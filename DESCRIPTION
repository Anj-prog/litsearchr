Title: Automated Search Term Selection and Search Strategy for Systematic Reviews
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Eliza Grames and Andrew Stillman
Maintainer: Eliza Grames <eliza.grames@uconn.edu>
Description: searchr automates the process of choosing search terms and writing search 
    strategies for systematic reviews. It determines which keywords are most important 
    in a field of research based on a naive search of scientific databases including
    Scopus, BIOSIS, Zoological Record, and ProQuest. After keywords are selected and 
    manually grouped into concept categories, searchr writes Boolean searches in up to 
    53 different languages with stemming support for English.
