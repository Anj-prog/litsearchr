Title: Automated Search Term Selection and Search Strategy for Systematic Reviews
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Eliza Grames, Andrew Stillman, Morgan Tingley, Chris Elphick

Description: Systematic review, meta-analysis, and other forms of evidence 
    synthesis require researchers to identify the body of evidence relevant 
    to their research question. Partially automating evidence synthesis 
    would reduce the amount of human time and effort needed to conduct 
    a systematic review and reduce bias in keyword selection when researchers 
    develop search strategies. This package facilitates quick, objective, 
    reproducible search strategy development using text-mining and 
    keyword co-occurrence networks to identify important terms to include 
    in a search strategy. It can automatically write Boolean search strings 
    in up to 53 different languages, with stemming support for English.
    It also automatically assembles and deduplicates search results from 
    a set of commonly used databases for systematic reviews. To assess the 
    quality of a search, it can also check the results of a search against 
    a set of known, relevant articles to get performance metrics.
