Version: 0.1.0

Description: litsearchr automates the process of choosing search terms and writing search 
    strategies for systematic reviews. It determines which keywords are most important 
    in a field of research based on a naive search of databases. After keywords are selected 
    and manually grouped into concept categories, litsearchr writes Boolean searches in up to 
    53 different languages with stemming support for English. It can also check the results 
    of a search strategy against known relevant articles to get search performance metrics.
