## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I made the following changes:
 - Every function has an executable example except for those requiring an API or that require internet access to scrape html.
 - I changed the default in all functions to not save output and the examples use tempdir().
 - I added in some new options for a couple of functions (e.g. deduplicate); I hope it was okay to make changes like that during the submission process.
 - I also deleted a few redundant or unnecessary functions to reduce the package size. 

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu 18.04.1 install, R 3.5.1
* win-builder (3.4.4, 3.5.1, r-devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs in any of the test environments.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
