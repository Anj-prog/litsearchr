## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I made the following changes:
 - Every function has an executable example except for those requiring an API or that require internet access to scrape html.
 - I changed the default in all functions to not save output and the examples use tempdir().
 - I added in some new options within a couple of functions (e.g. deduplicate); I hope it was okay to make changes like that during the submission process.
 - I also deleted a few redundant or unnecessary functions to reduce the package size.
