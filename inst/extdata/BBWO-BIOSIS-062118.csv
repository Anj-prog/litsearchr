Habitat loss and degradation, largely related to fire suppression, are believed to be the major causes of population declines, but these relationships are less studied at the northern range-extent. Hence, we investigated habitat selection of Bachman's Sparrow on Fort Bragg Military Installation, where vegetation is characterized by extensive fire-maintained Pinus palustris (Longleaf Pine) uplands. We surveyed breeding male sparrows using repeat-visit point-counts. We visited 182 points 3 times from April to July during the 2014 and 2015 breeding seasons. We measured vegetation and distance to other habitat features (e.g., wildlife openings, streams) at each point. We recorded presence or absence of Bachman's Sparrows and fit encounter histories into a single-season occupancy model in program Unmarked, including a year effect on detection. Occupancy probability was 0.52 and increased with greater grass-cover and at intermediate distances from wildlife openings, and decreased with years-since-fire and with greater shrub height. Predictors of Bachman's Sparrow occupancy were similar to those reported for other portions of the range, supporting the importance of frequent prescribed fire to maintain herbaceous groundcover used by birds for nesting and foraging. However, our study indicated that other habitat features (e.g., canopy openings) provided critical cover within extensive upland Longleaf Pine-Aristida stricta (Wiregrass) forest.","Fish, Alexander C.; North Carolina State Univ, Fisheries Wildlife and Conservat Biol Program, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",,,,2,2,,51,0,0,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",1528-7092,1938-5412,,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal","Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [Pinus palustris; longleaf pine]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [Aristida stricta; wiregrass]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Peucaea aestivalis; Bachman's sparrow]",,,,,,,,,"breeding season, habitat selection, canopy opening, habitat features, range limit, species occupancy, vegetation characteristics, occupancy probability",,,,2018/06/21

We address this issue by studying the neuromuscular origins of display behavior in a small tropical passerine bird, the golden-collared manakin (Manacus vitellinus). Males of this species court females by dancing around the forest floor and rapidly snapping their wings together above their back. Using radio-telemetry, we collected electromyographic (EMG) recordings from the three main muscles that control avian forelimb movement, and found how these different muscles are activated to generate various aspects of display behavior. The muscle that raises the wing (supracoracoideus, SC) and the primary muscle that retracts the wing (scapulohumeralis caudalis, SH) were activated during the wing-snap, whereas the pectoralis (PEC), the main wing depressor, was not. SC activation began before wing elevation commenced, with further activation occurring gradually. By contrast, SH activation was swift, starting soon after wing elevation and peaking shortly after the snap. The intensity of this SH activation was comparable to that which occurs during flapping, whereas the SC activation was much lower. Thus, light activation of the SC likely helps position the wings above the back, so that quick, robust SH activation can drive these appendages together to generate the firecracker-like snap sonation. This is one of the first looks at the neuromuscular mechanisms that underlie the actuation of a dynamic courtship display, and it demonstrates that even complex, whole-body display movements can be studied with transmitter-aided EMG techniques.","Fuxjager, Matthew J.; Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",,,,6,6,,51,0,0,,,"Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology",0022-0949,1477-9145,10.1242/jeb.167270,,"Nervous System (Neural Coordination); Muscular System (Movement and Support)","17504, Muscle - Physiology and biochemistry; 18004, Bones, joints, fasciae, connective and adipose tissue - Physiology and biochemistry; 20504, Nervous system - Physiology and biochemistry","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Manacus vitellinus; golden-collared manakin]",,,,,,,"electromyography; EMG; clinical techniques, diagnostic techniques/radio telemetry; applied and field techniques","wing/muscle; muscular system/forelimb/humerus; skeletal system","neuromuscular mechanism, wing display, firecracker-like snap sonation, whole-body display movements",,,,2018/06/21

Changes in land use and patterns of human settlement have altered fire regimes and led to fire suppression resulting in numerous undesirable consequences spanning individual species and entire ecosystems. Many obvious and direct consequences of fire suppression have been well studied, but several, albeit less obvious, costs of alteration to fire regimes on wildlife are unknown. One such phenomenon is the response of carnivores to fire events-something we refer to as pyric-carnivory. To investigate the prevalence of pyric-carnivory in raptors, we monitored 25 prescribed fires occurring during two different seasons and across two different locations in tallgrass prairie of the central United States. We used paired point counts occurring before and during prescribed fires to quantify the use of fires by raptors. We found a strong attraction to fires with average maximum abundance nearly seven times greater during fires than prior to ignitions (before: (x) over bar = 2.90, SE = 0.42; during: (x) over bar = 20.20; SE = 3.29) and an average difference between fire events and immediately before fires of 15.2 (+/- 2.69) raptors. This result was driven by Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsoni), which were the most abundant (n = 346) of the nine species we observed using fires. Our results illustrate the importance of fire as integral disturbance process that effects wildlife behavior through multiple mechanisms that are often overshadowed by the predominant view of fire as a tool used for vegetation management.","Hovick, Torre J.; North Dakota State Univ, Sch Nat Resource Sci, Range Program, Fargo, ND 58105 USA",,,,4,13,,47,0,2,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",2045-7758,2045-7758,10.1002/ece3.3401,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Biodiversity","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Falconiformes [85534]; [Buteo lineatus; red-shouldered hawk] [Accipiter striatus; sharp-shinned hawk] [Falco sparverius; American kestrel] [Buteo swainsoni; Swainson's hawk] [Ictinia mississippiensis; Mississippi kite] [Buteo platypterus; broad-winged hawk] [Buteo lagopus; rough-legged hawk] [Circus cyaneus; northern harrier]",,,,,"USA; North America; Nearctic region/Great Plains; North America; Nearctic region",,,,"terrestrial ecosystem, vegetation management, pyric-carnivory, species average maximum abundance, integral disturbance process, prescribed fires use",gold,,,2018/06/21

Retrofitting poles through increasing clearances (separation) between components, adding insulation to components, or adding redirection materials like perch discouragers reduces risk, but electrocutions may occur even on retrofitted poles. We evaluated 52 retrofitted poles where 56 birds, including 17 Golden Eagles, were electrocuted after retrofitting. We used burns on pole equipment and carcasses to identify precise pole-top locations where electrocutions occurred, and we identified three categories of retrofitting errors: product design, mitigation plan, and application. Product design errors (n = 9 poles, 6 Golden Eagles) occurred when products did not sufficiently cover energized equipment. Mitigation plan errors (n = 30 poles, 6 Golden Eagles) occurred when retrofitting plans did not include coverage of all energized components on a pole. Application errors (n = 13 poles, 5 Golden Eagles) occurred when the correct products were installed incorrectly. Retrofitting mistakes were identified in this study retroactively when avian electrocutions occurred on poles described as retrofitted. This is typical of how retrofitting mistakes are identified by the electric industry, which can lead to expensive duplicate efforts, and ongoing avian electrocutions. These can be avoided if retrofitting is done correctly initially. This study provides insight to electric utility personnel and wildlife managers interested in proactively evaluating the thoroughness of retrofitting, facilitating immediate identification and correction of retrofitting errors, increasing cost effectiveness, and reducing avian electrocution mortality.","Dwyer, James F.; EDM Int Inc, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA",,,,7,8,,31,1,1,,,"Behavioral Sciences",0892-1016,2162-4569,10.3356/JRR-16-93.1,,Behavior,"07002, Behavioral biology - General and comparative behavior; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Falconiformes [85534]; [Aquila chrysaetos; golden eagle]",,,,,,,,,"species migration, energized component, cost ellectiveness",,,,2018/06/21

Disturbance events often alter habitat, which in turn can modify behaviors of individuals in affected areas, including changes in habitat use and associated changes in social structure. To better understand these relationships, we investigated aspects of habitat selection and social connectivity of a small passerine bird, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus), before vs. after naturally occurring fire disturbance in Northern Territory, Australia. We utilized a social network framework to evaluate changes in social dynamics pre-vs. post-fire. Our study covered the non-breeding season in two consecutive years in which fires occurred, and individuals whose habitat was affected and those that were not affected by fire. Individuals in habitat affected by fires had stronger social ties (i.e. higher weighted degree) after fires, while those that were in areas that were not affected by fire actually had lower weighted degree. We suggest that this change in social connections may be linked to habitat. Before fires, fairywrens used habitat that had similar grass cover to available habitat plots randomly generated within our study site. Fire caused a reduction in grass cover, and fairywrens responded by selecting habitat with higher grass cover relative to random plots. This study demonstrates how changes in habitat and/or resource availability caused by disturbance can lead to substantive changes in the social environment that individuals experience.","Lantz, Samantha M.; Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol and Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",,,,4,6,,59,0,0,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",1932-6203,1932-6203,10.1371/journal.pone.0183144,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal","Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [grass]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Malurus melanocephalus; red-backed fairywren]",,,,,"Northern Territory; Australia; Australasian region",,,,"animal behavior, habitat selection, environmental disturbance, social dynamics, social connectivity",gold,,,2018/06/21

Its invasiveness can partly be explained by the high tannin content largely protecting the species from being browsed, its tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions, as well as its general preference for anthropogenically disturbed habitats. The dispersal of L. camara is facilitated by birds and other animals consuming its drupes (endozoochory), and so both wild and domestic ungulates could contribute to its spread. In our study, we investigated the distribution of L. camara in the Mutara rangelands of north-eastern Rwanda, an area that faced dramatic landscape changes in recent decades. We assessed 23 ecological factors and factors related to land-use and conservation-political history. Major effects on the local abundance of L. camara were found in that the relative canopy cover of L. camara was negatively correlated with the occurrence of other shrubs (suggesting competition for space and nutrients), while encounter rates of houses, 'living fences' (Euphorbia tirucalli L.) and cattle tracks were positively correlated with L. camara cover. Hence, the spread of non-native L. camara in the Mutara rangelands appears to be linked to landscape alterations arising from the transformation of rangelands supporting traditional pastoralist communities to other agricultural land-use forms.","Wronski, Torsten; NW A and F Univ, Coll Anim Sci and Technol, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China",,,,1,4,,94,1,1,,,Agriculture,2223-7747,2223-7747,10.3390/plants6020019,,Agriculture,"52502, Agronomy - Miscellaneous and mixed crops","Artiodactyla, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Artiodactyls, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Bovidae [85715]; [cattle]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [Cymbopogon]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Leguminosae [26260]; [Dichrostachys]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Mammalia [85700]; [livestock]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Verbenaceae [26930]; [Lantana camara]",,tannin,,,"Rwanda; Africa; Ethiopian region",,,,"grazing, environmental condition, community structure, pastoralism, local abundance, charcoal burning, distribution impact, agriculturalism, land-use form",gold,,,2018/06/21

Our results indicated that mixed-severity fires that burned at predominantly low-severity had little effect on survival and recruitment while fires characterized by more medium to high burn severities negatively affected spotted owl survival, with varying effects on recruitment. Reduced survival and increased recruitment rates on some territories affected by medium to high severity fires suggested that post-fire habitat quality was reduced resulting in territories that were marginally capable of supporting owls.

We report on a 20-year mark-recapture investigation (1991-2010) of the distribution and density of breeders, temporal and spatial variability in breeding, nestling sex ratios, local versus immigrant recruitment of breeders, breeding age structure, age-specific survival rates, and rate of population change () of this species on the Kaibab Plateau, a forested sky island in northern Arizona, USA. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of annual fluctuations in precipitation on the annual frequency of goshawk breeding and fledgling production. We studied 125 goshawk breeding territories, representing approximately 87% of an estimated 144 total territories based on a mean distance of 3.8km between territory centers in a 1,728-km(2) study area. The salient demographic feature of the population was extensive annual variation in breeding, which manifested as large inter-annual variation in proportions of pairs laying eggs, brood sizes, nest failure rates, and fledgling production. The percent of territories known in a prior year in which eggs were laid in a current year ranged from 8% to 86% (x=37%, SE=4.51), annual mean nest failure rate (active nests that failed) ranged from 12% to 48% (overall x=23%, SE=2.48), and mean annual brood size of successful nests (fledged 1 fledgling) ranged from 1.5 young to 2.5 young (overall x=2.0 young, SE=0.03). Inter-annual variation in reproduction closely tracked inter-annual variation in precipitation, which we hypothesize influenced primary forest productivity and bird and mammal prey abundance. The best breeding years (1992-1993, 77-87% of pairs laid eggs) were coincident with a record-long El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) wet period and the worst breeding year (2003; 8% of pairs laid eggs) was the last of a 3-year record drought. Overall breeding success was 83% with most failures occurring during incubation; once eggs hatched, goshawks tended to fledge young. The pooled 20-year nestling sex ratio did not differ from unity (53% M; n=410M, 366F) but was significantly male-biased in 2 years and female-biased in 1 year. Nonetheless, the overall greater production of male fledglings followed a strong trend of greater male production in other goshawk populations, suggesting that breeders might have been adaptively adjusting their offspring sex ratio, perhaps to produce more of the rarer (male) sex. Annual recruitment of new individuals into the breeding population averaged 43% during the study. Study area recruitment rate of hawks locally born (in situ) and banded was 0.12. Both sexes had equal tendencies to return to the Kaibab Plateau to breed (no differences in philopatry) and there were no differences in natal dispersal distances (natal to first breeding site) between the sexes. During the final years of study (1999-2010), an estimated 46% of breeding recruits were locally born and 54% were immigrants from distant forests. Minimum age at first breeding was 2 years and mean age at first breeding by known-age hawks (banded as nestlings or aged on plumage at first breeding) was 3.7 years for males and 3.5 years for females. Mean lifespan (yr from first banding as nestling to last resighting) of known-age goshawks was 6.9 years for both sexes.Mean minimum apparent lifespan of breeders aged 4 years based on plumage at first capture was 6.5 years for both sexes. Average age of goshawks at their first detection was 3.9 years old, at which time apparent survival was estimated at 0.77 for both sexes, which was just slightly less than the peak survival of 0.78 as a function of age. Age-specific survival estimates showed a steady decline after 9 years old and approached 0 at 20 years of age. Estimates of for breeding adults (M, 0.94, SE=0.037; F, 0.98, SE=0.038) provided only weak evidence for a population decline during the study. Although sex was not in the top survival model, models including age+sex were competitive, evidencing lower male than female survival, a finding corroborated by the occurrence of sex effects in the top model. Lower male survival may result from higher mortality associated with hunting agile prey in vegetation-filled environments during long breeding seasons when they are the primary forager. Lower survival may be compensated by the more frequent production (53%) of male fledglings. High-severity crown fire was an existential threat to the population. In addition to 4 large high-severity fires that burned roughly 3,770ha (equal to 3 goshawk territories) in the 30 years preceding 1991, 6 high-severity fires burned another 30,945ha during our study and killed most (>64%) of the forests in 8 known territories and possibly another 2 that were burned before we completed surveys. Based on a lack of any recent demographic perturbations in age structure, a relatively high and time-constant annual adult survival rate, confidence intervals around adult estimates overlapping 1.0, and a study area saturated with territories, we surmise that the goshawk population on the Kaibab Plateau was stable during the 20-year study. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains regarding the population's future status because of a declining trend in breeding frequency, uncertain status (dead, alive, emigrated) of non-breeding adults, extensive temporal and spatial variation in breeding, and high frequency of immigrant recruits to the breeding population on the Kaibab Plateau. If the century-long decline in precipitation persists, especially at the increased rate seen since 1980, and manifests as deeper droughts, diminished wet periods, and weaker pulses in forest productivity, then the Kaibab Plateau goshawk population would be expected to show unambiguous evidence of decline. Evidence would include reduced local and regional goshawk reproduction and survival, reduced frequency of immigration, and further habitat loss to catastrophic fire.

This ended with the introduction of mammalian herbivores by European settlers in the 19th century. For at least 40yr researchers have speculated about how New Zealand's vegetation communities might have responded to the herbivore gap'. Did plant taxa once consumed by moa flourish in forest understoreys without large herbivores to browse them? Did forest understoreys become denser, preventing regeneration of long-lived conifers and altering forest composition? Such questions remain to be tested using palaeoecological records.LocationThree locations on South Island, New Zealand (from <20 to 750m a.s.l) where forest has not been burned since human settlement, and where there has been no obvious geological or climatic disturbance events over the past 1000yr that have influenced vegetation dynamics.MethodsWe identified and quantified pollen grains and fern spores from soil/peat cores taken beneath, or adjacent to, tall forest canopies. Soil/peat samples from the cores were radiocarbon dated and Bayesian age-depth models were constructed for each core, from which depths corresponding to the herbivore gap period were identified. Changes in pollen/spore abundances occurring within the herbivore gap were identified and critically examined for consistency between cores and likelihood of being caused by loss of browsing pressure from large herbivores (through comparison with plant taxa known to have been consumed by moa).ResultsGround fern spores and Coprosma pollen exhibited increases in relative abundance at all three sites during the herbivore gap. Both occur frequently in moa coprolites and gizzard content, and so can be interpreted as possible responses to moa extinction. However, other changes in pollen assemblages at this time were inconsistent between sites, or could be better explained as being related to anthropogenic burning in the local region.ConclusionsNew Zealand forest plant communities appear to have experienced only relatively minor changes during the herbivore gap. Our results contradict long-standing hypotheses that shrubs and ferns had flourished in New Zealand forest understoreys at this time, preventing podocarp regeneration. However, due to the relatively recent extinction of moa, and long life span of many forest trees, there may be an extinction debt where the long-term consequences of moa extinction are still to be fully realized.","Wood, Jamie R.; Landcare Res, Long Term Ecol Lab, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand",,"Wilmshurst, Janet/C-2209-2009","Wilmshurst, Janet/0000-0002-4474-8569",4,15,,67,1,2,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Paleontology",1100-9233,1654-1103,10.1111/jvs.12469,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Paleobiology","05500, Social biology and human ecology; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 16504, Reproductive system - Physiology and biochemistry; 50526, Botany: general and systematic - Dicotyledones; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 51512, Plant physiology - Reproduction; 62518, Chordata: general and systematic - Aves; 62520, Chordata: general and systematic - Mammalia; 62800, Animal distribution; 64500, Paleobiology","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [Aves]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Rubiaceae [26680]; [Coprosma]",,,,,"New Zealand; Australasian region",,"Bayesian analysis; mathematical and computer techniques/radiocarbon dating; applied and field techniques","pollen grain; reproductive system","terrestrial ecosystem, climatic change, palaeoecology",gold_or_bronze,,,2018/06/21

This reclamation can provide a novel opportunity to conserve northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We evaluated the influence of habitat management activities on nest survival, nest-site selection, and brood resource selection on managed and unmanaged units of a reclaimed surface mine, Peabody Wildlife Management Area (Peabody), in west-central Kentucky, USA, from 2010 to 2013. We compared resource selection, using discrete-choice analysis, and nest survival, using the nest survival model in Program MARK, between managed and unmanaged units of Peabody at 2 spatial scales: the composition and configuration of vegetation types (i.e., macrohabitat) and vegetation characteristics at nest sites and brood locations (i.e., microhabitat). On managed sites, we also investigated resource selection relative to a number of different treatments (e.g., herbicide, disking, prescribed fire). We found no evidence that nest-site selection was influenced by macrohabitat variables, but bobwhite selected nest sites in areas with greater litter depth than was available at random sites. On managed units, bobwhite were more likely to nest where herbicide was applied to reduce sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) compared with areas untreated with herbicide. Daily nest survival was not influenced by habitat characteristics or by habitat management but was influenced by nest age and the interaction of nest initiation date and nest age. Daily nest survival was greater for older nests occurring early in the breeding season (0.99, SE<0.01) but was lower for older nests occurring later in the season (0.08, SE=0.13). Brood resource selection was not influenced by macrohabitat or microhabitat variables we measured, but broods on managed units selected areas treated with herbicide to control sericea lespedeza and were located closer to firebreaks and disked native-warm season grass stands than would be expected at random. Our results suggest the vegetation at Peabody was sufficient without manipulation to support nesting and brood-rearing northern bobwhite at a low level, but habitat management practices improved vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing resource selection. Reproductive rates (e.g., nest survival and re-nesting rates) at Peabody were lower than reported in other studies, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies caused by the abundance of sericea lespedeza. On reclaimed mine lands dominated by sericea lespedeza, we suggest continuing practices such as disking and herbicide application that are targeted at reducing sericea lespedeza to improve the vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing bobwhite.

Here, we use the functional trait structure of Amazonian forest bird assemblages to explore the impacts of land-cover change on two ecosystem processes: seed dispersal and insect predation. We show that trait structure in assemblages of frugivorous and insectivorous birds remained stable after primary forests were subjected to logging and fire events, but that further intensification of human land use substantially reduced the functional diversity and dispersion of traits, and resulted in communities that occupied a different region of trait space. These effects were only partially reversed in regenerating secondary forests. Our findings suggest that local extinctions caused by the loss and degradation of tropical forest are non-random with respect to functional traits, thus disrupting the network of trophic interactions regulating seed dispersal by forest birds and herbivory by insects, with important implications for the structure and resilience of human-modified tropical forests. Furthermore, our results illustrate how quantitative functional traits for specific guilds can provide a range of metrics for estimating the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem processes, and the response of such processes to land-cover change.","Bregman, Tom P.; Tobias, Joseph A.; Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, UK",,"Barlow, Jos/E-7861-2014; Aleixo, Alexandre/L-3135-2013","Aleixo, Alexandre/0000-0002-7816-9725; Lees, Alexander/0000-0001-7603-9081",11,86,,69,5,6,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry; Anthropology",0962-8452,1471-2954,10.1098/rspb.2016.1289,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Forestry; Human Ecology (Anthropology)","05500, Social biology and human ecology; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 53500, Forestry and forest products","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human]",,,,,"Amazon; South America; Neotropical region",,,,"land-cover change, seed dispersal, tropical forest, ecosystem process, insect predation, forest species assemblage, avian functional traits, quantitative functional traits",green_published,,,2018/06/21

We quantified the effects of military training on vertebrates in a 5-year study at Beecroft Weapons Range in south-eastern Australia by contrasting the occurrence of birds, mammals and reptiles between 24 sites within an area subject to repeated weapons use and a matched set of non-impacted sites. Species richness of mammals and reptiles was similar within versus outside the impact area, although many-individual species responded to fire, which occurred more frequently in impacted sites. Bird species richness, the occurrence of larger-bodied and migratory bird species, and the occurrence of most individual bird species, was reduced within the impact area. Many bird species that displayed low prevalence in impacted sites also declined over time across the whole study area. Differences in biota between the impact and non-impact areas were detectable after controlling for the effects of recent fire, suggesting that weapons use impacted vertebrates through mechanisms additional to altered fire regimes.Overall, our data indicated that Beecroft Weapons Range maintained considerable biodiversity value despite prolonged military use. Hence, MTAs have the potential to make a substantial contribution to conservation outside the formal protected area network. However, managers of MTAs need to explicitly state their environmental objectives. This is because management practices may be different if the aim is to maximize species richness rather than to secure populations of particular species.

Endogenous factors are directly related to density-dependent forces, whereas exogenous factors are environmental drivers (e.g. climate). Several studies have reported the effects of endogenous and exogenous factors using exponential population models in mammals, birds or insects, but few works have explored the effects on reptiles, specifically in tortoises. In this study, we developed logistic population growth models to decipher the role of these factors on the population dynamics of the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca. The role of environmental drivers in the distribution, movement, survival, reproduction or individual growth has been described for this species in previous works, but no studies have examined the effects of both endogenous and exogenous factors in population growth rates. Using long-term data of T. graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula (1999-2013), we fitted non-linear logistic models with endogenous and exogenous effects. The results showed that endogenous processes are important drivers of the population dynamics of this species, and that exogenous factors, such as freezing hours in winter, also directly affect the population growth rate. Intolerance of extreme winter temperatures may especially affect hatchlings and juvenile tortoises. Our models also showed that perturbations (i.e. a fire occurred during the monitoring period) have a lasting impact by reducing the carrying capacity of the population. This study shows that simple quantitative approaches based on population dynamic theory are useful for deciphering the ecological mechanisms underlying dynamics of tortoise populations.","Rodriguez-Caro, R.

In this model, HVC is organized into FSUs, each of which provides the basis for the production of one syllable in vocalization. Within each FSU, the inhibitory neuron population takes one of two operational states: 1) simultaneous firing wherein all inhibitory neurons fire simultaneously, and 2) competitive firing of the inhibitory neurons. Switching between these basic modes of activity is accomplished via changes in the synaptic strengths among the inhibitory neurons. The inhibitory neurons connect to excitatory projection neurons such that during state 1 the activity of projection neurons is suppressed, while during state 2 patterns of sequential firing of projection neurons can occur. The latter state is stabilized by feedback from the projection to the inhibitory neurons. Song composition for specific species is distinguished by the manner in which different FSUs are functionally connected to each other. Ours is a computational model built with biophysically based neurons. We illustrate that many observations of HVC activity are explained by the dynamics of the proposed population of FSUs, and we identify aspects of the model that are currently testable experimentally.

Its impacts on fauna can be both direct (e.g., mortality) and indirect (e.g., altered habitat), resulting in population recovery being driven by several possible mechanisms. Separating direct from indirect impacts of fire on faunal population recovery can be valuable in guiding management of biodiversity in fire-prone environments. However, resolving the influence of direct and indirect processes remains a key challenge because many processes affecting fauna can change concomitantly with time since fire. We explore the mechanisms influencing bird response to fire by posing the question, can temporal changes in vegetation structure predict changes in bird occurrence on sites, and can these be separated from other temporal changes using the surrogate of time since fire? We conducted a 12-yr study of bird and vegetation responses to fire at 124 sites across six vegetation classes in Booderee National Park, Australia. Approximately half of these sites, established in 2002, were burned by a large (>3000 ha) wildfire in 2003. To disentangle collinear effects of temporal changes in vegetation and direct demographic effects on population recovery that are subsumed by time since fire, we incorporated both longitudinal and cross-sectional vegetation effects in addition to time since fire within logistic structural equation models. We identified temporal changes in vegetation structure and richness of plant and bird species that characterized burned and unburned sites in all vegetation classes. For nine bird species, a significant component of the year trend was driven by temporal trends in one of three vegetation variables (number of understory or midstory plant species, or midstory cover). By contrast, we could not separate temporal effects between time since fire and vegetation attributes for bird species richness, reporting rate, and the occurrence of 11 other bird species. Our findings help identify species for which indirect effects of vegetation dominate recovery and thus may benefit from vegetation management where conservation actions are required and, conversely, those species for which direct effects of time since fire drive recovery, where simply leaving a system to recover following the last disturbance will be sufficient.","Lindenmayer, David B.; Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm and Soc, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",,"Lindenmayer, David/P-7183-2017; Ikin, Karen/G-2845-2012; Tulloch, Ayesha/E-4408-2012","Lindenmayer, David/0000-0002-4766-4088; Tulloch, Ayesha/0000-0002-5866-1923; /0000-0003-2415-0057; Westgate, Martin/0000-0003-0854-2034",5,22,,58,3,6,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",1051-0761,1939-5582,10.1002/eap.1367,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Biodiversity; Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird]/Plantae; Plants; Plantae [11000]; [plant]",,,,,"Booderee National Park; Australia; Australasian region",,,,"species richness, vegetation structure, species conservation, fire status",,,,2018/06/21

A 3-point scale (0, 1 or 2) was used to classify dirty feathers, footpad dermatitis and hock burns measures, and a 2-point scale (present or absent) was used to classify breast burns, breast blisters and breast ulcer measures. Flocks were allocated into three body weight (BW) classes (A, B, C): class A (light) >= 1.43 and <= 1.68 kg, class B (medium) >= 69 and <= 1.93 kg; class C (heavy) >= 1.94 and <= 2.41 kg. The absence of hock burns was more common in class A, while mild hock burns was more common in class B flocks. Breast ulcer was observed in class C flocks. The association observed for mild hock burns, breast burns and severe footpad dermatitis can indicate a simultaneous occurrence of these painful lesions. Very dirty feathers and severe footpad dermatitis relationship suggest litter humidity to be the common underlying cause. In conclusion, it was shown that clinical indicators can be used at the slaughterhouse to identify welfare problems. In the studied flocks, footpad dermatitis, feather conditions and hock burns were the main restrictions for good welfare and should be considered significant welfare indicators of the on-farm rearing conditions.

A total of 3,600 one-day-old male chicks were randomly assigned to one of 4 dietary treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement (9 replicates of 100 birds/dietary treatment). Birds were slaughtered at 31 (thinning) and 51 d of age. Body weight, daily weight gain (DWG), feed intake, feed conversion rate (FCR), and mortality were determined. A significant effect of the source of TM supplementation was found only in 51-day-old chickens. Birds of the OTM groups were heavier (P < 0.05), with a higher (P < 0.05) DWG and a better FCR (P < 0.05) compared with those of the ITM groups. OTM significantly reduced the lesion scores of femoral head (P = 0.004) and total leg (femur + tibia, P = 0.02) compared to ITM, which is mainly caused by the reduction of the percentages of femoral head transitional degeneration (FHT, P = 0.04) and femoral head necrosis (FHN, P = 0.07). Carcass traits were similar among the experimental groups. No alleviating effect of TM administration on the incidence of FPD and HB in 31- and 51-day-old chickens was found.

In particular, these grasslands serve as biodiversity repositories for a myriad of imperilled animal species. One such group is grassland birds, which have experienced significant declines, predominantly caused by extensive loss and degradation of native grasslands. Rangeland management that promotes increasing and sustaining livestock production through reducing the inherent, disturbance-driven variability that historically occurred in grasslands is considered a major contributing factor to these declines. An alternative approach to this homogeneous management paradigm attempts to restore a shifting mosaic of disturbance patches across the landscape through the spatial and temporal interactions of fire and grazing (i.e. pyric herbivory). Application of pyric herbivory through patch-burn grazing increases overall habitat heterogeneity, likely a critically important factor in maintaining and enhancing grassland bird populations. We compared reproductive rates and estimates of fecundity of three grassland birds nesting in grasslands maintained by traditional and patch-burn grazing management paradigms in the Southern Great Plains of North America. Additionally, we used a sensitivity analysis approach to assess population stability (i.e. =1) and source-sink population dynamics under the two management practices. Nest survival for dickcissels Spiza americana and grasshopper sparrows Ammodramus savannarum was higher in patch-burned grasslands than in traditionally managed grasslands, while nest survival for eastern meadowlarks Sturnella magna was higher in traditionally managed grasslands than in patch-burned grasslands. Dickcissels and grasshopper sparrows responded positively to patch burning with source habitats occurring over a wider range of survival rates under patch burning than traditional management, while no clear pattern emerged in source-sink dynamics of eastern meadowlarks.Synthesis and applications. Management strategies such as patch-burn grazing offer opportunities to restore landscape heterogeneity to benefit bird communities while maintaining livestock production goals. Applying patch-burn grazing to rangelands can increase productivity of grassland birds and could be effective for reversing the decline of grassland birds by providing source habitats more consistently than traditional rangeland management. Our results emphasize the utility of using sensitivity analyses to determine source-sink population dynamics when evaluating management practices. However, land managers should consider that source-sink models have shortcomings and designation of a habitat as a sink does not necessarily mean the habitat has low conservation value.","Davis, Craig A.; Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol and Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",,,,8,48,,47,3,3,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation",0021-8901,1365-2664,10.1111/1365-2664.12641,,"Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Ammodramus savannarum; grasshopper sparrow; (immature; protected species)]",,,,,"Great Plains; North America; Nearctic region",,,,"population dynamics, grazing, habitat heterogeneity, fecundity, wildfire, species survival, population stability, reproductive rates, pyric herbivory",,,,2018/06/21

The exclusion of other invasive mammals is now being undertaken with more sophisticated control techniques and fences. New fence designs are capable of excluding all mammals from areas to protect endangered native birds. Although the eradication of mammals from large areas has resulted in the restoration of some ecosystem processes such as natural forest regeneration, changes in other processes such as fire regimes, nutrient cycling, and invasive plant proliferation remain more difficult to reverse at larger landscape scales.","Hess, Steven C.; US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, POB 44,Natl Pk, Hawaii, HI 96718 USA",,,"Hess, Steven/0000-0001-6403-9922",12,62,,138,4,4,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation",1343-4152,1348-6160,,,"Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Artiodactyla, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Artiodactyls, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Bovidae [85715]; [Capra hircus] [Ovis aries] [Ovis musimon]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Gruiformes [85540]; [Porzana palmeri]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Leguminosae [26260]; [Sophora chrysophylla] [Canavalia kauensis]/Lagomorpha, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Lagomorphs, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Leporidae [86040]; [Oryctolagus cuniculus; European rabbit]/Rodentia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Muridae [86375]; [Mus musculus; mouse]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Himatione sanguinea] [Acrocephalus familiaris] [Loxioides bailleui]/Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Rodentia [86265]; [Rodentia]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Urticaceae [26920]; [Urticaceae]",,,,,"New Zealand; Australasian region/Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean",,,,"ecological integrity, nutrient cycling, forest regeneration, ecosystem process, plant proliferation",,,,2018/06/21

To better understand how forest management practices, weather, and indices of nest predator abundance influence nest predation, we set artificial ground nests at 100 sites for 2 weeks each summer from 2002 to 2013 in a longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem. We modeled effects of prescribed fire, hardwood removal, rainfall, temperature, indices of mammalian and avian nest predator abundance, and proximity to wildlife food plots and agriculture, edges, and roads on nest predation. Annual nest predation rates ranged from 30% to 74% and averaged 53%. Occurrence of prescribed fire at a nest site <2 months prior to nest placement had a strong, positive association with nest predation but prescribed fires carried out >2 months prior to nest placement had little effect. Hardwood removal was also associated with increased rates of nest predation, but this effect appeared most prevalent 4-9 years following removals. Nest predation rates also increased when food plots or agricultural fields were within 50 m of nest sites. Higher temperatures were associated with greater rates of predation, but rainfall did not have a significant influence. There was a general lack of support for effects of predator indices on nest predation rates, except for a weak, negative association with raccoon relative abundance. This study shows the wide range of factors which may influence nest predation and importance of viewing effects of forest management practices on nest predation over the long term.

These are important not only intrinsically, but also for ecological functioning and as flagships for South Africa's economically valuable avitourism sector. Little is known about population sizes or realised distribution ranges of these six species, but projected range modelling based on occurrence from the South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP) has suggested these species are vulnerable to climate change. We estimate global population sizes for these six endemics based on densities calculated from two intensive biome-wide point count surveys in 2012. We modelled regions of suitable climatic space, from which we established that mean annual temperature and the temperature of the warmest quarter of the year appear to limit Cape Rock-jumper Chaetops frenatus and Protea Canary Serinus leucopterus ranges. Both species have seen an apparent > 30% decrease in range and reporting rates (a proxy for abundance) in the twenty years between SABAP atlas periods (1987-1991 and 2007-ongoing). The Cape Rock-jumper result is unexpected: encounter rates are higher in shorter vegetation, dry slopes and habitats with more recent occurrence of fire - all proxies for proximate causes of climate change on the Fynbos. Although coastal plains are highly transformed, mountain Fynbos is the best protected of all the world's Mediterranean-climate habitats, with relatively little anthropogenic land transformation. Long term weather datasets from the Fynbos demonstrate significant warming since 1960. We conclude from these lines of evidence that these decreases are consistent with the loss of suitable climate space and inability of these species to adjust physiologically to increasing temperatures.","Lee, Alan T.

Our goal was to identify the degree of ecological specialization in order to inform activities directed at conserving a diversity of species (e.g. specialists and generalists) within the western boreal bird community. We used avian data (>5,220 point counts) and environmental variable data comprised of forest composition, stand, and landscape pattern metrics at local (7.1 ha), landscape (1,963 ha), and regional (11,310 ha) scales to determine boreal bird distribution and community-level associations using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Outlying Mean Index (OMl) analysis. OMI analysis explained a high proportion of variance in the ""dataset (71.8%) and separated boreal birds along two axes associated with moisture-productivity and age-structural complexity gradients. Niche position was influenced by local scale variables (height, age, area of mature-old forest, area of wet soil types), but also landscape and regional scale variables (total area of hardwood and conifer, mean nearest neighbour distance of conifer, and total core area of productive upland conifer). Only 15 of 67 species (22%) had marginal (atypical) niches and narrow niche breadths exhibiting specialization in old hardwood and white spruce forests and burned, open, and lowland habitats. Most species occupied typical or common habitats within the study area and exhibited generalist strategies typical of species in heterogeneous and disturbed habitats that undergo frequent change.

Not only does this strategy depart from dormant season to growing season prescriptions, but the strategy also moves from stand-scale to landscape-scale implementation (>1,000 ha). This being so, agencies are making considerable commitments in terms of time and resources to this management strategy, but the effects on wildlife in upland forests, especially those dominated by hardwood canopy species, are relatively unknown. We initiated our study to assess whether this management strategy affects eastern wild turkey reproductive ecology on the Ozark-St. Francis National Forest. We marked 67 wild turkey hens with Global Positioning System (GPS) Platform Transmitting Terminals in 2012 and 2013 to document exposure to prescribed fire, and estimate daily nest survival, nest success, and nest-site selection. We estimated these reproductive parameters in forest units managed with prescribed fire (treated) and units absent of prescribed fire (untreated). Of 60 initial nest attempts monitored, none were destroyed or exposed to prescribed fire because a majority of fires occurred early than a majority of the nesting activity. We found nest success was greater in untreated units than treated units (36.4% versus 14.6%). We did not find any habitat characteristic differences between successful and unsuccessful nest-sites. We found that nest-site selection criteria differed between treated and untreated units. Visual concealment and woody ground cover were common selection criteria in both treated and untreated units. However, in treated units wild turkey selected nest-sites with fewer small shrubs (<5 cm ground diameter) and large trees (>20 cm DBH) but not in untreated units.

The Firecrest, a local rarity in the 19(th) century, has become one of the common birds of southern Germany in the course of the 20(th) century, so that in many areas its numbers are now greater than those of Goldcrest. Although it has been assumed that the explanation for this is probably connected to the increase in conifers and climate change in Central Europe, the most important point has been overlooked, since German Goldcrests spend five to six months in the Mediterranean Region: The situation in the geographical region of the Alps can be taken as a reference point to examine these developments in Central Europe, since there spruce and fir trees accounted for a high proportion of the woodlands even in the 18(th) and19(th) century. In southern Germany and the Austrian Alps between 1820 and 1920 the Firecrest was described as rare and localized, and was even unknown until the end of the 19(th) century in most places since it didn't occur at all. Since then it has undergone a steady increase, so that today it is among the common bird species in Germany and the whole region of the Alps. In the South German study area dealt with here, the Goldcrest was still the more common of the two until around 1970, but currently the Firecrest is at least 1.5 times more abundant than the Goldcrest. Its present abundance in western Central Europe, from near the alpine tree line to sea level, can be explained neither by climatic causes nor by the planting of coniferous trees. The earlier minimal forest cover in the winter quarters of the Firecrest between the Iberian Peninsula and Italy prevented the species from spreading and increasing its numbers in Central Europe. It was the retreat of pastureland and arable farming, favoring succession and reforestation, that led to a change in the historic avifauna to the benefit of woodland species, among them many migrant species from northern and Central Europe such as the Blackcap. Therefore, the cause of the increasing commonness of Firecrest as opposed to Goldcrest, and of the expansion of its distributional range in Central Europe, is the enormous increase in the area covered by forest in its winter quarters in the European part of the Mediterranean Region. There, the increase in woody cover and forest in the past 100 years, as shown in new maps and other evidence, could be as high as a factor of 50. Without that, the expansion of the Firecrest and its current high abundance in Central Europe would be unthinkable, even if the effects of climate change would also be positive. It also illustrates how careless treatments of historical data can impair research and antedate the development of the status of the Firecrest by a hundred years. The responsibility of Germany, which today harbors 40 % of the world population of Firecrest, becomes a shared responsibility with the Mediterranean countries where the species overwinters.","Gatter, Wulf; Hans Thoma Weg 31, D-73230 Kirchheim Unter Teck, Germany",,,,0,0,,39,1,1,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",0042-7993,,,,"Population Studies; Climatology (Environmental Sciences)","07504, Ecology: environmental biology - Bioclimatology and biometeorology; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 37001, Public health - General and miscellaneous","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Regulus ignicapillus; firecrest]",,,,,"Germany; Europe; Palearctic region",,"reforestation; applied and field techniques",,"climate change, geographical region, population development, Mediterranean woodland",,,,2018/06/21

Severe storms in 1967, and especially in 1990 and 1999, provided the opportunity for a long-term study of the adaptation of this species to such events. The dynamics of unhindered succession caused by infestations of bark beetles (Scolytidae) allowed unexpected insights into the settlement strategy, diet phenology, and nesting and breeding behaviour of the flycatcher. The rise in numbers and/or settlement activity of Spotted Flycatcher triggered by the increase in the beetle population enabled us to study trophic processes in stocks of woodland, insects, and birds.In the absence of human influence, the scenario of these processes, where bark beetles from wind-thrown timber spread to and killed neighboring stands, could be followed for up to 16 years. High flycatcher population densities, as well as a band-like distribution that moved with the advancing infestation front, were found. The bark beetles supplied not only a surplus of food, but also of nest sites (thousands of 'bark-pockets, i.e. fragments caught in branch whorls by the Scolytidae beetles loosening the bark in spruce forests), a situation unknown in conventionally managed forests but probably normal in pristine forests. There were over a hundred dying trees standing in every flycatcher territory with a large number of such nesting possibilities, too many for predators to deal with. So we were able to observe the development by Spotted Flycatchers of flexible settlement and reproduction strategies.Territory occupation mostly in June could be interpreted as late arrival of the flycatchers from Africa or as an adaptation to bark beetle phenology. A third strategy could be that breeding outside the early part of the season, when predators are occupying their territories, allows the flycatchers to exploit the situation by breeding when the spatial and temporal pressures of competition and predation are already declining.The strong differences in biology between the Spotted Flycatcher and two Ficedula species (Pied and Collared Flycatcher) could indicate that the evolution of the species as a niche-nester has been shaped by the frequency of (large-scale) catastrophes occurring in unmanaged forest, especially since its wing morphology gives the species a high degree of mobility.The possibility of a 'pheno- or ecotype' Forest Spotted Flycatcher, adapted via mobility to the spatially and temporally unpredictable catastrophes of pristine forest is discussed and contrasted with urban Spotted Flycatchers.","Gatter, Wulf; Hans Thoma Weg 31, D-73230 Kirchheim Unter Teck, Germany",,,,0,0,,40,0,0,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology",0042-7993,,,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Evolution and Adaptation","01500, Evolution; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 62800, Animal distribution; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Coleoptera [75304]; [bark beetle] [Scolytidae]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Muscicapa striata; spotted flycatcher] [Ficedula]",,,,,"Baden-Wurttemberg; Germany, Europe; Palearctic region",,,,"species evolution, forest management, population density, predation, species distribution, nesting behavior, forest fire, breeding behavior, human influence, species reproduction strategy, natural disaster-related adaptation, species succession dynamics, diet phenology, species competition-based pressure",,,,2018/06/21

These two shrubs occur in tropical and subtropical dry forests, including forests that have been subjected to recent disturbance. Despite their importance to the endangered warbler, the disturbance ecology of these shrubs is poorly understood. We sought to determine, based on functional characteristics of the plants, whether their presence is favored by a particular type or regime of disturbance.We used data from field experiments (seed broadcasting and shrub cutting) conducted on the island of Eleuthera, The Bahamas to determine mechanisms of and conditions favoring establishment and persistence ('vital attributes') of E. fruticosa and L. involucrata, which enabled categorization according to the plant functional types defined by Noble and Slatyer (1980). We then compared hypothesized distributions of these plant functional types among different anthropogenic disturbance regimes to observed distributions of E. fruticosa and L. involucrata in order to identify disturbance regimes most likely to produce habitat used by Kirtland's Warblers.E. fruticosa and L. involucrata were functionally categorized as widely dispersed but largely shade intolerant species capable of establishing or regenerating individuals after disturbance via both seeds and vegetative mechanisms. Both hypothesized and observed distribution patterns indicated the shrubs were favored by a regime of frequent disturbance producing open canopy and ground layers. Among the anthropogenic disturbances we examined, areas of large-scale land clearing combined with subsequent goat grazing most often supported E. fruticosa and L. involucrata, while the shrubs were relatively rare in burned areas. Utilizing the plant functional type framework in combination with field data to evaluate predictions of species occurrence among different disturbances regimes provides a strong theoretical basis for conservation strategies. Understanding which disturbance types favor a habitat of concern and the mechanisms by which they do so can aid the prioritization of areas for protection or the design of habitat management protocols.","Fleming, Genie M.; Puerto Rican Conservat Fdn, POB 362495, San Juan, PR 00936 USA",,,,0,11,,50,1,1,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Anthropology; Biodiversity & Conservation",1752-9921,1752-993X,10.1093/jpe/rtu036,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Human Ecology (Anthropology); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 05500, Social biology and human ecology; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 25000, Pediatrics; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation; 62800, Animal distribution","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Burseraceae [25695]; [Bursera simaruba]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Leguminosae [26260]; [Acacia choriophylla]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Setophaga kirtlandii; Kirtland's warbler; (protected species)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Polygonaceae [26605]; [Coccoloba diversifolia]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Rubiaceae [26680]; [Erithalis fruticosa; (immature, seedling, seed)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Verbenaceae [26930]; [Lantana involucrata; (immature, seedling, seed)]",,,,,"Bahamas; West Indies; Neotropical region/Eleuthera Island; West Indies; Neotropical region",,"seed broadcasting field experiment; applied and field techniques/shrub cutting field experiment; applied and field techniques",,"species distribution, anthropogenic disturbance, species management, species functional attribute",gold_or_bronze,,,2018/06/21

Past studies have focused on nest site selection and survival but information is needed on factors influencing their space use when away from the nest. We examined space use by white-headed woodpeckers during the nesting (May-Jul) and post-nesting (Jul-Oct) periods and compared the role of environmental factors (e.g., landcover) and socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, breeding success) in home range size and selection of location. Average size of 99% kernel home ranges was 125ha (SD +/- 59ha; n=19) in the nesting period and 137ha (SD +/- 70ha; n=30) in the post-nesting period. Minimum convex polygons were generally comparable to or smaller than ranges reported from previous radio-telemetry studies with this species. Although bird weight and age best explained variation in home range size compared to other factors, neither parameter estimate was significant in our models. Thus, even though weight and age were the most-supported factors in our analysis, home range size was largely influenced by factors that we did not measure. We found that most woodpeckers selected home ranges within forest patches that had undergone a recent disturbance; these areas included forests that had recently been burned with prescribed fire by the United States Forest Service (82%) or subject to disease (16%). Most burned patches in our study were small (approx. 4.8ha) and occurred within otherwise live forest but had nearly complete mortality of adult trees. We suggest that recent forest disturbances, especially mixed-severity prescribed burns, may have been selected by white-headed woodpeckers because they created snags for nesting and future studies should explore this hypothesis. Because home range size was variable and not linked with productivity, it should not be used as an indication of habitat quality without more detailed studies on causal factors that affect space use in this species.

The vast areas of logged tropical forest are often vulnerable to relogging, clear-felling, burning or conversion to plantations, despite evidence that logged forests retain a large proportion of tropical forest species at high abundances compared with alternate land uses. However, the demographic processes (e.g. survival, fecundity) that drive community or species properties (e.g. occurrence, density) in response to logging have never been examined. We used a novel capture-recapture-based sampling design to separate insitu reproduction from immigration-fuelled recruitment to investigate the demographic vital rates of six forest-dependent understorey insectivorous bird species along a logging continuum in the Eastern Himalaya Global Biodiversity Hotspot. We expected a positive relationship between forest intactness and reproductive rates, and that intact patches would contribute excess' individuals to logged patches from natal dispersal. Contrary to our expectations, we found: (i) a positive relationship between logging intensity and reproduction, and (ii) evidence of natal dispersal from more logged to less logged and intact forest patches. Our results indicate that for certain forest-dependent species in particular contexts, selectively logged habitats can have surprising and hitherto unrecognized demographic value that might be superior even to primary forest.Synthesis and applications. In most tropical settings, logged forests can not only support a greater subset of forest biodiversity than other forms of land use (for instance, agriculture), but can also play an important role in supporting populations of certain forest-dependent species. The ongoing conversion of large swathes of logged forest to non-forest habitat (such as oil palm plantation) because of their perceived lack of importance for biodiversity is a cause for serious concern for the conservation of tropical biodiversity.In most tropical settings, logged forests can not only support a greater subset of forest biodiversity than other forms of land use (for instance, agriculture), but can also play an important role in supporting populations of certain forest-dependent species.

We collected data for 93 nests over two breeding seasons (2012-2014). We assessed how some covariates influence the daily survival rates and affect nest survival, building models in Program MARK. Breeding begins in early October, peaks in late November, and continues until early March, lasting approximately 150 days. The mean size of breeding territories was 1.1 ha, and territories located in burned areas were smaller than those in unburned areas. Only the females build the small open-cup nests, in clumps of grass (mainly composed of Andropogon lateralis, Schizachyrium tenerum and Sorghastrum setosum) at 36.2 cm above the ground. The clutch size is three (67%) or two eggs (n = 52), and laying occurs on consecutive days. Incubation is performed by the female and lasts 13.7 days. The mean period of on-bouts was 73.5 min and the mean period of off-bouts was 39 mins. The hatching is synchronized and the hatching rate was 94%. In most nests, both the female and male fed the nestlings (biparental care). The frequency of visits/hr to feed the young did not differ with nestling age, but the length of visits was longer when the nestlings were younger. Nestlings fledged after 9-12 days. The apparent success was 42%, with 39% and 35% breeding success when calculated with the Mayfield estimate and the MARK software program, respectively. Predation was the main cause of failure, affecting 76% of the unsuccessful nests. The best models included time-specific factors (nest age and year) and nest-site features (nest height and habitat) influencing nest survival. Daily survival rates decreased through the nest cycle, and were much lower in the nestling stage. The re-nesting interval after nest failure was 2.7 days, and the mean distance between consecutive nesting attempts was 104.2 m. Up to four attempts (n 5 5) by the same female were observed in the same breeding season.

The droughts, forest fires, winter frosts become more frequent that affects the abundance and diversity of animals, including commercial species and crop pests. The deviation of timing of the phases of ontogeny from multiyear is a sensitive indicator of the state and the processes of ecosystems. In order to identify the features of the biota response to extreme weather conditions we studied the reaction of animals of the East Russian Plain (Kirov Region) to weather anomalies of cold winter in 2009-2010 and the hot summer of 2010 according to phenological (1890-2013 years) and phytosanitary (2000-2013 years) monitoring of 52 species Clitellata, Bivalvia, Gastropoda, Insecta, Ayes, Mammalia. The observations were carried out on the territory of the boreal ecotone with different changes of hydrothermal regime within Vyatsko-Verkhnekamsk District of the Volga Region. The phenological monitoring carried out by a standard technique involving public opinion poll from permanent correspondents. We analyzed the date of the seasonal phases of development: the end of winter diapause, the beginning of oviposition, hatching of larvae, the emergence of the imago insects; spring arrival, the beginning of the breeding cycle, autumn departure of birds and others. In 2010 the survey of additional information on phenology of biological objects was conducted by method of questioning of permanent observers in 23 geographical locations of the Kirov Region. We examined the impact of agro-climatic conditions for the development of pests within permanent control areas of Kumenskii Hospital District Department of the Federal Phytosanitary Service during the active vegetation. Long frosts below 35 degrees C were pessimal and sublethal for different stages of ontogenesis in Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Aella acuminata, Agrotis segetum, Oscinnella frit and others. Extreme summer heat above 30 degrees C and drought were pessimal for Phyllotreta vittula, Leptinotarsa decemlineata and sublethal for eggs and larvae of Oscinnella frit, Aelia acuminata, Elateridae, but contributed to the early emergence of Apion apricans adults. Exceeding monthly average air temperature at the 1 degrees C resulted in advancing the timing of microthermal insects development by 1.9 days and advancing the arrival dates of near migrant birds by 1 day in April, and in advancing the timing of mesothermal insects development by 1.3 days and advancing the arrival dates of distant migrant birds by 1.4 day in May. The 100 degrees C excess of the effective temperature in May led to emergence of Oscinnella frit, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Pieris brassicae adults 2.9-3.8 days ahead of due time. In June it resulted in larvae hatching 2.7-4.8 days ahead of due time, and in July their adult summer generation occurred 1.6-1.7 days earlier. Negative impact of pests on crops in abnormal seasons can be reduced by spring crops sowing in early summer, while winter rye should optimally be sowed in later date. In the conditions of mid-latitude of Eastern European Plain the temperatures below 40 degrees C in winter and long heat up to 40 degrees C with a summer drought are within the adaptive capacities of the regional biota. Their influence does not cause irreversible consequences in the functioning of wildlife, particularly animals, including pests.","Solov'ev, A.

The station has 60 experimental units with replicated grazing and fire treatments that create a heterogeneous landscape of different habitat patches. We radio-tracked sandpipers for two breeding seasons (2003-2004, n = 37 birds) and monitored sandpiper nests for eight seasons (2001-2008, n = 246 nests). We used resource utilization functions to examine resource selection with respect to five landscape features.Home ranges of sandpipers were large in contiguous prairie () and explain area-sensitive occurrence in fragmented prairie. Upland sandpipers selected grazed and burned sites with short vegetation within their home range. In contrast, nest site selection was influenced by fire frequency and birds selected infrequently burned sites with greater vegetative structure. Settlement decisions affected fitness because nest survival was low in burned and grazed sites (0.068), but higher in unburned and ungrazed sites (0.201-0.247).Our results raise concerns for conservation because private rangelands managed for livestock production are often homogeneous landscapes with heavy grazing and frequent fires. Rotational grazing and fire could be used to restore heterogeneity to grasslands but the duration of rotation, patch size, and optimal configuration require further investigation.","Sandercock, Brett K.; Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, 116 Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",,"Sandercock, Brett/L-1644-2016","Sandercock, Brett/0000-0002-9240-0268",16,99,,70,13,18,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0921-2973,1572-9761,10.1007/s10980-014-0133-9,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Charadriiformes [85518]; [Bartramia longicauda; upland sandpiper; (male)]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Mammalia [85700]; [livestock]",,,,,"Konza Prairie; Kansas, USA, North America; Nearctic region",,,,"breeding season, habitat patche",,,,2018/06/21

Habitat for shrubland birds is typically dynamic, in which available habitat changes temporally and spatially in response to disturbance and succession. Despite widespread concerns among conservationists about shrubland birds, much is still poorly understood regarding fundamental demographic processes associated with the persistence of species in dynamic landscapes, such as the age of colonists, their success upon establishment, the fate of birds displaced by disturbance, and the effect of displaced birds on neighboring territories. To address these knowledge gaps, we studied prairie warblers (Setophaga discolor) between 2008 and 2012 in a pitch pine-scrub oak (Pinus rigida Quercus ilicifolia) barren consisting of newly created, maturing, and disturbed habitat patches. We found that newly created habitat patches were colonized primarily by younger, second-year males, whereas slightly older shrubland habitat was occupied by site-faithful older birds. Second-year males arrived later on the breeding grounds and had slightly lower pairing success compared to older males; however, they had similar reproductive output as older males. Based on mark-resight analyses, we calculated that 72% of adult males and 14% of banded nestlings returned to the study site in a following year. When territories were subject to high-intensity mowing, fire, or selective herbicide during the non-breeding season, only 14% of the males that returned to the study site stayed on their territories the following year. These returning males that acquired a territory within the study area had similar reproductive success to other birds in the study area and did not negatively affect the pairing or reproductive success of birds occupying adjacent areas. Disturbed territories made up a relatively small portion of the suitable habitat in the study area and disturbance affected a low number of territorial males in any given year. Overall, we found that the short-term effects of shrubland management and habitat disturbance on birds are minimal and subsequently allow young birds to colonize and breed. Moreover, the long-term effects of management are beneficial by maintaining ephemeral shrubland habitat for immigrating and site-faithful birds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The Siju Cave of Meghalaya, also known as cave of the bat, is among the longest caves on the Indian subcontinent. The palynological study of fifty bat-guano samples from Siju Cave and of thirty surface soil and moss cushion from the area immediate surrounding the cave reflects the close similarity between the modern pollen and vegetation in the region in the two areas sampled. The resulting palynodata comprise mainly the native flora, dominated by riparian taxa like Duabanga, Syzygium, Careya, and Ficus, along with evergreen and deciduous elements in the region. The evergreen taxa Mesua, Elaeocarpus, and Garcinia, along with Impatiens, reflect the high precipitation in the region. The climate of the region and the vegetation are strongly influenced by the Simsang River, and the heavy rainfall results in the dominance of riparian taxa and other high-rainfall indicator taxa. The occurrence of pollen from Nepenthes khasiana, an endemic and endangered plant of Meghalaya, in bat guano is significant and may be due to its insectivorous and entomophilous nature. However, medicinal plants like Swertia chirata, Cinchona, and Rauvolfia are not encountered in the bat-guano sediments, despite their luxuriant growth around the cave, and these species could be avoided by the insects due to their alkaloid contain and bitter taste. The presence of highland taxa such as Pinus, Abies, Picea, and Larix in the bat guano deposit is significant and suggestive of high winds from higher altitudes, or the pollen may be introduced by the return of migratory Siberian birds during winter to the nearby Siju wildlife and bird sanctuary. The recovery of cerealia along with Areca catechu and Citrus pollen indicate the human activity in the region. The abundance of fungal remains, namely Meliola, Glomus, and Microthyriaceae along with degraded palynomorphs are suggestive of strong microbial activity under warm and humid conditions during sedimentation in the region. The main objective of this study is to identify the potential of bat guano for palaeoecological research and as supportive data for surface and sedimentary soil profiles in the South Garo Hills of Meghalaya. The palynodata from the bat guano of the Siju Cave provides a useful source for palaeoecological information for the South Garo Hills, where intensive natural and human-caused forest fires, heavy rainfall, and soil erosion occur every year and there is a relative scarcity of the lake, wetland, and swamp habitats that normally preserve pollen.","Basumatary, Sadhan K.; Birbal Sahni Inst Paleobot, Quaternary Palynol Div, 53 Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India",,,,1,24,,75,2,2,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Reproductive Biology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Paleontology",1090-6924,,10.4311/2013PA0119,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Reproductive System (Reproduction); Climatology (Environmental Sciences); Paleobiology","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07504, Ecology: environmental biology - Bioclimatology and biometeorology; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 16504, Reproductive system - Physiology and biochemistry; 50000, Paleobotany; 50506, Botany: general and systematic - Fungi; 50518, Botany: general and systematic - Gymnospermae; 50524, Botany: general and systematic - Monocotyledones; 50526, Botany: general and systematic - Dicotyledones; 51512, Plant physiology - Reproduction; 64500, Paleobiology","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Apocynaceae [25580]; [Rauvolfia; (Fossil)]/Fungi, Plantae; Fungi, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Ascomycetes [15100]; [Meliola; (Fossil)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Balsaminaceae [25620]; [Impatiens; (Fossil)]/Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [Pinus; (Fossil)] [Abies; (Fossil)] [Picea; (Fossil)] [Larix; (Fossil)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Elaeocarpaceae [26015]; [Elaeocarpus; (Fossil)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gentianaceae [26100]; [Swertia chirata; (Fossil)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Guttiferae [26135]; [Mesua; (Fossil)] [Garcinia; (Fossil)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Lecythidaceae [26250]; [Careya; (Fossil)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Moraceae [26395]; [Ficus; (Fossil)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Myrtaceae [26430]; [Syzygium; (Fossil)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Nepenthaceae [26435]; [Nepenthes khasiana; (protected species; Fossil)]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Palmae [25380]; [Areca catechu; (Fossil)]/Fungi, Plantae; Fungi, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Phycomycetes [15900]; [Glomus; (Fossil)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Rubiaceae [26680]; [Cinchona; (Fossil)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Rutaceae [26685]; [Citrus; (Fossil)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Sonneratiaceae [26780]; [Duabanga; (Fossil)]",,,,,"Meghalaya; India, Asia; Oriental region/Garo Hills; India, Asia; Oriental region/Simsang River; India, Asia; Oriental region/Siju Cave; India, Asia; Oriental region",,,"pollen; reproductive system",,gold_or_bronze,,,2018/06/21

Concerns about the massive use of these substances have increased due to their possible toxicity, endocrine disrupting properties and occurrence in almost all the environmental compartments, including humans and wildlife organisms. Several conventional BFRs (e.g. polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDE)) have been included in the list of Persistent Organic Pollutants and their use has been restricted because of their established toxicity and environmental persistence. Over the past few years, these compounds have been replaced with ""new"" BFRs (NBFRs). Despite the fact that NBFRs are different chemical molecules than traditional BFRs, most of physical-chemical properties (e.g. aromatic moiety, halogen substitution, lipophilic character) are common to both groups; therefore, their fate in the environment is potentially similar to the banned BFRs. Therefore, this article has been compiled to summarize the published scientific data regarding the biodegradability of the most widely used NBFRs, a key factor in their potential persistency in the environment, and their ecotoxicological effects on humans and test organisms. The data reviewed here document that the mechanisms through NBFRs exibit their ecotoxicity and the processes leading to their biotransformation in the environment are still poorly understood.

We conducted occupancy surveys for an umbrella species, the Coastal California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica), from 2004 to 2009 in San Diego County, California, focusing on preserve lands associated with HCPs. We investigated the effects of habitat quality classification, elevation, distance to coast, and heat load on gnatcatcher occupancy, extinction, and colonization probabilities. Our work focused on these factors throughout the range of this species in San Diego County where, through conservation agreements, a preserve system has been assembled addressing management considerations at a landscape scale. In addition, a large wildfire in 2003 burned 17,044 ha, roughly 1/3 of preserve lands, thus we were able to investigate the recolonization process associated with this event. We found that occupancy increased with habitat quality and over time, but decreased with elevation. Extinction probability was generally constant (similar to 0.13), but colonization varied greatly, with probabilities being greater in higher quality habitat and at lower elevations. Gnatcatchers were more likely to colonize burned areas adjacent to high and very high quality habitat, sites that should receive priority conservation actions, particularly at lower elevations. Our work suggests that umbrella species, like the California Gnatcatcher, may reflect not just habitat quality, but may also be useful indicators of recovery after an unexpected event such as fire. Although not perfect, the use of multiple umbrella species in HCPs may lead to effective conservation and management of biodiversity hotspots.","Winchell, Clark S.; US Fish and Wildlife Serv, Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Off, Carlsbad, CA 92008 USA",,,,5,26,,36,1,1,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0010-5422,1938-5129,10.1650/CONDOR-13-156.1,,"Conservation; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Polioptila californica californica; California gnatcatcher]",,,,,"California; USA, North America; Nearctic region/San Diego County; California, USA, North America; Nearctic region",,"occupancy survey; applied and field techniques",,"habitat quality, wildfire, Habitat Conservation Plan",,,,2018/06/21

Although snag availability is believed to limit populations in managed and non-managed forests, little data are available to evaluate the relative effect of stand conditions and management on snag occurrence. We analyzed point sample data from an intensive forest inventory within an 80,000 ha landscape for four major forest types to support the hypotheses that routine low-intensity prescribed fire would increase, and thinning would decrease, snag occurrence. We employed path analysis to define a priori causal relationships to determine the direct and indirect effects of site quality, age, relative stand density index and fire for all forest types and thinning effects for loblolly pine and longleaf pine. Stand age was an important direct effect for loblolly pine, mixed pine-hardwoods and hardwoods, but not for longleaf pine. Snag occurrence in loblolly pine was increased by prescribed fire and decreased by thinning which confirmed our initial hypotheses. Although fire was not important in mixed pine-hardwoods, it was for hardwoods but the relationship depended on site quality. For longleaf pine the relative stand density index was the dominant variable affecting snag occurrence, which increased as the density index decreased. Site quality, age and thinning had significant indirect effects on snag occurrence in longleaf pine through their effects on the density index. Although age is an important condition affecting snag occurrence for most forest types, path analysis revealed that fire and density management practices within certain forest types can also have major beneficial effects, particularly in stands less than 60 years old.

In species in which both the males and females are ornamented, assortative pairings could arise from mutual mate choice on the same trait. We test this mechanism of mate choice and assortative pairing in the Diamond Firetail (Stagonopleura guttata), an Australian estrildid finch in which both sexes are ornamented with red bills, red rumps and white flank spots. We have previously shown sex differences in the degree of ornamentation as females have more flank spots than males. These white flank spots are used during sexual display, being fully displayed by courting males and by females when approaching a displaying male. Here, we experimentally test whether mutual mate preference is based on the number of flank spots. There was no evidence for a direct mutual preference for spot number. Given a choice of potential mates with a natural or experimentally manipulated number of flank spots, males preferred females with more spots, while female preference was not solely based on flank spots. Intriguingly, in both wild and captive Diamond Firetails, we found the number of flank spots in pairs was correlated suggesting a basis for positive assortative pairing. Nevertheless, we conclude that assortative pairing in Diamond Firetails is not due to mutual choice of mates based on the number of flank spots.

This has caused many scientists to identify the conservation of early-successional species as a high priority. In this synthesis, we discuss the conservation implications of this loss of early-successional habitats using examples from the literature on songbirds. Early-successional ""shrubland"" bird species require conditions and resources present in recently disturbed sites. These conditions are ephemeral and change rapidly over time as sites become dominated by later-seral species. Historical disturbance regimes such as wind-throw, fire and flooding have been altered or suppressed in eastern forests through human activity such as conversion of forests to younger aged stands more resistant to wind, fire suppression and mesophication of fire-adapted communities, and suppression of beaver activity and flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic disturbance has shifted over much of the region to types of land use that provide less shrubland habitat of lower quality than historically. Despite scientific evidence in support of this concern, there is still misunderstanding about the role of disturbance in maintaining biodiversity, and public opposition to management remains a challenge to conserving these communities. Contemporary approaches use natural disturbance regimes to inform management practices that employ historical agents where possible or surrogates when necessary to achieve desired future conditions defined on the basis of regional population or community status. Conservation of early-successional communities occurs within the context of other potentially conflicting ecological values, such as the conservation and enhancement of biologically mature forest. Recent findings, however, show shrubland habitat can augment diversity in forested landscapes by providing seasonal resources for mature-forest species, such as food or predator-free space for juvenile forest songbirds that seek out early-successional habitats during the transition to independence. Balancing the conservation of early-successional shrubland species with other, sometimes conflicting values is an active area of current conservation research. In some cases the conservation of shrubland birds can be coordinated with commercial activities like silviculture or maintenance of infrastructure (e.g. powerline corridors), although our work indicates that deliberate efforts expressly directed at conservation of early-successional shrubland species are more effective.

I provide here the first study of Great Crested Flycatcher nesting ecology and nest-site selection in tree cavities in the eastern United States. I monitored 44 Great Crested Flycatcher nests in a mosaic of slash pine plantations and longleaf pine sandhills in Clay County, Florida. Nest sites were located in slash pine (52%), turkey oak (39%), longleaf pine (7%), and unknown pine species (2%). Most (73%) Great Crested Flycatcher nests were located in abandoned tree cavities excavated by various species, especially the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus). Cavity entrance diameters averaged 6.2 (+/- 2.5) cm, with most (55%) measured entrances smaller than the minimum previously reported for the species. These findings are contrary to earlier characterizations of the species as showing a strong affinity for large naturally occurring hollows in live trees. Only 19 of 44 Great Crested Flycatcher nests (43%) were successful in fledging >= 1 young. Mean cavity height was greater for successful nests than for unsuccessful nests, and the primary cause of nest failure was predation. Most flycatcher nests in oaks were located in the understory <3 m above ground where they were particularly vulnerable to predation.

Although black-backed woodpeckers occupy habitats created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and mountain pine beetle infestations. Our finding that population growth rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the landscape. The lower growth rates in fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations may be attributed to differences in predator communities and food resources relative to summer wildfire.","Rota, Christopher T.; Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries and Wildlife Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",,,"Rota, Christopher/0000-0001-9272-4687",2,43,,57,12,14,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",1932-6203,1932-6203,10.1371/journal.pone.0094700,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Conservation; Pest Assessment Control and Management; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 54600, Pest control: general, pesticides and herbicides; 62800, Animal distribution; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Coleoptera [75304]; [mountain pine beetle; (mature, immature; pest)]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Piciformes [85552]; [Picoides arcticus; black-backed woodpecker; (host)]",,,,,"Black Hill; South Dakota, USA, North America; Nearctic region",,"matrix projection model; mathematical and computer techniques/Bayesian multi-state model; mathematical and computer techniques",,"population dynamics, habitat loss, reproductive success, nest success, prescribed fire, wildfire role",gold,,,2018/06/21

Besides the known cases of biological extinctions, this time period was also characterized by the regional extirpations of specialized taxa and by the expansion and population growth of some opportunistic species. Several lines of evidence suggest that the current configuration of small mammal communities - i.e. richness (number of species) and diversity (distribution of species abundance)-in southern South America would have been generated in the period after the arrival of Europeans ca. 1500 AD. In this study, we reviewed the fossil record for small rodents and marsupials during the last 500 years, with emphasis on the Pampean and Patagonian regions. Based on these findings, we offer some considerations concerning the biogeography and conservation of these species.Methods: Micromammals from archaeological and paleontological sites have provided considerable information on environmental conditions during the Quaternary in South America. In this work, we reviewed several micromammal fossil samples, mostly generated by the trophic activity of owls. The use of this kind of data involves some extrinsic and intrinsic biases that must be considered at the time to study the diversity of past communities, such as the bird involved on the accumulations, its hunting techniques, the time of the year, the size and behavior of the prey species, etc. For this work, we compared the fossil samples with more than 700 owl pellet assemblages of the same geographical areas.Results: Richness and diversity of small mammal communities was higher prior to the deepest human impact (> 0.5 ka), showing a pronounced drop in both parameters to the present. The regional extinction of some cricetid rodents and small marsupials was recorded, both in the Pampean (e.g. Bibimys torresi, Pseudoryzomys simplex) and in the Patagonian regions (e.g. Euneomys mordax, Lestodelphys halli, Tympanoctomys kirchnerorum), as well as the biological extinctions of the bat Desmodus cf. D. draculae and the cavy Galea tixiensis in the Pampas. At this same time, opportunistic species (e.g. Calomys spp., Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) showed a dramatic increase of their populations, especially in the most extensively disturbed areas.Discussion and conclusions: In the last 500 years, significant variations occurred in the micromammal assemblages of southern South America. These changes included the dispersion and increase (in some cases extensive) of some specialized species and the regional extinctions of others, involving hundreds to thousands of kilometers of distributional extent. We suggest that the changes produced by livestock and agriculture have caused extensive habitat uniformity which was beneficial for some opportunistic taxa (e.g. Calomys spp., Oligoryzomys longicaudatus), facilitating their dispersion and allowing the increase of their populations. Anthropic disturbances also include the extensive use of fire, urbanization, and introduction of exotic forbs and grasses. Of about 46 species rodents considered as Least Concern by the IUCN and with fossil record for the last 500 years, 23 (50 %) have experienced drastic reductions in their range or abundance during the Late Holocene. At least nine taxa are completely extinct, including one marsupial, one bat and seven rodents. Similar phenomena are recorded in other areas of the Southern Hemisphere, both in continental and island contexts. This evaluation of the fossil record highlights the need to evaluate more carefully the status of some species with supposedly stable populations, but which are likely to be affected by future extensive changes in their environments (e.g. mining, expansion of the agricultural frontier).","Teta, Pablo; Ctr Nacl Patagon, Unidad Invest Diversidad Sistemat and Evoluc, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina",,,"Tammone, Mauro/0000-0003-2966-820X",0,1,,132,13,17,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Paleontology; Biodiversity & Conservation",2007-3364,2007-3364,,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Paleobiology; Wildlife Management (Conservation); Biodiversity","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 64500, Paleobiology; 64728, Geological periods - Recent",,,,,,"Patagonia; South America; Neotropical region/Pampas; South America; Neotropical region/Pampean; South America; Neotropical region","Holocene; Quaternary, Cenozoic, Phanerozoic",,,"species diversity, species abundance, species distribution, anthropogenic impact, species rRichness",gold,,,2018/06/21

J.; Clarke, Michael F.",,,,,,,,,"Wildlife Research",,2014,,41,3,203-211,203,211,English,,,,,,"Context. The superb lyrebird Menura novaehollandiae is thought to be an important ecosystem engineer that, through its foraging, accelerates the decomposition of litter in Eucalyptus forests. Lyrebird foraging is therefore likely to affect forest fuel loads and hence fire behaviour in these fire-prone forests. In turn, fire is likely to reduce the abundance and influence the distribution of lyrebirds.Aims. Our goal was to determine the impacts of a major bushfire on the habitat and food sources for the superb lyrebird and the effects of foraging activities of lyrebirds on litter fuel and potential fire behaviour in gullies of herb-rich foothill forests.Methods. The effect of fire on lyrebirds and their habitat in the post-fire environment was examined at the landscape-scale, 2 years after fire; and at the patch-scale, 3 years after fire. Paired exclusion and control plots were also used over a 9-month period to assess the effects of foraging by the lyrebird on litter accumulation and fuel connectivity. Fire-behaviour models were used to determine the potential influence of lyrebird scratchings on fire behaviour.Key results. At the landscape scale, lyrebirds were present in both unburnt and ground-burnt sites, but not in canopy-burnt sites. Within patchily burnt sites, lyrebirds favoured foraging in unburnt patches. On average, lyrebird foraging reduced litter fuel loads by25%(1.66 t ha(-1)) in plots in which they were free to forage, compared with plots from which they were excluded, over a 9-month period. Fire-behaviour modelling showed that lyrebird foraging led to a lower likelihood of fire occurring and less intense fire.Conclusions. Distinctly different vegetation structure and composition between burnt and unburnt patches appears to influence both the foraging patterns and distribution of lyrebirds. Additionally, foraging by lyrebirds reduces surface fuel loads and fuel connectivity such that fire spread is likely to be inhibited.Implications. We propose that alternative stable states may emerge in Eucalyptus forests as a result of feedback mechanisms among lyrebirds, vegetation and fuel accumulation. Therefore, the ecological role of lyrebirds is an important consideration in forest fuel management and conservation in these extensive, fire-prone forests in south-eastern Australia.","Nugent, Daniel T.; 6 Gibbs Rd, Healesville, Vic 3056, Australia",,,,3,33,,54,3,4,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Forestry; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",1035-3712,1448-5494,10.1071/WR14052,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Forestry; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 53500, Forestry and forest products; 62800, Animal distribution","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Myrtaceae [26430]; [Eucalyptus]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Menura novaehollandiae; superb lyrebird]",,,,,"Australia; Australasian region",,,,"species composition, species habitat, species distribution, species interaction, vegetation structure, species conservation, foraging pattern, food source, foraging activity, ecological importance, forest fuel management, bushfire impact, litter fuel",,,,2018/06/21

Nest-sites are generally selected to reduce the risk of nest predation. In this study we provide information on the reproductive biology of Siamese fireback (Lophura diardi) at Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve, Thailand and identify habitat characteristics that influence nest site selection. At this site the species is found both in pristine and disturbed habitats. During a three year period (2010-2012), we found 21 nest-sites. Egg laying occurred from April to early August and the average clutch size was 6.4 +/- 0.3 SE eggs (range four-eight). Incubation lasted 23-24 days and daily nest survival was estimated at 0.90 +/- 0.02 SE (95% CI = 0.85-0.94), giving an estimated overall nest success of 0.08 +/- 0.04 SE. Predation was the main cause of nest failure. Siamese fireback appeared to prefer to site nests between the buttresses of large trees (62.5%), which presumably have the potential to serve as shelter from potential predators. Analyses indicated that Siamese fireback significantly preferred to place nests in an area associated with dense vegetation coverage below 0.5 m, on steeper slopes, large basal areas of trees DBH > 10 cm and with low potential predation pressure. This can be interpreted as a strategy to make the nest less conspicuous to predators and facilitate flying out of the nest when predators attack. Primary forest provides large mature trees and a complex structure of understory coverage that is important for optimal nesting sites and nest survival of Siamese fireback.","Suwanrat, Jirapa; Suranaree Univ Technol, Inst Sci, Sch Biol, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand",,,,1,12,,81,5,7,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Reproductive Biology",0217-2445,,,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Reproduction","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 16504, Reproductive system - Physiology and biochemistry","Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Canidae [85765]; [Canis aureus; Asian golden jackal]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Primates, Primates, Vertebrates; Cercopithecidae [86205]; [Macaca nemestrina; pig-tailed macaque]/Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Felidae [85770]; [Prionailurus bengalensis; leopard cat]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]; [Lophura diardi; Siamese fireback; (egg)]/Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Mustelidae [85780]; [Arctonyx collaris; hog badger]/Reptilia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Reptiles, Vertebrates; Sauria [85408]; [Varanus bengalensis; monitor lizard]/Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Viverridae [85795]; [Viverra zibetha; large Indian civet] [Viverricula indica; small Indian civet] [Viverra megaspila; large-spotted civet] [Paradoxurus hermaphrodites; common palm civet] [Herpestes javanicus; small Asian mongoose]",,,,,"Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve; Thailand, Asia; Oriental region",,,,"species habitat, reproductive biology, nest-site selection, clutch size, predation pressure, reproductive ecology, lowland forest, nest success, disturbed habitat, nest failure, nest survival, nesting period, pristine habitat, understory coverage, dense vegetation coverage, nest concealment hypothesis, micro habitat characteristics",,,,2018/06/21

Prescribed burning has sometimes been proposed for its conservation, but without evidence of its effectiveness. To evaluate the short-term effects of a summer wildfire on this species, we performed several transect counts in the burnt and unburnt parts of a shrub-steppe in central Spain. The same transects were counted within a three-year interval prior to the fire and were repeated during the first two springs after the fire. We also measured the vegetation during the first two springs after the fire. In the burnt area, we observed a decrease of about 85-100% in Dupont's Lark abundance, and about 7-15% in the control area. The disappearance of the scrub cover after fire and its slow regeneration, as well as the large increase in grass cover during the second year, may explain the decrease in this habitat-specialist bird species. Fire should be avoided in areas occupied by the Dupont's Lark, as its negative effects in the short-term may cause local extinctions. However, prescribed burning may be used in neighboring areas to create new open habitats that may be subsequently colonized by this species.","Perez-Granados, Cristian; Univ Alicante, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Multidisciplinary Inst Environm Studies Ramon Mar, 03690 POB 99, E-03080 Alicante, Spain",,"Noguerales, Victor/C-4376-2013","Noguerales, Victor/0000-0003-3185-778X; Perez-Granados, Cristian/0000-0003-3247-4182",2,13,,50,3,5,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0001-6454,1734-8471,10.3161/000164513X678856,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Climatology (Environmental Sciences); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07504, Ecology: environmental biology - Bioclimatology and biometeorology; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 62800, Animal distribution","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Labiatae [26230]; [Lavandula latifolia] [Thymus vulgaris] [Phlomis lychnitis] [Thymus mastichina] [Thymus mastigophorus]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Leguminosae [26260]; [Genista pumila]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Chersophilus duponti; Dupont's lark; (protected species; male)]",,,,,"Spain; Europe; Palearctic region/Europe; Palearctic region",,,,"species habitat, species abundance, species conservation, summer season",,,,2018/06/21

We also summarize the ornithological work that has been conducted and compiled recommendations for bird conservation. A total of 261 species of birds have been detected in the Cienega de Santa Clara, representing 71% of the species known to the Colorado River delta. The birds of the Cienega include 189 migratory species (70.4%), 49 year-round residents (18.7%), and 28 breeding visitors (10.7%). Twenty-seven species are federally protected in Mexico, four of them as Endangered, eight as Threatened, and 15 under Special Protection. The Cienega provides critical habitat for migratory waterbirds, with maximum counts of 280,000 shorebirds in the southern mudflats, as well as for breeding marsh birds, including Yuma Clapper Rails, Virginia Rails and California Black Rails, with maximum estimates of 8600, 7150 and 400 individuals respectively. Other species of concern that occur regularly in the Cienega include Least Bittern, Snowy Plover, Least Tern, and Large-billed Savannah Sparrow. This wetland also provides important stopover habitat for 81 species of Neotropical migratory landbirds during their northbound spring migration, particularly for Wilson's Warbler, Swainson's Thrush, Yellow Warbler, Pacific-slope Flycatcher, and Willow Flycatcher. Binational cooperation is essential to protect the Cienega in the long-term, especially in terms of dedicating the necessary water for its maintenance.

Fire management for wildlife conservation requires understanding how species respond to burning at different frequencies, severities, and over time. In an earlier study, we experimentally assessed how breeding bird communities and species responded to fuel reduction treatments by mechanical understory reduction, low-severity prescribed fires, or mechanical understory reduction followed a year later by high-severity prescribed fires in upland hardwood forest. Here, we assess longer-term response to the initial mechanical treatment (M), and a second low-intensity burn in twice burned (B2) and mechanical + twice burned (MB2) treatments and controls (C). Initial (2003) higher dead fuel loadings and consequently high-severity fires in MB2 created open-canopy structure with abundant snags, resulting in much higher species richness and density of breeding birds compared to other treatments. Relative bird density and richness remained much higher in MB2 after a second burn, but few changes were evident that were not already apparent after one burn. The initial (2003) burn in B2 had cooler, low-severity fires that killed few trees. Delayed tree mortality occurred in both burn treatments after one burn, and continued in both after a second low-intensity burn. In B2, this resulted in gradual development of a ""perforated,"" patchy canopy structure with more snags. Abundance of total birds and most species in B2 was similar to C, but several additional species associated with open-forest conditions occurred at low levels, increasing richness in B2. In both burn treatments, burning temporarily reduced habitat suitability for ground-nesting birds. Bird communities in M were similar to C, as shrubs recovered rapidly. Results indicate that one or two relatively low-intensity burns with patches of hotter fire may result in gradual, subtle changes to canopy cover and structure that may slightly increase bird species richness over time. In contrast, a single high-intensity, high severity fire can create young forest conditions and a heterogeneous canopy structure that can be maintained by repeated burning and increase breeding bird relative abundance and richness by attracting disturbance-adapted species while retaining most other forest species.

In the absence of fire, fuels have accumulated in these forests causing concerns over the potential for catastrophic wildfires. Fuel reduction treatments are being used on federal and state lands to reduce the threat of wildfire by mechanically removing biomass. Although these treatments result in a reduction in fire hazard, their impact on wildlife is less clear. We use a multi-species occupancy modeling approach to build habitat-suitability models for 46 upland forest birds found in the Lake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra Nevada based on forest structure and abiotic variables. Using a Bayesian hierarchical framework, we predict species-specific and community-level responses to changes in forest structure and make inferences about responses of important avian foraging guilds. Disparities within and among foraging group responses to canopy cover, tree size and shrub cover emphasized the complexities in managing forests to meet biodiversity goals. Based on our species-specific model results, we predicted changes in species richness and community similarity under forest prescriptions representing three management practices: no active management, a typical fuel reduction treatment that emphasizes spacing between trees, and a thinning prescription that creates structural heterogeneity. Simulated changes to structural components of the forest analogous to management practices to reduce fuel loads clearly affected foraging groups differentially despite variability in responses within guilds. Although species richness was predicted to decrease slightly under both simulated fuels reduction treatments, the prescription that incorporated structural heterogeneity retained marginally higher species richness. The composition of communities supported by different management alternatives was influenced by urbanization and management practice, emphasizing the importance of creating heterogeneity at the landscape scale.

Using occupancy survey data from 2003 to 2011 for all-detections and pairs-only data, we estimated annual extinction and colonization probabilities at 71 burned and 97 unburned breeding-season sites before and after fire, while controlling for confounding effects of non-fire-related temporal variation and among-site differences in habitat characteristics. We found no statistically significant effects of fire or salvage logging on occupancy dynamics of spotted owls of southern California. However, we found some evidence that fire and logging effects could be biologically meaningful. For pairs data, the model-averaged mean of fire-related effects on colonization and extinction probabilities resulted in a 0.062 lesser site-occupancy probability in burned sites 1-year post-fire relative to unburned sites. Post-fire salvage logging reduced occupancy an additional 0.046 relative to sites that only burned. We documented a threshold-type relationship between extinction and colonization probabilities and the amount of forested habitat (conifer or hardwood tree cover types) that burned at high severity within a 203-ha core area around spotted owl nests and roost centroids. Sites where approximately 0-50ha of forested habitat within the core area burned at high severity had extinction probabilities similar to unburned sites, but where more than approximately 50ha of forested habitat burned severely, extinction probability increased approximately 0.003 for every additional hectare severely burned. The majority (75%) of sites burned below this threshold. Sites where high-severity fire affected >50ha of forested habitat could still support spotted owls, so all burned sites should be monitored for occupancy before management actions such as salvage logging are undertaken that could be detrimental to the subspecies. We also recommend that managers strive to reduce human-caused ignitions along the wildland-urban interface, particularly at lower elevations where owl sites are at higher risk of extinction from fire.

Four different processes can lead to intraspecific variation in social organization: (i) genetic variation between individuals owing to local adaptation (between populations) or evolutionarily stable strategies within populations; (ii) developmental plasticity evolved in long-term (more than one generation) unpredictable and short-term (one generation) predictable environments, which is mediated by organizational physiological effects during early ontogeny; (iii) social flexibility evolved in highly unpredictable environments, which is mediated by activational physiological effects in adults; (iv) entirely extrinsic factors such as the death of a dominant breeder. Variation in social behaviour occurs between individuals in the case of genetic variation and developmental plasticity, but within individuals in the case of social flexibility. It is important to study intraspecific variation in social organization to understand the social systems of species because it reveals the mechanisms by which species can adapt to changing environments, offers a useful tool to study the ultimate and proximate causes of sociality, and is an interesting phenomenon by itself that needs scientific explanation.","Schradin, Carsten; Univ Strasbourg, IPHC DEPE, 23 Rue Becquerel, F-67087 Strasbourg, France",,"Schradin, Carsten/A-1534-2013",,2,85,,85,30,37,,,"Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0962-8436,1471-2970,10.1098/rstb.2012.0346,,"Behavior; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07002, Behavioral biology - General and comparative behavior; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 64054, Invertebrata:comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Arthropoda: crustacea; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Charadriiformes [85518]; [Philomachus pugnax; ruff; (female, male)]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Hymenoptera [75326]; [Solenopsis invicta; fire ant; (female, male)]/Crustacea, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Crustaceans, Invertebrates; Malacostraca [75112]; [Paracerceis sculpta; isopod; (female, male)]/Reptilia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Reptiles, Vertebrates; Sauria [85408]; [Uta stansburiana; side-blotched lizard; (female, male)]",,,,,,,,,"genetic variation, developmental plasticity, social behavior, intraspecific variation, social organization, social flexibility, species social system",gold_or_bronze,,,2018/06/21

For populations occupying such environments, fire-induced landscape change is likely to influence population processes, and genetic patterns and structure among populations. The Mallee Emu-wren Stipiturus mallee is an endangered passerine whose global distribution is confined to fire-prone, semi-arid mallee shrublands in south-eastern Australia. This species, with poor capacity for dispersal, has undergone a precipitous reduction in distribution and numbers in recent decades. We used genetic analyses of 11 length-variable, nuclear loci to examine population structure and processes within this species, across its global range. Populations of the Mallee Emu-wren exhibited a low to moderate level of genetic diversity, and evidence of bottlenecks and genetic drift. Bayesian clustering methods revealed weak genetic population structure across the species' range. The direct effects of large fires, together with associated changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of suitable habitat, have the potential to cause population bottlenecks, serial local extinctions and subsequent recolonisation, all of which may interact to erode and homogenise genetic diversity in this species. Movement among temporally and spatially shifting habitat, appears to maintain long-term genetic connectivity. A plausible explanation for the observed genetic patterns is that, following extensive fires, recolonisation exceeds in-situ survival as the primary driver of population recovery in this species. These findings suggest that dynamic, fire-dominated landscapes can drive genetic homogenisation of populations of species with low-mobility and specialised habitat that otherwise would be expected to show strongly structured populations. Such effects must be considered when formulating management actions to conserve species in fire-prone systems.","Brown, Sarah M.; Deakin Univ, Sch Life and Environm Sci, Burwood, Australia",,,"Sunnucks, Paul/0000-0002-8139-7059",1,62,,98,11,14,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Genetics & Heredity; Biodiversity & Conservation",1932-6203,1932-6203,10.1371/journal.pone.0059732,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Population Genetics (Population Studies); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 03506, Genetics - Animal; 03509, Genetics - Population genetics; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Stipiturus mallee; Mallee Emu-wren; (protected species; female, male)]",,"nuclear loci",,,"Australia; Australasian region",,"genetic analysis; laboratory techniques, genetic techniques",,"genetic drift, genetic diversity, population structure, fire-prone ecosystem, genetic homogenisation, bottlenecks characterise",gold,,,2018/06/21

Long-distance dispersal may shape the genetic structure of these new closed forest formations. We analyzed eight microsatellite loci using a single-time approach to understand contemporary pollen and effective seed dispersal of the tropical tree, Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. (Fabaceae), occurring in a Brazilian fire- and livestock-protected savanna. We sampled all adult trees found within a 10.24ha permanent plot, young trees within a subplot of 1.44ha and open-pollinated seeds. We detected a very high level of genetic diversity among the three generations in the studied plot. Parentage analysis revealed high pollen immigration rate (0.64) and a mean contemporary pollen dispersal distance of 74m. In addition, half-sib production was 1.8 times higher than full-sibs in significant higher distances, indicating foraging activity preference for different trees at long distances. There was a significant and negative correlation between diameter at breast height (DBH) of the pollen donor with the number of seeds (r=0.640, P-value=0.032), suggesting that pollen donor trees with a higher DBH produce less seeds. The mean distance of realized seed dispersal (recruitment kernel) was 135m due to the large home range dispersers (birds and mammals) in the area. The small magnitude of spatial genetic structure found in young trees may be a consequence of overlapping seed shadows and increased tree density. Our results show the positive side of closed canopy expansion, where animal activities regarding pollination and seed dispersal are extremely high.","Tarazi, Roberto; Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Genet, CP 9, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil",,"Kageyama, Paulo/L-2221-2015","Sebbenn, Alexandre/0000-0003-2352-0941; Tarazi, Roberto/0000-0001-8080-441X",0,47,,88,4,7,,,"Genetics & Heredity; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",2045-7758,2045-7758,10.1002/ece3.515,,"Population Genetics (Population Studies); Conservation; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 03504, Genetics - Plant; 03509, Genetics - Population genetics; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Leguminosae [26260]; [Fabaceae] [Copaifera langsdorffii; (seed)]",,"microsatellite loci",,,,,,,"genetic diversity, pollen dispersal, genetic structure, animal activity, pollen immigration rate, livestock-protected savanna",gold,,,2018/06/21

In this study, we set up a 2 x 2 factorial design with nectar-robbing ants and hummingbird pollination to test for non-additive effects on fruit set, seed mass, and seed germination of the leafless mistletoe Tristerix aphyllus (Loranthaceae). Even though ants caused conspicuous damage at the base of the floral tubes, nectar availability was reduced by only 8 % in the presence of ants. The green-backed firecrown Sephanoides sephaniodes was insensitive to the presence of ants. Rather, the bird responded to flower number and the presence or the absence of damage, but not to the extent of damage within inflorescences. As hummingbirds were largely insensitive to variation in nectar robbing, the interaction ant x hummingbird had no effect on plant-reproductive success. Thus, the factorial experiment did not provide evidence for indirect negative effects of nectar robbing on plant reproduction. These results suggest that indirect effects of nectar robbers on pollinator behaviour may occur under a more restricted set of conditions than those previously considered. We suggest that the low amount of nectar removed by nectar-robbing ants was insufficient for hummingbirds to avoid robbed flowers, which restricted the potential for non-additive effects.","Medel, Rodrigo; Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Casilla 653, Santiago, Chile",,,"GONZALES, WILFREDO/0000-0002-8885-5972",4,60,,54,4,4,,,"Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",1385-0237,1573-5052,10.1007/s11258-013-0195-9,,"Reproductive System (Reproduction); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 16504, Reproductive system - Physiology and biochemistry; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation; 51512, Plant physiology - Reproduction; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Apodiformes [85506]; [hummingbird] [Sephanoides sephaniodes; green-backed firecrown]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Hymenoptera [75326]; [ant]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Loranthaceae [26305]; [Tristerix aphyllus; leafless mistletoe; (seed)]",,,,,,,,"flower; reproductive system/floral tube; reproductive system","germination, fruit set, seed weight, pollinator behavior, nectar robbing, plant reproductive success",,,,2018/06/21

Water-based fire-fighting foam is a conditionally approved method of depopulating floor-reared gallinaceous poultry such as chickens and turkeys; however, ducks have physiological mechanisms that may make them more resistant to this method of depopulation. The following experiment was designed to assess the physiological responses of White Pekin ducks to nonterminal submersion in water-based foam compared with water. The hypothesis of this experiment was that submersion of ducks in water or water-based foam would trigger the diving reflex and lead to bradycardia. All treatments led to pronounced bradycardia. Heart rate was not significantly different between treatments during the final 30 s of the 60-s treatment period. Heart rate dropped significantly faster for the water dip and foam dip treatments and rose significantly faster than the foam pour treatment after the termination of the 60-s treatment period. Duration of bradycardia approached significance for the foam pour treatment, leading to a longer duration of bradycardia compared with the water pour, water dip, and foam dip treatments. The results of this experiment demonstrated that apnea and bradycardia as a result of the diving reflex can occur as a result of submersion in foam, which may have an impact on the time it takes White Pekin ducks to reach unconsciousness and death during water-based foam depopulation.","Benson, E.

These declines may be in part related to contemporary reductions in small-scale forest interior disturbances such as fire, windthrow, and treefalls. To mitigate the negative impacts of disturbance alteration and suppression on some late-successional species, strategies that emulate natural disturbance regimes are often advocated, but large-scale evaluations of these practices are rare. Here, we assessed the consequences of experimental disturbance (using partial timber harvest) on a severely declining late-successional species, the cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea), across the core of its breeding range in the Appalachian Mountains. We measured numerical (density), physiological (body condition), and demographic (age structure and reproduction) responses to three levels of disturbance and explored the potential impacts of disturbance on source-sink dynamics. Breeding densities of warblers increased one to four years after all canopy disturbances (vs. controls) and males occupying territories on treatment plots were in better condition than those on control plots. However, these beneficial effects of disturbance did not correspond to improvements in reproduction; nest success was lower on all treatment plots than on control plots in the southern region and marginally lower on light disturbance plots in the northern region. Our data suggest that only habitats in the southern region acted as sources, and interior disturbances in this region have the potential to create ecological traps at a local scale, but sources when viewed at broader scales. Thus, cerulean warblers would likely benefit from management that strikes a landscape-level balance between emulating natural disturbances in order to attract individuals into areas where current structure is inappropriate, and limiting anthropogenic disturbance in forests that already possess appropriate structural attributes in order to maintain maximum productivity.","Boves, Than J.; Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources and Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",,"Rodewald, Amanda/I-6308-2016","Rodewald, Amanda/0000-0002-6719-6306",2,86,,85,7,7,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry; Biodiversity & Conservation",1932-6203,1932-6203,10.1371/journal.pone.0052107,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Forestry; Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 53500, Forestry and forest products; 62800, Animal distribution","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Setophaga cerulea; cerulean warbler; (protected species; male)]",,,,,"Appalachian Mountains; USA, North America; Nearctic region",,,,"species habitat, timber harvest, reproductive performance, breeding density, anthropogenic disturbance, species conservation, species management, forest area, physiological disturbance, source-sink dynamics, emulating natural disturbance, ecological trap, population model, canopy disturbance, light disturbance, numerical disturbance, demographic disturbance",gold,,,2018/06/21

Those remaining are problematic to manage, with modified water regimes, invasive weeds and grazing by livestock. Before settlement, wetland habitats supported diverse avian herbivores, the majority of which are now extinct. However, introduced birds are increasing in wetlands. We sought to understand the role of grazing birds in the maintenance of local turf communities in a lacustrine environment in Otago, New Zealand. To determine the causes of the vegetation patterns, we investigated the influence of abiotic (water table and soil nutrients) and biotic (direct via grazing and indirect via faeces deposition) effects of the birds on the vegetation. Four plant communities were distinguished, two dominated by Leptinella and two by Carex species. The occurrence of the communities was correlated with the distance from the nearest permanent water, soil phosphorus levels, and amount of faecal deposition. The results indicate that avian grazing decreased the proportion of dominant exotic plant species by biomass removal, but not through enhanced nutrient inputs via faecal deposition. Results from this site suggest that naturalised geese facilitate the maintenance of indigenous plant species in the face of exotic invasion, and have a conservation role in highly modified wetland systems, perhaps restoring a herbivore function lost with the extinction of native avian grazers. The long-term conservation management of wetlands in New Zealand may require the utilisation of both native and introduced avian grazers to facilitate the dominance of indigenous plants.","Korsten, Annika C.; Univ Otago, Dept Bot, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand",,,,0,17,,34,5,5,,,"Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0110-6465,1177-7788,,,"Soil Science; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Biodiversity; Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 14004, Digestive system - Physiology and biochemistry; 52801, Soil science - General and methods","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Anseriformes [85504]; [goose]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Compositae [25840]; [Leptinella]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Cyperaceae [25280]; [Carex; sedge]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [turfgrass; (protected species)]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human]/Plantae; Plants, Vascular Plants; Tracheophyta [22000]; [weed]",,"phosphorus; (nutrient)",,,"South Island; New Zealand; Australasian region/Otago; New Zealand; Australasian region/Waihola; New Zealand; Australasian region",,,"feces; digestive system","species habitat, water level, soil sample, exotic invasion, vegetation pattern, species assemblage, wetland restoration, species conservation, wetland ecosystem, species extinction, agricultural development, biomass removal, abiotic effect, biotic effect, lacustrine wetland, grazing process, soil seed bank composition, fire exposure, herbivore function, turf community",,,,2018/06/21

Diagnosis is usually achieved by detailed history and ruling out other causes through evaluation of CBC and biochemical profile. Prolonged crack-cocaine misuse could cause digit or nail lesions in humans. In this report similar clinical manifestations in two African gray parrots owned by crack-cocaine addicted users have been reported.Cases: Two African gray parrots were referred with pruritic foot, discoloration of digits, black and brown patching of the scales on the feet and legs associated with soft tissue swelling. Gross necrosis and self mutilation were also observed. According to the history, both birds had been suffering from the lesions for the past few weeks. A detailed history was obtained for each patient, including environmental condition and their main diet was nuts and fruits. Common causes were ruled out through evaluation of CBC and biochemical profile. Based on gross characteristics and distribution of lesions, foot necrosis was diagnosed. Husbandry recommendations were given and antibiotics were prescribed to prevent possible infections. However, no improvements were seen, following the prescribed medication. Also deterioration of the clinical signs and feet lesions were observed. Typical finger tips showed gangrenous necrosis and very severe dark discoloration. After scrutiny in history taking, and visit of the owner's residence, it was evident that the birds have been exposed to the owner's crack-cocaine smoking area for at least two years. One of the owners accepted the recommendation of amputation of the affected digits and changing either the owner or environment. Follow-up showed no further lesion progression.Discussion: This clinical report presents two cases of parrots exposed to long term crack-cocaine smoke released to the environment. Generally speaking pet birds such as African gray parrots, used to share in many social activities with their owners, and such a behavior makes them more vulnerable to develop lesions in polluted environment. The history of both patients did not show any exposure to external or internal irritant of epithelial tissues except that they were continuously in close contact with crack-cocaine smoke. Clinical manifestations of both cases were similar in the first visit and follow-up clinical examination. So, according to the history and physical examination finding and ruling out other possibilities, it is assumed that foot necrosis may occur following long-term exposure of a bird in a crack-heroin-polluted area. Skin lesions such as burns and blackened hyperkeratosis on hands or digits of human associated with the use of crack have been reported before. Vasoconstriction (due to cocaine exposure) would be able to cause persistent hypoxia at the periphery. Another possible reason for these signs is acute peripheral arterial thrombosis associated with cocaine. Cocaine has also been associated with small vessel vasculitis. It is therefore postulated that, prolonged habitual use of crack-cocaine by parrot owners may result in visible digital changes (caused by multiple prolonged episodes of vasoconstriction, peripheral arterial thrombosis, hypoxia and ischemia) in parrots and could be one of the reasons for foot necrosis.","Hasiri, Mohammad Abbaszadeh; Shiraz Univ, Dept Clin Studies, Sch Vet Med, Shiraz 71345, Iran",,,,0,9,,12,0,0,,,"Toxicology; Dermatology; Veterinary Sciences",1678-0345,1679-9216,,,"Toxicology; Integumentary System (Chemical Coordination and Homeostasis); Veterinary Medicine (Medical Sciences)","12502, Pathology - General; 12504, Pathology - Diagnostic; 12512, Pathology - Therapy; 14508, Cardiovascular system - Blood vessel pathology; 18504, Integumentary system - Physiology and biochemistry; 18506, Integumentary system - Pathology; 22501, Toxicology - General and methods ; 22508, Toxicology - Veterinary; 38002, Veterinary science - General and methods; 38004, Veterinary science - Pathology","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Psittaciformes [85558]; [African gray parrot]","small vessel vasculitis; Vasculitis (MeSH); vascular disease/parrot foot necrosis; integumentary system disease; drug therapy, symptom, diagnosis, etiology, pathology","crack-cocaine; (toxin)",,,,,,leg/feet,"environmental condition, biochemical profile, polluted environment, fruit based diet, nut based diet, gross characteristics",,,,2018/06/21

Recently, this species has become increasingly challenged by Cronartium ribicola (white pine blister rust). This review examines literature relevant to P. strobiformis taxonomy, environmental associations, community associations, stand dynamics, and fire and disturbance ecology in order to better inform the management of this understudied species. In its US range, P. strobiformis occurs in central and southern Arizona and New Mexico and western Texas and has been documented as far north as southwestern Colorado. In Mexico, it occurs in northeastern Sonora, western Chihuahua and Durango, northern Zacatecas, southern Coahuila and central Nuevo Leon. Although P. strobiformis is a relatively high-elevation species preferring mesic habitats, it occurs across a variety of aspects, slope positions, and elevations. It rarely dominates forest composition but is most often found in complex species mixtures. While located in mixed-conifer habitats at the northern end of its range, it is associated with more diverse forest communities in the southern part of its range. Studies generally indicate P. strobiformis is a mid-seral species, although its low abundance and broad environmental amplitude complicate classification. Regeneration ecology is poorly understood, but bird and rodent seed dispersal do occur in portions of its range. Historical fire regimes in P. strobiformis mixed-conifer forests in the US were primarily characterized by frequent, low-severity surface fire, with less evidence of mixed- and high-severity fire. In Mexico, low-severity surface fire appears to have been ubiquitous within P. strobiformis habitats, with historical fire regimes still largely intact. Information is limited on the effects of disturbances other than fire. Increased temperatures and drought severity associated with climate change could potentially shrink the distribution of P. strobiformis, while altering its dominance in future forest communities. Future research on the ecology and management of P. strobiformis is necessary to effectively manage this species given climate change and white pine blister rust selection pressure.

The breeding biology of the Fire-eyed Diucon (Xolmis pyrope) was studied in a private reserve in central Chile. Its breeding season extended from late September to late December, with a peak in October. The nest is typically cup-shaped, and bulky built with sticks, a midthick layer of mosses and, lining was primarily made with soft vegetable items and mammalian hair depending on availability, e.g., horse or rabbit fur, and occasionally feathers of other bird species. Nests were placed at an average height of 2.2 m. Although there was no clear preference in nesting for native shrubs/trees, there was a slight tendency to prefer second growths of Acacia caven. Clutch size was two to four eggs, but primarily three eggs (66.6%), and most eggs (54.1%) were oval in shape. The eggs had as base color a matt to semi-glossy white with a large variability of markings, ranging from almost no marks to a several irregular dots or blotches, reddish to reddish brown, sometimes forming wreathed or capped patterns. It is not certain if one or both adults incubate. The average incubation period was 18.0 days (17-19) and the nestlings departed from the nest between 13-15 days, the Ti, period was 7.3 days, and the growth constant was K = 0.602. On average, the body mass of nestlings at hatching was 3.3 g, and the maximum acquired was 31.8 g at 13 days of age. The observed nestling diet was mainly ground-dwelling insects indicating ground feeding of the parental birds.

Knowledge of fine-scale habitat requirements is important for predicting species occurrence and identifying suitable habitat for target species. Here we investigate the perplexing distribution of a riparian habitat specialist, the western subspecies of the purple-crowned fairy-wren (Malurus coronatus coronatus), in relation to fine-scale habitat associations and patterns of riparian degradation. Surveys of vegetation attributes, river structure and disturbance indicators that are likely to be causal determinants of the species occurrence were undertaken at 635 sites across 14 catchments. Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling demonstrated that the probability of purple-crowned fairy-wren occurrence increased with Pandanus aquaticus crown cover, shrub density and height of emergent trees, while riparian structure and signs of cattle were indirect predictors of occurrence. As our study area predominantly contained Pandanus type habitat, we failed to identify river grass as an important component of habitat. Predictions from a cross-validated model of purple-crowned fairy-wren occurrence suggested distribution is constrained by three factors: (i) low quality of local habitat within catchments where the species occurs; (ii) broad-scale reduction in habitat quality that has resulted in extinction of the species from parts of its range; and (iii) unmeasured variables that limit the exploitation of suitable habitat. The reliance of the species on dense shrubby understorey suggests conservation efforts should aim to maintain the complexity of understorey structure by managing fire and grazing intensity. Efforts to halt the continuing decline of riparian condition and maintain connectivity between areas of quality habitat will help to ensure persistence of riparian habitat specialists in northern Australia.","Skroblin, Anja; Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Evolut Ecol and Genet, Gould Bldg,116 Daley Rd, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",,,,3,55,,71,10,11,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",1442-9985,1442-9993,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02331.x,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 62800, Animal distribution","Artiodactyla, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Artiodactyls, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Bovidae [85715]; [cattle]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [grass]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Pandanaceae [25385]; [Pandanus aquaticus]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Malurus coronatus coronatus; purple-crowned fairywren]/Plantae; Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Spermatophyta [25000]; [tree]",,,,,"Australia; Australasian region",,"generalized linear mixed modeling; mathematical and computer techniques",,"habitat quality, species distribution, grazing intensity, shrub density, habitat requirement, forest fire management, vegetation disturbance, riparian degradation, river structure",,,,2018/06/21

In the Orkney Isles, where pole nesting is relatively common, most nests are actively removed before they can cause a fault. However, rebuilding often occurs. Although the electrical company routinely fits Firefly FF-type diverters (P&R Tech Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA) after nest removals to deter the crows from rebuilding, there has been no field test of the effectiveness of the Fireflies as a deterrent. In our study, carried out in Orkney in the Spring/Summer of 2009 and 2010, Fireflies were fitted at half of the sites from which nests were removed and not fitted at the other half of the sites. We found that crows were equally likely to rebuild at sites fitted with Fireflies as they were to rebuild at sites without Fireflies. However, rebuilding was less likely to occur the later in the season that nests were removed, and nests in the middle phase of construction were the most likely to be rebuilt. Therefore, making an appropriate decision as to when to remove a crow nest seems to be a more effective method for deterring nest rebuilding than is the fitting of Firefly diverters.

We study here the usefulness of a general-purpose monitoring programme for the calibration of hybrid SDMs. As a benchmark case, we take the calibration with data from a monitoring programme that specifically surveys those areas where environmental changes expected to be relevant occur. Location Catalonia, north-east of Spain. Methods We modelled the distribution changes of twelve open-habitat bird species in landscapes whose dynamics are driven by fire and forest regeneration. We developed hybrid SDMs combining correlative habitat suitability with mechanistic occupancy models. We used observations from two monitoring programmes to provide maximum-likelihood estimates for spread parameters: a common breeding bird survey (CBS) and a programme specifically designed to monitor bird communities within areas affected by wildfires (DINDIS). Results Both calibration with CBS and DINDIS data yielded sound spread parameter estimates and range dynamics that suggested dispersal limitations. However, compared to calibration with DINDIS data, calibration with CBS data leads to biased estimates of spread distance for seven species and to a higher degree of uncertainty in predicted range dynamics for six species. Main conclusions We have shown that available monitoring data can be used in the calibration of the mechanistic component of hybrid SDMs. However, if the dynamics of the target species occur within areas not well covered, general-purpose monitoring data can lead to biased and inaccurate parameter estimates. To determine the potential usefulness of a given monitoring data set for the calibration of the mechanistic component of a hybrid SDM, we recommend quantifying the number of surveyed sites that are predicted to undergo habitat suitability changes.","De Caceres, Miquel; CTFC, Ctra St Llorenc,de Morunys Km 2, E-25280 Solsona, Catalonia, Spain",,"Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009; De Caceres, Miquel/I-1279-2016","Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457; De Caceres, Miquel/0000-0001-7132-2080",0,33,,53,8,8,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mathematical & Computational Biology",1366-9516,1472-4642,10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00899.x,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Models and Simulations (Computational Biology)","04500, Mathematical biology and statistical methods; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 10515, Biophysics - Biocybernetics; 62800, Animal distribution","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird]",,,,,"Catalonia; Spain, Europe; Palearctic region",,"hybrid species distribution model; SDM; mathematical and computer techniques/mechanistic occupancy model; mathematical and computer techniques/common breeding bird survey; mathematical and computer techniques",,"population dynamics, species habitat, environmental change, forest regeneration, general-purpose monitoring program, DINDIS program",,,,2018/06/21

These fires also cause a proliferation of invasive plant species, especially the Himalayan yellow raspberry Rubus ellipticus. We surveyed the Yellow-throated Apalis in 41 forest patches during the breeding season. The apalises favoured forest edge habitat, occurring in forest patches as small as 0.01 ha. Their occurrence was positively correlated with the presence of R. ellipticus, although this relationship may be driven primarily by canopy architecture and the existence of an understorey shrub layer. At a conservative estimate, 7,900 Yellow-throated Apalises were calculated to be present in cedar forest habitat alone on Mount Mulanje. Given that the birds occurred in other native forests at the same altitude at densities of 8.6-10.9 birds ha(-1), the true population size on Mount Mulanje alone is likely to approach or even exceed IUCN's most optimistic estimate of the global population (10,000).","Hockey, Philip A.

Analysis of nine micro-satellite loci revealed that, while a decline in census was observed during the bottleneck, there was no observed excess of heterozygosity or evidence of a decline in allelic richness, two characteristic bottleneck signatures.

We conducted the first assessment of the ecological impacts of these wildfires in 2008, sampling forest structure and biodiversity along twelve 500 m transects in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, Acre, Brazil. Six transects were placed in unburned forests and six were in forests that burned during a series of forest fires that occurred from August to October 2005. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) calculations, based on Landsat reflectance data, indicate that all transects were similar prior to the fires. We sampled understorey and canopy vegetation, birds using both mist nets and point counts, coprophagous dung beetles and the leaf-litter ant fauna. Fire had limited influence upon either faunal or floral species richness or community structure responses, and stems <10 cm DBH were the only group to show highly significant (p = 0.001) community turnover in burned forests. Mean aboveground live biomass was statistically indistinguishable in the unburned and burned plots, although there was a significant increase in the total abundance of dead stems in burned plots. Comparisons with previous studies suggest that wildfires had much less effect upon forest structure and biodiversity in these south-western Amazonian forests than in central and eastern Amazonia, where most fire research has been undertaken to date. We discuss potential reasons for the apparent greater resilience of our study plots to wildfire, examining the role of fire intensity, bamboo dominance, background rates of disturbance, landscape and soil conditions.","Barlow, Jos; Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, Lancs, UK",,"Barlow, Jos/E-7861-2014; Cochrane, Mark/A-1735-2018; Louzada, Julio/F-1265-2010; Vaz-de-Mello, Fernando/A-1023-2009","Cochrane, Mark/0000-0002-4573-568X; Louzada, Julio/0000-0002-1481-3112; Vaz-de-Mello, Fernando/0000-0001-9697-320X",1,60,,61,19,22,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry; Biodiversity & Conservation",1932-6203,,10.1371/journal.pone.0033373,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Forestry; Biodiversity","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 53500, Forestry and forest products; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Coleoptera [75304]; [beetle]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [Guadua weberbaueri] [Guadua sarcocarpa; bamboo]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Hymenoptera [75326]; [ant]",,,,,"Amazon; South America; Neotropical region/Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve; Brazil, South America; Neotropical region",,"normalized burn ratio calculation; mathematical and computer techniques",,"species richness, ecological impact, forest structure, species biodiversity, soil condition, above-ground biomass, fire intensity, canopy vegetation, burned forest, unburned forest, drought-related mortality, dead stem abundance",gold,,,2018/06/21

Partial nest depredation occurs when predators attack but leave some eggs intact. Using continuous video monitoring, we documented a total of 372 initial predation events at nests of Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). From these, we observed a sample of partial nest predation events (n = 47). Partial predation events resulted in three outcomes: (1) The nest failed due to parental abandonment; (2) adult stayed with the nest, but clutch failed to hatch, usually due to further predation events; or (3) adult stayed with nest and the remaining eggs hatched, adding to the reproductive fitness of the adult. Most common predators causing partial depredations were ratsnakes (Pantherophis alleghaniensis and P. guttatus), kingsnakes (Lampropeltis getula), and fire ants (Solenopsis spp.). We used logistic regression and model selection methods to assess six cues that parents may use to determine the value of remaining offspring and resulting abandonment decision. Overall, nests with fewer eggs remaining after the predation event or those predated early in the incubation period were more likely to be abandoned; juveniles appeared more likely to abandon than adults. Future studies will be needed to confirm our findings of the relationships between cues and abandonment decisions, and video surveillance systems will be a necessary component of these studies.","Ellis-Felege, Susan N.; Univ N Dakota, Dept Biol, 10 Cornell St,Stop 9019, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA",,,,1,6,,34,1,1,"COOPER ORNITHOLIGICAL SOCIETY, WESTERN FDN VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY 439 CALLE SAN PABLO, CAMARILLO, CA 93010 USA","WESTERN FDN VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY 439 CALLE SAN PABLO, CAMARILLO, CA 93010 USA","Environmental Sciences & Ecology",,,,"978-0-520-27313-9(H); 978-0-520-95409-0(P)","Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]; [Colinus virginianus; northern bobwhite; (egg, immature, mature)]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Hymenoptera [75326]; [Solenopsis; fire ant]/Reptilia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Reptiles, Vertebrates; Serpentes [85410]; [Pantherophis guttatus] [Lampropeltis getula; king snake] [Pantherophis alleghaniensis; rat snake]",,,,,,,"logistic regression; mathematical and computer techniques/model selection method; mathematical and computer techniques/continuous video monitoring; applied and field techniques",,"reproductive fitness, hatching process, nest predation event, partial depredation, parental abandonment, abandonment decision",,,,2018/06/21

Using vegetation data derived from satellite imagery, we modeled habitat suitability by using a maximum entropy model. We used Maxent software to compute habitat suitability scores from vegetation and physiographic attributes based on comparisons of conditions at 342 sites that were occupied by marbled murrelets (equal numbers of confirmed nest sites and likely nest sites) and average conditions over all forested lands in which the murrelets occurred. We estimated 3.8 million acres of higher suitability nesting habitat over all lands in the murrelet's range in Washington, Oregon, and California at the start of the Plan (1994/96). Most (89 percent) baseline habitat on federally administered lands occurred within reserved-land allocations. A substantial amount (36 percent) of baseline habitat occurred on nonfederal lands. Over all lands, we observed a net loss of about 7 percent of higher suitability potential nesting habitat from the baseline period to 2006/07. If we focus on losses and ignore gains, we estimate a loss of about 13 percent of the higher suitability habitat present at baseline, over this same period. Fire has been the major cause of loss of nesting habitat on federal lands since the Plan was implemented; timber harvest is the primary cause of loss on nonfederal lands. We also found that murrelet population size is strongly and positively correlated with amount or nesting habitat, suggesting that conservation of remaining nesting habitat and restoration of currently unsuitable habitat is key to murrelet recovery.","Raphael, Martin G.; US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific NW Res Stn, 3625 93rd Ave SW, Olympia, WA 98512 USA",,,,0,2,,80,0,0,,,"Mathematical & Computational Biology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0887-4840,,,,"Models and Simulations (Computational Biology); Conservation; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 04500, Mathematical biology and statistical methods; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 10515, Biophysics - Biocybernetics","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Charadriiformes [85518]; [Brachyramphus marmoratus; marbled murrelet]",,,,,"California; USA, North America; Nearctic region/Oregon; USA, North America; Nearctic region/Washington; USA, North America; Nearctic region",,"modeling; mathematical and computer techniques",,"habitat change, habitat characteristics, vegetation disturbance, habitat monitoring, nesting habitat conservation, fragmented patch",,,,2018/06/21

Mandatory hygiene measures were taken, including the control of animal reservoirs. It has been postulated that brown rats, through their commensal nature, form an important factor in the persistent dissemination of endemic circulating Coxiella burnetii in nature to domestic animals, livestock and humans. Here, the occurrence of C. burnetii in rats captured at different types of location during the Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands, viz, urban areas, nature areas and various types of farm has been determined. This is a first step towards the elucidation of the reservoir status of rats in veterinary and human Q fever epidemiology. C. burnetii DNA was detected in the spleen of 4.9% of the brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and 3.0% of the black rats (Rattus rattus). Evidence for C. burnetii infection was also found in liver, kidney, lung and intestinal tissue but not in heart, brain and pancreas. C. burnetii IgGs were detected in 15.8% of the brown rats. Positive rats were collected at goat, pig, cattle and poultry farms, and urban locations; including locations outside the designated 5 km ""increased-risk"" zones around bulk milk positive goat farms. The percentage of rat-positive locations was the highest for goat farms (50%) and cattle farms (14.3%). The presence of actively infected rats outside the lambing season and at multiple environmental settings including urban locations might suggest that rats are not merely a spill-over host due to infection by a contaminated environment but might represent true reservoirs, capable of independent maintenance of C. burnetii infection cycles and thereby contributing to spread and transmission of the pathogen. If frequent (re)introduction of C. burnetii to small ruminant farms can be caused by rats as maintenance reservoirs, mandatory wildlife control and lifelong vaccination of herds will be necessary.

We use two natural disturbances, fire and grazing, to examine the response of bird and arthropod communities in grasslands of Serengeti, Tanzania. Both burning and grazing by migrant ungulates take place at the end of the rains in June-July. We documented the communities before disturbance, then 1, 4 and 20 weeks after disturbance on three replicate plots and compared them with three undisturbed plots. Birds were recorded by observation, arthropods from pitfall, tray trap and sweepnet samples. We expected that as the grass biomass was reduced by either disturbance, bird communities would change with concomitant change in arthropod food abundance. Alternatively, bird communities would change not with the absolute amount of food but with the greater accessibility of food as the grass structure changed from long to short grass. Results showed first that both bird species richness and abundance increased after both types of disturbance, but burnt sites showed a greater increase than that for grazed sites. Second, there was a change in bird species composition with disturbance. The functionally equivalent athi short-toed lark (Calandrella athensis) was replaced by the red-capped lark (Calandrella cinerea). Third, the abundance of most groups of arthropods was lower on disturbed sites than those on undisturbed sites, and the reduction of arthropod numbers was greatest on burnt sites. These results imply that bird abundance did not occur through an increase in arthropod abundance but rather through a change in the grass structure making food more accessible; and the higher predation could have caused the lower arthropod abundance. In addition, some bird species replaced others thus functionally compensating for their loss.","Sinclair, A. R.

To improve our knowledge on these mechanisms, we examine cavity abundance, cavity occupation and reproductive performance of SCN in Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests subjected to two management systems: (i) dense ""young forests"", maintained at such stage by clear-cuttings and burns, and (ii) ""old forest"", subjected to extensive traditional grazing and scarce firewood extraction by selective cutting. Young forests had considerably lower density of cavities (1.29 +/- 0.71 vs 15.09 +/- 2.00 cavities ha(-1)). SCN species (0.18 +/- 0.11 vs 0.61 +/- 0.07 species ha(-1)) and nests (0.40 +/- 0.27 vs 2.67 +/- 0.25 nests of all SCN ha(-1)) than old forests, indicating that a low availability of cavities may limit SCN assemblages in young oak forests. However, reproductive parameters of great (Pants major) and blue (Cyanistes caeruleus) tits associated with the availability of food (laying date, clutch size, nestling number and weight, adult weight) did not differ between both forest types, suggesting that food supply was not reduced in young forests, at least for tits during the breeding season. Large diameter (up to 170 cm dbh) decayed trees were the most likely to hold cavities, but birds preferred smaller living cavity-trees for nesting (90% of nests in 21-65 cm dbh trees). The preservation of cavity-trees within traditionally managed old oak forests is crucial in providing nesting opportunities to SCN. Besides, the protection of these traditionally managed forests would also benefit to other forest organisms that depend on old and open oak forests. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This dynamic in species composition occurs across a large and geographically complex region. The elimination of fire has been postulated as the driver of this dynamic; however, some assumptions underlying this postulate have not been completely examined, and alternative hypotheses remain underexplored. Through literature review, and a series of new analyses, we examined underlying assumptions of the ""oak and fire"" hypothesis and explored a series of alternative hypotheses based on well-known ecosystem drivers: climate change, land-use change, the loss of foundation and keystone species, and dynamics in herbivore populations. We found that the oak-maple dynamic began during a shift in climate regime-from a time of frequent, severe, multi-year droughts to a period of increased moisture availability. Anthropogenic disturbance on the landscape changed markedly during this same time, from an era of Native American utilization, to a time characterized by low population densities, to Euro-American settlement and subsequent land transmogrification. During the initiation of the oak-maple dynamic, a foundation species, the American chestnut, was lost as a canopy tree across a broad range. Several important browsers and acorn predators had substantial population dynamics during this period, e.g. white-tailed deer populations grew substantially concurrent with increasing oak recruitment failure.

Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by next-generation sequencing technologies has caused the amount of sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly, and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory intensive. At the same time, large multicore computers have become commonplace in research facilities allowing for a new parallel computational paradigm.Results: We propose a new k-mer counting algorithm and associated implementation, called Jellyfish, which is fast and memory efficient. It is based on a multithreaded, lock-free hash table optimized for counting k-mers up to 31 bases in length. Due to their flexibility, suffix arrays have been the data structure of choice for solving many string problems.

We evaluated the influence of outcrops on the density of forest plants <= 60-cm tall, and the effects of other environmental variables and of site on plant density; we also used information on diaspore traits of the species to discuss the way in which plants disperse to the outcrops.Results: Rocky outcrops harbored a significantly higher density of forest plants than open fields, irrespective of site effect, and rock height was the best predictor for plant density on outcrops. Diaspores of all recorded species possess characteristics associated with dispersal by birds or mammals or by both.Conclusions: Small rocky outcrops markedly influence forest expansion by acting as perches for vertebrate dispersers and as nurse objects and safe sites for plants. Forest expansion starting in small outcrops possibly occurs as follows: perching of dispersers and increase of seed rain on rocks, promotion of better conditions of establishment for forest plants by nurse rocks, protection of plants sensitive to grazing and fire, and nucleation of forest vegetation.","Carlucci, Marcos B.; Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Ecol, CP 15007, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",,"Carlucci, Marcos/M-5381-2013; Pillar, Valerio/B-9872-2008; Duarte, Leandro/B-6552-2012","Carlucci, Marcos/0000-0002-5868-7090; Pillar, Valerio/0000-0001-6408-2891; Duarte, Leandro/0000-0003-1771-0407",1,27,,51,19,23,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry",1100-9233,,10.1111/j.1654-1103.2010.01229.x,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Forestry","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation; 53500, Forestry and forest products; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird]/Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [Araucaria; (seed)]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Mammalia [85700]; [mammal]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Orthoptera [75340]; [Camposacris]",,,,,"Brazil; South America; Neotropical region",,,,"grassland, environmental variable, forest vegetation, potential mechanism, nursing effect, perching effect, nurse rocks influence forest expansion, forest woody species density, different management regimes, grazing sensitive, fire sensitive",,,,2018/06/21

Numbers of resting Black-necked Grebes have increased since 1990, especially in some years (1996, 2005). Peak numbers occurred during migration from March to early May and late July to early October. The year 2011 was exceptional, as from June onwards numbers rose to 295 Black-necked Grebes on 30th July (moulting place), the highest number of this species ever recorded in Lower Saxony.In 2011, the species started to breed for the first time ever at lake Alfsee, without any breeding occurrence of gulls. Up to 52 occupied nests were present at the same time, performing the greatest colony in Lower Saxony ever. Nests were built mainly from mid June until early July on massive growing Western Waterweed Elodea nuttallii in the middle of the 210 ha lake, nearly 300-350 m off the waterline. The colony covered an area of 2-3 ha. By observation from distance, in total 91 breeding attempts were documented, of which 89 failed. Only two of the very early broods resulted in four fledged juveniles, i. e. breeding success was 0,08 juv./pair referring to the minimum breeding stock of 52 pairs. Losses were caused mainly by predation by a female Marsh Harrier. That bird flew into the colony on three of four evenings with special controls (3rd, 7th, 10th and July, but not 8th July). The Marsh Harrier visited up to three nests for feeding within 20 minutes each day. The Black-necked Grebes could not defend their broods against the raptor and escaped by diving immediately before the Marsh Harrier landed on the nest. The latest replacement clutch was registered at 20th July.The colony was potentially endangered due to surfing and sailing, but those activities mostly ceased early June because of the growing waterweed. To protect the grebe nests against pedal boating, the southern part of the lake (70 ha) was closed with a line of buoys. A replacement clutch 50-70 m nearby man made structures was destroyed by a swimmer (man or dog). After a professional firework in the night of 30th July (10:54-11:12 h p.m., sunset 9:23 h p.m.) directly beneath the northern part of lake Alfsee about 23 % of all Black-necked Grebes were missing the day after (including 11 of the former 15 first-year birds, which had arrived from elsewhere).","Flore, Bernd-Olaf; Gartlager Weg 54, D-49086 Osnabruck, Germany",,,,0,1,,50,1,1,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0042-7993,,,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Freshwater Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07514, Ecology: environmental biology - Limnology; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 62800, Animal distribution","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Charadriiformes [85518]; [gull]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Hydrocharitaceae [25315]; [Elodea nuttallii; western waterweed]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Podicipediformes [85554]; [Podiceps nigricollis; black-necked grebe; (immature)]",,,,,"Lower Saxony; Germany, Europe; Palearctic region/Alfsee lake; Germany, Europe; Palearctic region",,,,"species breeding, nest protection, endangered colony, species mass occurrence, species resting, pedal boating",,,,2018/06/21

Baseline data collected prior to the application of treatments allows accurate estimation of changes taking place on the experimental units, and random allocation of treatments ensures that relations between causes and effects can be established. This is critical to effective active adaptive management. In this paper, we outline the establishment phase of a new long-term ecological restoration experiment in south-eastern Australia, that will test ways of improving critically endangered box gum grassy woodlands for biodiversity.In the experimental design, treatments include the addition of 2000 tonnes of coarse woody debris, exclusion of kangaroos and fire. Random variation in biophysical variables occurs at several levels. To facilitate accurate estimation of key main effects, selected high order interactions are partially confounded with 'random' block terms. Response variables include: plants, birds, small mammals, reptiles and invertebrates. Analysis of baseline data across selected response variables confirmed no pre-treatment effects.The experiment provides a strong inferential framework for tracking the effects of restoration treatments on woodland biodiversity over coming years. It also provides a model for other similar experiments that integrate restoration and research. A newly constructed feral animal-proof fence, that will allow reintroduction of locally extinct species, including ecosystem engineers, will provide additional opportunities to research the woodland restoration process.

The negative effects of agricultural intensification and policies, use of pesticides, fertilisers and mechanised harvesting on several populations of pseudo-steppe birds have increasingly required more detailed and effective habitat suitability models. Distribution models of farmland species are prone to incur recordings of false absence data. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) allows identification of environmental predictors of species distribution by using presence data only.Aims. We quantified the diurnal habitat preferences and niche width of one steppe species, the stone curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus), with unfavourable conservations status in a Mediterranean area and reclassified a map with respect to habitat suitability classes according to the resulting distribution model.Methods. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis was used with GIS cartography customised with habitat and anthropogenic variables recorded during field surveys carried out in four study plots (similar to 500 ha) and at different spatial scales.Key results. The stone curlew selected areas with low vegetation cover, such as fields following artichoke harvesting and tillage, close to rural buildings and unpaved roads. In contrast, the stone curlew avoided areas with high vegetation cover and areas highly disturbed by human-induced fires. The occurrence of natural vegetation was neither preferred nor avoided. The most robust model was based on a large-scale analysis (200 m from the bird location points), according to which the optimal area for stone curlew distribution during its breeding season was restricted to 1% of the entire study area.Conclusions. Two uncorrelated factors, 'marginality' and 'tolerance', described the stone curlew's niche in the area. The first index indicated selection for habitats that were marginal with respect to those available in the area, whereas the second indicated a species with a medium-wide environmental niche. In particular, the stone curlew occupied a much more restricted niche (low tolerance) in relation to individual variables. The use of customised databases at a large scale of analysis was found to more effectively reveal ecological requirements of this marginal and specialised species.Implications. Our results allowed us to indicate practical land management actions for the stone curlew, such as prevention of human-induced fires and increase of pastoral activities. Our results indicated a potentially positive role of little-disturbed service roads along rural buildings in stone curlew distribution, which warrants further research. In addition, studies are needed to verify the presence of an ecological trap in artichoke fields, their preferred habitat. As we showed for the stone curlew, niche analyses conducted at a large scale using customised databases could greatly improve habitat suitability models of farmland species.","Campobello, Daniela; Univ Palermo, Dept Environm Biol and Biodivers, Via Archirafi, I-18123 Palermo, Italy",,"Sara, Maurizio/H-2662-2012","Sara, Maurizio/0000-0003-4274-422X; Campobello, Daniela/0000-0003-4094-9395",2,31,,85,8,8,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Biodiversity & Conservation",1035-3712,,10.1071/WR10185,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 62800, Animal distribution","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Charadriiformes [85518]; [Burhinus oedicnemus; stone curlew; (protected species)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Compositae [25840]; [artichoke]",,,,,"Mediterranean Region; Unclassified",,"Geographic Information System; applied and field techniques/ecological niche factor analysis; applied and field techniques",,"conservation status, breeding season, species distribution, tolerance, rural building, unpaved road, drastic population decline, diurnal habitat suitability, geoanthropogenic variable, low vegetation cover, artichoke harvesting, marginality",,,,2018/06/21

The DINDIS database results from the monitoring of bird communities occupying all areas affected by large wildfires in Catalonia since 2000. We used bird surveys conducted from 2006 to 2009 and performed a principal components analysis to describe two main gradients of variation in the composition of bird communities, which were used as descriptors of bird communities in subsequent analyses. We then analysed the relationships of these community descriptors with bioclimatic regions within Catalonia, time since fire and pre-fire vegetation (forest or shrubland). We have conducted I,918 bird surveys in 567 transects distributed in 56 burnt areas. Eight out of the twenty most common detected species have an unfavourable conservation status, most of them being associated to open-habitats. Both bird communities' descriptors had a strong regional component and were related to pre-fire vegetation, and to a lesser extent to the time since fire. We came to the conclusion that the responses of bird communities to wildfires are heterogeneous, complex and context dependent. Large-scale monitoring datasets, such as DINDIS, might allow identifying factors acting at different spatial and temporal scales that affect the dynamics of species and communities, giving additional information on the causes under general trends observed using other monitoring systems.","Zozaya, Elena L.; Forest Technol Ctr Catalonia, Biodivers Dept, Landscape Ecol Grp, Ctra St Llorenc de Morunys Port Comte Km 2, E-25280 Solsona, Spain",,"Pons, Pere/B-9472-2008; Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009","Pons, Pere/0000-0002-2196-5544; Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457; Clavero, Miguel/0000-0002-5186-0153; Rost, Josep/0000-0003-4053-5141",0,14,,33,7,8,,,"Mathematical & Computational Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0570-7358,,,,"Mathematical Biology (Computational Biology); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 04500, Mathematical biology and statistical methods; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird; (protected species)]",,,,,"Catalonia; Spain, Europe; Palearctic region",,"principal component analysis; mathematical and computer techniques/spatial dynamic scale; mathematical and computer techniques/temporal dynamic scale; mathematical and computer techniques",,"habitat configuration, species community, wildfire affected area, DINDIS database",,,,2018/06/21

In general, riparian zone management has focused on the production and maintenance of high quality aquatic habitat, including wood recruitment, sediment storage, and water quality, to benefit in-stream populations, primarily fish. However, the way in which different riparian management strategies influence the population dynamics of terrestrial wildlife is less well understood. I discuss 3 case studies to illustrate the difficulties in assessing population responses to management when temporal and spatial scales of research and management are not aligned: the responses of passerine birds to different buffer sizes, population changes in snag-dependent birds in response to intensive forest management, and occupancy dynamics of stream-associated amphibians. Numerous research results exist for these topics, but very few studies have uncovered causal mechanisms that describe the link between management actions and population responses. In part, these results may be attributed to research methods that were poorly suited to questions of interest, but also because sampling of local populations cannot capture dynamics that may influence regional populations. Also, I discuss how current management-characterized by uniform, localized disturbances, primarily harvest of individual stands-has been substituted for historic disturbances-such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires-that are characterized by patchy effects that occur over thousands of acres. Most riparian management strategies do not recognize the role of disturbance events that occur on larger scales, and instead focus on retaining small scale disturbances, such as debris flows, to provide in-stream habitat features. As implemented, current forest practices rules dictate novel landscape patterns and our research base is not prepared to address the consequences of these practices.","Kroll, A.

Logging implies an additional disturbance occurring shortly after fire, although its ecological effects can be somewhat mitigated by leaving wood debris on site. The composition of the bird community and its capacity to provide ecosystem services such as seed dispersal of fleshy-fruited plants have been shown to be affected by postfire logging. We assessed the effects of the habitat structure resulting from different postfire management practices on the bird community, in three burned pine forests in Catalonia (western Mediterranean). For this purpose, we focused on the group of species that is responsible for seed dispersal, a process which takes place primarily during the winter in the Mediterranean basin. In addition, we assessed microhabitat selection by seed disperser birds in such environments in relation to management practices. Our results showed a significant, positive relationship between the density of wood debris piles and the abundance of seed disperser birds. Furthermore, such piles were the preferred microhabitat of these species. This reveals an important effect of forest management on seed disperser birds, which is likely to affect the dynamics of bird-dependent seed dispersal. Thus, building wood debris piles can be a useful practice for the conservation of both the species and their ecosystem services, while also being compatible with timber harvesting.

There was no difference in production of grasses, forbs, or the juncus and other-Cyperaceae complex I year after burning. There was a significant difference in production of juncos and other Cyperaceae when years were compared. We presume this was caused by differences in precipitation between years. There was no difference in percentage frequency between burned and control plots 1 year after burning for most species examined. However, burning in summer significantly increased occurrences of coastal mistflower (Conoclinium betonicifolium), Fabaceae, and Cyperaceae (other than juncus) over control plots 1 year after treatment. Beach groundcherry (Physalis cinerascens) and Fabaceae also were increased by burning in summer 2 years following treatment. Prescribed burning did not affect density of vertical structure.

Intensive fire and grazing denude and homogenize vegetation whereas their suppression increases woody cover. Although habitat loss is implicated in grassland bird declines, degradation through intensive management or neglect also decreases breeding habitat and may reduce nesting success through increased rates of nest predation. Snakes are important nest predators, but little is known about how habitat use in snakes relates to predation risk for grassland birds nesting within tallgrass prairie subjected to different grazing and fire frequencies. We evaluated nest survival in the context of habitat used by nesting songbirds and two bird-eating snakes, the eastern yellowbelly racer Coluber constrictor flaviventris and Great Plains ratsnake Pantherophis emoryi. Daily nest survival rates decreased with increasing shrub cover and decreasing vegetation height, which characterize grasslands that have been neglected or intensively managed, respectively. Discriminant function analysis revealed that snake habitats were characterized by higher shrub cover, whereas successful nests were more likely to occur in areas with tall grass and forbs but reduced shrub cover. Because snakes often use shrub habitat, birds nesting in areas with increased shrub cover may be at higher risk of nest predation by snakes in addition to other predators known to use shrub habitat (e.g., mid-sized carnivores and avian predators). Depredated nests also occurred outside the discriminant space of the snakes, indicating that other predators (e.g., ground squirrels Spermophilus spp. and bullsnakes Pituophis catenifer) may be important in areas with denuded cover. Targeted removal of shrubs may increase nest success by minimizing the activity of nest predators attracted to shrub cover.","Klug, Page E.; Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Lab Landscape and Conservat Ecol, 116 Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",,"With, Kimberly/J-5124-2014","With, Kimberly/0000-0001-5570-1515; Klug, Page/0000-0002-0836-3901",2,51,,52,42,45,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0029-8549,1432-1939,10.1007/s00442-009-1549-9,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Anacardiaceae [25565]; [Rhus; sumac]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird]/Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [Juniperus virginiana; red cedar]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Cornaceae [25860]; [Cornus drummondii; dogwood]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [Panicum virgatum; switchgrass] [Sorghastrum nutans; Indian grass] [Andropogon gerardii; big bluestem] [Schizachyrium scoparium; little bluestem]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Rutaceae [26685]; [Zanthoxylum americanum; prickly ash]/Rodentia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Sciuridae [86405]; [Spermophilus; ground squirrel]/Reptilia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Reptiles, Vertebrates; Serpentes [85410]; [Pituophis catenifer; bullsnake] [Coluber constrictor flaviventris; eastern yellowbelly racer] [Pantherophis emoryi; Great Plains rat snake]/Plantae; Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Spermatophyta [25000]; [shrub]",,,,,,,,,"habitat loss, rangeland management, species conservation, breeding habitat, rangeland ecosystem, vegetation height, habitat usage, nest survival rate, nest predation risk",,,,2018/06/21

We recognized three functional bird types: seabirds, waterbirds, and landbirds (the latter separately treated as granivorous, insectivorous, carnivorous). The evidence shows that El Nino affects seabirds by reducing their food base. Seabirds feeding on fish, or fish plus squid, generally decrease their population abundance, as a combined result of adult mortality and reproductive failure. Omnivorous seabirds negotiate El Nino periods with modest declines, while those including fishery wastes in their diets show minimal changes during such periods. Waterbirds in the southeastern Pacific benefit from precipitation that accompanies El Nino, which enlarges their wetland habitats. Finally. landbirds are favored by El Nino-driven precipitation, which fires up primary productivity fuelling arthropod and mammal increases. Granivorous birds react promptly to peaks in seed output, while insectivores respond similarly to arthropod abundance. Carnivorous birds take somewhat longer to react to increases in mammal populations. We conclude that (a) Food shortage may be an important key factor for bird populations in the southeastern Pacific, but its effects depend on diet breadth, prey switching, and life history parameters. (b) Seasonal patterns of productivity determine distribution and abundance of resident birds, but variations imposed by occurrences of El Nino and La Nina phases determine the presence and abundance of migratory birds. (c) The dichotomy El Nino versus La Nina or versus 'normal' years is artificial and non conducive. (d) Long-term monitoring is needed to understand the connection between climate and birds.","Jaksic, Fabian M.; Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol and Biodivers, POB 114-D, Santiago, Chile",,,,0,8,,84,6,6,,,"Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0718-6932,0718-686X,,,"Climatology (Environmental Sciences); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Biodiversity","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07504, Ecology: environmental biology - Bioclimatology and biometeorology; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 64052, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Arthropoda: general","Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Invertebrates; Arthropoda [75000]; [arthropod]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [seabird] [waterbird] [landbird]",,,,,"Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean",,,,"food shortage, population abundance, resource availability, reproductive failure, seasonal patterns, El Nino-Southern Oscillation, prey switching, avian ecology",,,,2018/06/21

In 2004-2005, researchers initiated a project to investigate the feasibility and practicality of in-house composting of turkey mortalities (heavy hens and toms) as a method of disposal and disease containment. Occurrences of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) in West Virginia and Virginia in 2007 provided an opportunity for first responders to verify composting as an effective carcass disposal method. Many lessons learned from these experiences have led to improvements in the application of this technology. Market-weight turkeys, once thought too large for effective composting, were composted sufficiently for land application within 4 to 6 weeks. Additionally, fire-fighting foam, a new method of mass depopulation, proved to be compatible with composting. Knowledge gained from these incidents will be valuable not only for future responses to LPAI but also for outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza such as the H5N1 virus, which currently causes disease in both animals and humans in many parts of the world. Since three-quarters of all recent emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have arisen from animals, control of disease in animals is the principal way to reduce human exposure and prevent EIDs. Many of the general approaches and specific techniques used to eradicate the avian influenza virus can also be used to control other EIDs such as H1N1, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever, and plague.","Flory, Gary A.; Virginia Dept Environm Qual, Valley Reg Off, POB 3000, Harrisonburg, VA 22801 USA",,,,0,9,,8,7,9,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Infectious Diseases; Respiratory System; Veterinary Sciences",1084-2020,1930-6180,10.1093/ilar.51.2.149,,"Epidemiology (Population Studies); Infection; Respiratory System (Respiration); Veterinary Medicine (Medical Sciences)","14006, Digestive system - Pathology; 16004, Respiratory system - Physiology and biochemistry; 16006, Respiratory system - Pathology; 33502, Virology - General and methods; 36001, Medical and clinical microbiology - General and methods; 36002, Medical and clinical microbiology - Bacteriology; 36006, Medical and clinical microbiology - Virology; 37052, Public health: epidemiology - Communicable diseases; 37056, Public health: epidemiology - Miscellaneous; 38002, Veterinary science - General and methods; 38004, Veterinary science - Pathology; 38006, Veterinary science - Microbiology","Negative Sense ssRNA Viruses, Viruses, Microorganisms; Microorganisms, Negative Sense Single-Stranded RNA Viruses, Viruses; Bunyaviridae [03506]; [Rift Valley fever virus; (pathogen)]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]; [turkey; (host)]/Negative Sense ssRNA Viruses, Viruses, Microorganisms; Microorganisms, Negative Sense Single-Stranded RNA Viruses, Viruses; Orthomyxoviridae [03505]; [Avian influenza virus; (pathogen; H5N1)]/Negative Sense ssRNA Viruses, Viruses, Microorganisms; Microorganisms, Negative Sense Single-Stranded RNA Viruses, Viruses; Paramyxoviridae [03503]; [Nipah virus; (pathogen)]","plague; Plague (MeSH); bacterial disease/Rift Valley fever; digestive system disease, viral disease/influenza; Influenza (MeSH); respiratory system disease, viral disease; epidemiology/Nipah virus infection; viral disease/emerging infectious disease; EID; infectious disease",,,,"Virginia; USA, North America; Nearctic region/West Virginia; USA, North America; Nearctic region",,"carcass disposal method; applied and field techniques",,"disease containment, poultry carcass composting research, disposal containment",gold_or_bronze,,,2018/06/21

We quantified nest survival and identified nest predators of shrub-nesting songbirds within 4 large (approx. 40-ha) exclosures and 4 control sites within a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. During 2003-2006, we located and monitored 535 shrub nests (222 with videography) for 4,804 nest-days to quantify daily nest survival and document predation events. We found no support for a treatment effect, suggesting mesopredators had little impact on daily nest survival (0.9303 in controls and 0.9260 in exclosures) of shrub-nesting songbirds. For the 5 most commonly monitored species, daily nest survival within species was constant. Our analysis suggested that shrub nests were most vulnerable during the nestling stage and presence of cameras on nests increased survival with the increase in survival being more pronounced during the incubation stage. We filmed 107 nest predation events, identifying predators at 88 nests. Of these 88 nests, snakes caused 33%, red imported fire ants (hereafter fire ants, Solenopsis invicta) 28%, raptors 17%, corvids 8%, mesopredators 6%, and small mammals 8% of nest predations. Cause-specific nest predation in controls and exclosures did not differ from expectation, providing evidence that compensatory predation did not occur. Nest predators differed from expectation with regard to nest stage; fire ants and raptors only depredated nests during the nestling stage. Presence of cameras had no effect on nest abandonment. Fire ants were the most prevalent nest predator, and nest predation by fire ants was only observed on nestlings, potentially reducing likelihood of renesting. Magnitude and timing of fire ant predation suggests that fire ants may be the most influential nest predator of shrub-nesting birds within the longleaf pine ecosystem. Our data suggest that controlling mesopredators will have no effect on nest success of shrub-nesting birds within longleaf pine forests.","Conner, L.

We describe a single observation of an individual Bobwhite killed by a prescribed fire event. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of its kind in the scientific literature.

Extinction debt is the term used to describe the ongoing loss of species from fragmented landscapes long after the original loss and fragmentation of habitat. However, losses may also result from habitat changes that are unrelated to fragmentation, which reduce breeding success and recruitment. Many woodland birds have declined in fragmented landscapes in Australia, probably due to loss of small, isolated populations, though the ecological processes are poorly understood. We record the progressive regional loss of two ground-foraging, woodland birds, the Brown Treecreeper Climacteris picumnus and Hooded Robin Melanodryas cucullata, in northern New South Wales, over 30 years. This has happened despite most habitat loss occurring over 100 years ago, suggesting the payment of an extinction debt. Our observations suggest that several ecological processes, caused by habitat loss, fragmentation or degradation, and operating over different time scales, have led to both species' declines. Female Brown Treecreepers disperse poorly among vegetation remnants, leaving only males in isolated populations, which then go extinct. In contrast, Hooded Robins suffer high nest predation in fragmented landscapes, producing too few recruits to replace adult mortality. Foraging by both species may also be affected by regrowth of ground vegetation and shrubs. We found little support for a major role played by drought, climate change or aggressive Noisy Miners Manorina melanocephala. We propose that both extinction debt in the classical sense and ongoing habitat change frequently contribute to species' decline in modified landscapes. Management to arrest and reverse such declines needs to consider these multiple causes of decline. For instance, reconnecting isolated populations may be inadequate alone, and activities such as appropriate grazing, fires and the addition of woody debris may also be required.

Given its high abundance in recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time. Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success declined from 84% the first year after fire to 73% and 25%, respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests. Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests. Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature and overmature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated species.

Its habitat, Corsican pine Pinus nigra laricio forest, is currently restricted to less than 16,000 ha and is threatened by forest fires. In this article, we aim (1) to evaluate the effects of a large wildfire on a Nuthatch population, and (2) to identify the habitat features that influence the presence/absence of the Nuthatch after fire, so as to promote appropriate forestry practices after fire. The study has been conducted on a study plot of 300 ha which is part of a larger area severely burnt in August 2003. Habitat characteristics have been investigated on 39 plots of 1,225 m(2) occupied by the bird, and 22 randomly chosen plots without the Nuthatch. We observed a decrease of 37.5% in Nuthatch abundance the first spring after the fire, but the impact showed great local variation as a function of fire severity. Logistic modelling showed that the presence of Nuthatch mainly depended on the degree of crown alteration: the Nuthatch tended to be present when at least one pine had less than 2.5 m of crown burned. We have no evidence of any direct fire-induced mortality, but several effects of fire can explain this population decrease, namely, the reduction of canopy volume, the decrease of the amount of pine seeds, and the reduction of nest-site availability. These results permit us to propose a simple criterion that can help in choosing the plots to be cut where salvage logging is necessary.","Prodon, Roger; CNRS CEFE, UMR 5175, Ecol and Biogeog Vertebres Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France",,,,0,5,,49,8,8,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0021-8375,1439-0361,10.1007/s10336-009-0379-1,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation; 62800, Animal distribution","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Betulaceae [25645]; [Betula betula; birch; (seed)]/Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [Pinus nigra; Corsican pine; (seed)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Fagaceae [26070]; [Quercus ilex; holm oak; (seed)]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Sitta whiteheadi; Corsican nuthatch]",,,,,"Corsica; France, Europe; Palearctic region",,,,"species abundance, population decline, habitat selection, habitat feature, nest-site availability, salvage logging, forest fire severity, fire-induced mortality rate, canopy volume reduction",,,,2018/06/21

Habitat transects extending outward from its core range revealed massive and rapid bush encroachment, corroborating information from semi-structured interviews.

Reciprocal feedback between management and ecology can cause complex system behaviour. Therefore, better predictions about how external policy-drivers or climate change will affect semi-natural ecosystems may be made when both the ecological and human dimensions are considered.We develop a spatially-explicit model of moorland vegetation dynamics and management decisions about sheep grazing and heather burning in the Peak District National Park, UK. Competition between dwarf shrubs, bracken and graminoids is mediated by grazing, dwarf shrub age (determined by burning rotation) and environmental gradients. Management decisions depend on vegetation cover in a model parameterized through interviews with upland managers.Current management regimes are designed to reverse historical dwarf shrub losses, and simulations suggest that this reversal should occur in the future. After equilibration, grazing densities fall and dwarf shrubs have expanded from their current distribution, mainly at the expense of graminoids. This causes more land to come under managed burning, but current intensities are maintained.Enforcing winter or summer grazing densities influences model vegetation cover and causes other aspects of the management strategy to adapt. For example, when summer grazing is banned, dwarf shrub cover increases and there is a shift towards grouse moor management.Simulations with warmer temperatures indicate that climate change may increase bracken invasion of the moorland and prevent re-vegetation of bare peat. This is associated with a reduction in managed burning that causes the dwarf shrub community to become dominated by the older, degenerate growth phase.Synthesis and applications. Our model suggests that current management paradigms could achieve their aim of restoring historically degraded moorland over the coming century, but that climate change may prevent this from occurring. One application of the model would be to try to design management paradigms that are robust to this. As such, models of coupled human-natural systems can provide a valuable tool for assessing the impacts of policy decisions and climate change on semi-natural ecosystems at landscape scales.","Chapman, Daniel S.; Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, UK",,"Bonn, Aletta/A-2164-2013; Chapman, Daniel/C-2900-2008; Bonn, Aletta/N-6809-2015; Fraser, Evan/F-7967-2011","Chapman, Daniel/0000-0003-1836-4112; Bonn, Aletta/0000-0002-8345-4600; Quinn, Claire/0000-0002-2085-0446; Hubacek, Klaus/0000-0003-2561-6090; Reed, Mark/0000-0002-8958-8474",4,36,,31,18,22,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0021-8901,1365-2664,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01618.x,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Models and Simulations (Computational Biology); Conservation","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 04500, Mathematical biology and statistical methods; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 10515, Biophysics - Biocybernetics","Artiodactyla, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Artiodactyls, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Bovidae [85715]; [sheep]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Ericaceae [26035]; [Calluna vulgaris; heather]/Pteridophyta, Plantae; Plants, Pteridophytes, Vascular Plants; Filices [23100]; [Pteridium aquilinum] [bracken]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]; [grouse]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [Molinia caerulea]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human]/Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Monocotyledones [25202]; [graminoid]",,,,,"Peak District National Park; UK, Europe; Palearctic region",,"spatially-explicit model; mathematical and computer techniques",,"climate change, vegetation cover, sheep grazing, environmental gradient, upland vegetation, grazing density, system behavior, semi-natural ecosystem, moorland management, heather burning, burning rotation",gold_or_bronze,,,2018/06/21

Building several models that incorporate different potential causal factors is a useful way of formalising alternative hypotheses. We developed a series of models to test hypotheses about the factors influencing the distribution of a species of conservation importance - the hen harrier Circus cyaneus.A climate-based model using continental distribution data was consistent with the continental distribution and observational studies in Britain. According to the climate-model the parts of Britain occupied by the hen harrier are the least climatically suitable.Habitat-based models using detailed distribution data from seven Scottish areas explained the recent British distribution well, with birds largely confined to heather dominated areas. These patterns were inconsistent with historical data on the species' distribution, its habitat use in other parts of its range and with the climate-based model.Our burn intensity index of gamekeeper activity was highly correlated with climatic suitability within the best 25% of 10 km squares by modelled habitat suitability, negatively associated with the productivity data and associated with a decrease in abundances between 1998 and 2004. Gamekeeper activity may be keeping hen harriers out of the most climatically suitable areas with habitat similar to that which they currently occupy within Britain and or keeping the population numbers too low and isolated for the natural re-expansion of the species into parts of the range where it was historically extirpated.

Using GIS software, we integrated digital layers of ecogeographic variables with; (1) presence-only observations to derive and validate a habitat suitability model using ecological niche factor analysis, and (2) distance sampling to determine population distribution and densities across vegetation types. We detected populations in only five of seven reserves which they had occupied in 2000. We estimate the global population size to be 16,821 individuals (range 8431-39, 104), 68% greater than the previously estimated 10,000 individuals, with a single large reserve containing the majority (similar to 92%) of the global population. The Mallee Ernu-wren is a habitat specialist, primarily occurring in mallee-Triodia vegetation that has not been burnt for at least 15 years. The highest densities were in vegetation associations containing at least a 15% cover of Triodia, however, time since the habitat was last burnt was the overriding factor in determining densities. Large-scale wildfires are a pervasive threat: to the global status of the Mallee Emu-wren, and the risk to remaining populations is exacerbated by the adverse impact of prolonged drought and the potential for altered fire regimes caused by global warming. Evaluation of the global population status, and the continued wildfire threat warranted recent reclassification of the Mallee Emu-wren from Vulnerable to Endangered according to IUCN Red List categories and criteria.

Occurrence was recorded on 110 sites a year before, and for 3 years after a major unplanned fire in 2003. Although the Eastern Bristlebird is thought to be sensitive to wildfire, data indicated that the species either persisted continuously on burned sites or returned to previously occupied sites within 2 years. Post-fire site occupancy was associated with several factors: (1) pre-fire site occupancy; (2) vegetation type; (3) spatial heterogeneity in fire and the amount of unburned vegetation surrounding a site; and (4) site-level vegetation structure (e. g. diversity of understorey and midstorey plants). The most likely mechanism underpinning rapid re-occupancy was movement by resident birds to unburned parts elsewhere within their territories. The addition of intensive feral predator baiting within the present study suggests that predation may have a more important effect on populations after unplanned fires than formerly recognised. Our results have significant implications for fire management in areas where the Eastern Bristlebird occurs.

Field observations in the Pelican Cays in March 2007 revealed extensive clear-cutting of mangroves and covering of exposed peat surfaces with sediment dredged from the adjacent seafloor to create false sand cays. On Manatee Cay, introduction of dredge spoils taken from the nearby seabed resulted in fine sediment plumes spilling into the adjacent ponds, smothering the attached benthic communities on mangrove roots and burying Thalassia bottom communities. In addition, comparative studies of microalgal (phytoplankton) assemblages in a Manatee Cay pond before and after mangrove clearing indicate a dramatic loss in this group. This change, related to high turbidity observed in the water column, signals a serious impact to this aquatic ecosystem. In March 2007, clear-cutting, burning, and dredge and fill operations were taking place on Fisherman's Cay, with additional survey lines visible on Fisherman's, Manatee, and Cat Cays. We used a series of aerial photographic surveys from 2003 to 2007 to document the extensive loss of mangroves on both Manatee and Fisherman's Cays. To date, additional clearing of mangroves has occurred on Northeast Cay, Bird Cays, and Ridge Cay, resulting in a total of 15.3 ha or more than 29% of the mangrove community that have been destroyed in the Pelican Cays. Furthermore, several survey lines through still-forested areas on these islands indicated that additional clearing of mangroves was planned. The Pelican Cays ponds contain unique, biologically diverse ecosystems dominated by delicate sessile photosynthetic and filter feeding populations; these rare communities will be lost as a result of sediment suffocation caused by the clearing and filling of these islands. However, the conversion of mangrove ecosystems for residential, tourism, and commercial uses is both widespread and accelerating in Belize and throughout the global tropics. This pressure is having an adverse effect on the health of coral reefs and the biomass and viability of commercial fisheries, which are essential for both tourism and local livelihoods.","Macintyre, Ian G.; Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, POB 37012,MRC 125, Washington, DC 20013 USA",,,,0,3,,34,3,5,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Forestry; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology",0196-0768,1943-667X,,,"Conservation; Forestry; Marine Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07512, Ecology: environmental biology - Oceanography; 53500, Forestry and forest products","Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Hydrocharitaceae [25315]; [Thalassia]/Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Monocotyledones [25202]; [seagrass]/Algae, Plantae; Algae, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Pyrrophyta [14500]; [dinoflagellate]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Rhizophoraceae [26660]; [Rhizophora mangle; mangrove]",,,,,"Pelican cays; Belize, Central America; Neotropical region/Manatee Cay; Belize, Central America; Neotropical region",,"photographic survey; applied and field techniques",,"aquatic ecosystem, commercial development, sediment plume, Mangrove forest, peat surface, ecological loss, sediment suffocation, Southwater cay marine reserve",,,,2018/06/21

Every year many parts of the biome change from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and vice-versa. The degree of inundation creates a range of major habitats. Flooding occupies about 80% of the whole Pantanal. In contrast, during the dry season, most of the flooded areas stay dry, when the water returns to the river beds or evaporates. The Pantanal is a large continental savanna wetland (147,574km(2) in Brazil), touching Bolivia to the north and Paraguay to the south. The maze of fluctuating water levels, nutrients, and biota forms a dynamic ecosystem. The vegetation comprises 1,863 phanerogam plant species listed for the floodplain and 3,400 for the whole basin and 250 species of aquatic plants. The complex vegetation cover and seasonal productivity support a diverse and abundant fauna within the floodplain: 263 species of fish, 41 of amphibians, 113 of reptiles (177 for the basin), 463 of birds and 132 mammal species. Many endangered species occur, including jaguar (Panthera onca Linnaeus, 1758). Waterfowl are exceptionally abundant during the dry season. Analysis of the root causes of the threats to biodiversity indicated that deforestation (17% of the Pantanal and 63% of the Surrounding uplands) with modification and loss of natural habitats due to cattle ranching, unsustainable agriculture, mining environmental contamination (including mercury, pesticides, urban sewage), non organized tourism, fire, disturbances at the upstream region modifying hydrological flow, erosion, weak implementation and enforcement of legislation are the major issues to face conservation action and Sustainable use. Under an evolutionary focus, local biodiversity seems to be well adapted to seasonal shrinking and expansion Of natural habitats due to flooding.

Because most species of grassland birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines, especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an alternative grassland management practice known as patch-burning has been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296 dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures. Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides further evidence that this practice can he a useful tool for grassland bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation, patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g., trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects of grazing, which are not available under traditional management. Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains.","Churchwell, Roy T.; Univ Alaska, Dept Biol and Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA",,"Fuhlendorf, Samuel/A-2931-2011","Fuhlendorf, Samuel/0000-0002-8726-9402",0,23,,61,21,29,,,"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0022-541X,1937-2817,10.2193/2007-365,,"Methods and Techniques; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Conservation","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Molothrus ater; brown-headed cowbird; (parasite)] [Spiza americana; dickcissel]",,,,,"Great Plains; North America; Nearctic region/Oklahoma; USA, North America; Nearctic region/Prairie; Alabama, USA, North America; Nearctic region",,"patch-burning management; applied and field techniques/alternative grassland management practice; applied and field techniques",,"grassland, conservation, reproductive success, fledgling, heterogeneous landscape, nesting phenology, habitat-associated community, traditional rangeland management, nest success rate",,,,2018/06/21

It plays an important role in nutrient cycling and is an important food resource for many vertebrate species, especially migratory birds. We used data collected over a 16-year period to examine population dynamics of a tagged population of C. florida in a 6.4 ha area in the context of change in the protected Quercus-Carya forest of the Ross Biological Reserve, Indiana. We examined the hypothesis that forest dynamics result from interactions between long-term ecological succession and pathogens. The C. florida population at the Ross Reserve declined by 50% between 1983 and 2000, with a survivorship of 24%. Analysis of 40 years of forest survey data showed that Quercus and Carya populations declined in importance, while Acer saccharum increased dramatically. This change in forest structure is consistent with successional changes occurring throughout the Midwest and can be attributed to suppression of disturbance. Cornus florida declined more sharply where A. saccharum increased. From 1983 to 1999, C. florida were less likely to survive if they were within 5 m of a A. saccharum. Light measurements showed that A. saccharum abundance correlated negatively with light available to C. florida, suggesting that increased shading by A. saccharum contributed to C. florida decline. The fungus, Discula destructiva causes the disease dogwood anthracnose that is associated with widespread decline of C. florida in the eastern United States. Tests for this pathogen in our study area were mostly negative. Other tests revealed that Armillaria root rot infected most C. florida, but this disease seemed to be a secondary effect of shading by A. saccharum. These results suggest that the lack of fire and other anthropogenic disturbances has resulted in an accelerated shift in dominance from Quercus and Carya to A. saccharum in the main canopy, and this shift, in turn, has resulted in increased shading of C. florida and its decline in previously more open Midwestern forests.","Pierce, Aaron R.; Nicholls State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Thibodaux, LA 70310 USA",,,,1,20,,38,11,11,,,"Infectious Diseases; Forestry",1385-0237,1573-5052,10.1007/s11258-007-9297-6,,"Infection; Forestry","36001, Medical and clinical microbiology - General and methods; 53500, Forestry and forest products; 54502, Phytopathology - Diseases caused by fungi","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Aceraceae [25510]; [Acer saccharum]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Cornaceae [25860]; [Cornus florida; (host)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Fagaceae [26070]; [Quercus]/Fungi, Plantae; Fungi, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Fungi Imperfecti or Deuteromycetes [15500]; [Discula destructiva; (pathogen)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Juglandaceae [26215]; [Carya]","dogwood anthracnose; fungal disease, infectious disease; etiology",,,,,,,,"species abundance, forest structure, forest succession, ecological succession",,,,2018/06/21

Cunn. co-occur on lateritic soils in the jarrah forest of Western Australia, with their flowering seasons overlapping for several months during winter and spring. Both species are protandrous, with pollen presentation occurring 1-2 days before the stigmas of individual flowers become receptive. Peak receptivity, as indicated by maximum peroxidase secretion, coincides with the maximum opening of stigmatic grooves for D. sessilis or maximum elevation of the stigmatic papillae in G. wilsonii. Pollinators such as western wattlebirds, New Holland honeyeaters and western spinebills almost exclusively visit flowers or inflorescences at times when large amounts of nectar are present, andwhenself-pollen is available for transfer or stigmas are receptive to the deposition of pollen. By foraging in this manner, yet still moving frequently between plants and inflorescences, honeyeaters that visit D. sessilis should guarantee an effective spread of pollen. The overall level of fruiting success achieved by this species is considerably higher than that for G. wilsonii, a species whose flowers are visited much less often than those of D. sessilis. Allozyme analysis, artificial pollination experiments and the calculation of pollen : ovule ratios indicate that D. sessilis is essentially an obligate outcrosser, at least in locations where plant densities are high, whereas G. wilsonii has a mixed mating system that allows it to set fruits as a consequence of either selfing or outcrossing. Potential fruit-set is low for both species, with post-zygotic incompatibility mechanisms mediated by the availability of nutritional resources thought to be at least partly responsible for the even lower levels of final fruit-set. Total fruit and seed production by individual plants is much greater for D. sessilis than for G. wilsonii, and possibly a reflection of differences in the regeneration requirements of the two species after environmental disturbance such as fire.","Collins, Brian G.; Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Environm Biol, POB U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",,,,1,19,,48,3,3,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Developmental Biology; Reproductive Biology",0067-1924,,10.1071/BT07147,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Development; Reproductive System (Reproduction)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 10802, Enzymes - General and comparative studies: coenzymes; 16504, Reproductive system - Physiology and biochemistry; 25502, Development and Embryology - General and descriptive; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation; 51512, Plant physiology - Reproduction","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [honeyeater]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Proteaceae [26620]; [Dryandra sessilis] [Grevillea wilsonii]",,"nectar/peroxidase; (EC 1.11.1.7; secretion)",,,"Australia; Australasian region",,,"pollen; reproductive system/fruit; reproductive system/flower; reproductive system/stigma; reproductive system","breeding, floral development, environmental disturbance, postzygotic incompatibility mechanism",,,,2018/06/21

It was demonstrated that spatial distribution, numbers and nesting success of the Eurasian Curlew, (Numenius arquata) on farn-dands are primarily determined by intensity of landuse. Hatching success was increasing in a series of years 1997, 1999, 2005 from 32-97% due to improvement of protective characteristics of habitats on abandoned lands, as well as growth of the density of territorial pairs on considerably reduced area of mown meadows, a preferred nesting habitat. Abandonment of farmlands probably leads to decreased feeding activity of corvids, while density growth of Curlews facilitates effective nest protection by their communal agressive behaviour. Alterations of nesting habitats due to ploughing and growth of shrubs did not result in decrease of the species numbers, but caused changes in spatial distribution of territorial birds within the study plot. Catastrophic events in some years, like widespread grass fires (up to 43,5% of the area of nesting habitats burnt) did not result in changes of Curlew numbers or distribution, but markedly reduced total nesting success like in 2006 (49%, compared to 97% in 2005). This occures due to both decreased hatching success in nests affected by fire and low hatching success in replacement Clutches on burnt meadows (31,25%, n = 5) compared to clutches on unimpaired meadows (80516, n = 5).In years with late prolonged springs numbers of breeding pairs were increased from 10-15 to 26 32, the start of nesting was delayed by approximately 5 days (chi(2) = 14,45, p = 0,025) and egg-laying period was prolonged compared to phenologically normal and early seasons.","Sviridova, T.

(andy.porter@imperial.ac.uk)",,,,,,,,,"Cell Division",,2008,,3,,"Article No.: 3",3,,English,,,,,,"The cell cycle is tightly controlled to ensure that replication origins fire only once per cycle and that consecutive S-phases are separated by mitosis. When controls fail, DNA over-replication ensues: individual origins fire more than once per S-phase (re-replication) or consecutive S-phases occur without intervening mitoses (endoreduplication). In yeast the cell cycle is controlled by a single cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) that prevents origin licensing at times when it promotes origin firing, and that is inactivated, via proteolysis of its partner cyclin, as cells undergo mitosis. A quantitative model describes three levels of Cdk activity: low activity allows licensing, intermediate activity allows firing but prevents licensing, and high activity promotes mitosis. In higher eukaryotes the situation is complicated by the existence of additional proteins (geminin, Cul4-Ddb1(Cdt2), and Emi1) that control licensing. A current challenge is to understand how these various control mechanisms are co-ordinated and why the degree of redundancy between them is so variable. Here the experimental induction of DNA over-replication is reviewed in the context of the quantitative model of Cdk action. Endoreduplication is viewed as a consequence of procedures that cause Cdk activity to fall below the threshold required to prevent licensing, and re-replication as the result of procedures that increase that threshold value. This may help to explain why over-replication does not necessarily require reduced Cdk activity and how different mechanisms conspire to prevent over-replication. Further work is nevertheless required to determine exactly how losing just one licensing control mechanism often causes over-replication, and why this varies between cell systems.","Porter, Andrew C.

Trees can promote the establishment of bird-dispersed woody plant species in savannas by reducing dispersal limitation. Previous work in wet pine savannas has shown that densities of bird-dispersed shrubs are higher and species richness of herbaceous species, most of which are not bird-dispersed, is lower in areas near trees. To test the hypothesis that shrub seedling density in wet pine savannas was limited by dispersal and thus the availability of perches for seed-dispersing birds, seed traps and artificial perches were placed near and away from pines. To measure fire-induced mortality of trees and shrubs, Pinus elliottii juveniles and shrub seedlings that had emerged during a fire-free interval were quantified before and after fires. Trees provided perches for birds that dispersed shrubs, thereby reducing dispersal limitation of shrubs. Significantly more seeds of the shrubs, Ilex glabra and L vomitoria, were encountered in seed traps at the bases of P. elliottii than in areas away from trees in two consecutive years. Seedlings of woody species with fleshy fruits occurred more frequently at the bases of artificial perches than away from perches, and the effect of the perches on seedling density was greater away from trees. Eight- and nine-year periods without fire were not long enough for the majority (>99%) of post-fire recruits of P elliottii to grow large enough to survive growing-season fires. A small but greater fraction of shrub seedlings (10%) survived the fires. We argue that periodic fires are sufficient to preclude further invasion of wet pine savannas by P. elliottii, expansion of shrub thickets, and associated declines in plant diversity.","Hinman, Sarah; Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA",,,,1,16,,42,6,6,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0885-8608,,10.3375/0885-8608(2008)28[37:SSEILB]2.0.CO;2,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Aquifoliaceae [25585]; [Ilex glabra; (seedling)] [Ilex vomitoria; (seedling)]/Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [Pinus elliottii; (seedling)]",,,,,"Mississippi; USA, North America; Nearctic region",,,,"fire, dispersal, dispersal limitation, slow growth, shrub seedling establishment, wet pine Savannah",,,,2018/06/21

From 1989-2002, I studied the nest-site selection and reproductive success of Warbling Vireos across an elevational gradient in the southern Sierra Nevada. Warbling Vireos regularly nested in upland coniferous forests with few or no deciduous trees, and tree species used by nesting vireos included five species of conifers and four species of deciduous trees. Overall, hardwoods were used more than expected based on their availability, but 69% of all nests were in conifers. Hardwood trees were found only in low and mid-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed-conifer sites. In low-elevation ponderosa pine habitat, 87% of nests were in hardwoods, with 67% in California black oaks (Quercus kelloggii), a species that typically occupies upland sites. In mixed-conifer sites where reproductive success was high, 65% of nests were in incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) and California black oak was the next most commonly used species. Because fire suppression has likely increased numbers of shade-tolerant tree species like incense cedar, shade-intolerant species like black oaks may have been more important as a nest substrate for vireos in the past. Only conifers were used as nesting substrates at higher elevations. Nest success was greater for Warbling Vireos that nested in tall trees in areas with high basal area. My results suggest that Warbling Vireos in the Sierra Nevada would benefit from management activities that encourage retention and recruitment of California black oaks at lower elevations, and development of stands with large trees, dense foliage, and semi-open canopy throughout their elevation range.","Purcell, Kathryn L.; USDA, Forest Serv, Pacific SW Res Stn, Sierra Nevada Res Ctr, 2081 E Sierra Ave, Fresno, CA 93710 USA",,"Purcell, Kathryn/S-2592-2016",,0,5,,36,2,2,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0273-8570,,10.1111/j.1557-9263.2007.00107.x,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 62800, Animal distribution","Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [Pinus ponderosa; ponderosa pine] [conifer] [Calocedrus decurrens; incense cedar]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Fagaceae [26070]; [Quercus kelloggii; black oak]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Vireo gilvus; warbling vireos]",,,,,"Sierra Nevada; California, USA, North America; Nearctic region",,,,"reproductive success, nesting habitat, elevational gradient",,,,2018/06/21

We conducted mechanical treatments in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls. Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird species did not detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species richness, total bird density, and some species, including indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year delay; eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus) declined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions, and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the mechanical + burn treatment.

While PBDEs play a key role in reducing loss of human life and property from fires, these flame retardants have become pervasive organic contaminants in the environment and in the tissues of fish, birds, marine mammals, and humans. Levels of PBDEs in wildlife and humans continue to rise, raising concerns about potential ecological and health risks associated with exposure to these chemicals. Nevertheless, there is little currently known about the toxicological effects of PBDE exposure. Here, we examined the developmental toxicity of the PBDE congener 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE 47) using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an ontogenetic model. Zebrafish embryos were exposed continuously to dissolved phase PBDE 47 (100-5000 mu g/l) beginning 3-5 h post-fertilization (hpf). Fish treated with the highest concentrations of PBDE 47 delayed hatching, had reduced growth post-hatching, and displayed an abnormal dorsal curvature of the body with flexion at the hindbrain. By 96 h post-fertilization larvae exposed to PBDE 47 had significant tachycardia, which progressed into atrioventricular block arrhythmias. Microinjection of fluorescent dye into the hindbrain ventricle revealed that cerebrospinal fluid in the neural tube and brain ventricles flowed more slowly in fish larvae exposed to PBDE 47, a likely etiology for the dorsal curvature. Similar, though much less pronounced, developmental toxicity also occurred in larvae exposed to PBDE 47 only for a 20 h period during early embryogenesis (3-23 hpf), suggesting that PBDEs incorporated in lipid of the egg are bioavailable and cause toxicity later in life. Taken together, this work indicates that exposure to PBDE 47 can cause morphological abnormalities, impair cardiovascular function and cerebrospinal fluid flow, and provides a tractable starting point for using the zebrafish model to explore molecular mechanisms of PBDE toxicity.

We use an unplanned fire, which burned half of a long-term study plot, as a natural experiment to test the effects of fire on the federally endangered Cape Sable seaside sparrow in Everglades National Park. By implementing a before-after-controlimpact study design we determine the mechanistic link between fire and demography of this endangered sparrow. Our results show that while the sparrow tolerates fire, neither sparrow density nor nesting success are enhanced by fire, which runs contrary to the current paradigm in which sparrows are expected to benefit and therefore require fire for persistence. Our results caution against the assumption that occupancy of disturbance-prone habitat automatically suggests dependence on disturbance. Land managers must prevent large and frequent fires from burning occupied sparrow habitat to best manage for the species. Moreover, it is imperative that more studies focus on the effects of disturbance processes on rare and endangered species in order to prevent further loss of biodiversity. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, human activities that closely mimic the appearance but not the fundamental quality of natural habitats could attract animals to settle whether or not these habitats are suitable for their survival or reproduction. We examined habitat selection behavior and nest success of Olive-sided Flycatchers (Contopus cooperi) in a naturally occurring burned forest and an anthropogenically created habitat type-selectively harvested forest. Olive-sided Flycatcher density and nestling provisioning rates were greater in the selectively harvested landscape, whereas estimated nest success in selectively harvested forest was roughly half that found in naturally burned forest. Reduced nest success was probably a result of the relatively high abundance of nest predators found in the artificially disturbed forest. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that selectively harvested forest call act as an ""ecological trap"" by attracting Olive-sided Flycatchers to a relatively poor-quality habitat type.

Vegetation (floristic data and 22 habitat variables) and vertebrate fauna (birds. mammals, reptiles) were sampled in 29 standardized 50 x 50-m quadrats in the 2001 wet season. representing Four treatments: sites burnt recently (within 2 y) and grazed by cattle (4-8 ha per livestock unit): sites unburnt (last burnt > 2 y ago) and grazed: sites burnt recently and ungrazed: and unburn and ungrazed sites. Fire and grazing had a significant influence on vegetation: both grazing and fire reduced ground cover (fire in grazed sites 51-23%, tire in ungrazed sites 68-39%)) and increased the cover of forbs (8%, in burnt and grazed sites, 3%, if ungrazed) and tussock grasses (20%) in grazed and unburnt sites and 5%) when ungrazed). Grazing caused a shift in floristic composition from the perennial hummock grass Trioda pungens to tussock grasses (e.g. Aristida spp.. Enneapogon spp.), forbs (e.g. Phyllanthus spp.) and shrubs (e.g. Acacia spp.). Of the vertebrate groups, birds responded more to fire effects (9 species), reptiles to grazing effects (6 species) and mammals to the interaction (2 species). Species reacted to increases in bare ground (e.g. crested pigeon Ocyphaps lophotes, hooded robin Melanodryas cucullatus. Ctenophorus nuchalis) and to the dominant ground cover (e.g. Ctenotus pantherinus) or change in vegetation architecture (e.g. singing honeyeater Lichenostomus virescens, variegated fairy-wren Malurus lamberti). The clearest example of an interacting effect was the cycle of complementary dominance between the rodents Pseudomys delicatulus and P. desertor, the latter's post-fire recovery becoming more muted in sites where cattle grazed (modelled time for population recovery twice as long as in ungrazed sites).","Kutt, Alex.

Several stoat control operations in beech forest valley floors in southern New Zealand assume that adjacent montane areas act as a barrier to stoat immigration. Stoats were live-trapped and radio-tracked in alpine grasslands above the Borland Burn, Fiordland National Park, during the summer and autumn of 2003 and 2004. Seventeen stoats were radio-collared and home ranges were estimated for I I of them. These home ranges were used in a compositional analysis which showed that these stoats spent significantly more time in alpine grassland than in adjacent beech forest. Range cores calculated for six of these stoats were located high up in alpine grassland and contained very little beech forest. This means that montane areas that contain alpine grasslands are unlikely to be barriers to stoat immigration; rather they may be a source of dispersing stoats that reinvade control areas. Also, endemic animal species that inhabit alpine grasslands could be at risk from stoat predation.","Wilson, Deborah J.; Landcare Res, Private Bag 1930, Dunedin, New Zealand",,"Wilson, Deborah/B-8651-2008",,1,19,,35,9,9,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0110-6465,,,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 62800, Animal distribution","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Fagaceae [26070]; [beech]/Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Mustelidae [85780]; [Mustela erminea; stoat]",,,,,"New Zealand; Australasian region/Fiordland National Park; New Zealand; Australasian region/Borland Burn; Australasian region",,,,"geographic distribution, alpine grassland",,,,2018/06/21

Yet very little is known of its impacts or potential impacts on biodiversity in Australian ecosystems. In this paper we examine the impacts of black rats on biodiversity values at North Head, Sydney where a wildlife sanctuary is planned in an area with an abundant black rat population. We examined impacts on three key biodiversity elements considered flagships for the sanctuary concept: the endangered wattle Acacia terminalis, seedlings of which are vulnerable to rat grazing; the nests of small passerine birds which are vulnerable to rat predation; and the endangered population of long-nosed bandicoots Peramales nasuta, vulnerable to competition from black rats. Caging experiments using artificial seedling patches in recently burnt areas showed that rabbits or long-nosed bandicoots rather than black rats were the biggest grazing threat to A. terminalis. Similarly, although rats preyed on experimental artificial nests, nest predation was caused largely by other birds. An intensive trapping study showed a negative spatial relationship between black rats and long-nosed bandicoots at both macrohabitat and microhabitat scales in urban areas, suggesting some avoidance may occur. Thus rat impacts on sunshine wattle and birds nests currently appear to be small in comparison to impacts from other fauna, but an increase in the black rat population may heighten their impacts. It is also possible that black rats affect conservation values not measured here and the negative spatial interaction between black rats and long-nosed bandicoots warrants further investigation.","Rose, Tania A.; Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth and Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,,,0,14,,61,6,6,"ROYAL ZOOLOGICAL SOC NEW SOUTH WALES, TARONGA ZOO MOS, MOSMAN NSW, 2088, AUSTRALIA","TARONGA ZOO MOS, MOSMAN NSW, 2088, AUSTRALIA","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",,,,978-0-9803272-1-2(S),"Biogeography (Population Studies); Biodiversity; Pest Assessment Control and Management","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation; 54600, Pest control: general, pesticides and herbicides; 62800, Animal distribution","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Leguminosae [26260]; [Acacia terminalis; wattle; (seedling; protected species)]/Rodentia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Muridae [86375]; [Rattus rattus; black rat; (pest)]/Marsupialia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Marsupials, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Peramelidae [86090]; [Perameles nasuta; long-nosed bandicoot]",,,,,"Sydney; New South Wales, Australia; Australasian region",,,,biodiversity,,,,2018/06/21

Yet, As is a natural metallic element found in low concentrations in virtually every part of the environment, including foods. Mining and smelting activities are closely associated with As, and the largest occurrence of As contamination in the United States is near the gold mines of northern Nevada. Inhabitants of Bangladesh and surrounding areas have been exposed to water that is naturally and heavily contaminated with As, causing what the World Health Organization has described as the worst mass poisoning in history. Although readily absorbed by humans, most inorganic As (> 90%) is rapidly cleared from the blood with a half-life of 1 to 2 h, and 40 to 70% of the As intake is absorbed, metabolized, and excreted within 48 h. Arsenic does not appreciably bioaccumulate, nor does it biomagnify in the food chain. The United States has for some time purchased more As than any other country in the world, but As usage is waning, and further reductions appear likely. Arsenic is used in a wide variety of industrial applications, from computers to fireworks. All feed additives used in US poultry feeds must meet the strict requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration Center for Veterinary Medicine (Rockville, MD) before use. Although some public health investigators have identified poultry products as a potentially significant source of total As exposure for Americans, studies consistently demonstrate that < 1% of samples tested are above the 0.5 ppm limit established by the US Food and Drug Administration Center for Veterinary Medicine. Although laboratory studies have demonstrated the possibility that As in poultry litter could pollute ground waters, million of tons of litter have been applied to the land, and no link has been established between litter application and As contamination of ground water. Yet, the fact that < 2% of the United States population is involved in production agriculture and the overtones associated with the word ""arsenic"" could mean the matter becomes a perception issue.","Jones, F.

The purpose of our analyses was to provide an assessment of the status and trends of northern spotted owl populations throughout most of their geographic range. The 14 study areas made up approximately 12% of the range of the subspecies and included federal, tribal, private, and mixed federal and private lands. The study areas also included all the major forest types that the subspecies inhabits. The analyses followed rigorous protocols that were developed a priori and were the result of extensive discussions and consensus among the authors. Our primary objectives were to estimate fecundity, apparent survival (phi), and annual rate of population change (lambda) and to determine if there were any temporal trends in these population parameters. In addition to analyses of data from individual study areas, we conducted 2 meta-analyses on each demographic parameter. One meta-analysis was conducted on all 14 areas, and the other was restricted to the 8 areas that constituted the Effectiveness Monitoring Plan for northern spotted owls under the Northwest Forest Plan. The average number of years of reproductive data per study area was 14 (range = 5-19), and the average number of recapture occasions per study area was 13 (range = 4-18). Only 1 study area had < 12 years of data. Our results were based on 32,054 captures and resightings of 11,432 banded individuals for estimation of survival and 10,902 instances in which we documented the number of young produced by territorial females.The number of young fledged (NYF) per territorial female was analyzed by testing a suite of a priori models that included (1) effects of age, (2) linear or quadratic time trends, (3) presence of barred owls (Strix varia) in spotted owl territories, and (4) an even-odd year effect. The NYF varied among years on most study areas with a biennial cycle of high reproduction in even-numbered years and low reproduction in odd-numbered years. These cyclic fluctuations did not occur on all study areas, and the even-odd year effect waned during the last 5 years of the study. Fecundity was highest for adults ((x) over bar = 0.372, SE = 0.029), lower for 2-year-olds ((x) over bar = 0.208, SE = 0.032), and very low for 1-year-olds ((x) over bar = 0.074, SE = 0.029). Fecundity was stable over time for 6 areas (Rainier, Olympic, Warm Springs, H. J. Andrews, Klamath, and Marin), declining for 6 areas (Wenatchee, Cie Elum, Oregon Coast Range, Southern Oregon Cascades, Northwest California, and Simpson), and slightly increasing for 2 areas (Tyee, Hoopa). We found little association between NYF and the proportion of northern spotted owl territories where barred owls were detected, although results were suggestive of a negative effect of barred owls on the Wenatchee and Olympic study areas. The meta-analysis on fecundity indicated substantial annual variability with no increasing or decreasing trends. Fecundity was highest in the mixed-conifer region of eastern Washington ((x) over bar = 0.560, SE = 0.041) and lowest in the Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) region of the Oregon coast ((x) over bar = 0.306, SE = 0.039).We used Cormack-Jolly-Seber open population models and Program MARK to estimate apparent survival rates of owls > 1 year old. We found no differences in apparent survival rates between sexes except for 1 area (Marin), which had only 6 years of data. Estimates of apparent survival from individual study areas indicated that there were differences among age classes with adults generally having higher survival than 1 and 2-year-olds. Apparent survival rates ranged from 0.750 (SE = 0.026) to 0.886 (SE = 0.010) for adults, 0.626 (SE = 0.073) to 0.886 (SE = 0.010) for 2-year-olds, and 0.415 (SE = 0.111) to 0.860 (SE = 0.017) for 1-year-olds. These estimates were comparable to survival rates from previous studies on the subspecies. We found evidence for negative time trends in survival rates on 5 study areas (Wenatchee, Cie Elum, Rainier, Olympic, and Northwest California) and no trends in survival on the remaining areas. There was evidence for negative effects of barred owls on apparent survival on 3 study areas (Wenatchee, Cie Elum, and Olympic). Survival rates of adult owls on the 8 Monitoring Areas generally were high, ranging from 0.85 (SE = 0.009) to 0.89 (SE = 0.010), but were declining on the Cie Elum, Olympic, and Northwestern California study areas. The meta-analysis of apparent survival indicated differences among regions and changes over time with a downward trend in the mixed-conifer and Douglas-fir regions of Washington. The meta-analysis of apparent survival also indicated that there was a negative association between fecundity and survival the following year, suggesting a cost of reproduction on survival. This effect was limited to the Douglas-fir and mixed-conifer regions of Washington and the Douglas-fir region of the Oregon Cascade Mountains.We used the reparameterized Jolly-Seber method Q-RA to estimate annual rate of population change of territorial owls in the study areas. This estimate answers the question, Are these territorial owls being replaced in this geographically open population? Point estimates of lambda(RJS) were < 1.0 for 12 of 13 study areas. The analyses provided strong evidence that populations on the Wenatchee, Cie Elum, Rainier, Olympic, Warm Springs, H. J. Andrews, Oregon Coast Ranges, and Simpson study areas were declining during the study. The mean RJS for the 13 study areas was 0.963 (SE = 0.009), suggesting that populations over all the areas were declining about 3.7% per year during the study. The mean lambda(RJS) for the 8 monitoring areas for the Northwest Forest Plan was 0.976 (SE = 0.007) compared to a mean of 0.942 (SE = 0.016) for the other study areas, a 2.4-versus-5.8% decline per year. This suggested that owl populations on federal lands had higher demographic rates than elsewhere; thus, the Northwest Forest Plan appeared to have a positive effect on demography of northern spotted owls. Populations were doing poorest in Washington, where apparent survival rates and populations were declining on all 4 study areas. Our estimates of lambda(RJS) were generally lower than those reported in a previous analysis (lambda(RJS) = 0.997, SE = 0.003) for many of the same areas at an earlier date. The possible causes of population declines include but are not limited to habitat loss from timber harvest and fires, competition with barred owls, and weather patterns.","Anthony, Robert G.; Oregon State Univ, Dept Wildlife and Fisheries, US Geol Survey, Oregon Cooperat Fish and Wildlife Res Unit, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,"Piper, Walter/B-7908-2009",,5,73,,118,50,57,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Reproductive Biology",0084-0173,1938-5455,,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Reproduction","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 16504, Reproductive system - Physiology and biochemistry; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 51512, Plant physiology - Reproduction; 62800, Animal distribution","Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [Pseudotsuga menziesii; Douglas-fir]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Strigiformes [85564]; [Strix varia; barred owl] [Strix occidentalis caurina; northern spotted owl; (female, male)]",,,,,"California; USA, North America; Nearctic region/Oregon; USA, North America; Nearctic region/Washington; USA, North America; Nearctic region",,"Effectiveness Monitoring Plan; applied and field techniques",,"demographic data, fecundity",,,,2018/06/21

Jeffrey",,,,,,,,,"Forest Ecology and Management",,2006,2006/07/15,230,1-3,69-78,69,78,English,,,,,,"Medicinal use of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) fruits in treating benign prostatic hypertrophy has driven a recent sharp increase in fruit harvesting. At the same time, saw palmetto often is considered a keystone species, serving as habitat or a food source for several hundred mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian and insect species. Due to harvesting pressure on this ecologically important, non-cultivated species, land management practices that produce environmentally sustainable harvests are needed. As part of research focusing on use of controlled burning as a management tool, we investigated effects of burning season and frequency on saw palmetto flowering and fruiting in 32 pine flatwoods sites in central and southwest Florida from 1997 to 1999. The study was conducted as two repeated measures experiments, each involving 16 sites. Each experiment included two among-subjects factors - burning season and past burning frequency - and one within-subjects factor -year- with four replications of each treatment combination. For both experiments, growing season (i.e., April-July) burns had high flowering levels the first year after burning (mean proportion of saw palmettos flowering = 0.49, n = 16 sites), but decreased the second year after burning (mean proportion flowering = 0.15, n = 16 sites), while winter (i.e., November-February) burns had intermediate levels of flowering during both the first and second years after burning (mean proportions flowering = 0.21 and 0.28 for first and second years after burning, n = 16 sites). Although most flowering occurred during April and May, flowering occurred 2-5 months after winter burns, but did not occur until 9-12 months after growing season burns. During the 1997-1998 experiment, fruit infection by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides caused a fruiting failure in all sites. During the 1998-1999 experiment, fruit yields were higher in growing season burns only in infrequently burned (i.e., burned less often than every 5 years) sites, and only in 1998 (mean fruit yields = 325 kg/ha and 0.25 kg/ha for growing season, infrequently burned sites and winter, infrequently burned sites; n = 4 sites in each group). Frequently burned (i.e., burned every 2-3 years) sites generally had low fruit yields (mean fruit yields = 163 kg/ha and 242 kg/ha for frequently burned sites in 1998 and 1999; n = 8 sites). Although controlled burning can be an effective management tool in producing economically sustainable saw palmetto fruit harvests, land managers also must consider ecological needs of other plant and animal species when planning environmentally sustainable burning regimes.

Habitat loss is magnified by fragmentation, which produces edge effects, alters dispersal and natural processes (i.e., fire). We quantified how Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) habitat varied using traditional landcover maps and methods that considered small focal habitat features (e.g., scrub ridges < 2 ha) within an otherwise unsuitable matrix. We collected 7 years of data on color banded Florida scrub-jays to quantify dispersal and investigate how reproductive success and survival varied with habitat potential (scrub ridges), edge effects, and fire history. Landcover maps that identified only large scrub ridges resulted in a potential population of 354 pairs. Including small scrub ridges within an otherwise unsuitable matrix resulted in a potential population > 774 pairs. Florida scrub-jays occupied less than half the potential habitat, and their population declined most from disrupted fire regimes. Almost 90% of all breeding dispersers remained within the same cluster of territories that they hatched in emphasizing the need to maximize local habitat quantity and quality. Reduced habitat quality, caused by disrupted fire regimes, was a major fragmentation effect that greatly magnified impacts of habitat loss. The disruption of natural processes is seldom identified as a major fragmentation effect, but studies worldwide have accumulated to demonstrate its significance. We advocated specific mapping approaches for species influenced by small habitat features and species dependent on matrix habitats that advance natural processes, such as fire. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A vascular plant inventory was conducted here between 1993 and 2005, resulting in the documentation of 466 species (398 native) in the preserve. Included in the annotated checklist of plants presented in this paper is a federally endangered species, northern monkshood Aconitum noveboracense Gray), nineteen plant species listed by the State of Iowa as threatened, endangered or of special concern, and the first report of a grass species, drooping woodreed (Cinna latifolia (Trevir.) Griseb.), in the Iowa flora. During the above inventory, a vegetation map was prepared on which six forest types were identified. Seven microhabitats were also recognized as occurring in the preserve; although these are not noted on the map, they are described. The results of other inventories conducted at Bixby of fungi (115 species), amphibians (7), reptiles (4), summer birds (40) and mammals (10) are also presented in this paper.As a vegetation remnant, Bixby fulfills several roles in conservation as described by Saunders et al. (1991). The numerous habitats at Bixby support populations of many uncommon to rare organisms and their gene pools and thus serve a species oriented role. By preserving a diversity of forest types and microhabitats, including rare Betula alleghaniensis forest and algific talus slope habitats, Bixby fulfills an example oriented role. The climatic conditions (temperature, precipitation) and topographic diversity that occur here allow the persistence of numerous ""special plants"" at the edge of their distribution or disjunct from floras elsewhere in North America, thus preserving evolutionary opportunities and successional states (i.e., a process oriented role). Bixby is commonly visited by the general public and is frequently utilized by educators and conservationists as a site for field trips and natural history hikes; hence, it fulfills a social values oriented role in conservation. Numerous human effects have been observed or inferred to have Occurred at Bixby that have altered population dynamics and community composition of the residing biota. These impacts include fire Suppression, introduction of non-native species of vascular plants Such as garlic Mustard (Alliaria petiolata (Bieb.) Cavara & Grande) and disease-causing fungi including Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma ulmi (Buisman) Nannf. and O. nova-ulmi Brasier) and butternut canker (Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum N.B. Nair, Kostichka & Kuntz), increased abundance of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) and brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater Boddaert), forest fragmentation, and increased edge habitat.Bixby is an ideal site for future research that might include inventory of the bryoflora, Study of population dynamics of herbs in disturbed versus mature forests, and resurvey of forest vegetation plots to monitor Successional dynamics in northeast Iowa forests. Future management at Bixby should include removal of woody vegetation from the prairie opening, annual removal of garlic mustard, and acquisition of adjacent forest lands to act as a buffer surrounding the preserve.","Norris, William R.; Western New Mexico Univ, Dept Nat Sci, 1000 W Coll Ave, Silver City, NM 88061 USA",,,,0,4,,97,1,1,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Infectious Diseases; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0896-8381,,,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Infection; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 05500, Social biology and human ecology; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 36001, Medical and clinical microbiology - General and methods; 36008, Medical and clinical microbiology - Mycology; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 54502, Phytopathology - Diseases caused by fungi; 62800, Animal distribution","Fungi, Plantae; Fungi, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Ascomycetes [15100]; [Ophiostoma ulmi] [Ophiostoma nova-ulmi]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Betulaceae [25645]; [Betula allegbaniensis]/Artiodactyla, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Artiodactyls, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Cervidae [85725]; [Odocoileus virginianus; white-tailed deer]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Cruciferae [25880]; [Alliaria petiola; garlic mustard]/Fungi, Plantae; Fungi, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Fungi Imperfecti or Deuteromycetes [15500]; [Sirococcus clavigignenti juglandecearum; butternut cracker]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [Cinna latifolia; woodreed]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Molothrus ater; cowbird]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Ranunculaceae [26645]; [Aconitum noveboracense; monkshood]","Dutch elm disease; fungal disease, infectious disease",,,,"Iowa; USA, North America; Nearctic region/Bixby State Park and Preserve; USA, North America; Nearctic region",,,,,,,,2018/06/21

Classically, EDs act genomically, with agonistic or antagonistic effects on steroid receptors and may alter reproductive function and/or cause feminisation by binding to oestrogen or androgen receptors; their binding to the thyroid receptor may dysregulate the neuroendocrine system. Recently, it has been shown that EDs can also act by non-genomic mechanisms, altering steroid synthesis (inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoforms) or steroid metabolism. The alkylphenol and phthalate plasticisers inhibit the inactivation of oestrogens by sulphation (via SULT 1A1 and 1E1 isoforms) and so cause a rise in levels of the free active endogenous oestrogens. A range of ED effects have been shown in mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibia and aquatic invertebrates but it is not yet clear whether these processes also occur in human beings. It is evident that EDs, as well as altering reproduction, can cause changes in neurosteroid levels and so have the potential to affect immune function, behaviour and memory. This may be of long-term concern since traces of EDs such as plasticisers, brominated fire retardants, sunscreen agents and cosmetic ingredients are widely distributed in the environment and in human biofluids.

We developed a graphical model based on isodar theory to distinguish between an ideal distribution and an ecological trap. We tested the model's predictions using data on breeding bird populations in managed tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. Between 1992 and 1996 we monitored success for 2600 nests of 26 breeding species in undisturbed, grazed, and burned and grazed plots. We also sampled arthropod biomass and nest predator abundance. Using the isodar model we determined that managed plots are ecological traps: compared with success on plots left undisturbed, nest success on plots that were only grazed was lower, and success on plots that were burned and grazed was substantially lower. Yet birds preferred to nest on managed plots, where arthropod abundance was measurably higher. Reptiles were the most abundant taxon of nest predators, and their abundance was highest in managed plots. Consequently, tree-nesting species had higher nest success than shrub- and ground-nesting birds. Nest success also increased with tree height. We concluded that isodar theory is a useful tool for detecting ecological traps if any component of fitness is measured in addition to animal densities. Our study also suggests that (1) human modification of the environment may alter simultaneously food and predator abundance, (2) the former affects nest site selection and the latter nest success, and (3) such ecosystems are likely to become traps for breeding birds.","Shochat, Eyal; Univ Oklahoma, Sutton Avian Res Ctr, POB 2007, Bartlesville, OK 74005 USA",,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",1,27,,52,60,62,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0030-1299,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13907.x,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 64052, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Arthropoda: general","Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Invertebrates; Arthropoda [75000]; [arthropod]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [tallgrass]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Reptiles, Vertebrates; Reptilia [85400]; [reptile]",,,,,"Oklahoma; USA, North America; Nearctic region",,,,"ecological trap, isodar theory, prairie management, bird nest success",,,,2018/06/21

Species richness of birds, fishes, reptiles, amphibians, and insects is equally high, whereas mammal diversity is relatively low. Deforestation rates have been higher in the Cerrado than in the Amazon rainforest, and conservation efforts have been modest. only 2.2% of its area is under legal protection.

Soil erosion, the degradation of the diverse Cerrado vegetation formations, and the spread of exotic grasses are widespread and major threats. The use of fire for clearing land and to encourage new growth for pasture has also caused damage, even though the Cerrado is afire-adapted ecosystem. Ecosystem experiments and modeling show that change in land cover is altering the hydrology and affecting carbon stocks and fluxes. Cerrado agriculture is lucrative, and agricultural expansion is expected to continue, requiring improvements in and extension of the transportation infrastructure, which will affect not only the Cerrado but also the Amazon forest.

First, post-disturbance colonization is not limited by the dispersal ability of the species to reach the newly created open areas and, secondly, colonization is limited by dispersal. Under the first hypothesis, we expect, at a regional scale, to find similar post-disturbance communities to develop on recently burned sites. However, colonization limited by dispersal will lead to strong between-site variations in species composition.Location To test these hypotheses, we studied the post-fire colonization patterns of nine open-habitat bird species in eight distantly located wildfires in the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula.Methods We censused post-fire bird composition by means of field transects and identified potential colonization sources from species-habitat suitability maps derived from atlas data.Results Our results showed strong significant differences in post-fire species composition between burnt areas. Burnt areas located in areas with low probability of species presence before the fire event showed lower species occurrence and richness after the fire.Main conclusions These results do not support the idea that early successional stages and open habitats have a homogeneous community structure at regional scales and suggest that dispersal is a key constraint determining bird colonization of post-fire habitats. Further attention should be paid to landscape heterogeneity as a key factor in determining population dynamics of open-habitat species in the light of current and future land-use changes in Mediterranean regions.","Brotons, Lluis; Ctr Tecnol Forestal Catalunya, Area Biodiversitat, Pujada Seminari S-N, Solsona 25280, Catalonia, Spain",,"Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009","Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457; Pons, Pere/0000-0002-2196-5544",1,21,,51,65,74,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0305-0270,,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01195.x,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Ecology (Environmental Sciences)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 62800, Animal distribution","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrate; Aves [85500]; [bird]",,,,,"Mediterranean Region; Unclassified/Iberian Peninsula; Europe; Palearctic region",,,,"wildfire, colonization pattern, landscape heterogeneity, open habitat, early successional habitat",,,,2018/06/21

In lower elevation, xeric sagebrush communities, the role of fire has changed in recent decades from an infrequent disturbance maintaining a landscape mosaic and facilitating community processes to frequent events that after sagebrush communities to exotic vegetation, from which restoration is unlikely. Because of cheatgrass invasion, fire-return intervals in these sagebrush ecosystems have decreased from an historical pattern (pre-European settlement) of 30 to >100 yr to 5-15 yr. In other sagebrush communities, primarily higher elevation ecosystems, the lack of fire has allowed transitions to greater dominance by sagebrush, loss of herbaceous understory, and expansion of juniper-pinyon woodlands. Response by birds living in sagebrush habitats to fire was related to the frequency, size, complexity (or patchiness), and severity of the burns. Small-scale fires that left patchy distributions of sagebrush did not influence bird populations. However, large-scale fires that resulted in large grassland expanses and isolated existing sagebrush patches reduced the probability of occupancy by sagebrush-obligate species. Populations of birds also declined in sagebrush ecosystems with increasing dominance by juniper (Juniperus spp.) and pinyon (Pinus spp.) woodlands. Our understanding of the effects of fire on sagebrush habitats and birds in these systems is limited. Almost all studies of fire effects on birds have been opportunistic, correlative, and lacking controls. We recommend using the large number of prescribed burns to develop strong inferences about cause-and-effect relationships. Prescribed burning is complicated and highly contentious, particularly in low-elevation, xeric sagebrush communities. Therefore, we need to use the unique opportunities provided by planned burns to understand the spatial and temporal influence of fire on sagebrush landscapes and birds. In particular, we need to develop larger-scale and longer-term research to identify the underlying mechanisms that produce the patterns of bird responses to fire in sagebrush ecosystems.","Knick, Steven T.; USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Snake River Field Stn, 970 Lusk St, Boise, ID 83706 USA",,,,1,2,,0,0,0,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0197-9922,,,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Compositae [25840]; [Artemisia; sagebrush]/Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [Juniperus; juniper] [Pinus; pinyon pine]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]; [Centrocercus urophasianus]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [Bromus tectorum] [cheatgrass; (alien species)]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Amphispiza belli] [Spizella breweri] [Oreoscoptes montanus]",,,,,,,,,"habitat structure, fire effects",,,,2018/06/21

The occurrence of fire in the region has been associated with the presence of humans for over 10,000 yr. While pre-European fire regimes are poorly understood, fire is widely thought to have promoted and maintained large expanses of oak forest, woodland, and savanna documented in original land surveys. Forest composition is gradually shifting from fire-tolerant oaks (Quercus spp.) to other species (e.g., maples [Acer spp.]) and suppression of fire has been implicated as a primary cause. Prescribed fire has been used successfully to restore and maintain oak savannas and has been advocated to improve the sustainability of oak forests. Fire ecology research has addressed short-term effects of prescribed fire on habitat structure, breeding bird populations, and nesting productivity. In the short term, prescribed fire reduces habitat suitability for forest-interior birds that nest on the ground and in low shrubs but provides more favorable conditions for disturbance-dependent birds associated with savannas, woodlands, and early-successional forest. The use of prescribed burning requires tradeoffs in terms of management and conservation because some bird species benefit while others are negatively affected, depending on the degree to which fire changes habitat features. There is a critical need for long-term studies to better understand the effects of different fire regimes on bird populations in the eastern deciduous forest region.","Artman, Vanessa L.; Depauw Univ, Dept Biol, Greencastle, IN 46135 USA",,,,0,1,,0,0,0,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0197-9922,,,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Aceraceae [25510]; [Acer; maple]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Fagaceae [26070]; [Quercus; oak]",,,,,"North America; Nearctic region",,,,"fire suppression, deciduous forest, fire history, nesting productivity, fire regimes, fire ecology, forest-interior birds, disturbance-dependent birds",,,,2018/06/21

Wildfire, which is rare in this habitat, had occurred at 1 of the sites before data collection. A significantly larger proportion of Passerella iliaca was recaptured in subsequent winters at the unburned site than at the burned site, but little difference was found between sites for Catharus guttatus or Regulus calendula. Body mass of all 3 species declined during winter at the burned site, but differences between sites were not significant. Similarly, body mass indices of new captures were lower at the burned site than the unburned site for all 3 species, but these differences were not significant. The within-year recapture rate for all 3 species combined declined at the burned site over the course of the study, possibly due to changes in vegetation structure caused by the fire. Overall, our data suggest that wintering songbirds were resilient to this disturbance, but that response to the post-fire environment differed among foraging guilds.

In this paper, we use generalised linear models to investigate interrelationships among an index of decline in 1 degrees by 1 degrees cells and measures of grazing intensity and contemporary patterns of burning, together with the environmental variables of rainfall, vegetation and topographic patterning in the landscape. Grazing intensity was the single strongest human effect but strong correlations between grazing intensity and other human influences suggest that these may have been subsumed within the grazing intensity measure. Impacts of grazing may be worse where pastoral settlement occurred earlier. Topographic variation appeared to be a mitigating effect, suggesting a role for 'topographic refuges' from human activities. Relationships among granivore declines, grazing and rainfall are difficult to disentangle using inferential statistics, but a consistent effect is that declines are more severe in areas with greater year-to-year variation in rainfall. We do not suggest that our analyses are conclusive. However, they do support the proposition that better understanding of the causes of decline at finer spatial scales will emerge most strongly in studies that link habitat quality with granivore demography at inland sites of highly variable year-to-year rainfall and with strongly contrasting grazing histories.","Franklin, Donald C.; Charles Darwin Univ, Sch Environm Res, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia",,"Franklin, Donald/F-1171-2014","Franklin, Donald/0000-0002-9813-0959",5,23,,72,57,68,,,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Biodiversity & Conservation",1035-3712,,10.1071/WR05052,,"Biogeography (Population Studies); Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 05500, Social biology and human ecology; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 62800, Animal distribution","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human]",,,,,"Australia; Australasian region",,,,"grazing intensity, rainfall, vegetation, spatial scale, landscape, geographic pattern, topographic variation",gold_or_bronze,,,2018/06/21

Ecosystem engineers are important facilitators of other species because they cause physical changes in the environment that alter resource availability. Although a species can be associated with more than one partner, facilitators may not be interchangeable if they differ in abundance, behavioral characteristics, or interactions with other factors in ways that condition the outcome of the association. We examined interactions between burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) and two burrowing mammals, hairy armadillos (Chaetophractus villosus) and plains vizcachas (Lagostomus maximus), and determined whether these ecosystem engineers are interchangeable for owls. We examined reproductive success for owls nesting in these mammal burrows, constructed a logistic regression model to identify habitat characteristics associated with owl nests, and examined the engineering activities of the mammals. Data on reproduction and habitat indicate that armadillos and vizcachas are not interchangeable for owls. Thirty-five percent of the nests in vizcacha burrows produced fledglings; no fledglings were produced from nests outside vizcachas colonies, even though owls nest successfully in armadillo burrows in other parts of Argentina. Vizcachas facilitate burrowing owls by construction of burrows and by producing open understory vegetation through herbivory. In contrast, armadillos do not alter vegetation, and their burrows are suitable for nest sites only when they occur in recently burned areas or areas maintained by anthropogenic disturbance. Our habitat model also suggests that fire plays a key role in maintaining owl populations because fire is the only natural process that reduces shrubs to the level required by owls. Current management practices of eradication of vizcachas and fire suppression in shrublands could have strong negative consequences for burrowing owls.","Machicote, Marcela; Dept Wildlife Ecol and Conservat, Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, USA",,,,0,34,,61,40,42,,,"Mathematical & Computational Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0030-1299,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13139.x,,"Models and Simulations (Computational Biology); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","04500, Mathematical biology and statistical methods; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 10515, Biophysics - Biocybernetics","Rodentia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Chinchillidae [86305]; [Lagostomus maximus; plains vizcacha; (burrowing mammal)]/Edentata, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Edentates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Dasypodidae [85965]; [Chaetophractus villosus; hairy armadillo; (burrowing mammal)]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Strigiformes [85564]; [Athene cunicularia; burrowing owl; (fledgling, reproductive success)]",,,,,"Argentina; South America; Neotropical region",,"logistic regression model; mathematical and computer techniques",,"abundance, anthropogenic disturbance, behavioral characteristics, ecosystem engineers (facilitators, interchangeability) , habitat characteristics, habitat data, herbivory, physical environmental changes, reproduction data, understory vegetation",,,,2018/06/21

We mapped territories and measured survival, recruitment, emigration, immigration, and shrub heights annually for 12 years. We classified territories as oak if they overlapped well-drained ridges, oak-palmetto if they overlapped poorly drained ridges >0.4 ha, and palmetto-oak if they only overlapped poorly drained ridges <0.4 ha. Territory size differed little among these categories but was negatively correlated with the annual number of breeding pairs, which ranged from 12 to 27. Scrub ridge characteristics influenced the locations of sinks and potential sources, whereas population density and fires caused temporal variation in demographic success. Oak territories were usually sources because they were net exporters of individuals and because recruitment exceeded mortality. Oak-palmetto territories sometimes functioned as sources but were often pseudo-sinks because density dependence caused mortality to exceed recruitment. Palmetto-oak territories were true sinks because they were net importers of individuals and mortality exceeded recruitment regardless of population density. All scrub was short (<1.2 m) or medium height (1.2-1.7 m), but the spatial arrangement of these height classes changed regularly because fires occurred every 2-7 years. We observed a quadratic relationship between demographic success and the area of medium-height scrub within territories. Territories that had 0.9-1.2 ha of medium-height scrub had the highest demographic success. Applying source-sink concepts at the territory scale was useful to quantify habitat variation at a spatial scale relevant to population processes, reserve design, and habitat management. Our approach can be applied by using territory maps or geographic information systems to partition heterogeneous landscapes into territories and then by classifying territories into potential sources and sinks using scrub ridge characteristics and shrub heights.","Breininger, David R.; Dyn 2, Dynam Corp, Kennedy Space Ctr, FL, 32899, USA",,,,0,14,,46,18,19,,,"Behavioral Sciences; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics",1051-0761,,10.1890/03-5002,,"Behavior; Population Studies","07002, Behavioral biology - General and comparative behavior; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 37001, Public health - General and miscellaneous","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Aphelocoma coerulescens; Florida scrub jay]/Plantae; Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Spermatophyta [25000]; [shrub]",,,,,,,,,"emigration, fires, immigration, population density, recruitment, survival",,,,2018/06/21

Ants (family Formicidae) are an important, although often overlooked, component of many terrestrial ecosystems. Six species of ants are especially striking in their global ability to invade, and their impacts. This paper focuses on the impacts of the most destructive of those species, the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), and focuses on impacts on native vertebrates. Red imported fire ants often become the dominant ant species in infested areas outside of their native range due to their aggressive foraging behavior, high reproductive capability and lack of predators and/or other strong competitors. The evidence suggests that mammals, birds and herpetofauna are vulnerable to negative impacts from fire ants, and some species are more likely to experience negative population-level impacts than other species. Assessing the ecological impacts of fire ants on wild animal populations is logistically difficult, and very few studies have combined replicated experimental manipulation with adequate spatial (> 10 ha) and temporal (>1 y) scale. Thus, most studies have been observational, opportunistic, small-scale or 'natural' experiments.

A Norwegian population of the endangered ortolan bunting (Emberiza hortulana) occurs on a forest burn that has an area allocated to golf. Some forest-burn habitat (heather (Calluna vulgaris) heath with scattered, small Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris)) remains between fairways and on the periphery of the golf course. I compared pairing success, residence times, and emigration rates of male ortolan buntings in the interior and periphery of the golf course and in a neighboring part of undisturbed forest burn (control area). Males in the interior of the golf course (n = 4) never attracted females and less than half (43%, n = 7) in the golf periphery did so, whereas most males in the control area attracted females (77%, n = 13; all males on golf course vs. control: P= 0.038). Males in the golf interior had shorter residence times than males on the golf periphery and both were present for a shorter time than males in the control area (golf vs. control: P = 0.030). All males that had territories in the golf interior emigrated to other areas (median = 13.3 km away). The emigration rate was lower for males on the golf periphery (43%) and even lower in the control area (15%; golf vs. control: P = 0.033). Males emigrating from the golf course attracted females at the same rate as control males in their new areas of residence. Compared to males in the rest of the forest burn (n = 76), males on the golf course had shorter residence times (P = 0.049) and higher emigration rate (P = 0.009), but pairing success was not different (P = 0.196). Overall, the golf course did not seem to be attractive to ortolan buntings, although the lack of other populations on golf courses precludes replicate studies.

The density and numbers of these birds are governed mainly by changes in the groundwater table caused by floods, droughts or fires. Aquatic Warblers breed successfully when the groundwater table coincides with the topsoil level; the optimal water table lies in the range from 12 cm above the soil to 5 cm below it. Between 1981 and 2002 successful first-clutch breeding occurred 11 times (47.8%); in only 4 years was second-clutch breeding successful (17.3%). First and second clutches both failed in 9 years (39%). The pattern of changes in the population size and data on the recovery of the population size following such unfavourable years indicates that the key factors governing the overall population size are not migration or wintering conditions, but rather the state of the breeding biotopes.

However, logistic regression models for nest fate are inappropriate when applied to data from nests found at various ages, for the same reason that the apparent estimator of nest success is biased (i.e. older clutches are more likely to be successful than younger clutches). A generalized linear model is presented and illustrated that gives ornithologists access to a flexible, suitable alternative to logistic regression that is appropriate when exposure periods vary, as they usually do. Unlike the Mayfield method (1961, 1975) and the logistic regression method of Aebischer (1999), the logistic-exposure model requires no assumptions about when nest losses occur. Nest survival models involving continuous and categorical explanatory variables, multiway classifications, and time-specific (e.g. nest age) and random effects are easily implemented with the logistic-exposure model. Application of the model to a sample of Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) nests shows that logistic-exposure estimates for individual levels of categorical explanatory variables agree closely with estimates obtained with Johnson's (1979) constant-survival estimator. Use of the logistic-exposure method to model time-specific effects of nest age and date on survival of Blue-winged Teal (Anas discors) and Mallard (A. platyrhynchos) nests gives results comparable to those reported by Klett and Johnson (1982). However, the logistic-exposure approach is less subjective and much easier to implement than Klett and Johnson's method. In addition, logistic-exposure survival rate estimates are constrained to the (0,1) interval, whereas Klett and Johnson estimates are not. When applied to a sample of Mountain Plover (Charadrius montanus) nests, the logistic-exposure method gives results either identical to, or similar to, those obtained with the nest survival model in program MARK (White and Burnham 1999). I illustrate how the combination of generalized linear models and information-theoretic techniques for model selection, along with commonly available statistical software, provides ornithologists with a powerful, easily used approach to analyzing nest success.","Shaffer, Terry L.; Prairie and No Wildlife Res Ctr, US Geol Survey, 8711 37th St SE, Jamestown, ND, 58401, USA",,,,9,150,,40,423,438,,,"Behavioral Sciences; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0004-8038,,10.1642/0004-8038(2004)121[0526:AUATAN]2.0.CO;2,,"Behavior; Models and Simulations (Computational Biology); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","04500, Mathematical biology and statistical methods; 07002, Behavioral biology - General and comparative behavior; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 10515, Biophysics - Biocybernetics","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Anseriformes [85504]; [Anas discors; blue-winged teal] [Anas platyrhynchos; mallard]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Charadriiformes [85518]; [Charadrius montanus; mountain plover]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Icteria virens; yellow-breasted chat]",,,,,,,"MARK; computer software/generalized liner model; mathematical and computer techniques/logistic model; mathematical and computer techniques/logistic regression; mathematical and computer techniques",,"information theoretics, nest success, survival",,,,2018/06/21

The physical division of the lake into three main basins and the variation in chemical composition and temperature of the artesian springs feeding this shallow productive lake have large spatial effects. Variation in groundwater characteristics depends on percolation time and proximity to geothermal sources. Variation in precipitation is evened out by the porous volcanic soil and bedrock and the spring-water discharge is therefore very stable. A pulse of volcanic activity in 1975-1984 ( the Krafla Fires) heated the groundwater entering the North Basin of the lake and changed its chemistry. Although much reduced, these effects have not disappeared yet, but overall the impact of the volcanic activity on the biota seemed minimal. Recycling of nutrients through internal loading is important and occurs on various time scales. In winter, when the lake is ice-covered, the topmost 5-cm layer of sediment pore water has a hundredfold concentration of nutrients relative to the overlying lake water. The nutrients are released during the ice-free period by sediment resuspension, diffusion, bioturbation and recycling. In spring, resuspension events sometimes lead to spikes in dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen, but there is little evidence of any major desorption of nutrients from suspended particles during such events later in the summer. In contrast to the stable groundwater, the biota show more or less regular fluctuations with no straightforward correlation with external signals. The most prominent fluctuations, those of the chironomid Tanytarsus gracilentus seem to be driven by interactions between the species and its sediment resources. Fluctuations in other invertebrates could be a consequence of the Tanytarsus cycles due to the large impact this species has on the benthic environment of this detritus-driven ecosystem. Temporal variation in epibenthic chironomids and Cladocera translates into variable production of vertebrate predators (Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, and ducks), body condition and mortality of fish and sometimes into return rates of migrating adult ducks. The waterfowl show large temporal variation on a centennial scale, e. g., the invasion of the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) which arrived by the end of the 19th century and has by now outnumbered other species. Fluctuations of Cyanobacteria ( Anabaena) and the fish Gasterosteus aculeatus ( three-spined stickleback) harmonize with the cycles in the benthic community. Palaeolimnological studies indicate that primary production in the South Basin became increasingly benthic as the lake depth was reduced by sedimentation (around 2 mm year-1). Other trends include a decrease in Tanytarsus and Daphnia and an exponential increase in green algae (Cladophorales, Pediastrum) and associated organisms.","Einarsson, Arni; Myvatn Res Stn, IS-660, Myvatn, Iceland",,"Gislason, Gisli/B-2109-2008","Gislason, Gisli/0000-0001-8507-1796",4,54,,146,50,61,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology",1386-2588,,10.1023/B:AECO.0000032090.72702.a9,,"Freshwater Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07514, Ecology: environmental biology - Limnology; 31000, Physiology and biochemistry of bacteria; 64054, Invertebrata:comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Arthropoda: crustacea; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Anseriformes [85504]; [Aythya fuligula]/Crustacea, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Crustaceans, Invertebrates; Branchiopoda [75102]; [Daphnia]/Algae, Plantae; Algae, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Chlorophyta [13300]; [Pediastrum]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Diptera [75314]; [Simulium] [Tanytarsus] [Tanytarsus gracilentus]/Nostocales, Cyanobacteria, Oxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria, Eubacteria, Bacteria, Microorganisms; Bacteria, Cyanobacteria, Eubacteria, Microorganisms; Nostocaceae [09241]; [Anabaena]/Pisces, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Fish, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Osteichthyes [85206]; [Gasterosteus aculeatus] [Salvelinus alpinus; Arctic charr]",,,,,"Lake Myvatn; Iceland, Europe; Palearctic region/River Laxa; Iceland, Europe; Palearctic region",,,,"bioturbation, chemical composition, ice cover, internal loading, lake ecology, nutrient cycling, paleolimnology, sediment transport",,,,2018/06/21

Among the forest stands occupied by this bird, 848 ha of Corsican pines and 275 ha of Maritime pines were either totally ""charred"" or simply ""browned"".

However, data on burnt surfaces did not take into account forest mosaic where nuthatches are able to survive.

S",61-72,61,72,English,,,,,,"Through a literature review from the southeastern fringe of the Pacific Basin, I attempt to identify what aspects of El Nino determine the availability of resources (food and habitat) that in turn affect avian ecology. The evidence shows that El Nino affects seabirds essentially by reducing their food base. Fish- and fish + squid-eating seabirds generally decrease their population abundance, likely as a combined result of adult mortality (famine) and reproductive failure. Omnivorous seabirds negotiate El Nino periods without important declines, while those including fishery wastes in their diets show minimal changes or even increase their populations during such periods. Waterbirds seem to benefit from precipitation that accompanies El Nino, which enlarges their habitats (waterbodies). Increased habitat affords more opportunities for installing adequate nests and obtaining enough food. Finally, landbirds are affected by El Nino-driven precipitation, which fires up primary productivity (aboveground plant biomass and seed crop), which in turn fuels arthropod and mammal increases. Granivorous birds react promptly to peaks in seed output, while insectivores respond similarly to arthropod abundance. Carnivorous birds take somewhat longer to react to increases in mammal populations. I conclude that (a) Food shortage may be an important key factor for bird populations, but its effects depend on diet breadth, prey switching, and life history parameters; (b) Predictable (seasonal) patterns of productivity may determine distribution and abundance of resident birds, but variations imposed by unpredictable occurrences of El Nino and La Nina may determine the presence and abundance of migratory birds; (c) The dichotomy El Nino versus La Nina or other ""normal"" years may be artificial; (d) Long-term monitoring is needed to understand the connection between climate and birds.","Jaksic, Fabian M.; Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol and Biodivers, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile",,"jaksic, Fabian/G-1705-2014",,2,17,,9,14,16,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics",1075-4377,,,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences); Biogeography (Population Studies)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 62800, Animal distribution","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [seabird] [waterbird]",,,,,"Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean",,,,"seasonal pattern, food shortage, population abundance, life history parameter, reproductive failure, literature review, prey switching",,,,2018/06/21

We studied the nesting biology of Southeastern American Kestrels in 1999 and 2000 at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, in old-growth longleaf pine savanna, a habitat type historically widely occupied by the kestrels. Most of the nest cavities we observed were in old-growth trees, both living and dead, and were originally excavated by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and then enlarged by other woodpecker species. Nesting success was 70% in 1999 and 56% in 2000. In 1999, 67% of eggs survived to become fledglings in successful nests, as did 58% in 2000. Nests in live pines and snags were equally successful, and nest success was positively related to cavity height in 1999. Reduced nesting success in 2000 may have been related to severe drought conditions. High nesting concentrations of up to 4 pairs per km2 were observed. We suggest that stands of old-growth longleaf pine, with little or no hardwood midstory and a relatively high number of snags, inhabited by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, may constitute high quality habitat for Southeastern American Kestrels. Therefore, loss of longleaf pine habitat, degradation of remaining longleaf habitat due to fire suppression and removal of old-growth and snags, and the decline of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker, a species on which kestrels may have depended as a source of nest cavities historically, may have contributed to the decline of the Southeastern American Kestrel.","Gault, Kathleen E.; RCW Res Team, Virginia Tech, POB 875, Niceville, FL, 32588, USA",,,,1,10,,36,5,5,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation",1528-7092,,10.1656/1528-7092(2004)003[0191:NSOSAK]2.0.CO;2,,"Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Falconiformes [85534]; [Falco sparverius paulus; Southeastern American Kestrel; (nest success, threatened species)]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Piciformes [85552]; [Picoides borealis; Red-cockaded Woodpecker]",,,,,"Eglin Air Force Base; Florida, USA, North America; Nearctic region",,,,"habitat alteration (fire suppression, old-growth removal, snag removal) , old-growth longleaf savanna (habitat)",,,,2018/06/21

Consistent with global trends, Australia has warmed apprx0.8degreeC over the last century with minimum temperatures warming faster than maxima. There have been significant regional trends in rainfall with the northern, eastern and southern parts of the continent receiving greater rainfall and the western region receiving less. Higher rainfall has been associated with an increase in the number of rain days and heavy rainfall events. Sea surface temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef have increased and are associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of coral bleaching and mortality. Sea level rises in Australia have been regionally variable, and considerably less than the global average. Snow cover and duration have declined significantly at some sites in the Snowy Mountains. CSIRO projections for future climatic changes indicate increases in annual average temperatures of 0.4-2.0degreeC by 2030 (relative to 1990) and 1.0-6.0degreeC by 2070. Considerable uncertainty remains as to future changes in rainfall, El Nino Southern Oscillation events and tropical cyclone activity. Overall increases in potential evaporation over much of the continent are predicted as well as continued reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover. Future changes in temperature and rainfall are predicted to have significant impacts on most vegetation types that have been modelled to date, although the interactive effect of continuing increases in atmospheric CO2 has not been incorporated into most modelling studies. Elevated CO2 will most likely mitigate some of the impacts of climate change by reducing water stress. Future impacts on particular ecosystems include increased forest growth, alterations in competitive regimes between C3 and C4 grasses, increasing encroachment of woody shrubs into arid and semiarid rangelands, continued incursion of mangrove communities into freshwater wetlands, increasing frequency of coral bleaching, and establishment of woody species at increasingly higher elevations in the alpine zone. Modelling of potential impacts on specific Australian taxa using bioclimatic analysis programs such as BIOCLIM consistently predicts contraction and/or fragmentation of species' current ranges. The bioclimates of some species of plants and vertebrates are predicted to disappear entirely with as little as 0.5-1.0degreeC of warming. Australia lacks the long-term datasets and tradition of phenological monitoring that have allowed the detection of climate-change-related trends in the Northern Hemisphere. Long-term changes in Australian vegetation can be mostly attributed to alterations in fire regimes, clearing and grazing, but some trends, such as encroachment of rainforest into eucalypt woodlands, and establishment of trees in subalpine meadows probably have a climatic component. Shifts in species distributions toward the south (bats, birds), upward in elevation (alpine mammals) or along changing rainfall contours (birds, semiarid reptiles), have recently been documented and offer circumstantial evidence that temperature and rainfall trends are already affecting geographic ranges. Future research directions suggested include giving more emphasis to the study of climatic impacts and understanding the factors that control species distributions, incorporating the effects of elevated CO2 into climatic modelling for vegetation and selecting suitable species as indicators of climate-induced change.","Hughes, Lesley; Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University, North Ryde, NSW, 2109, Australia",,"Ross, Donald/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald/0000-0002-8659-3833; Hughes, Lesley/0000-0003-0313-9780",35,564,,181,315,406,,,"Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",1442-9985,,10.1046/j.1442-9993.2003.01300.x,,"Climatology (Environmental Sciences); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07504, Ecology: environmental biology - Bioclimatology and biometeorology; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 10060, Biochemistry studies - General","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird]/Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Bats, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Chiroptera [85845]; [bat]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Mammalia [85700]; [mammal]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Reptiles, Vertebrates; Reptilia [85400]; [reptile]",,"carbon dioxide",,,"Australia; Australasian region/Great Barrier Reef; South Pacific Ocean, Pacific Ocean/Snowy Mountains; Australia; Australasian region",,,,"El Nino Southern Oscillation events, climate change, eucalypt woodlands, forest growth, rainfall, rainfall trends, snow cover, temperature, tropical cyclone activity",,,,2018/06/21

The model is represented mathematically as a discrete-time, stochastic compartment model based on difference equations with a time interval of 1 week. In the model, sheep graze through sage grouse breeding habitat during spring and fall, and different portions of the area can burn at different frequencies, creating a habitat mosaic of burned and unburned areas. The model was evaluated by examining predictions of (1) growth of sagebrush canopy cover after fire, (2) seasonal dynamics of grass and forb biomass under historical environmental conditions, and (3) sage grouse population dynamics associated with selected sagebrush canopy covers. Simulated changes in sagebrush canopy cover following fire correspond well with qualitative reports of long-term trends, simulated seasonal dynamics of herbaceous biomass correspond well with field data, and simulated responses of sage grouse population size and age structure to changing sagebrush canopy cover correspond well to qualitative field observations. Simulation results suggest that large fires occurring at high frequencies may lead to the extinction of sage grouse populations, whereas fires occurring at low frequencies may benefit sage grouse if burned areas are small and sheep grazing is absent. Sheep grazing may contribute to sage grouse population decline, but is unlikely to cause extinction under fire regimes that are favorable to sage grouse.","Grant, W.

Despite intensive Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) removal at Fort Hood, we recorded nine predator visits by females of this species, but only one resulted in nest failure. Although predator visits occurred at all hours, most (58%) took place at night. The daily predation rate was higher during the nestling stage than during incubation, partly due to the apparent inability of fire ants to prey upon vireo eggs. We monitored 435 nests without video; field assistants checked the contents of these every 4-5 days. The daily survival rate of these nests was not higher than the rate of nests monitored with video, evidence that video monitoring does not increase nest predation relative to monitoring by human visits to nests.","Stake, Mike M.; University of Missouri, 105 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA",,,,0,29,,46,96,103,,,"Behavioral Sciences; Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0010-5422,,10.1650/0010-5422(2003)105[0348:UVTMPA]2.0.CO;2,,"Behavior; Reproduction; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07002, Behavioral biology - General and comparative behavior; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 16504, Reproductive system - Physiology and biochemistry; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Hymenoptera [75326]; [Solenopsis sp.; fire ant; (predator)]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Mammalia [85700]; [mammal; (predator)]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Molothrus ater; brown-headed cowbird; (brood parasite, predator)] [Vireo atricapillus; black-capped vireo; (adult, egg, juvenile)]/Reptilia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Reptiles, Vertebrates; Serpentes [85410]; [snake; (predator)]",,,,,"Fort Hood; Texas, USA, North America; Nearctic region",,"time-lapse IR videocameras; field equipment/video nest monitoring; applied and field techniques",,"daily predation rate, daily survival rates, nest predators, nest success, predation",,,,2018/06/21

In order to design management plans to prevent large wildfires while preserving biodiversity, understanding of the ways in which birds respond to these fires is required. We investigated the spatial variability of both avifauna and habitat structure in three zones: unburnt, burnt in 1982, and burnt in 1994. The habitat structure of the unburnt zone was the most variable spatially. However, bird species composition between sampling points was very homogeneous in space. In contrast, the bird communities inhabiting burnt zones were more spatially heterogeneous. This pattern was caused by distinct specific responses to variations in habitat structure. Open-space species responded to small changes in habitat structure with large changes in local abundance, whereas the response of forest species to these structural variations was much less. We suggest that land managers should select specific zones with limited vegetation recovery within large burnt areas and maintain them as open space to keep combustibility low and provide an appropriate habitat for several open space species that are of conservation concern.","Herrando, Sergi; Catalan Institute of Ornithology, C./Girona 168, E-5, 08037, Barcelona, Spain",,"Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009","Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457",3,9,,42,30,37,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0019-1019,,10.1046/j.1474-919X.2003.00155.x,,"Biodiversity; Conservation; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird]",,,,,"Southern Europe; Europe; Palearctic region",,,,"avifauna spatial diversity, biodiversity preservation, bird communities, fire ecology, habitat structure, land management, landscape spatial heterogeneity, mediterranean ecosystems, species composition, vegetation recovery",,,,2018/06/21

The Rocky Mountain region has one of the most heterogeneous landscapes in North America, combining high complexity in abiotic gradients with fire as a major disturbance factor. In recent decades fire suppression has limited this disturbance, resulting in altered stand structures and relatively homogeneous expanses of mid-successional forest where there were once mosaics of different-aged post-fire stands. Elsewhere, historically homogeneous landscapes that rarely burned have become more heterogeneous due to logging. Many forest types are less common than they were historically due to current management. Land conversion to agriculture and development has primarily occurred in low elevations. We speculate that the consequences of these changes include: (1) bird species adapted to historically homogeneous forest landscapes would be negatively affected by landscape heterogeneity created by timber harvest openings; (2) bird species specialized for forest types that were once prevalent but are now uncommon may be negatively affected by decreasing patch size and increasing isolation; and (3) birds that breed in close proximity to human-added landscape features may be negatively affected by brood parasites or nest predators. Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) and Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa) had the strongest trends of species sensitive to fragmentation indices. Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina) and Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis) were positively associated with fragmentation across most studies. Nesting success varied among landscape configurations, and some trends paralleled abundance patterns. Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism rates were extremely low (0-3%) where nest success has been studied in coniferous forests of the north-central Rockies. Across extensive and intensive studies, distance to agricultural lands was the strongest predictor of cowbird presence. Therefore, we found evidence for the ideas that birds adapted to homogeneous forest landscapes have been negatively affected by heterogeneity caused by timber harvesting, that patch size is important for some birds in one vanishing habitat (old-growth ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa), and that cowbirds are more abundant in conifer forests near human-added landscape features. The effects of changes in landscape patterns on birds in the north-central Rockies seem to be less dramatic than in eastern and midwestern North America, and different landscape measures are more relevant to western conifer forests. We need additional research on most aspects of breeding, nonbreeding, and dispersal ecology in relation to landscape patterns and within-stand changes. We offer our proposed consequences as hypotheses upon which to base future tests.","Hejl, Sallie J.; Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, 77843-2258, USA",,,,3,12,,0,7,7,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0197-9922,,,,"Conservation; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal","Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [Pinus ponderosa]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Carduelis pinus; pine siskin] [Certhia americana; brown creeper] [Junco hyemalis; dark-eyed junco] [Molothrus ater; brown-headed cowbird] [Regulus satrapa; golden-crowned kinglet] [Spizella passerina; chipping sparrow]",,,,,"Rocky Mountains; North America; Nearctic region",,,,"anthropogenic changes, anthropogenic landscape features, avian communities, breeding biology, brood parasitism, conifer forests, dispersal ecology, disturbance factors, edge effects, fire regimes, fire suppression, forest fragmentation, forest patterns, forested landscapes, fragmentation indices, heterogenous landscapes, land management, landscape ecology, landscape patterns, nesting success, species abundance, successional forest, wildfire",,,,2018/06/21

This is particularly true of wildfire effects on spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) because of the uncertainty of impacts of controlled burning within spotted owl habitat. Therefore, we documented minimum survival, site fidelity, mate fidelity, and reproductive success for 21 spotted owls after large (>540 ha) wildfires occurred within 11 owl territories in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. In each territory, fire burned through the nest and primary roost sites. Eighteen owls (86%) were known to be alive at least 1 year after the fires, which was similar to reported annual adult survival probabilities for the species. Of 7 pairs of which both members were later resighted, all were located together on the same territories during the breeding season following fires, and 4 pairs produced a total of 7 fledglings. No pair separations were observed after fire. On 8 territories where fire severities were mapped, 50% experienced predominantly low- to moderate-severity fires while 50% experienced high-severity fires that burned large (>30%) areas of the territories. We hypothesize that wildfires may have little short-term impact on survival, site fidelity, mate fidelity, and reproductive success of spotted owls. Further, prescribed burning could be an effective tool in restoring habitat to natural conditions with minimal short-term impact on resident spotted owls. While we do not advocate wholesale prescribed burning in spotted owl territories at this time, we believe our observations justify large-scale experiments on effects of prescribed burning on spotted owls to corroborate our observations and to establish cause-and-effect relationships.","Bond, Monica L.; Center for Biological Diversity, P.O.

Therefore, we evaluated effects of food abundance (i.e., supplemental prey) and time since prescribed fire on nest success of artificial ground nests. We monitored the fate of 759 artificial ground nests from June to July 2000. No interaction (P = 0.74) occurred between fire and supplemental prey treatments. Nest success in prey-supplemented plots (37.6%) did not differ (P = 0.70) from control plots (44.9%), and nest success in burned plots (41.8%) did not differ (P = 0.86) from nonburned plots (40.7%). Motion-sensitive cameras placed on feeders revealed that mesomammals accounted for >80% of visits to feeders, indicating that supplemental prey was detected and consumed by mesomammals. Nest predators differed as a function of food abundance, with combined avian and small-mammal predation being greater in prey-supplemented (46.5%) than in control (25.9%) plots. Nest predators also differed as a function of prescribed fire. Avian predation of nests was greater in burned (13.7%) than nonburned (9.9%) plots, whereas small-mammal predation was greater in non-burned (30.9%) than in burned (15.1%) plots. Altering food and cover to manage nest success may result in compensatory predation. Further work to quantify the extent of compensatory predation is needed to fully understand trade-offs of various practices for managing nest predation.","Jones, David D.; Joseph W.

Comparison of subthreshold postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) and spike output for the same neurons showed that receptive fields measured in PSPs were much larger than those measured in spikes in both ITD and ILD dimensions. Space-specific neurons fire more spikes for a particular ITD than for its phase equivalents (ITD +- 1/F, where F is best frequency). This differential response was much less pronounced in PSPs. The two sides of pyramid-shaped ILD curves were more symmetrical in spikes than in PSPs. Furthermore, monaural stimuli that were ineffective in eliciting spikes induced subthreshold PSPs. The main cause of these changes between PSPs and spikes is thresholding. The spiking threshold did not vary with the kind of acoustic stimuli presented. However, the thresholds of sound-induced first spikes were lower than those of later sound-induced and spontaneous spikes. This change in threshold may account for the sharpening of ITD selectivity during the stimulus. Large changes in receptive fields across single neurons are not unique to the owl's space-specific neurons but occur in mammalian visual and somatosensory cortices, suggesting the existence of general principles in the formation of receptive fields in high-order neurons.","Pena, Jose Luis; Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, 216-76, Pasadena, CA, 91125, USA",jose@etho.caltech.edu,,,0,1,,35,32,39,,,"Neurosciences & Neurology",0270-6474,,,,"Nervous System (Neural Coordination)","20504, Nervous system - Physiology and biochemistry","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Strigiformes [85564]; [barn owl]",,,,,,,,"auditory spatial receptive fields; nervous system; genesis/inferior colliculus; nervous system/somatosensory cortex; nervous system/space-specific neurons; nervous system/visual cortex; nervous system","interaural level difference, interaural time difference, postsynaptic potentials, sound localization, spikes",,,,2018/06/21

There is now increasing evidence that this very localized occurrence is caused by human activity, that chronic overgrazing and pasture management by burning has restricted the woody vegetation to particular habitats, and that these forests were once widespread and contiguous with lower-elevation cloudforests. The human-induced vegetation changes were modest in the arid parts of the puna zone, and some Polylepis patches persist remarkably well, probably because of active management by local communities. Comparison of current and modeled potential distribution of birds suggest an average reduction in species richness of 26% in the humid parts of the puna zone and 17% in montane basins of central Peru. The biologically most valuable areas are found close to ancient cultural centers in the Andes, possibly reflecting the fact that the local climate is favorable for agriculture as well as for rare (relict) species of animals and plants. Because of this link, initiatives to minimize global extinction of animals and plants must include support for sustainable land use in these places, in addition to traditional conservation by formal reserving of wilderness areas with few people.

Here we investigate the initiation of spontaneous episodes of rhythmic activity in the embryonic chick spinal cord. These episodes recur regularly and are separated by quiescent intervals of many minutes. We examined the role of motoneurons and their intraspinal synaptic targets (R-interneurons) in the initiation of these episodes. During the latter part of the inter-episode interval, we recorded spontaneous, transient ventral root depolarizations that were accompanied by small, spatially diffuse fluorescent signals from interneurons retrogradely labeled with a calcium-sensitive dye. A transient often could be resolved at episode onset and was accompanied by an intense pre-episode (apprx500 ms) motoneuronal discharge (particularly in adductor and sartorius) but not by interneuronal discharge monitored from the ventrolateral funiculus (VLF). An important role for this pre-episode motoneuron discharge was suggested by the finding that electrical stimulation of motor axons, sufficient to activate R-interneurons, could trigger episodes prematurely. This effect was mediated through activation of R-interneurons because it was prevented by pharmacological blockade of either the cholinergic motoneuronal inputs to R-interneurons or the GABAergic outputs from R-interneurons to other interneurons. Whole-cell recording from R-interneurons and imaging of calcium dye-labeled interneurons established that R-interneuron cell bodies were located dorsomedial to the lateral motor column (R-interneuron region). This region became active before other labeled interneurons when an episode was triggered by motor axon stimulation. At the beginning of a spontaneous episode, whole-cell recordings revealed that R-interneurons fired a high-frequency burst of spikes and optical recordings demonstrated that the R-interneuron region became active before other labeled interneurons. In the presence of cholinergic blockade, however, episode initiation slowed and the inter-episode interval lengthened. In addition, optical activity recorded from the R-interneuron region no longer led that of other labeled interneurons. Instead the initial activity occurred bilaterally in the region medial to the motor column and encompassing the central canal. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that transient depolarizations and firing in motoneurons, originating from random fluctuations of interneuronal synaptic activity, activate R-interneurons, which then trigger the recruitment of the rest of the spinal interneuronal network. This unusual function for R-interneurons is likely to arise because the output of these interneurons is functionally excitatory during development.","Wenner, Peter; Lab. of Neural Control, NIH, NINDS, 49 Convent Dr., Bldg. 49, Rm. 3A50, Bethesda, MD, 20892-4455, USA",,"o'donovan, michael/A-2357-2015","o'donovan, michael/0000-0003-2487-7547; Wenner, Peter/0000-0002-7072-2194",0,1,,51,72,73,,,"Neurosciences & Neurology",0022-3077,,,,"Nervous System (Neural Coordination)","02506, Cytology - Animal; 10069, Biochemistry studies - Minerals; 20504, Nervous system - Physiology and biochemistry","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]; [chicken]",,calcium,,,,,,"interneuron; nervous system/motoneuron; nervous system/spinal cord; nervous system/ventrolateral funiculus; nervous system",,,,,2018/06/21

Deviations from the perpendicular shooting failed to stun 5 out of 9 broilers. The perpendicular vs non-perpendicular effect was significant. 4. Shooting broilers with a 3 mm bolt at air line pressures of 620 kPa (n=2) or 827 kPa (n=2) failed stun as indicated by the unaltered physical reflexes, EEG and VEPs. Shooting of two broilers with a 6 mm bolt at 620 kPa resulted in effective stunning and a very rapid recovery of consciousness in one bird and death in the other. 5. Captive bolt stunning of broilers with a 6 mm bolt and air line pressure of 827 kPa resulted in an immediate stun leading to death in all 6 broilers tested. In these broilers, a profound EEG suppression and abolition of VEPs occurred immediately after shooting. 6.

Regional diversity of sequestrate fungi is high in comparison to other parts of the world: for ascomycetes and basidiomycetes 83 genera and 294 species are currently known in Australia and 32 genera and 58 species in New Zealand. Only an estimated 12-23% of species are known for Australia and 25-30% for New Zealand. On that basis, between 1278-2450 species may occur in Australia and 193-232 in New Zealand. Centres of diversity for some groups of sequestrate fungi occur in the region, e.g. Russulaceae (five known genera, 68 species) and Cortinariaceae (eight genera, 33 species). Some other groups are less diverse than in the northern hemisphere, e.g. sequestrate Boletaceae (seven genera, 25 species). More than 35% of Australian sequestrate genera and 95% of species are endemic; for New Zealand about 45% of sequestrate genera and 80% of species are endemic. Australia and New Zealand share similarities in sequestrate fungi at generic level (11% of total) but do not share many of the same species (4% of total). Knowledge of biogeographical distributions is limited by incomplete taxonomic knowledge and insufficient collections. Some Gondwanan, Australasian and widespread/cosmopolitan patterns are evident. Some exotic sequestrate fungi have been recently introduced and some fungi indigenous to the region occur world-wide as exotics with eucalypt plantings. Within Australia and New Zealand, there is evidence that characteristic suites of fungi co-occur in different climatic and vegetation types. Mycorrhizas of Australian and New Zealand taxa have a range of morphological and physiological attributes relating to their effect on plants and broader roles in ecosystem nutrient cycling and health. Spores of sequestrate fungi are dispersed by a range of fauna. There are tripartite inter-dependent interactions between mycorrhizal plants, sequestrate fungi and native mammals and birds that use the fungi as food. Major environmental influences affecting the distribution, diversity and abundance of sequestrate fungi include climate, topography, soil, vegetation and animals. Imposed upon such influences are a range of natural and human-induced disturbance factors which alter habitat heterogeneity, e.g. fire, fragmentation and replacement of native vegetation and exotic organisms. Rare and endangered sequestrate fungi are likely to occur in Australia and New Zealand, but for most taxa there is insufficient data to determine rarity or commonality. In the face of poor knowledge, assemblage-based and habitat-based approaches are the most appropriate for conservation and management of sequestrate fungi. Habitat heterogeneity may be important for the fungi at scales ranging from different climatic and vegetation types to local topographic-related variations.","Bougher, Neale L.; CSIRO Forestry and Forest Products, Wembley, WA, 6913, Australia",Neale.Bougher@ffp.csiro.au,,"Lebel, Teresa/0000-0002-8592-1102",0,20,,296,49,53,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics",1030-1887,,10.1071/SB00002,,"Biodiversity; Biogeography (Population Studies); Systematics and Taxonomy","00504, General biology - Taxonomy, nomenclature and terminology; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 50506, Botany: general and systematic - Fungi; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution","Plantae; Fungi, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Fungi [15000]; [sequestrate fungi; ruffle-like fungi]",,,,,"Australia; Australasian region/New Zealand; Australasian region",,,,"dispersal mechanisms, ecological roles, evolutionary relationships",,,,2018/06/21

In this study I sought to understand how rainforest bird communities are affected by shifting cultivation in Mizoram State. I studied bird occurrence and abundance patterns in secondary successional and mature tropical rainforests in a shifting-cultivation habitat mosaic in Dampa Tiger Reserve. To compare replicate sites in fallows aged 1, 5, 10, 25, and 100 years with undisturbed primary forest, I used systematic strip-transect sampling over the winter and early summer (breeding) seasons during 1994-1995. Many forest bird species, especially those with ranges restricted to northeast India, declined in abundance or disappeared in successional fallows that had regenerated for ltoreq10 years. Birds that colonized or increased in abundance in regrowth habitats were mainly common and widespread species of open-country and secondary-forest habitats, and of low importance for conservation. Primary forest was the main habitat for specialized forest birds, intrinsically rare species, and elevational migrants. Although protection and conservation of relatively undisturbed mature forests is imperative in the core area of the reserve, management in the buffer zone for long-rotation shifting cultivation (>10-year cycles) instead of plantation of monocultures may be important until alternate means of livelihood are available to cultivators.","Raman, T.

In Australia, members of the family have radiated across the landscape from rainforests, moist and dry eucalypt forests, heaths, alpine areas and deserts. Some 71 native taxa (in 14 genera) of Rutaceae occur in the Sydney Region, representing some 3% of the native vascular plant flora of the region. Species richness is greatest in heaths, woodlands and dry forests on sandstone derived soils. A number of species occur in moist forest, while a few species occur in riparian forests, rainforests or forests on clay soils or soils derived from granite. The most species rich genera are Boronia and Zieria (both 18 species). Fifteen species in the region are rare or threatened at the state or national level, with a further 2 species poorly known and likely candidates as threatened species. There are 17 species endemic to the Sydney region, 11 of which are rare or threatened. Most species flower in winter to spring with seeds released in October to December. There are two basic modes of dispersal in the family in the Sydney Region. Firstly, a few species, generally associated with rainforests, disperse seeds widely via fleshy fruits that are taken by birds and probably mammals. Secondly, most Rutaceae species have limited dispersal ability and have short range initial ballistic dispersal of seeds from fruits at maturity followed by secondary seed dispersal primarily by ants. In this latter group, seeds are generally dispersed less than a few metres. There is a high level of seed dormancy at seed release. Members of the Rutaceae are likely to have persistent soil seedbanks with germination linked to fire, except perhaps for species in rainforest or rainforest margins (where the nature of possible seedbanks is unknown). Heating of the soil during fire is one mechanism for breaking seed dormancy and allowing germination. Other mechanisms, i.e. smoke and the interaction of fire related germination cues may also be important. Fire is a widespread disturbance affecting vegetation in the Sydney Region. Within the Rutaceae in the Sydney region, a mixture of fire-sensitive and resprouting species occur, although details for many species are lacking. To maintain the floristic diversity in the family, effective management of such plant communities requires sufficient times between fires for seedlings to flower and replenish the soil seedbanks, as well as for juveniles of resprouting species to become fire-resistant. The ecology of Rutaceae species remains poorly understood, a pattern typical across Australia, with a few notable exceptions. There have been no comprehensive demographic studies of members of the family in Sydney, and only limited attempts to examine aspects of the biology of the species in the family. In particular, the seed biology and ecology of the family and the impact of fire on species are poorly understood. This review poses a number of questions for research on members of the Rutaceae.","Auld, Tony D.; Biodiversity Research Group, NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, PO Box 1967, Hurstville, NSW, 2220, Australia",tony.auld@npws.nsw.gov.au,,,0,5,,0,14,16,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0727-9620,,,,"Conservation; Reproduction; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 51512, Plant physiology - Reproduction","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Rutaceae [26685]; [Acronychia] [Asterolasia] [Boronia spp.] [Correa] [Crowea] [Eriostemon] [Geijera] [Leionema] [Melicope] [Nematolepis] [Phebalium] [Philotheca] [Sarcomelicope] [Zieria spp.]",,,,,"Sydney; New South Wales, Australia; Australasian region",,,,"reproductive ecology (flowering, seed dispersal)",,,,2018/06/21

Many of these creations lie within habitat conservation plan (HCP) sites, and they could play a more prominent role by being repositories for plants taken from a single site having site-specific genetics. Among others, one technique that increases initial resemblance to natural stands uses digitized, to-scale photography, which has been ground-truthed to verify vascular plant associations, which appear as mosaics on a landscape. A combination of placing patches of salvaged, mature canopy plants within larger matrices of imprinted or container plant plots appears to significantly enhance immediate use by CSS obligate bird species, accelerate ""spread"" or expansion of CSS, and can also introduce many epiphytic taxa that otherwise would be slow or unable to occupy developing CSS creations. Reptile, amphibian, butterfly, and rodent diversity in a salvaged canopy restoration case study at the University of California, Irvine, showed CSS species foraging and inhabiting transplanted canopy patches. Using restoration techniques to expand existing CSS stands has more promise than creating isolated patches, and the creation of canopies resembling CSS mid-fire cycle stands is now common. Gnatcatchers and other birds use restorations for foraging and occasional nesting, and in some cases created stands along ""biological corridors"" appear to be useful to bird movement. Patches of transplanted sage scrub shrubs along habitat edges appear to break up linear edge effects. There are no data on which long-term survival, succession, or postfire behavior can be predicted for CSS restoration sites, and postfire community changes are not part of either mitigation or restoration planning at present. Long-term planning including burning is needed so that a fire-adapted habitat will develop. Restoration is important in retaining genetic resources, for ameliorating edge effects, as habitat extenders in buffer zones around HCP sites, and by providing areas into which natural stands can expand.","Bowler, Peter A.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697-2525, USA",,,,9,56,,32,16,19,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0364-152X,,,,"Wildlife Management (Conservation); Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 00508, General biology - Institutions, administration and legislation; 00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 13202, Nutrition - General studies, nutritional status and methods; 64072, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: general; 03502, Genetics - General; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Amphibians, Animals, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Amphibia [85300]; [amphibians]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Lepidoptera [75330]; [butterflies]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Polioptila californica; California gnatcatcher; (threatened species)]/Plantae; Plants; Plantae [11000]; [plants]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Reptiles, Vertebrates; Reptilia [85400]; [reptiles]/Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Rodentia [86265]; [rodents]",,,,,,,,,"biological corridors, coastal sage scrub, ecological restoration, edge effects, foraging behavior, genetic resources, habitat conservation plans [HCPs], habitat loss mitigation, mid-fire cycle, plant salvage, site-specific genetics, species diversity, stand isolation, transplanted canopy patches",,,,2018/06/21

No noticeable shortening of the O-polysaccharide chains was observed in the LPSs isolated during the C. burnetii cultivation. However, a redistribution of the existing LPS populations has been observed due to an increasing prevalence of those cells in the whole cell population that express LPS molecules with truncated O-chains and those being of R-type. In the high and intermediate molecular weight LPS populations, virenose and dihydrohydroxystreptose are lost gradually with the progress in phase variation.

Link) is the only broom species that is a declared noxious weed in New Zealand. It was first recorded in the wild in 1872 and is now widespread and abundant on a range of soils (esp. of alluvial or colluvial origin), particularly the drier eastern side of the South Island and in central North Island. The range expansion of broom has been most dramatic over the last 50 years, but it continues to invade new areas. Broom grows more vigorously in many parts of New Zealand than in its native range, obtaining a greater maximum age and a larger size. It occupies open habitats, from sea level to 1200 m, invading native tussock grassland, introduced pasture, riverbed and wasteland throughout productive and conservation areas. Broom causes economic losses to agricultural and forestry operations, and detracts from conservation values. Establishment costs of exotic pine forests are increased by the need to clear broom from plantation sites, and reinvasion by the weed reduces the rate of pine growth. Broom is a serious invader of pastoral land, particularly in drier hill country areas, where substantial losses to agricultural production may result. In the South Island it has been estimated to occupy 0.92% of farmable land. In some situations grazing management can contain broom, and where further control is necessary, herbicides, although expensive are effective. Cutting and burning have also been recommended in certain situations. Habitat of nesting native birds on open riverbeds is threatened when broom and other scrub species invade and provide cover for predators. On the positive side, broom is regarded as a useful pollen source by New Zealand beekeepers. In some environments it can play a role in encouraging succession to native bush, and in some areas it may provide an important spring food source for the native pigeon. However, its negative environmental effects are much greater than its positive effects, and a recent update of the cost-benefit analysis for biological control of broom in New Zealand showed a clear net benefit from its control.","Fowler, Simon; Landcare Research, Auckland, New Zealand",,,,0,0,,0,1,1,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0815-2195,,,,"Pest Assessment Control and Management","54600, Pest control: general, pesticides and herbicides; 52518, Agronomy - Weed control; 00520, General biology - Symposia, transactions and proceedings","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Leguminosae [26260]; [Cytisus scoparius; broom; (weed)]",,,,,"New Zealand; Australasian region",,,,"economic losses (agricultural loss, forest plantation preparation costs) , range expansion, Meeting Paper",,,,2018/06/21

A database was assembled from 272 published and unpublished bird lists, and this was supplemented with records extracted from a systematic search of the primary ornithological literature. In excess of 7 000 records were located. The original forest avifauna (just before the impact of European settlers became pronounced) consisted of 112 breeding species (81 land, 31 water). Salient characteristics of this avifauna include: only 1 species is confined (as a breeding species) to the primaeval forest ecosystem; 53 species occur throughout the forests; 32 and 13 species are restricted to its eastern or southern portions respectively; most species occur extensively outside of the forests (66 species to the west, north, east and south; 33 species to the west, north and east); 52 per cent of landbird species are insectivores; about 20 per cent of the landbird fauna migrates from the forest in varying degrees in winter; 67 per cent of landbird species nest in the overstorey or understorey; and landbirds in streamside forests occur at higher densities than in upland forests. The distribution of 5 species - Leipoa ocellata (Malleefowl), Cacatua pastinator (Western long-billed corella), Atrichornis clamosus (Noisy scrub-bird), Falcunculus frontatus (Crested shrike-tit) and Rallus pectoralis (Lewin's rail) - is discussed in detail, with new or neglected information being provided. The landbird fauna of the primaeval forest is impoverished relative to elsewhere in the South West Land Division, particularly the region now known as the wheatbelt. The forests of south-west Western Australia have only about half of the number of bird species present in a similar-sized, comparable area in south-east Australia. The south-west forest avifauna is more similar to that present in the Mount Lofty Ranges (South Australia) than to the forest avifaunas of New South Wales or Tasmania. At local scales (1-100 ha), however, the number of landbird species present is similar in all forests in southern mainland Australia (20-25 breeding species). Overall density of bird populations in jarrah and karri forests is about one half of that in comparable forests in south-east Australia. Disturbances caused by European settlement have resulted in 4 species present in the primal forests contracting in geographical range, 2 species becoming extinct, and more than 90 species benefiting from provision of new habitats. Forest management has had limited impact on biodiversity and total abundance of birds. Prescribed burning under moist soil conditions has no impact on bird species richness in jarrah forest, but increases bird species richness in karri forest for 3-6 years. Total abundance of birds increases in both types of forest after prescribed burning. Planned burning under dry soil conditions increases both bird species richness and total abundance of birds. Wildfire reduces bird species richness. All of these changes are temporary. Thinning of jarrah forest does not change bird species richness, whereas cutting to gaps increases bird species richness. Clearfelling of karri forest initially reduces bird species richness; 12 years later about 85 per cent of the avifauna in mature stands is present in regrowth karri forest. Those species dependent on large hollows for nesting are unlikely to nest in unthinned regrowth forest younger than about 120 years. Open-cut mining for bauxite has a severe initial impact on bird species richness, but following rehabilitation there is a rapid return of bird species, with 85 per cent of species present before mining being recorded after 5 years. Species requiring large hollows for nesting cannot, however, nest in rehabilitated sites for many decades. The most severe, long term reduction in local bird species richness and total abundance is caused by dieback disease and by permanent removal of forest as in agriculture, urbanization, damming of rivers, and plantations of pine. However, an additional 75 species (51 land, 24 water) have been recorded within the forests following clearing for farming and towns. Of these species, 23 (17 land, 6 water) now breed, but only two of them (Aquila morphnoides Little eagle, Dacelo novaeguineae Laughing kookaburra) breed in forest. The policies and procedures in place to mitigate the impact of humans on the forest bird fauna and to promote the conservation of bird species are summarized. These include an extensive mosaic of protected areas (national parks, nature reserves, forest along roads, rivers and streams), a structural goal of 40 per cent of the forest being maintained at the mature or senescent stage, the retention of habitat trees for species dependent on hollows for nesting, and spatially and temporally diversified use of fire. Much of the ornithological literature about forest management impacts in the south-west forests was found to be based on misconceptions about, or lack of awareness of, silvicultural and fire science, policies and prescriptions. The erroneous impressions thus created are discussed. Available empirical data and other information synthesized in this review present a strong challenge to the proponents of fire and logging as causes of long term detrimental change in the forest avifauna. Several bird species are proposed for consideration as suitable indicators of ecologically sustainable forest management.

The decline of the malleefowl has been most pronounced in New South Wales, where foxes prey so heavily on malleefowl that adult mortality exceeds recruitment of young into the breeding population. Although young malleefowl are particularly vulnerable to foxes, sub-adults and adults are also taken. Within New South Wales, heavy predation by foxes occurs both in the remnants of native vegetation within agricultural lands and in the large tracts of mallee that lie further inland. Foxes appear to be the prime cause of malleefowl mortality throughout much of the malleefowl's geographic range. Both fire and grazing by domestic stock reduce the carrying capacity of the habitat for malleefowl. In reserves where stock are excluded, there is no evidence that food resources are limiting malleefowl populations. Exotic herbivores, such as goats and rabbits, probably contribute to the demise of the malleefowl by reducing vegetative cover. Malleefowl are particularly vulnerable to predation by raptors in habitats where vegetative cover is sparse. Greater canopy cover, together with greater stocks of seeds within the soil seed-bank, can explain why old-growth mallee is optimal habitat for malleefowl. Malleefowl survival can be enhanced substantially by fox control. Fox baiting, however, needs to be frequent, intensive and widespread to reduce fox density to levels where predation no longer threatens the survival or recovery of malleefowl populations. Poisoning of foxes on surrounding properties, together with effective rabbit and goat control, is needed to maximise the effectiveness of any fox-control program. Without conservation action, the steady decline and loss of extant populations will continue unabated. Improved survival of malleefowl in habitat thathas been intensively managed for their benefit is encouraging, but as yet there has been no definitive evidence of population recovery. In New South Wales, conservation efforts will need to focus on the expansive reserves of mallee in the west of the state. Conservation of malleefowl throughout its range is likely to be achieved only by the use of exclusion fencing to protect isolated populations in small remnants of native vegetation.","Priddel, D.; Wheeler, R.; NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, Hurstville, NSW, 2220, Australia",,,,0,1,,0,0,0,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation",0024-1652,,,,"Wildlife Management (Conservation)","07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 62518, Chordata: general and systematic - Aves; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods","Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Canidae [85765]; [Vulpes vulpes; European red fox; (predator)]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]; [Leipoa ocellata; malleefowl; (prey)]",,,,,"New South Wales; Australia; Australasian region",,,,"mortality, species decline",,,,2018/06/21

In order to develop such methods and assess risk, vegetation was collected from two sites on a soil-capped coal fly ash landfill near Dunkirk, New York, during June of 1991 and June and August of 1992. The mean concentrations (mug g-1 dry weight) of Se and Mo in the shoots did not exceed, respectively, 0.12 and 18.7 in bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), 0.06 and 12.1 in red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), 0.07 and 5.3 in timothy (Phleum pratense L.), and 0.09 and 2.2 in a mixture of grasses. These concentrations were greater than those in the same species harvested concurrently from a non-landfill site. The mean concentrations of B at the landfill ranged from 29 to 53 mug g-1 in the legumes and from 2 to 11 mug g-1 in the grasses, less than those at one non-landfill site but greater than those at another. Within the landfill, the concentration of Se in grasses was not correlated with the concentration of Se in soil and fly ash. The concentration of Se in grasses on both landfill sites was double that of grasses on the non-landfill site despite higher mean concentrations of Se in the upper soil (0-15 cm) on the non-landfill site. Therefore grass roots seem to be accessing Se from the ash by means of mass flow or other mechanisms. Based on our findings of significant variation in trace element uptake among species, harvests, and locations within sites, we recommend that contemporaneous transect sampling of at least two species be used to assess uptake of potentially toxic trace elements on landfills or other sites where contamination may occur.","Woodbury, Peter B.; Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Tower Road, Ithaca, NY, 14853-1801, USA",,,"Woodbury, Peter/0000-0003-3954-7639",0,8,,24,5,9,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Toxicology",0049-6979,,10.1023/A:1005008411336,,"Pollution Assessment Control and Management; Toxicology; Waste Management (Sanitation)","22506, Toxicology - Environment and industry; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 10060, Biochemistry studies - General; 37015, Public health - Air, water and soil pollution; 51522, Plant physiology - Chemical constituents; 37014, Public health - Sewage disposal and sanitary measures; 10069, Biochemistry studies - Minerals","Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [Phleum pratense; timothy]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Leguminosae [26260]; [Lotus corniculatus; bird's-foot trefoil] [Trifolium pratense; red clover]",,"boron; (pollutant, trace metal)/molybdenum; (pollutant, trace metal)/selenium; (pollutant, trace metal)/trace element; (uptake)",,,"Dunkirk; New York, USA, North America; Nearctic region",,,,"coal burning (pollution) , coal fly ash landfill (soil-capped) , environmental pollution, trace element uptake assessment (vegetation uptake)",,,,2018/06/21

We follow the fates of seeds and seedlings of the different pinon and juniper species within the woodlands from seed development to seedling establishment, and discuss the implications of this information for the past and present expansion of the woodlands. While seed development requires about two and one-half years in pinons, it is species-dependent in junipers and can take one, two, or even three years. Substantial seed losses can occur during seed development due to developmental constraints, and before or after seed maturation as a result of insects, pathogens, or predatory animals. In pinon pines, the primary seed dispersers are scatter-hoarding birds (corvids) and rodents that harvest seeds from the trees or after seed fall and cache them in the soil. In contrast, most junipers appear to be dispersed primarily by frugivorous birds and mammals that ingest the seeds and defecate them onto the soil surface. We have recently documented that scatter-hoarding rodents also disperse juniper seeds. Disperser effectiveness, or the contribution a disperser makes to the future reproduction of a plant population, may vary among species of pinons and especially junipers. Pinon seeds are short-lived and exhibit little dormancy, and they probably only germinate the spring following dispersal. Juniper seeds are long-lived and seed dispersal can occur over one or more years. Seed germination can be delayed for several years due to impermeable seed coats, embryo dormancy, or the presence of inhibitors. Seedling establishment of pinon pines is facilitated by nurse plants but, while junipers often establish beneath nurse plants, they are capable of establishing in open environments. In the southwestern United States, higher establishment of juniper occurs in open environments due to more favorable precipitation, and competition may be more important than facilitation in determining establishment. When considering the mechanisms involved in the past and present expansion of the woodlands, short-distance dispersal, local population growth, and long-distance dispersal are all important. Different classes of dispersers, some of which appear to have coevolved with the tree species, appear to be responsible for local (short-distance) vs. long-distance dispersal in pinons and junipers. Because ecotones form the interface between the woodlands and adjacent communities, they can provide valuable information on both the seed dispersal and seedling establishment processes responsible for tree expansion. Disturbance regimes and, recently, the effects of humans on those regimes have major effects on the expansion and contraction of the woodlands. Before Anglo-American settlement, fires occurred as frequently as every 50-100 years throughout much of the woodlands. During this century, fire frequencies have been reduced due to the indirect effects of livestock grazing and the direct effects of removing Native Americans from the ecosystem and implementing active fire-prevention programs. The result has been an increase in tree-dominated successional stages at the expense of grass-dominated stages. Various management techniques, including controlled burning and chaining, have been implemented to reduce tree dominance, but their effects depend largely on the life histories of the tree species and the disturbance characteristics. Several areas relating to the seed and seedling ecology of the pinon and juniper require additional research if we are to truly understand the dynamics of the woodlands.","Chambers, Jeanne C.; Rocky Mountain Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 920 Valley Road, Reno, NV, 89512, USA",,"Schupp, Eugene/F-1834-2010",,3,46,,197,75,97,,,"Developmental Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0006-8101,,10.1007/BF02856556,,"Development; Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 01500, Evolution; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 50518, Botany: general and systematic - Gymnospermae; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation; 51512, Plant physiology - Reproduction; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 13202, Nutrition - General studies, nutritional status and methods; 05500, Social biology and human ecology; 00532, General biology - Miscellaneous","Animalia; Animals; Animalia [33000]; [animals; (herbivore)]/Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [junipers; (seed, seedling)] [pinons; pinyons; (seed, seedling)]",,,,,"western North America; North America; Nearctic region",,,"cones; sensory system","adaptation, anthropogenic impact, disturbances, ecotone role, expansion, migration, pygmy woodlands, seed dispersal, seed ecology, seed germination, seed predation, seed production, seedling ecology, seedling establishment",,,,2018/06/21

During a 26 year period from 1972 to 1997, when three major and eight minor fires occurred, the density of Splendid Fairy-wrens Malurus splendens ranged from a high of 105 adults/100 ha in 1985 to 20 adults/100 ha in 1994. Both of these extremes followed periods of similar fire frequency (five fires in preceding 10 years). However, in the ten years before 1985, all fires were of limited extent, whereas the ten year period up to 1994 began with an extensive 100% hot summer burn, closely followed by two smaller reburns. The aftermath of the major fire in 1985 and subsequent minor fires had a major detrimental impact on populations of Splendid Fairy-wrens, Western Thornbills Acanthiza inornata, Scarlet Robins Petroica multicolor and Yellow-rumped Thornbills A. chrysorrhoa, all of which declined during the following eight years, even though the vegetation had nearly recovered to 1985 conditions. This continued decline in bird densities was related to increased mortality of breeding birds and lowered productivity, due to temporary cessation of breeding by Western Thornbills and to increased nest predation and parasitism in Splendid Fairy-wrens. In addition, the broad extent of the 1985 fire reduced opportunities for immigration from elsewhere. Understanding this avifaunal response to fire would not have been possible without an extended period of study. Any fire management plans based on just two or three years data might have yielded recommendations quite detrimental to the fauna they were designed to protect. For the species and habitats studied here, small, patchy burns on a well-spaced rotational basis are to be preferred over regular 'fuel reduction' burning of entire habitats, particularly in isolated areas where immigration is unlikely to occur. Once an entire area has been burnt, special care should be taken to prevent a reburn within at least the next 8-10 years.","Brooker, Michael G.; CSIRO Wildlife Ecol., Private Bag PO, Wembley, WA 6014, Australia",,,,0,9,,15,10,10,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0158-4197,,10.1071/MU98039,,"Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)","07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Acanthiza chrysorrhoa; yellow-rumped thornbill] [Acanthiza inornata; western thornbill] [Malurus splendens; fairy-wrens; (adult)] [Petroica multicolor; scarlet robins]",,,,,"Gooseberry Hill; Western Australia, Australia; Australasian region",,,,"fire, heathland (habitat)",,,,2018/06/21

The majority (> 70%) occur in fire-prone vegetation on nutrient-poor, summer-dry soils of south-western Australia. These species are characterised by large, winged seeds contained within serotinous follicles. Seed release is mediated by desiccation of the follicle walls resulting from fruit death, although wet-dry cycles are required in some genera. After release, germination must take place by the next wet season, as the seeds are not long-lived. Seeds are particularly high in protein (40-60%), P (1-2%) and Fe (10-60permill) compared with other Proteaceae. Seeds are favoured food for pre- and post-dispersal granivores (insects, birds, rodents) and young seedlings are favoured by herbivores (insects, marsupials), with the more serotinous fruits providing extra protection for their seeds. Successful establishment is facilitated by the protective and water retentive role of the testa during germination, and the remobilisation of N and P from the cotyledons to the seedling within 10 weeks of emergence. Drought stress reduces seedling establishment in otherwise favourable postfire microsites and prevents it (assisted by herbivores) in mature vegetation. Typically, < 10% of seeds released after fire become seedlings, and < 50% of these survive the first summer. Among fire-killed species, species that produce few seeds are more likely to have drought-resistant seedlings, often associated with larger seeds and/or needle-shaped leaves. Species that resprout after fire produce a few large viable seeds per plant, whereas fire-killed species produce many smaller seeds. Of all the Proteaceae, the ecology of woody-fruited species is best known, providing great scope for comparative biology studies.","Lamont, Byron B.; Sch. Environ. Biol., Curtin Univ.

Previous studies, however, have focused primarily on bow nest predation can change when landscapes become fragmented by agriculture rather than by logging. To determine if predation on artificial nests in forest patches was influenced by the surrounding landscape, we placed ground and shrub nests along the edge and interior of forest patches located in agricultural, logged, and contiguous forest landscapes within a single region of the southern boreal mixed wood forest of central Canada. Nest predators were identified using remotely triggered cameras and by marks left in plasticine eggs, whereas the relative abundance of nest predators such as corvids and small mammals was estimated by surveys and live-trapping. The percentage of ground nests destroyed at the edge and interior of patches in the logged and contiguous forest landscapes was significantly lower than at the edge or interior of patches in the agricultural landscape. No differences in predation rate were observed for shrub nests among landscapes. We attributed higher rates of predation in the agricultural landscape to higher densities of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in the interior and a greater diversity of predators along edges. The similarity in predation rate between logged and contiguous forest landscapes suggests that fragmentation caused by logging may result in little change in predator communities and in this respect, might be similar to fragmentation caused by natural disturbance regimes such as fire. In contrast, fragmentation by agriculture seems to have more serious consequences for nesting birds. Policy changes that limit the growth of agriculture in the southern boreal mixed wood forest are required to conserve the diverse avifauna of this region.","Bayne, Erin M.; Canadian Wildlife Serv., Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X4, Canada",,,"Bayne, Erin/0000-0002-0679-4521",4,77,,61,145,157,,,Forestry,0888-8892,,10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96135.x,,Forestry,"53500, Forestry and forest products; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 13202, Nutrition - General studies, nutritional status and methods; 52502, Agronomy - Miscellaneous and mixed crops","Rodentia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Sciuridae [86405]; [Tamiasciurus-hudsonicus; red squirrel]",,,,,"Canada; North America; Nearctic region",,,,"agriculture, artificial nest, forestry, landscape fragmentation, logging, predation",,,,2018/06/21

However, lowland habitats have been impacted by clearing and fragmentation of native forest types within the past 170 years. This paper considers the implications of loss and fragmentation of lowland eucalypt forests for birds in winter, by comparing the proportionate density of twelve selected species across 49 different cases representing a variety of structural habitat differences. There was little fragmentation effect on forest-dependant winter immigrant species down to about 10 ha. The smallest remnants had reduced proportionate abundances of forest-dependent species together with elevated abundances of two other species: Noisy Miner and Australian Magpie. Similar shifts in species composition occurred in association with a variety of types of change in native eucalypt forest, all involving alteration to physical structure incorporating reduction of foliage cover (at forest edges, in areas, without understorey, in regenerating forest, on slopes and ridges, and after fires). We consider the ecological processes that might underlie these patterns, and suggest that: (1) habitat selection, possibly mediated and/or reinforced by interference competition from Noisy Miners, is a key process in the study system in winter; (2) habitat loss, rather than fragmentation, is likely to be the main cause of regional declines in forest-dependent winter migrants; and (3) the management of habitat for winter migrant birds within lowland eucalypt forests of this region should focus on maintaining and improving: (a) the overall percentage of lowland area covered by native forest, and (b) factors associated with the structural integrity (canopy and understorey cover, fire frequency, retention of complete microtopographic gradients) of remnant forest areas irrespective of their size, at least down to about 10 ha.","Catterall, Carla P.; Kingston, Mark B.; Park, Kate; Fac.

The liberation of Prespa, a remote and rather socially isolated borderline area, from Ottoman occupation took place in 1912-13. Recent events in its environmental history have been forest clearings and human depopulation in the Civil War (1944-49), irrigation system construction in the 1960s, its 'discovery' by ornithologists in the late 1960s, the high emigration rates of 1960-1980, its designation as a National Park in 1974, the destructive development works of 1984-86 after Greece's entry to the EEC and the conversion to intensive bean cultivation in the mid 1980s. The human population of ca 7000 at the start of this century suffered an almost 80% decrease after the Civil War. A resettlement in the mid 1950s increased the population by 40% but in the 1970s emigration reduced it to its previous size of around 1500, still its present size. The extensive and diverse farming systems of previous centuries changed gradually after the construction of an irrigation network in the 1960s, which twenty years later and along with international changes in production and economy patterns, made possible the present day domination of a bean monoculture within irrigated croplands. This was accompanied by increased energy inputs, mechanisation and the use of chemicals. Intensification of agriculture brought increased incomes which attracted also livestock keepers, resulting in a 56% decrease in numbers of livestock in 1964-1993. Cattle are presently kept for meat production only. They graze on the mountains, and no longer in the meadows around the lakeshore. A local shorthorn breed accounting for 93% of all cattle in 1963 declined to less than 18% in 1993. Fishing aimed mainly at carp and Prespa bleak, continues today as in the past to be a source of supplementary income. Eighty-six per cent of the - mainly oak and beech - forests are State owned and the rest belong to local municipalities. The forest area has not changed essentially in the last 40 years, but forest roads have expanded. Forests provide mainly fuelwood for local needs and small quantities of industrial timber. No specific management is conducted to safeguard the conservation values of the forest, the majority of which consists of even aged coppiced stands with limited value for wildlife. Manufacturing never played an important role for the economy of the area. Tourism has increased in the last 20 years, concentrated mainly in summer and spring. Accommodation in the villages is not yet satisfactory though it has improved enormously in recent years. The National Park's infrastructure for visitors remains poor. Tourist pressure generally is not yet that high to impact drastically the social and environmental fabric. In places, hunting, angling and poaching can negatively affect the target species. The construction of the irrigation network in the eastern part of Lake Mikri Prespa was the most important change to the landscape and the habitats of Prespa the last 30 years. It resulted in the embankment of free-flowing streams, drainage of wet meadows and dramatic reduction of trees and hedges. In the last 15 years, the reedbeds, no longer burnt or mowed and assisted by increased nutrient loadings from agricultural runoff, have expanded landward to occupy formerly open, periodically flooded, areas. The above changes in habitats and land use have brought an impoverishment of biodiversity which can be seen in the extermination or the decrease in the numbers of certain plant and bird species.","Society Protection Prespa, 530 77 Agios Germanos, Greece",,,,0,43,,54,6,11,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation",0018-8158,,10.1023/A:1003093330400,,Conservation,"00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods","Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human]",,,,,,,,,"biodiversity, demography, economics, ecosystem, farming, habitat restoration, history, land use, legislation, resource management, water quality, wet meadows (habitat) , wildlife conservation",,,,2018/06/21

Previous checklists are reviewed, together with sightings accumulated over the 1992-1995 period during which approximately 70 new species have been added to the reserve inventory, bringing the total to 478. Occurrence across the 12 delineated habitats, relative abundance and sighting documentation are given for each species. The avifauna of the B.B.S. is mixed biogeographically; in addition to a substantial component of lowland birds widespread throughout South America, it is composed of Amazonian, cerrado and chaco elements also. Representation from the Bolivian Yungas is minimal. Significantly, no less than four threatened and 15 near-threatened species have occurred, including the little known Bolivian endemic Unicoloured Thrush Turdus haplochrous, and the enigmatic White-winged Nightjar Caprimulgus candicans, known until recently only from Emas National Park (Brazil). Short accounts are provided detailing records of all of these species. Birds of the reserve core, consisting largely of humid tropical forest formations inundated during the austral summer, appear not to be subjected currently to any serious environmental degradation, although some subsistence clearance by Chimane Indians in the northern reaches of the reserve gives some cause for concern. Of much greater import, however, are changes occurring outside the confines of the B.B.S. These include increasing urbanization immediately to the west (and associated road upgrading) and forest fragmentation to the south brought about by logging. The latter is especially worrying because linkage of the B.B.S. forest block to surrounding forest is already physically tenuous, and therefore it is imperative that future logging activities be geared to minimize isolation occurring and the damaging restriction of gene flow. Monitoring in rainforest immediately south of the reserve should become routine to warn of putative avifaunal impoverishments. Extensive surveying of the 2,500-ha El Porvenir estancia (savanna and related forest islands) due to be assimilated shortly into the B.B.S., which constitutes less than 1% of the area under consideration, has shown that it is used by no less than three threatened and up to nine near-threatened species. In the absence of data relating to other savanna areas (c. 15%) at present, the exact status of each species at the B.B.S. remains imprecise and begs for further research to be undertaken. Unfortunately, present management of the El Porvenir savanna is not conducive to the long-term maximization of populations of these species, several of which have local strongholds in this part of Beni. We recommend that the current policy of cattle ranching adopted by this estancia should cease or be reduced dramatically, to minimize grazing and trampling damage, and that measures should be taken to reduce incursions of fires started wilfully in neighbouring properties. The Academia National de Ciencias de Bolivia, which administers the reserve, should be encouraged to safeguard and enhance the savanna complement further by ensuring that the impending ratification of El Porvenir proceeds as quickly as possible, and by purchasing additional tracts of land to the south of the present southern reserve boundary, where feasible.

Selenium bioaccumulated in aquatic food chains and caused severe reproductive failure and teratogenic deformities in fish. Beginning in 1986, the electric utility company changed its ash disposal practices and selenium-laden wastewater no longer entered the lake. A survey of selenium present in the water, sediments, benthic invertebrates, fish, and aquatic birds was conducted in 1996. Concentrations were compared to pre1986 levels to determine how much change occurred during the decade since selenium inputs stopped. The data were also examined using a hazard assessment protocol to determine if ecosystem-level hazards to fish and aquatic birds had changed as well. Results reveal that waterborne selenium fell from a peak of 20 mu-g/liter before 1986, to lt 1 mu-g/liter in 1996; concentrations in biota were 85-95% lower in 1996. Hazard ratings indicate that high hazard existed prior to 1986 and that moderate hazard is still present, primarily due to selenium in the sediment-detrital food pathway. Concentrations of selenium in sediments have fallen by about 65-75%, but remain sufficiently elevated (14 mu-g/g) to contaminate benthic food organisms of fish and aquatic birds. Field evidence confirmed the validity of the hazard ratings. Developmental abnormalities in young fish indicate that selenium-induced teratogenesis and reproductive impairment are occurring. Moreover, the concentrations of selenium in benthic food organisms are sufficient to cause mortality in young bluegill and other centrarchids because of Winter Stress Syndrome. At the ecosystem level, recovery has been slow. Toxic effects are still evident 10 years after selenium inputs were stopped. The sediment-associated selenium will likely continue to be a significant hazard to fish and aquatic birds for years.","United States Forest Serv., Southern Res.

Some organisms such as fungi account for up to 15% of cases of prosthetic valve infective endocarditis, whereas organisms of the HACEK group (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H. aphrophilus, and H. paraphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae) cause 3% of community-acquired cases of infective endocarditis. Special techniques are necessary to identify these microorganisms. A history of contact with mammals or birds may suggest infection caused by Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Brucella species, or Chlamydia psittaci. A nosocomial cluster of postsurgical infective endocarditis may be caused by Legionella species or Mycobacterium species. If risk factors that are commonly associated with fungal infections (cardiac surgical treatment, prolonged hospitalization, indwelling central venous catheters, and long-term antibiotic use) are present, fungal endocarditis is possible. Patients with endocarditis and a history of periodontal disease or dental work in whom routine blood cultures are negative might have infection due to nutritionally variant streptococci or bacteria of the HACEK group. Communication between the microbiologist and the clinician is of crucial importance for identification of these microorganisms early during the course of the infection before complications such as embolization or valvular failure occur. In this article, we review the microbiologic and clinical features of these organisms and provide recommendations for diagnosis and treatment.","Steckelberg, James M.; Div.

Bee-pollination in which pollen is the sole reward is the dominant pollination system. Nectar has been best documented in Syzygium but probably also occurs in other bee-pollinated genera. The most common bee visitors are Apidae: Meliponinae and Bombinae. Bird- and mammal-pollination occur in Old World Syzygium with nectar as the primary reward. Bird-pollination with petals as the reward occurs in New World Acca and Myrrhinium. General floral morphology is veru uniform, while inflorescence types and flowering strategies are very diverse. Stigmas are dry and ovules are anatropous, hemicampylotropous or anacampylotropous and have an outer 2-6-layered integument and an inner 2-layered integument or a single integument. The ovary usually contains more ovules than will form seeds. Flowering strategies vary from mass-flowering types, in which the flowering episode typically takes only a few days, to steady-state types of up to 90 days duration. Flowering at dry/wet season transition is common in seasonal climates, and fire-induced flowering is found occasionally. Outbreeding is probably widespread, although both self-compatible and self-incompatible species exist. The self-incompatible species have self pollen tubes penetrating the micropyles, so preferential outcrossing may be maintained by a late-acting mechanism. Cryptic dioecy, which female flowers have ""mimic"" sterile anthers occurs in several genera. Apomixis occurs in Syzygium and this has been reported to be linked to the polyembryony found in this genus. Myrtoid fruits are fleshy berries or drupes, dispersed by birds, bats, and other small mammals. Fruit size, color, texture, and number of seeds are all very variable. Seed coats may be absent to bony, but have a smooth surface. The endosperm is mainly digested by the developing embryo. Early embryology is relatively uniform but final embryo morphology varies widely across the genera. Germination times vary from 10 days to over 2 years and seed viability periods from 15 days to 1 year.","Lughadha, E.

This represents about 10% of the native vascular plant flora of the region. These plants reach their greatest diversity in heaths, woodlands and dry forests on sandstone soils. Twenty-five species in the region are rare or threatened at the state or national level, including 15 local endemic species. Several introduced species, including Acacia species native to other parts of Australia, pose serious threats as environmental weeds. Fire is the most widespread disturbance affecting the Fabaceae in the Sydney region and a mixture of fire-sensitive and resprouting species occur, although details of how species vary in their response to different fires is lacking. Most species flower in winter to spring with seeds released in October to December. There is a high level of seed dormancy. Initial seed dispersal varies from passive to explosive, while secondary seed dispersal is primarily by ants, although distances seeds are dispersed are generally less than 10 metres. A few species are likely to be dispersed by other animals such as birds. Members of the Fabaceae are likely to have persistent soil seedbanks with germination linked to fire. Heating of the soil during the passage of a fire is the primary mechanism for breaking seed dormancy and allowing germination. Effective management of plant communities containing legumes needs to allow sufficient times between fires for seedlings to flower and replenish the soil seedbanks, as well as for juveniles of resprouting species to become fire-resistant. In addition, sufficient soil heating is needed during fires to break seed dormancy and allow germination after fires.","NSW Natl. Parks Wildlife Service, P.O.

In two of the stands, Scots pine seedlings that had naturally regenerated during the last 40 years were surveyed in relation to field- and bottom-layer vegetation. The most abundant forest floor species, viz. Cladina spp., occupied 41% of the ground cover and dominated the microhabitat of Scots pine seedlings ltoreq 10 years old. The second most common species, Pleurozium schreberi (Bird.) Mitt., which occupied 10 and 20% of the ground cover at the two sites, was, in contrast, only found to cover less than 3% of the microhabitat of the seedlings ltoreq 10 years old. With increasing age of seedlings ( gt 10 years), however, the cover of Cladina spp. significantly decreased and the cover of P. schreberi and various ericaceous species slightly increased. Thus Scots pine seedlings initially establish in lichen-dominated vegetation but as they develop P. schreberi and ericaceous species gradually become more abundant in the ground vegetation. The relationships between natural establishment patterns and microhabitat were further empirically tested by sowing seeds of Scots pine in patches of Cladina spp. and patches of P. schreberi. Seeding was performed in six sites during 3 consecutive years. A significant higher number of established Scots pine seedlings were found in Cladina spp. vegetation than in P. schreberi dominated vegetation, and Scots pine seedlings in P. schreberi experienced a significantly higher mortality. Laboratory studies indicated a negative chemical influence by P. schreberi on Scots pine seed germination but not on radicle growth of pregerminated seeds. The negative influence of P. schreberi on Scots pine seed germination and seedling survival in the field experiments is interpreted as an effect of moisture factors, chemical interference, and barriers of nutrient availability. Age structures of naturally established Scots pine showed evidence of continuous regeneration over the last 40 years. The study emphasizes the importance of biotically mediated regeneration patterns in explaining spatial stand structure and temporal dynamics in northern boreal Scots pine forest ecosystems during prolonged absence of fire. Tree regeneration tends not to be associated with mesoscale characteristics such as gaps and tip-up mounds, but rather with microhabitat conditions. The results have implications for predicting the effect of climatic warming.","Nilsson, Marie-Charlotte; Dep. Forest Vegetation Ecology, Swedish Univ. Agric. Sci., Fac.

The accuracy of the methods depends on how closely habitat mapping classes are linked to population demography. Habitat use by Florida Scrub jays (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) was quantified using circular plots. Habitat variation was mapped using high-resolution aerial Photography on a site where all Florida Scrub Jays were color-banded. Nest site selection, nest success, yearling production, and breeder survival were measured within Florida Scrub Jay territories. Habitat use was lowest in areas without scrub oaks or areas within 136 m from forests. Open oak, dominated by scrub oaks and open sandy areas, bad the highest use and nest success among habitats. Open oak occurred as narrow patches ( lt 20 m wide) in landscapes dominated by matrix habitat (palmetto-lyonia and swale marshes). Most wide patches ( gt 50 m) of open oak were potential population sources, where reproduction exceeded mortality. Areas with patches of open oak of less than 1 ha were usually population sinks. Open oak occurred as less flammable patches in a landscape subject to frequent fires. Population sources varied temporally and spatially with fires and site potential to support scrub oaks (soils). Analyses of landscape patterns and dynamics indicated that habitat mapping should not only include patches of currently optimal habitat but should also include landscapes associated with open oak. The influences of landscape patterns on habitat use, reproductive success, survival, and territory size can be quantified at different scales starting with attributes associated with habitat patches, nest sites, and territories. Potential mapping errors occur, however, when habitats are used to quantify the areal extent of sources and sinks and similar population attributes important for species persistence.","Breininger, David R.; Larson, Vickie L.; Duncan, Brean W.; Smith, Rebecca A.; Oddy, Donna M.; Dyn-2, Dynamac Corp., NASA Biomed.

A modeling framework is presented to develop production plans which maximize returns from livestock grazing and meet deer and quail habitat constraints on private rangelands in Oklahoma. In the initial solution of the model, net returns are maximized from cattle grazing without concern for wildlife habitat. An intensive vegetation management program involving herbicides and prescribed burning is used to reduce forage diversity (forbs, legumes, and woody shrubs) and maximize grass production for cattle grazing. Low to moderate deer and quail habitat ratings are associated with this plan. Optimal plans to achieve incremental increases in target quail and deer habitat ratings include strip application of herbicide, fail burning, and some mechanical removal of hardwoods to produce a mosaic of small open prairie areas and wooded areas. Brush piles and disking of small portions of the prairie areas are used to improve food diversity and protective cover. Only small reductions in income from livestock production are required to attain initial improvements in quail and deer habitat ratings; however, further improvements translate to more significant income reduction. While habitat appraisal models provide means of quantifying habitat considerations in economic optimization models, several limitations still exist. First, additional research is needed to verify the positive relationship between wildlife habitat and population and-to determine the relationship between hunting lease values and habitat quality. Application of the model requires rather meticulous detail in specifying the effects of various management practices on forage production and wildlife habitat. These data are not available for all areas; however, such information is required to develop efficient multiple-use management strategies (Matulich and Adams 1987). Also, the analysis does not consider the influence of dynamics or risk on decision making. Manipulation of vegetation is a dynamic process that may occur over several years and is significantly influenced by climatic events. Risk caused by price volatility and other sources of uncertainty may also influence ranch plans. Improvements to the model should focus on these considerations. While the findings are somewhat site specific, the study does present a useful and transferable framework for simultaneously analyzing livestock management and wildlife habitat decisions. The model can be specified to accommodate alternative livestock enterprises, vegetation management treatments, and habitat improvement practices for which the required technical data are available. The model may be expanded to incorporate additional wildlife species and is adaptable to accommodate alternative wildlife habitat evaluation systems. While probably more applicable to decision making on private lands, this model could also be applied to public grazing lands.","Div. Agric. Sci.

This period included 13 years of below-average rainfall, a number of minor wildfires and one that burnt 95% of the study area in January 1985. Annual survival of breeding males (mean = 70%) and females (mean = 59%) was higher during a period without fire. Survival of breeding females fell to less than 50% from 1987 to 1989, two years after the major fire. Survival of adults did not vary with age, but survival of juveniles was lower (mean = 31%) and variable (range 11-59%), particularly among those produced in the first breeding season after the fire in 1985. Splendid fairy-wrens bred during the Austral spring, with minor variation in length of the breeding season depending on rainfall at the start and temperature at the end of the breeding season. Clutch size varied little, but females laid more clutches in years when predation or brood parasitism were high, particularly in the two years after the major fire. Females produced a mean of 2.9 fledglings each season (4.7 in the best year), but productivity was low for several years after the 1985 fire. Helpers attended 60% of all nests but overall had little effect on annual fledgling production. Experienced females were more productive than novices, both with and without helpers. High reproductive effort, indexed by days nesting and caring for fledglings, did not reduce a female's chance of survival to the next breeding season, and annual reproductive effort was not correlated with female survival. Differential dispersal and mortality produced variation in the adult sex ratio. During the fire-free period 1978-84, the numbers of non-breeding males and females increased, because of a lack of available territories rather than a lack of available partners. Variation in natality and survival caused large variations in population density but the density of breeders was more constant (C.V. = 24%) than than of helpers (C.V. = 57%). No decline in the population after the major fire of January 1985 was apparent until the 1988 breeding season; the number of groups declined from 1988 to 1990, some previously occupied territories became vacant and group size decreased. This delayed decline in population is attributed to decreased production of fledglings in the years after the fire and the gradual replacement of experienced breeding females by novices, which were less productive and suffered higher mortality. The major causes of demographic variation (brood parasites and fire) directly affected natality and juvenile survival; indirectly, population density, age structure, sex ratio and group composition were affected. Delayed dispersal, the proximate cause of cooperative breeding in splendid fairy-wrens, is favoured by this demographic environment. The widespread occurrence of similar demographic profiles may in part explain the high frequency of cooperative breeding in Australian birds.","Russell, Eleanor M.; CSIRO Div.

J,BCI:BCI199395037032,,Article,,"Cross-scale morphology, geometry, and dynamics of ecosystems",,"Holling, C. S.",,,,,,,,,"Ecological Monographs",,1992,,62,4,447-502,447,502,English,,,,,,"This paper tests the proposition that a small set of plant, animal, and abiotic processes structure ecosystems across scales in time and space. Earlier studies have suggested that these key structuring processes establish a small number of dominant temporal frequencies that entrain other processes. These frequencies often differ from each other by at least an order of magnitude. If true, ecosystems therefore will have a few dominant frequencies that are endogenously driven and that are discontinuously distributed. This paper additionally tests the proposition that these structuring processes should also generate a discontinuous distribution of spatial structures coupled with the discontinuous frequencies. If that is the case, animals living in specific landscapes should demonstrate the existence of this lumpy architecture by showing gaps in the distribution of their sizes. This proved to be the case for birds and mammals of the boreal region forest and the short-grass prairie. Alternative hypotheses to explain the body mass clumps include architectural, developmental, historical, and trophic causes. These were all tested by comparing body-mass clump distributions (1) in ecosystems having different spatial structures (forest, grassland, and marine pelagic) and (2) in different animal groups having different body plans (birds and mammals) or feeding habits (carnivore, omnivore, and herbivore). The only hypothesis that could not be rejected is that the body-mass clumps are entrained by discontinuous hierarchical structures and textures of the landscape. There is evidence for at least eight distinct habitat ""quanta"", each defined by a distinct texture at a specific range of scales. These eight quanta together cover tens of centimeters to hundreds of kilometers in space and at least months to millennia in time. There is a striking similarity, but not identity, between the clump structure of prairie and boreal animals. This indicates that many processes that form qualitative habitat structure are common to both landscapes or ecosystems, but a few are landscape specific, particularly over larger scales. That conclusion is extended to all terrestrial ecosystems by an analysis of the body-mass clump structure of all North American birds. In contrast, there are striking differences in clump structure between landscapes and ""waterscapes"", indicating that fundamentally different processes shape structure in terrestrial and open ocean systems. The discontinuous body-mass structure provides a bioassay of discontinuous ecosystem structure. Mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores all show the same number of body-mass clumps, and the gaps in these distributions occur at the same body masses. Mammals and birds show the same number of body-mass clumps, but the mass gaps for mammals occur at larger sizes than those for birds in such a way that the log-transformed body-mass gaps for mammals are correlated linearly with those for birds. Hence there is a simple cross-calibration between the mammal and bird bioassays. I compiled and analyzed published data on home ranges in order to convert body masses into an absolute linear measure of geometric structures in the landscape. A new and general equation was developed relating home-range size to body mass, and was tested by reanalyzing published data for mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores and for birds. I conclude: (1) Birds and mammals of all trophic levels utilize resources in their foraging areas in the same way by measuring the spatial grain of habitat patches with a resolution defined as a function of their size (i.e. the animal's step length or minimum unit of measurement). The step length is a morphological function of the size of animals and is not significantly affected by trophic status or taxonomy of the groups considered. That explains why all trophic levels and both birds and mammals show the same qualitative body-mass clump structure. (2) Home-range data can convert the body-mass data to a quantitative estimate of texture, i.e., of fractal dimension of the landscape. The landscape forms a hierarchy that contains breaks in object sizes, object proximities, and textures at particular scales. Animals also demonstrate a hierarchy of decisions whose target suddenly shifts at specific scales in space and time. The interaction between these two hierarchies produces the discontinuous body-mass clump structure. The breaks in geometry in the landscape occur because structuring exert their influence over defined ranges of scale. The temporal and architectural structure of habitat quanta are in general determined by three classes of processes, each dominating over three different ranges of scale. Vegetative process that determine plant growth, plant form, and soil structure dominate the formation of texture at fine microscales of centimeters to ten of meters in space and days to decades in time. At the other, macroscale extreme, slow geomorphological processes dominate the formation of a topographic and edaphic structure at large scales of hundred to thousands of kilometers and centuries to millennia. At the mesoscales in between, contagious hundreds to thousands of kilometers and centuries to millennia. At the mesoscales in between, contagious disturbance processes such as fire, insect outbreak, plant disease, and water flow dominate the formation of patterns over spatial scales of hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers. In addition, the direct impacts of grazing by large herbivores and of human activities, and the indirect effects of large predators and animal disease, further transform spatial patterns over these meso-scales. These processes operate on time scales of years to decades, making them critically important in determining whether present local, regional, and global human influences will trigger a transition in vegetation types, and, if so, how rapidly. The paper provides a direction for the development of programs to evaluate, monitor, and predict ecosystem and community changes across scales. The necessary research elements include (1) models that incorporate a few scale-dependent structuring processes to allow cross-scale analysis; (2) comparative studies of different disturbed and undisturbed landscapes using the animal body-mass bioassay technique to identify critical scales of ecosystem geometry; (3) analysis of remote imagery to identify spatial discontinuities and regions of scale invariance: and (4) behavioral studies of the hierarchy of animal decisions to identify species groups vulnerable to predicted (using models) or observed (using remote imagery) changes in vegetation geometry.","Arthur R.

Experiments were performed on the isolated lumbosacral cord maintained in vitro. Intracellular and whole cell patch clamp recordings obtained from sartorius (primarily a hip flexor) and femorotibialis (a knee extensor) motoneurons showed that both classes of cell are depolarized simultaneously during each cycle of motor activity. Sartorius motoneurons generally fire two bursts/cycle, whereas femorotibialis motoneurons discharge throughout their depolarization, with peak activity between the sartorius bursts. Voltage clamp recordings revealed that inhibitory and excitatory synaptic currents are responsible for the depolarization of sartorius motoneurons, whereas femorotibialis motoneurons are activated principally by excitatory currents. Early in development, the dominant synaptic currents in rhythmically active sartorius motoneurons appear to be inhibitory so that firing is restricted to a single, brief burst at the beginning of each cycle. In E7-E13 embryos, lumbosacral motor activity could be evoked following stimulation in the brainstem, even when the brachial and cervical cord was bathed in a reduced calcium solution to block chemical synaptic transmission. These findings suggest that functional descending connections from the brainstem to the lumbar cord are present by E7, although activation of ascending axons or electrical synapses cannot be eliminated. Ablation, optical, and immunocytochemical experiments were performed to characterize the interneuronal network responsible for the synaptic activation of motoneurons. Ablation experiments were used to show that the essential interneuronal elements required for the rhythmic alternation are in the ventral part of the cord. This observation was supported by real-time Fura-2 imaging of the neuronal calcium transients accompanying motor activity, which revealed that a high proportion of rhythmically active cells are located in the ventrolateral part of the cord and that activity could begin in this region. The fluorescence transients in the majority of neurons, including motoneurons, occurred in phase with ventral root or muscle nerve activity, implying synchronized neuronal action in the rhythm generating network. Immunocytochemical experiments were performed in E14-E16 embryos to localize putative inhibitory interneurons that might be involved in the genesis or patterning of motor activity. The results revealed a pattern similar to that seen in other vertebrate with the dorsal horn containing neurons with .gamma.-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-like immunoreactivity and the ventral and intermediate regions containing neurons with glycine-like immunoreactivity.","O'DONOVAN M; SECTION DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOL, LAB NEURAL CONTROL, NINDS, NIH, BETHESDA, MD 20892, USA",,,,0,0,,43,42,52,,,"Cell Biology; Developmental Biology; Physiology; Neurosciences & Neurology",0022-104X,,10.1002/jez.1402610306,,"Cell Biology; Development; Muscular System (Movement and Support); Nervous System (Neural Coordination)","01056, Microscopy - Histology and histochemistry; 02506, Cytology - Animal; 11104, Anatomy and Histology - Experimental anatomy; 12100, Movement; 17504, Muscle - Physiology and biochemistry; 20504, Nervous system - Physiology and biochemistry; 25508, Development and Embryology - Morphogenesis; 34502, Immunology - General and methods","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]",,,,,,,,,"CELLULAR MECHANISMS SYNAPTIC MECHANISMS SARTORIUS FEMOROTIBIALIS MOTONEURON IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY ABLATION EXPERIMENTS",,,,2018/06/21

In The Netherlands, visible bird migration was recorded at twelve observation sites (four of which situated along the North Sea coast) during 1 409 hours from September to December, 1989 (tab. 1, fig. 1). Comparable information from observation and ringing sites elsewhere in Europe was gathered. Notably large numbers of Coal Tits were recorded in The Netherlands in the third decade of September (dozens of birds per site per hour, all over the country). Two waves of birds passed in the course of October. The first occurred during the first week of the month (300 birds/h along the coast, 35 birds/h at inland sites), the second peaked on October 17 (1 100 birds/h along the coast, 50 birds/h at inland sites, fig. 2, a and b). The first wave consisted mainly of Coal Tits, but during the second wave they were accompanied by Blue and Great Tits. The two waves are considered to have consisted mainly of adult (first) and juvenile (second) birds. The first flocks were observed about half an hour before sunrise, and migration usually peaked between 07h00 and 08h00 (fig. 5). Mean flock size correlated positively with mean number of birds observed per hour, except for the last two hours of the day when relatively large flocks were observed. In appears that two separate Coal Tit-irruptions affected Europe in autumn 1989: one originated from the taiga zone, the other from northern Germany plus western Poland, and the two differed with respect to timing. Examination of Coal Tits caught in The Netherlands at the time (wing-length, back colour, moult of greater coverts) showed that these birds originated from northern Germany and Poland (Wijker 1991). This irruption coincided with one of Goldcrests and Firecrests, which may have come from the same geographical area. The Coal Tit irruption to western Europe reached France, the northern Alps and Austria. Mean travelling speed of these birds is calculated to have been about 30 km per day. It is estimated that c. 725 000 birds passed through The Netherlands, and c. 2.3 million through western Europe. The other irruption, originating from the taiga zone, reached southern Finland, the Baltic republics and Poland. In this irruption birds travelled approximately 40 km per day. It is not possible to estimate the number of birds that participated in this irruption, since quantitative data are lacking. Generally, food shortage and unusually high population density (following a mild winter, a high breeding population density and/or a successful breeding season) are considered the causes of irruptions. Food shortage probably affects taiga zone Coal Tit populations especially. This may result in irruptions occurring relatively early in autumn, and characterised by a high overall percentage of adult birds (order 20-50%), and two separate migration peaks (adults first, juveniles later). The 1989 Coal Tit irruption in western Europe, however, was characterised by a relatively late timing, and (overall) a very small fraction of adult birds (3%). These features are considered characteristic of an irruption resulting from a high population density. Indeed, breeding population density (Netherlands, FRG, Switzerland, Estonia) and breeding success (Netherlands) are known to have been high in 1989, and, furthermore, conifer seed production was at least normal (FRG) that year. It is therefore concluded that the 1989 Coal Tit irruption in western Europe resulted from unusually high population densities (northern Germany, Poland) that year. Some earlier Coal Tit irruptions in western Europe are known to have been characterised by either low (1959, 1972) or high (1967, 1969) percentages of adult birds (Scherrer 1972, Winkler 1974). We consider these irruptions to have been caused by high population densities, and by food shortage (probably in the taiga zone), respectively.","VAN GASTEREN H; MOERWATER 27, 2715 GM ZOETERMEER",,,,0,0,,0,0,0,,,"Behavioral Sciences; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Nutrition & Dietetics",0024-3620,,,,"Behavior; Biogeography (Population Studies); Nutrition; Systematics and Taxonomy","07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 12100, Movement; 13202, Nutrition - General studies, nutritional status and methods; 13203, Nutrition - Malnutrition and obesity; 62518, Chordata: general and systematic - Aves; 62800, Animal distribution -","Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]",,,,,,,,,"GOLDCREST FIRECREST CONIFER SEED TAIGA ZONE ADULT JUVENILE POPULATION DENSITY FOOD SHORTAGE ZOOGEOGRAPHY GERMANY POLAND",,,,2018/06/21

In the younger plants, canopy seed storage was highest in B. coccinea. However, 21-year-old B. coccinea stored an order of magnitude fewer seeds than the other species and no more than young B. coccinea. Seed storage per year increased exponentially with plant age in B. speciosa and B. baxteri, whereas a quadratic function, peaking at 16 years, best described seed storage in B. coccinea. Degree of serotiny was lowest in B. coccinea. Seed abortion did not vary between age cohorts but was highest in B. coccinea. Granivory ranged from 18 to 42% and was highest in the older plants and in B. baxteri. Cockatoos removed about 20% of cones in B. baxteri and B. coccinea and 10% in B. speciosa. Experimental cone removal accelerated follicle opening, especially in B. coccinea, irrespective of whether cones were placed in the ground (simulating cockatoo removal) or reattached to the plant (simulating plant death). Half the 21-year-old B. coccinea were dead and the remainder were considered senescent, as most branches showed dieback and cone fertility had fallen to 8%. Death of the other species was negligible, with cone fertility rising to a mean of 45% (B. speciosa) and 66% (B. baxteri). Interfire establishment was significant only in B. coccinea.

We inferred from the repeated surveys that this population increase of 10.1% over a 7-year period was significant (P < 0.05). Our inference was supported by (1) documentation of colonization (new clans using new colony sites) in both surveyed and nonsurveyed compartments; (2) an actual increase in number of clans in surveyed compartments; and (3) an actual increase in the number of clans in a group of nonsurveyed compartments. Fourteen of 19 new clans were occupying new colony sites < 400 m to 2,440 m from an adjacent colony. Two of these 14 colonizations were observed to be formed by pioneering, and were 520 m and 1,530 m from another colony. Either pioneering or budding was suspected in the formation of the 12 remaining new colonies, depending upon the distance the new colony was from another colony. Although only 1% of males were estimated to have colonized, colonization appears to be an important factor in the population biology of the species. The population increase was attributable to: (1) a large inventory of pine sawtimber, (2) availability of old trees for cavity excavation, (3) control of hardwood midstory with prescribed fire, (4) protection of cavity trees, and (5) provision of adequate foraging habitat. The lack of any of these factors probably would have prevented a population increase. Despite a net increase in number of clans, colonies were being abandoned at a rate of 1.1% annually. This loss was thought to be caused by encroachment of hardwood and pine midstories around cavity trees.","HOOPER R G; USDA FOREST SERV, SOUTHEASTERN FOR EXP STN, 2730 SAVANNAH HIGHWAY, CHARLESTON, SC 29414, USA",,,,0,4,,35,18,20,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Biodiversity & Conservation",0091-7648,,,,"Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Systematics and Taxonomy; Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 01008, Methods - Field methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 62518, Chordata: general and systematic - Aves","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Piciformes [85552]",,,,,,,,,"ENDANGERED SPECIES HABITAT MANAGEMENT SURVEY",,,,2018/06/21

DC-coupled recordings from sartorius (a flexor) and femorotibialis (an extensor) muscle nerves revealed that both sets of motoneurons were depolarized at the same time in each cycle even when the motoneurons fired out of phase. Sartorius motoneurons fired briefly on the rising phase of the depolarization and then stopped firing before discharging a second burst of spikes as the depolarization decayed. By contrast, femorotibialis motoneurons fired at the peak of their depolarization, which was coincident with the interruption in sartorius activity. Intracellular recordings from antidromically identified motoneurons confirmed that flexor and extensor motoneurons were depolarized at the same time during each cycle of activity. The discharge of femorotibialis motoneurons, and others presumed to be extensors, followed changes in membrane potential so that maximal firing occurred during peak depolarization. The relationship between discharge and membrane potential was different in sartorius motoneurons (and in others presumed to be flexors) because they fired briefly on the rising phase of the depolarization and then stopped firing during peak depolarization. In some of these cells firing resumed as the membrane potential decayed back to rest. Intracellular injection of depolarizing current into sartorius motoneurons during motor activity reversed the direction of the membrane potential change from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing during the pause in sartorius discharge. In addition, the discharge evoked by the depolarizing current was blocked during the reversed part of the synaptic potential revealing its inhibitory nature. The occurrence of the IPSP was accompanied by a large reduction in motoneuronal input impedance. Injection of depolarizing current steps into motoneurons produced steady firing with no evidence of a pause in discharge, indicating that the depolarization accompanying synaptic activity was not responsible for the pause in firing of flexor motoneurons. These results suggest that flexor and extensor motoneurons receive a similar depolarizing drive from a common set of excitatory premotor interneurons. The alternating pattern of flexor and extensor discharge is produced, in part, by the timing of a depolarizing IPSP coincident with extensor activity that silences flexor discharge. The inhibition of motoneuron discharge that accompanies the IPSP appears to be mediated by a shunt conductance that prevents action potential generation.","O'DONOVAN M J; LAB NEURAL CONTROL, ROOM 5A-31, BUILD 36, NINDS, NIH, BETHESDA, MD 20892, USA",,,,0,0,,53,82,94,,,"Cell Biology; Developmental Biology; Physiology; Neurosciences & Neurology",0270-6474,,,,"Cell Biology; Development; Membranes (Cell Biology); Muscular System (Movement and Support); Nervous System (Neural Coordination)","02506, Cytology - Animal; 10502, Biophysics - General; 10508, Biophysics - Membrane phenomena; 12100, Movement; 17504, Muscle - Physiology and biochemistry; 20504, Nervous system - Physiology and biochemistry; 25502, Development and Embryology - General and descriptive","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]",,,,,,,,,"EMBRYONIC MOTILITY MEMBRANE POTENTIAL",,,,2018/06/21

In 1987 there were only 40 pairs, of which 20 were on the isles of Sylt and Fohr. The little number includes a few isolated pairs in North-Frisia, Eiderstedt and Dithmarschen. The sandy uplands in northern Schleswig-Holstein as well as the eastern hills around the Schwansener lake and the Oldenburger fault are occupied by 10 pairs each. The decline began sometime between 1960 and 1965 and increased rapidly after 1975. Pictures and tables 1 and 2 inform in detail about this happening. The formerly considerable wintering population can be considered as practically extinct. The main breeding distribution centred in farmlands with fertile soil in the west and east of the province (fig. 1). Fewer Corn Bunting settled on the sandy uplands with their less fertile soil. Unspoiled beach and lake meadows as well as variety of heaths are usually inhabitted only by isolated pairs. Different causes of decrease are discussed which all in the final analysis have to do with intensivied farming methods. The lack of food in autumn and winter is possibly the most important factor. This lack is caused by the use of herbicides, the elimination of the field borders, the mowing of the edges of paths and roads, the burning of fields and their immediate plowing under, decreased corn supply thanks to the use of modern combines. Apparently many Corn Buntings have starved to death or have perished as results of undernourishment.","BUSCHE G; HOCHFELDER WEG 49, D-2240 HEIDE",,,,0,0,,0,12,13,,,"Agriculture; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology",0049-6650,,,,"Agronomy (Agriculture); Biogeography (Population Studies); Conservation; Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Pest Assessment Control and Management; Systematics and Taxonomy; Toxicology","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 10060, Biochemistry studies - General; 22506, Toxicology - Environment and industry; 23001, Temperature - General measurement and methods; 52504, Agronomy - Grain crops; 54600, Pest control: general, pesticides and herbicides; 62518, Chordata: general and systematic - Aves; 62800, Animal distribution -","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]",,,,,,,,,"DISTRIBUTION INTENSIVE FARMING HERBICIDE FIELD BURNING LOCAL EXTINCTION",,,,2018/06/21

At the study site, the canopy-stored seed bank built up exponentially with plant age to yield a mean of 830 viable seeds per plant from about 212,000 ovules produced over 16 years. Seed availability was the net result per year of number of flower heads, extent of head removal by cockatoos, number of florets per head and number of fruits (follicles) per floret in the production phase and the extent of seed abortion, insect granivory, seed senescence and spontaneous seed release in the mortality phase. Plants are killed by fire and a substantial proportion of cones was consumed by a hot fire. Up to 87% of viable seed may survive and be released within 100 days of a fire, depending on intensity and season of burn. Plants which died in the absence of fire released little viable seed subsequently, while the remainder were consumed when fire occurred. Comparison of 25 reproductive attributes between B. burdettii and another two Banksia species occurring in the vicinity indicated that it has much in common with these serotinous, non-sprouters. Although viable canopy-stored seeds account for few of the original ovules, reproductive inefficiency, once a fire interval of 10 years is exceeded, cannot explain the restricted distribution of this species.","LAMONT B B; SCH BIOL, CURTIN UNIV TECHNOL, PERTH, WA 6001, AUSTRALIA",,,"Lamont, Byron/0000-0001-9279-7149",0,8,,24,50,54,,,"Developmental Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Reproductive Biology",0067-1924,,10.1071/BT9880193,,"Development; Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Reproduction","07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 24500, Gerontology - ; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation; 51512, Plant physiology - Reproduction","Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Proteaceae [26620]/Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Insecta [75300]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Psittaciformes [85558]",,,,,,,,,"BANKSIA-BURDETTII INSECT GRANIVORY COCKATOO DAMAGE AUSTRALIA SENESCENCE VIABILITY DISTRIBUTION",,,,2018/06/21

Examination of specimens indicated that death from striking the tower or guy wires, burning in the flare, or toxic agents (contracted previously) was unlikely for the majority of the casualties. Recommendations to minimize the occurrence of bird kills at flare stacks and to assist in documenting the occurrence and significance of such mortalities include processing and selling sour gas rather than flaring, mandatory reporting of bird kills at industry flare stacks, contingency plans to ensure quick and thorough analysis of dead birds and increased evaluation of methods used to detect traces of gaseous irritants in animals.","BJORGE R R; ALBERTA FISH AND WILDL DIV, 4901-48 ST, RED DEER, ALBERTA T4N 6M4, CANADA",,,,0,4,,0,5,7,,,"Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physiology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Respiratory System; Toxicology",0008-3550,,,,"Climatology (Environmental Sciences); Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Physiology; Pollution Assessment Control and Management; Respiratory System (Respiration); Toxicology","07504, Ecology: environmental biology - Bioclimatology and biometeorology; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 12508, Pathology - Inflammation and inflammatory disease; 12510, Pathology - Necrosis; 15010, Blood - Other body fluids; 16006, Respiratory system - Pathology; 22506, Toxicology - Environment and industry; 37015, Public health - Air, water and soil pollution","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]",,,,,,,,,"PASSERINE STACK EMISSION PULMONARY CONGESTION EDEMA",,,,2018/06/21

Only at refuges has wildlife conservation been legislated to have higher priority than either recreational or commercial activities. Presently, private ranchers and farmers graze cattle on 981,954 ha and harvest hay on 12,021 ha at 123 National Wildlife Refuges. USA Fish and Wildlife Service policy is to permit these uses primarily when needed to benefit refuge wildlife. To evaluate the success of this policy, I surveyed grassland management practices at the 123 refuges. The survey results indicate that in fiscal year 1980 there were 374,849 animal unit months (AUMs) of cattle grazing, or 41% more than was reported by the Fish and Wildlife Service. According to managers' opinions, 86 species of wildlife are positively affected and 82 are negatively affected by refuge cattle grazing or haying. However, quantitative field studies of the effect of cattle grazing and haying on wildlife coupled with the survey data on how refuge programs are implemented suggest that these activities are impeding the goal of wildlife conservation. Particular management problems uncovered by the survey include overgrazing of riparian habitats, wildlife mortality due to collisions with cattle fences, and mowing of migratory bird habitat during the breeding season. Managers reported that they spend $919,740 administering cattle grazing and haying; thus refuge grazing and haying programs are also expensive. At any single refuge these uses occupy up to 50% of refuge funds and 55% of staff time. In light of these results, prescribed burning may be a better wildlife management option than is either cattle grazing or haying.","STRASSMAN B I; MUSEUM ZOOL, UNIV MICH, ANN ARBOR, MICH 48109, USA",,,,1,10,,53,6,6,,,"Agriculture; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Government & Law",0364-152X,,10.1007/BF01867177,,"Animal Husbandry (Agriculture); Conservation; Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Government and Law; Wildlife Management (Conservation)","00508, General biology - Institutions, administration and legislation; 00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 12100, Movement; 26504, Animal production - Feeds and feeding","Artiodactyla, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Artiodactyls, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Bovidae [85715]",,,,,,,,,"GRASS BIRD FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE REGULATORY AGENCIES GOVERNMENT AGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ECONOMICS COST PRESCRIBED BURNING ENVIRONMENTAL LAW CATTLE INDUSTRY FEED INDUSTRY",,,,2018/06/21

Some are associated with darkened mammoth and bird fossils, and these fossils have been considered as having been burned by early man. Reevaluation of these so-called ""fire areas"" indicates that the above phenomena are the result of low-temperature (.ltoreq. 100.degree. C), nonheating processes occurring in groundwater. Evidence for this conclusion is derived from field observations on fossil carbonized vegetation, and the geology of the areas. Additional evidence derives from experiments on the red sediments and fossil wood, X-ray diffraction analyses, magnetic analyses, studies on the clay minerals smectite and illite, and the demonstration that fossil mammoth bone contains sufficient Fe and Mn to account for their discoloration. Much of the carbonization of vegetation probably occurred in water rather than in fire. Radiocarbon dates from the islands will probably need to be reevaluated.

Rates of seed removal by ants usually are measured by recording removal from artifical seed baits, but the reliability of this approach has not been tested, nor have there been many attempts to integrate the results with the activity of seed-eating ants. This paper describes the rates of seed removal, estimated using a baiting technique that is tested for its reliability, by the seed-eating ants in adjacent heath and woodland sites at Wilson's Promontory, Victoria. Ants removed up to 100% of seeds, but rates varied according to seed species, size of seed clumps, season, time of exposure, and other aspects of the baiting technique. Methodological guidelines are provided to make baiting conditions approximately those likely to occur in nature. Seed-eating ants, particularly species of Rhytidoponera, Chelaner and Pheidole, were by far the most important post-dispersal seed predators, and patterns of seed removal were directly related to their composition, abundance and foraging behaviour. Lygaeid bugs were also observed eating seeds, but there was no evidence of seed predation by rodents or birds. The results suggest that seed predation by ants can substantially deplete seed reserves; however, its actual effect on seedling recruitment is likely to depend on many factors including seed size, crop size, weather, timing and location of seed fall, availability of alternative food sources, patterns of seedling mortality, and fire, none of which have been adequately investigated.","ANDERSEN A N; SCHOOL OF BOTANY, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA",,"Andersen, Alan/F-8763-2010","Andersen, Alan/0000-0003-1487-3323",0,11,,38,55,58,,,"Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Physiology",0307-692X,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.1985.tb00900.x,,"Behavior; Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Nutrition; Physiology","01008, Methods - Field methods; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07504, Ecology: environmental biology - Bioclimatology and biometeorology; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 13202, Nutrition - General studies, nutritional status and methods; 51512, Plant physiology - Reproduction; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Hymenoptera [75326]",,,,,,,,,"PHYTIDOPONERA CHELANER PHEIDOLE FORAGING BEHAVIOR TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION ABUNDANCE SEASONALITY",,,,2018/06/21

NATIVE AND INTRODUCED BIRDS",,"MCILROY J C",,,,,,,,,"Australian Wildlife Research",,1984,,11,2,373-386,373,386,English,,,,,,"Birds in Australia vary greatly in their sensitivity to 1080 poison (sodium monofluoroacetate). Median lethal doses (LD50) range from 0.63 mg kg-1 for red-browed firetails, Emblema temporalis, to approximately 278 mg kg-1 for the emu, Dromaius novaehollandiae. Significant differences occur between the sensitivity of different groups of birds and may be related to differences in their metabolic rates. A few species may also have developed a tolerance to 1080 from being exposed to indigenous plants that contain fluoroacetate, or to insects and other animals which have fed on such plants. The most common signs of 1080 poisoning among birds are depression, fluffed feathers, a reluctance to move and convulsions. Signs of poisoning first appeared among the species tested at 1-60 h after dosing, and deaths follow between 1 h to almost 11 days after dosing. The susceptibility of 48 spp. of birds in Australia to 1080 poisoning is discussed in relation to typical baits and poison concentrations used against vertebrate pests. Theoretically, fewer types of birds are likely to be at risk from dingo [Canis familaris]-poisoning than pig [Sus scrofa]-poisoning campaigns that also use meat baits but higher concentrations of 1080. Individuals of 39 of the 48 spp. could be at risk from rabbit [Oryctolagus cuniculus] and other pig-poisoning campaigns. The impact on bird populations will depend, among other factors, on the amount of bait individuals eat and on the poisoning methods employed.","MCILROY J C; DIV WILDLIFE AND RANGELANDS RES, CSIRO, PO BOX 84, LYNEHAM, ACT 2602, AUSTRALIA",,,,0,2,,35,42,46,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Toxicology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0310-7833,,,,"Pest Assessment Control and Management; Pollution Assessment Control and Management; Systematics and Taxonomy; Toxicology; Wildlife Management (Conservation)","07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 10060, Biochemistry studies - General; 12504, Pathology - Diagnostic; 12510, Pathology - Necrosis; 22501, Toxicology - General and methods ; 22506, Toxicology - Environment and industry; 37015, Public health - Air, water and soil pollution; 51522, Plant physiology - Chemical constituents; 54600, Pest control: general, pesticides and herbicides; 62518, Chordata: general and systematic - Aves; 62520, Chordata: general and systematic - Mammalia; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Plantae; Plants; Plantae [11000]/Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Insecta [75300]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Casuariiformes [85516]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]/Artiodactyla, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Artiodactyls, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Suidae [85740]/Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Canidae [85765]/Lagomorpha, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Lagomorphs, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Leporidae [86040]",,"SODIUM MONOFLUOROACETATE",,,,,,,"EMBLEMA-TEMPORALIS DROMAIUS-NOVAEHOLLANDIAE SUS-SCROFA CANIS-FAMILIARIS ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS PLANT INSECT NONTARGET ORGANISM VERTEBRATE PEST CONTROL BAIT SODIUM MONO FLUORO ACETATE SYMPTOM/",,,,2018/06/21

Active nests (561) of 18 CNB species, including 9 excavators, were located. Characteristics of nest trees were compared among bird species and to a sample of available trees using univariate and multivariate analyses. Overall, 72% of the nests were in standing dead trees (snags); only 7% of available standing trees were dead. Compared to available trees, nest trees were larger in diameter, surrounded by a larger number of snags > 23 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), had more bark cover, and were more often broken-topped white fir (Abies concolor). Diameter was the most consistently important difference observed between nest trees and trees available to each bird species. Comparisons of nest sites among bird species showed that tree height varied most. Interspecific differences in nest hole height were completely explained by these tree height differences. Bird species also differed in their preferences for tree decay-states. Bark-gleaning species tended to nest in well decayed, softer snags; timber-drilling species nested in sounder snags. These differences suggested that little interspecific competition for nest sites occurred in this bird community. Most (67%) of the nest cavities occupied by nonexcavators were created by excavators (woodpeckers and nuthatches). Brown creepers (Certhia americana) did not depend on excavators for holes and chose trees that were different from those of other CNB. Foraging behavior observations (1026) of 10 bird species were recorded. All species except brown creepers and pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea) and red-breasted nuthatches (S. canadensis) foraged on snags more often than predicted from snag availability. Birds preferred to forage on trees 23-53 cm dbh; morphologically similar species tended to feed at different tree heights. Differences in foraging method, rather than differences in microhabitat, were more responsible for foraging segregation. Cavity-nesting bird density increased in proportion to snag density on 7 study plots. CNB density declined 77% after snag removal on a burned plot, but 2 CNB species nested in remaining stumps. Density of CNB varied from 19 to 65 pairs/40 ha on 6 other plots and was most strongly correlated with density of snags > 38 cm dbh. CNB density was not correlated with any live vegetation variable. Yearly changes in CNB density from 1966-1979 were highly negatively correlated with annual precipitation. Winter weather apparently influenced density through direct mortality or by inducing movements to or from the study plots, suggesting that winter habitat may be critical. An estimated 423 suitable soft snags (15 yr or older) per 40 ha were required to support maximum bird densities on burned forests, and .apprx. 4 hard snags were required to produce 1 soft snag. On unburned forests, 342 suitable snags (1/3 hard) were required/40 ha. Snag suitability could be predicted using diameter, bark cover and top condition. Snags should be managed as dispersed clumps rather than as isolated individuals to meet nesting and feeding requirements. Providing sufficient numbers of large-diameter snags on managed stands often will require retention of trees and selected stands beyond the usual rotation period or retention of existing patches of old-growth timber. Recommendations for future research emphasize winter habitat studies and more detailed nesting and foraging studies.","RAPHAEL M G; DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY, CALIF 94720, USA",,,,2,21,,118,124,136,,,"Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry; Nutrition & Dietetics; Biodiversity & Conservation",0084-0173,,,,"Behavior; Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Forestry; Nutrition; Wildlife Management (Conservation)","04500, Mathematical biology and statistical methods; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07504, Ecology: environmental biology - Bioclimatology and biometeorology; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 10602, External effects - General; 13202, Nutrition - General studies, nutritional status and methods; 20504, Nervous system - Physiology and biochemistry; 21003, Psychiatry - Psychophysiology; 53500, Forestry and forest products","Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Piciformes [85552]",,,,,,,,,"ABIES-CONCOLOR CERTHIA-AMERICANA SITTA-PYGMAEA SITTA-CANADENSIS WOODPECKER NUTHATCH WEATHER FORAGING BEHAVIOR/",,,,2018/06/21

The percentage occurrences of items eaten were obtained from feces, and the abundances of prey by counting water-birds, trapping small mammals, and tracking large and medium-sized mammals on specially prepared soil plots. Dingoes were also estimated by tracking. The diet was broad but predominantly mammalian (23 spp.). Dietary frequencies were grouped around 3 weight modes, 0.1, 1.25 and 16 kg, corresponding with bush rat (Rattus fuscipes), ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor). The amplitudes of those frequencies approximately doubled from mode to mode, viz. 4, 13.5 and 28.3%, respectively. Medium-sized mammals were recognized as the staple prey because of their dependability. Their density estimates fluctuated least among prey-groups, and track records of dingoes in the mountains were significantly related to them. Other categories of prey were supplementary (large mammals), opportune (small mammals) anud scavenged. Although there were general tendencies for dietary frequencies to follow prey abundances, significant functional and numerical responses were obtained only for water birds (coot and swan). Their super-abundance in the mid-years of the coastal study and their highly clumped distribution were the likely causes. Predation was disproportionately severe on mammalian prey-classes after an extensive wildfire at the coastal site. Such predation may have suppressed populations of wallabies and kangaroo for 2 yr until the water-birds became super-abundant. The prevalence of wombats in the mountains may have induced heavy predation on other less numerous large prey. Concepts of profitability in feeding appear to apply to the dingo more than those of optimization of time or energy. The decline in dingoes was correlated most with long-term declines in water-birds and medium-sized mammals. At the time, abundance estimates of wallabies and kangaroos were increasing and those species increasingly predominated in the diet. The ability to hunt co-operatively was apparently ineffectual in preventing decline in dingo numbers. Pack size is related inversely to the level of temporal instability in the environment. Frequent wildfires may prevent staple (medium-sized) and supplementary (large) prey from being abundant simultaneously, a combination thought necessary for large pack size.","NEWSOME A E; CSIRO, DIV WILDL RANGELANDS RES, PO BOX 84, LYNEHAM, AUSTRALIA 2602",,,,1,17,,59,85,95,,,"Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Nutrition & Dietetics",0307-692X,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.1983.tb01332.x,,"Behavior; Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Nutrition","01008, Methods - Field methods; 04500, Mathematical biology and statistical methods; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 10060, Biochemistry studies - General; 10602, External effects - General; 13202, Nutrition - General studies, nutritional status and methods; 14001, Digestive system - General and methods; 20504, Nervous system - Physiology and biochemistry; 21003, Psychiatry - Psychophysiology","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Anseriformes [85504]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Gruiformes [85540]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Mammalia [85700]/Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Canidae [85765]/Marsupialia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Marsupials, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Macropodidae [86075]/Marsupialia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Marsupials, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Phalangeridae [86095]/Marsupialia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Marsupials, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Phascolomidae [86100]/Rodentia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Muridae [86375]",,,,,,,,,"RATTUS-FUSCIPES PSEUDOCHEIRUS-PEREGRINUS WALLABIA-BICOLOR MAMMAL COOT SWAN KANGAROO WOMBAT FIRE PACK SIZE/",,,,2018/06/21

Two repeat clutches were laid. Losses to presumed human predators were high, and since 1979 further failure through addling, egg breakage and chick death has increased greatly. Levels of DDE and PCB [polychlorinated biphenyls] in recent eggs were substantial, while shell thinning was marked. Fire destroyed 5 out of the moor's 14 breeding sites in 1980.

J,BCI:BCI198172001744,,Article,,"DIVERSITY IN ADVERSITY THE BEHAVIORS OF 2 SUBORDINATE ANTBIRDS",,"WILLIS E O",,,,,,,,,"Arquivos de Zoologia (Sao Paulo)",,1981,,30,3,159-234,159,234,English,,,,,,"The main subordinate anti-following antbirds south of the eastern Amazon (white-backed fire-eyes, Pyriglena leuconota) and north of the eastern Amazon (white-plumed antbirds, Pithys albifrons) differ in many behavioral aspects despite their similar niches. They and other subordinate anti-followers studied previously are more diverse in behavior than are dominant antbirds of the same guilds. The main foraging adaptation of white-plumeds is rapid flying, infiltrating among larger antbirds by being nonsocial and speedy. The main foraging adaptation of fire-eyes is rapid hopping around the periphery of dominant birds. White-plumeds forage near the centers of forest swarms, darting to the ground for prey and fleeing instantly to escape of dominant birds. Fire-eyes forage more diversely, capturing food on the ground or on foliage, either high or peripherally, around woodland swarms. Fire-eyes also forage away from ants whenever colonies are inactive. Voice and aggressive behaviors are minimal in white-plumeds, probably so as to be inconspicuous when infiltrating among larger birds. Fire-eyes are very vocal and aggressive and pairs maintain dominance in their territories even though trespassing individuals are grudgingly permitted to stay. Probably the necessity of foraging away from ants makes it advantageous for Fire-eyes to retain territories in which other foragers will not reduce food supplies irregularly. Courtship in subordinate antbirds depends less on courtship feeding of females and more on mutual grooming and special displays than in dominant antbirds, which probably get food for females more easily. An unusual wing waving-zeesinging display in white-plumeds may be sexual, as may be a draping display in fire-eyes. Hypertrophy of courtship patterns may occur because pair bonds are somewhat unstable in fire-eyes and very unstable in white-plumeds. Fire-eye pairs stayed together except when foraging at ant swarms but separated readily when their woodland territories were cut. White-plumed pairs stayed together only for brief nestings and females left males feeding single young to move quickly to new males for new nestings. Because they show high divorce rates or repeat nestings throuhout most of the year, fire-eyes and white-plumeds are relatively r-selected for high reproductive rates. Apparently, long breeding seasons are linked with high adult mortality rates in wandering fire-eyes and white-plumeds, short seasons with low adult mortality rates in territorial spotteds. Sexual dimorphism is the rule in subordinate ant-following antbirds, perhaps because individuals forage far apart at swarm borders and females need not bluff males. Fire-eyes have subspeciated repeatedly, white white-plumeds and spotteds tend to show speciation instead. Attaining speciation may indicate more rapid evolution than does subspeciation and seems associated with high-diversity habitats like the rain forest. Taxon flow of rapidly evolving forms from high-diversity habitats replaces species in lower-diversity habitats. Diverse form and behavior evolve in subordinate ant followers despite competitive adversity rather than because of it. Moderate diversity of opportunity, not the negative factors of competition or extreme diversity, seem to explain high rates of diversification.","WILLIS E O; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY 08540, USA",,,,0,0,,0,8,9,,,"Behavioral Sciences; Communication; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology",0066-7870,,,,"Behavior; Communication; Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Evolution and Adaptation","01500, Evolution; 03510, Genetics - Sex differences; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07006, Behavioral biology - Animal communication; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 12510, Pathology - Necrosis; 13202, Nutrition - General studies, nutritional status and methods; 16504, Reproductive system - Physiology and biochemistry; 18502, Integumentary system - Anatomy; 20008, Sense organs - Deafness, speech and hearing; 53500, Forestry and forest products; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Plantae; Plants; Plantae [11000]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Hymenoptera [75326]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]",,,,,,,,,"PYRIGLENA-LEUCONOTA PITHYS-ALBIFRONS ANT FORAGING RAIN FOREST VOICE COURTSHIP SEXUAL DIMORPHISM MORTALITY BREEDING SEASON SPECIATION TERRITORIALITY",,,,2018/06/21

The samples were taken monthly between middle of May 1978. Shoots and stubble (4880) were collected in different reed-types. Two groups of reed-insects were found: miners in 1-yr-old shoots or gall building larvae of reed parasites. [Europhilus thoreyi Dej Demetrias imperialis L., Odacantha melanura L., Coccidula scutellata Herbst., Anisosticta novemdecimpunctata L., Lema melanopa L., Galerucella lineola Fbr., Leucania obsoleta Hb., Arachanara geminipuncta Hw., Psammochares sp. (consobrinus), Symmorphus sinuatus, Clubiona phragmitis C. L. Koch, Araneus cornutus CL., Singa sp., Tetragnatha sp., Pachygnatha clercki, Donacochara speciosa Thor.]. There were also some other rare species of arthropods. The relationships between the amounts of these arthropods and several parameters of the reed, such as length, basal diameter and density of shoots, were investigated. A negative correlation was found between the relative density of reed parasites and the length of reed shoots and a positive correlation was found between the relative density of wintering arthropods in stubbles and the length of reed shoots or the diameter of stubbles. Distributional differences of arthropod-species and the colonization dynamics of stubble-overwinterers during the winter are described. The variation of shoot parameters, insect densities and their use by birds from landside to lakeside border of a great reed-belt is shown for the peninsula of Mettnau near Radolfzell. The consumption of reed-insects by blue tits wa observed by the increase of the number of picked shoots and by the decrease of the insect biomass during the winter. Some insect species are strongly preferred by the blue tit [Parus caeruleus]. There is a negative correlation between the number of picked shoots and the length of shoots. The same was found for the use-effectivity of the food-supply. But there is a positive partial correlation between use-effectivity and relative insect density. About 20% of shoots occupied by insects are picked and 50% of the insect biomass was consumed. Every picked internodium was inhabited by insect-larvae which were obvious by characteristic modifications of the inside of the internodes. The blue tits only open internodes when they contain insect-larvae. The consequences of burning and mowing in reed areas for insect populations were investigated. There is evidence, less for great reed belts than for small isolated ones, that insect density is decreased by burning as well as by mowing. The importance of the imagines of insects wintering as larvae in reed belts as food for breeding birds and for resting birds during the spring migratory period is discussed. A rough estimation of the available reed-insect biomass on the Mettnau-peninsula (an important resting place for migrants) shows that the insects wintering in reed-belts may play an important role in supplying food for migrating as well as for breeding birds. Give importance of animal food for songbirds, reed areas, even very small and isolated ones, with their considerable supply of insects should be generally protected for reason of bird protection and any management should be arranged extremely carefully.","FROEMEL R; FILDENMOOS 8/1, 798 RAVENSBURG 19",,,,0,0,,0,0,0,,,"Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Endocrinology & Metabolism; Nutrition & Dietetics; Physiology",0049-6650,,,,"Climatology (Environmental Sciences); Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Metabolism; Nutrition; Physiology","00518, General biology - Nontechnical literature; 04500, Mathematical biology and statistical methods; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07504, Ecology: environmental biology - Bioclimatology and biometeorology; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 10602, External effects - General; 12100, Movement; 13003, Metabolism - Energy and respiratory metabolism; 13202, Nutrition - General studies, nutritional status and methods; 20004, Sense organs - Physiology and biochemistry; 21003, Psychiatry - Psychophysiology; 25502, Development and Embryology - General and descriptive; 51000, Morphology, anatomy and embryology of plants; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation; 54508, Phytopathology - Diseases caused by animal parasites; 60502, Parasitology - General; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology","Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Coleoptera [75304]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Diptera [75314]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Hymenoptera [75326]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Lepidoptera [75330]/Chelicerata, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Chelicerates, Invertebrates; Arachnida [75402]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]",,,,,,,,,"EUROPHILUS-THOREYI DEMETRIAS-IMPERIALIS ODACANTHA-MELANURA COCCIDULA-SCUTELLATA ANISOSTICTA-NOVEMDECIMPUNCTATA LEMA-MELANOPA GALERUCELLA-LINEOLA LEUCANIA-OBSOLETA ARCHANARA-GEMINIPUNCTA PSAMMOCHARES-SP SYMMORPHUS-SINUATUS CLUBIONA-PHRAGMITIS ARANEUS-CORNUTUS SINGA-SP TETRAGNATHA-SP PACHYGNATHA-CLERCKI DONACOCHARA-SPECIOSA PARUS-CAERULEUS BIOMASS FOOD PREFERENCE BASAL DIAMETER SHOOT LENGTH REED PARASITE BURNING LARVAE MIGRATION IMAGO GALL",,,,2018/06/21

Later in the growing season, secondary inoculum produced in infected tissues [of pome fruit trees] may be disseminated by rain or by sucking and biting insects. Relatively rare sources of inoculum and inefficient means of dissemination may be responsible for introducing the pathogen to areas where fireblight has not been found previously. E. amylovora may be carried to new locations in intimate association with host tissues (infected nursery stock), in association with vectors (insects, birds or man), or by wind as strands or in airborne water drops.

The territories of the 2 spp. normally overlap in areas where they occur syntopically. In Central Europe 2 of 35 Sg-.male. were interspecifically territorial, while no interspecific territoriality was found among 35 Wg-.male.. The highest population densities of Wg and Sg in Central Europe are attained in spruce and fir forests. There is no evidence for the preference of deciduous forests by Sg, nor for the displacement of Sg into such forests by Wg. Pine forests are avoided by both species. Playback experiments support the results of sonagraphic analysis which showed neither character displacement in sympatric areas nor a reduced contrast in the songs of allopatric areas. Interspecific territoriality occurs only exceptionally. In 2 areas of Spain near Soria and Luarca a higher number of interspecifically territorial .male. (Soria: 6 of 17 Sg, Luarca: 2 of 4 Wg), as well as males singing both Wg and Sg songs (or mixed songs), were found in the species with a much lower population density. This can be explained through incorrect imprinting on the song of the sibling species and is not attributable to increased song similarity ecological factors or hybridization. Allopatrically occurring Wg-.male. do not react any more than sympatrically occuring Wg to the song of Sg, but 53 and 64% of Sg-.male. in 2 areas where only Sg occurs react to the song of the sibling species. Since reduced contrast in the song has been disproved as the reason for this, it may be that allopatrically occuring Sg possess a less selective releasing mechanism. This would mean that when in sympatry with Wg, Sg must learn not to react to the song of the sibling species. In Wg and Sg, reaction to the song of the sibling species, interspecific territoriality and mixed singing males seem to be the result of errors in the imprinting processes.",,,,,0,1,,0,21,25,,,"Behavioral Sciences; Communication; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Neurosciences & Neurology",0021-8375,,10.1007/BF01643534,,"Behavior; Communication; Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Sense Organs (Sensory Reception)","07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07006, Behavioral biology - Animal communication; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 10608, External effects - Sonics and ultrasonics; 20001, Sense organs - General and methods; 20004, Sense organs - Physiology and biochemistry; 20504, Nervous system - Physiology and biochemistry","Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]",,,,,,,,,"SPRUCE FIR IMPRINTING",,,,2018/06/21

Because of persistent snow and inclement wheather, kestrels hunt throughout most of the day in areas devoid of snow, cruising over large parcels of land in search of prey. Kestrel reoccupied some 61% of their territories from the previous year. Breeding activities of kestrels include copulation, territorialism, vocalizations, aerial displays, joint hunting, nest-site inspection and production feeding. Annual philopatry may also facilitate pairing. Copulation and defense of territory by males initiate the breeding season. Promiscuity occurs early in the season. As soon as the female associates with only 1 male, pairing is consummated. The female ceases to hunt and depends on the male for food. Coupled with this division of labor is a division of space; the female remains in 1-2 acres about the nest-tree while the male hunts farther away on the 109-ha territory. The caching of food by either sex assures food availability during the early to mid part of the breeding season. Because of its excavation of nest-cavities, the common flicker (Colaptes cafer) is a critical ecological element in kestrel biology. The kestrel out-competes other cavity-nesters except various squirrels. Kestrels prefer nest-trees on an east-facing slope or nest entrance pointing to the east. An eastern exposure provides protection from prevailing storms and facilitates warming of the nest in the morning. Kestrels select nest-trees located in sheltered basins. Protection from stormy weather, access to suitable hunting grounds, and easy transport of prey to the nest influence the choice of the nest-tree location. Kestrel females lay 4 eggs/clutch on the average, and produce successive eggs in a clutch at the rate of 1 egg each day. Females probably lay a determinate number of eggs but re-nest if the entire clutch is destroyed. Kestrels start a continuous incubation as the clutch nears completion. Both sexes incubate, but the male accounts for only 20% of the 29-31 days of incubation. Predation, chilled or infertile eggs, and wind damage to the nest-tree account for egg loss. Disease and parasites are not important mortality factors for kestrels. Young kestrels reach adult weight 16-19 days from hatching. Up to 7-10 days post-hatching, the male continues to supply all food for the family. As the food demand increases, the female resumes hunting. Parents feed the young throughout the day when prey is readily available. The young fledge after 29-31 days. A close sibling flock develops and persists until the young disperse. The success of fledging at Sagehen reaches 98.0% of young hatched, making the total reproductive output 87.5% of eggs laid. Parental defense insures a high survival of the fledglings. By late Sept., most kestrels have independently departed from the territory. Low temperatures and/or reduced amounts of daylight, and not food shortage, seem to be the proximate causes stimulating the southward movement of kestrels. Food availability is super-abundant on an average territory of 109.4 ha. An average family of 6 uses only 1.6% by weight of the food available. Male kestrels supply 49.6% of the needed food (15.540 g), and the female and young account for the remainder. The breeding system of kestrels allows for division of both labor and space. The male obtains food for the pair, and later for the young, in areas far from the nest-tree where the female confines her activities. This strategy conserves energy of the female which is expended in production. A smaller male needs less energy in the capture and transport of food, leaving more food for the dependent female.

There are over 13 million acres of aspen forest in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The dominant species, quaking aspen, may grow in essentially pure stands but varying numbers of other species usually are present. Common associates in the Lake States include paper birch, balsam fir, jack pine, spruces, northern red oak, elms, big tooth aspen, red pine, or white pine. Over its wide range, aspen occurs on a variety of soils and sites. Growth rate varies with soil fertility and moisture. Tree heights at age 50 range from 90 feet on deep fertile loams to 40 feet on dry sands, rock outcrops, water-logged mineral soils, or peat. About 11% of the aspen type occurs on poor sites (Site Index < 50), 58% on average sites (Site Index 50 to 69), and 31% on good to excellent sites (Site Index .gtoreq. 70). Most Lake States aspen stands are young. About 70% are less than 40 yr old and only 4% are distinctly overaged. Over half the stands are pole-sized; a third are seedlings or saplings. Only 6% of the type is owned by industry; the rest is nearly evenly divided between public and small private ownerships. Aspen is one of the simplest species to manage because it is easy to regenerate from root suckers, and its intolerance causes early natural thinning and pruning. Even without thinnings, aspen stands on average and better sites produce cordwood along with some larger products in a short rotation. The only direct investment usually needed is treatment of residual trees and brush at the time of harvest to stimulate production and rapid growth of aspen suckers. The recommended practice is to make either a complete clearcut or a commercial harvest followed by cutting or killing the remaining overstory. The brush that is often present on the better sites may be controlled using prescribed burns, but application of approved herbicides is more reliable. Mechanical treatments also are effective although costs will be higher. Favorable growing conditions must be provided for aspen sucker development. Volume growth rate and yields are related to both site quality and aspen stocking. Average aspen yields in unmanaged mixed stands often are only 10 to 15 cords per acre. Pure, well-stocked aspen stands on excellent sites yield 60 or more cords per acre, but poor sites may not produce enough volume to be worth harvesting. On the better sites, a single commercial thinning from below should be considered at age 30 to 35 yr, especially where large, high-quality trees will bring premium prices in the final harvest. Periodic defoliation of aspen stands by the forest tent caterpillar or other leaf feeders may reduce volume growth during infestations. Trees of any age can be attacked by the aspen borer, but infestation is most frequent in poorly stocked or thinned stands. Hypoxylon canker is the most serious disease, resulting in death or breakage of many trees; infection may be reduced by maintaining well-stocked stands. Because losses to decay fungi increase rapidly in overmature stands, aspen harvest should not be unduly delayed. To minimize losses to insects and diseases, aspen should be grown in well-stocked stands and harvested promptly at maturity. Recommended rotations for aspen stands range from about 30 yr on poor sites to 50 or 60 yr on good sites. Growing continuous crops of aspen also plays a key role in maintaining other natural resources. Aspen suckers are a staple food of moose and deer. The staminate flower buds of aspen trees are a necessary winter food for grouse and stands of all ages provide favorable habitat for grouse and other birds. Aspen bark and twigs are the primary food of beaver. The easily regenerated aspen provides soil cover that helps stabilize the water regime, and aspen forests have considerable esthetic and recreation value.",,,,,1,2,,0,0,0,,,"Developmental Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry; Reproductive Biology",0065-4612,,,,"Development; Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Forestry; Reproduction","00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07002, Behavioral biology - General and comparative behavior; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 07517, Ecology: environmental biology - Water research and fishery biology; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 11107, Anatomy and Histology - Regeneration and transplantation; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation; 51512, Plant physiology - Reproduction; 52807, Soil science - Fertility and applied studies; 53500, Forestry and forest products; 54502, Phytopathology - Diseases caused by fungi; 60010, Economic entomology - Trees, ornamentals and wood products","Plantae; Fungi, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Fungi [15000]/Fungi, Plantae; Fungi, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Ascomycetes [15100]/Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Fagaceae [26070]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Salicaceae [26695]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Ulmaceae [26910]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Coleoptera [75304]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Lepidoptera [75330]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]/Artiodactyla, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Artiodactyls, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Cervidae [85725]/Rodentia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Castoridae [86295]",,,,,,,,,"PAPER BIRCH NORTHERN RED OAK BALSAM FIR ELM JACK PINE RED PINE SPRUCE WHITE PINE FOREST TENT CATERPILLAR ASPEN BORER HYPOXYLON CANKER DECAY FUNGI GROUSE BEAVER MOOSE DEER SOILS GROWTH VOLUME NATURAL RESOURCES",,,,2018/06/21

X-irradiation and contact with certain chemicals are known to be involved in the development of leukemia, the viral etiology of the murine and avian disease is also well established. Autoimmune mechanisms may play a major role in the pathogenesis of leukemia. Cells of the hematopoetic system might become infected in utero or shortly after birth with a leukemo-genic virus. These cells then may be stimulated by the thymus to multiply at a rapid rate. The virus enters the body and then the cell while the host is still immunologically tolerant. This is to explain the preservation of the virus during the time required for its interaction with the cell and the development of cellular transformation. The resultant immunologically competent transformed cells may be recognized by normal ""immunocytes"" which synthesize specific antibody against them or their altered antigens. Or that clones of normal immunocytes are selected for by the altered antigens of the transformed cells satisfying Burnet's clonal selection theory. It is the transformed immunologically competent cell which no longer is capable of recognizing the body as ""self"" and thus commences open hostilities against the host In any event, the stage is set for autoimmunity to occur. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth","S.

The disease is particularly prevalent in the spring and summer and in regions where livestock are reared, though it usually appears in a subclinical form that can be diagnosed only by serological means. The causal agent, Coxiella burnetii, has been discovered in many species of domesticated and wild animals and birds and in various species of ticks and mites, and there is a large reservoir of natural infection in Eastern Siberia, Central Asia, Transcaucasia and the Southern Caucasus. Next in importance is Asian tick-borne typhus, which occurs[long dash]mainly in spring[long dash]in Siberia and the Central Asian Republics. The causative agent is Rickettsia sibirica and ticks of the family Ixodidae form the virus reservoir. Other endemic rickettsioses that have been observed in the USSR are: boutonneuse fever, which appears sporadically in the summer months on the Caucasian coasts of the Black and Caspian Seas and is transmitted by the dog-tick Rhipicephalus san-guineus; murine typhus, which has occurred in the same regions in the autumn and is spread by the rat-flea Xenopsylla cheopis; and another tick-borne disease[long dash]rickettsial pox[long dash]which has been endemic in the Southern Ukraine throughout the year, but with a peak incidence in May-July. During the Second World War and the immediate post-war period, epidemic outbreaks of classical (louse-borne) typhus were prevalent in the extensive territories temporarily occupied by the invading army. Some time after the epidemic episodes had ceased, there began to appear in these regions sporadic cases of a disease that was distinguishable from classical typhus clinically by its benign nature and epidemiological-ly by the absence of any known source of infection, by the fact that lice did not play a role in its transmission, and by its age distribution (it occurred most frequently in middle-aged and elderly people and rarely in children, who are so very susceptible to epidemic typhus). A special investigation, employing the most modern serological techniques, was undertaken by the Rickettsial Diseases Department of the Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences to determine the exact nature and origin of this sporadic, benign disease. The serological studies disclosed that the disease in question was a sporadic form of typhus, often presenting an atypical clinical picture that is readily confused with conditions such as chronic influenza and catarrh of the respiratory tract. It was concluded that these cases of sporadic typhus in the USSR were due to recrudescence of a previous latent infection and that the disease was therefore identical with Brill's disease and was a legacy of the epidemics of classical typhus that were rife during the Second World War. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors","Acad.

A 20-megaton ground burst on downtown Boston would seriously damage reinforced-concrete buildings to a distance of 10 miles, and demolish all other structures. Within a radius of 16 to 21 miles second-degree burns would be produced, and clothing, houses, foliage, gasoline and so forth would ignite, producing a fire storm. Human survival in this area would be practically impossible. An estimated 2,250,000 deaths would occur in metropolitan Boston from blast and heat alone. Beyond the area consumed by fire, many persons would be exposed to lethal doses of radiation from local fallout. Fallout shelters could reduce the cumulative dose of radioactivity to levels compatible with survival. For many, access to shelters would be made more difficult by blindness produced instantly by retinal burning. Many sheltered survivors would be subject to acute radiation sickness and to the long-term somatic and genetic effects of radiation. Acute whole-body irradiation produces a variety of clinical syndromes, largely dependent on the dose of radiation absorbed. The similarity of presenting symptoms in persons who have been lethally irradiated and those who have received much smaller doses would create major diagnostic problems in the postattack period. Sublethal irradiation would increase the morbidity and mortality from pre-existing disease and from blast injuries, burns and infections. Long-term effects of radiation due to fallout would include increased incidence of neoplasia, stillbirths, congenital malformations and cataracts. Serious ecologic problems would result from thermal destruction of forests and widespread lethal irradiation of mammals and birds, accompanied by relative sparing of bacteria, fungi, viruses and insects, all of which are highly resistant to radiation. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors",,,,,1,2,,8,9,34,,,Physics,,,10.1056/NEJM196205312662204,,"Radiation Biology","06502, Radiation biology - General","Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [birds]/Microorganisms; Bacteria, Eubacteria, Microorganisms; Bacteria [05000]; [bacteria]/Plantae; Fungi, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Fungi [15000]; [fungi]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human]/Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Insecta [75300]; [insects]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Mammalia [85700]; [mammals]/Microorganisms; Microorganisms, Viruses; Viruses [03000]; [viruses]","neoplasia; Neoplasms (MeSH); neoplastic disease/acute radiation sickness; Radiation Injuries; disease/miles second-degree burns; disease/blast injuries; disease/blindness; Blindness (MeSH); nervous system disease, eye disease/infections; Infection (MeSH); infectious disease/retinal burning; disease/cataracts; Cataract (MeSH); eye disease",gasoline,,,"Massachusetts; USA, North America; Nearctic region",,,,,,,,2018/06/21

An account is given of, mainly, human tick-borne rickettsioses due to R rickettsi and allied species, and Q-fever due to R burnetti, with brief comment on heart-water fever (Cowdria rumi-nantium) and tick-borne rickettsioses of domestic animals (Ehrlichia spp.), with special reference to mechanisms of transmission and reservoir hosts in wild life. Non-pathogenic, rickettsia-like microorganisms in ticks, as yet hardly studied, are noted with emphasis on recent work on Wolbachia persica Suitor and Weiss 1961 in the tick, Argas persicus. In discussion, the importance of the different host-ranges of different tick species as an index to possible maintenance hosts, or reservoirs, of rickettsial infections and diseases is stressed, with some special reference to Africa where most known rickettsial diseases of man and domestic animals occur. Attention is drawn to tick parasitization of birds as potentially important to the dispersal, and survival, of rickettsiae in nature. Suggestions are made regarding possible applications of histochemical methods and electron microscopy in the future study of pathogenic rickettsiae and non-pathogenic, so-called symbiotic rickettsia-like microorganisms in ticks. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author","London Sc.

The first epidemic outbreak comprised 22 cases of disease of a respiratory type. The ""Q"" fever diagnosis was confirmed by complement fixation tests (CFT) with a C. burnetii antigen which were carried out shortly after the outbreak, and by the isolation of the pathogenic agent from one of the patients. At the same time, 38.98% of sera from the persons living on the farm gave positive CFT as follows: zootechnical department 31.53%; department of mechanics and transport 28.26%; administration and managing department 21.74%; household department 13.04%; and agricultural department 5.43% (the percentage rates refer to the total number of persons included by the respective department). Periodical repetition of the serological investigations showed the percentage rate of positive CFT to stay at about the same level during the whole period of observation, with a marked tendency towards an increased number of low titers (1/8-1/16) and a corresponding disappearance of high ones. Of the serologically positive cases 50.40% exhibited signs of disease, while 49.60% were completely asymptomatic. Typical cases occurred more frequently in the zootechnical department. CFT with C. burnetii carried out in cattle revealed the existence of 56 serologically positive animals (18.48% of the entire stock.) The number of serologically positive animals decreased at the subsequent examinations practiced at 6 months intervals, pari passu with the decrease of the enzootic potential. The highest incidence rate of positive CFT in animals coincided with the epidemic ""Q"" fever episode in humans. Titer increases of the CFT were noticed in cows during gestation or immediately after calving. Positive CFT and comparatively high titers (1/128) were recorded in calves immediately after birth. Serological tests in the domestic animals (dogs, goats, fowls) belonging to the staff of the farm yielded negative results. Extension of the investigations to include the natural biotope surrounding the farm resulted in the demonstration of the infection in the hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus L.), the magpie (Pica caudata), and the buzzard (Buteo buteo). In other wild animals belonging to 18 different species as well as 1300 ticks of the genera Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes the results were negative. The most plausible routes of transmission appear to be the respiratory one as well as contact with the animals, their dejecta, the placenta, and the fetal fluids. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors",,,,,0,1,,0,2,3,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,,,,"Epidemiology (Population Studies)","37052, Public health: epidemiology - Communicable diseases","Chelicerata, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Chelicerates, Invertebrates; Acarina [75403]; [Ixodes] [Dermacentor] [Haemaphysalis] [ticks]/Animalia; Animals; Animalia [33000]; [animals]/Artiodactyla, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Artiodactyls, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Bovidae [85715]; [goats] [cattle] [cows]/Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Canidae [85765]; [dogs]/Insectivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Insectivores, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Erinaceidae [86000]; [Erinaceus europaeus]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Falconiformes [85534]; [Buteo buteo] [buzzard]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [magpie]/Rickettsiales, Rickettsias and Chlamydias, Eubacteria, Bacteria, Microorganisms; Bacteria, Eubacteria, Microorganisms; Rickettsiaceae [07113]; [C. burnetii; Coxiella burnetii]","epidemic Q fever; Q Fever; disease/infection; Infection (MeSH); infectious disease/Pica; behavioral and mental disorders/Q fever; bacterial disease",antigen,,,,,,"placenta; reproductive system, embryonic structure/sera; blood and lymphatics",,,,,2018/06/21

In Senegal these birds live along river valleys in the dry season, but in the rains move north and breed in enormous colonies in the thorn bush country. In the dry season the flocks disperse in the early morning and feed, rest at mid-day and congregate at night into the roost. When there are rice fields in the vicinity, there is daily aggregation at the feeding place instead of daily dispersal. Flock movements differ as ""drifting"", ""synchronised"" and ""escape"", depending upon individual speeds of reaction to companions. There is neither a flock fragmentation prior to breeding, nor an increase in ""individual distance"" of males prior to the establishment of territories. Courtship begins at the nest when it is half built. After the male's display, the female comes to the nest and hops about with him. Copulation follows. After pair-bond formation, a special mutual wing-quivering behavior reduces further aggressive behavior between mates. At the nest the female becomes dominant over the male but not generally in the territory around it. The species is monogamous. Each male builds one nest and assists in incubation. Territory defense is described. The males work as do the females in bringing in food for the young. Around the 12th day the young leave the nest, for a time remaining nearby. Young and parents recognise each other but the young may solicit food from other adults, and parents prevent the approach of other adults or other young. With increased wandering the groups of birds mix so that young receive food from adults other than their parents. The change from juvenile flocking behavior to that of the adults occurs as the young leave the colony. During incubation, test egg-removal and nest mutilations beyond the cutting of small holes resulted in desertion. Reorientation of entrance to nest caused changes in routes to the nest and increased aggressive encounters between previously peaceful neighbors. Fragmented and promiscuous courtship occurred at the singed remains of nests, and some nesting material was brought. Burnt colonies are always deserted, but those burnt in the first few days of brooding may be restarted elsewhere. The ""vocabulary"" of the species is summarised in an appendix. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: G. N.

Broadcast, semi-basal, and basal spraying were tried in different ways and one section was cut. Broadcast spraying with Ammate resulted in 90% bare ground. Fireweed, which is of slight wildlife value, dominated this ground the 1st year but gradually dwindled in later years; sweetfern, a shrub of some browse value to deer, increased later. All broadcast sprays killed such low shrubs as blueberry. Basal sprays caused little disturbance of shrubs and herbs; plant cover remained on 75% of area. All sprayed areas are gradually reverting to bracken-sedge-herb-blueberry type. No soil erosion occurred, for litter was not disturbed. Wildlife usage was studied by transect counts of scats and observation of sign. Results are tabulated. All areas were used by game animals. Deer apparently preferred unsprayed and winter basal areas. Rabbits may have preferred unsprayed, winter basal, and hormone-broadcast areas. The few turkey signs suggested preference for areas broadcast with hormone mixture or Ammate. Deer use of all areas increased over the 5-year period, but was less where brush was reduced. In spring and early summer, however, deer fed heavily on young shoots of herbs. Young turkeys used the grass-herb cover of broadcast areas for catching insects. Squirrels apparently ""planted"" acorns in the right-of-way[long dash]a practice that will complicate maintenance. Rabbits actually increased in treated areas, owing to more low food and cover and more woodchuck holes. In general, treatments benefited wildlife by creating more interspersion and edge. Broadcast spraying benefits some game animals and its results can be maintained by selective basal spraying. Initial basal spraying creates a tight cover that is relatively cheap to maintain and is highly satisfactory both to the utility company and to wildlife. Table lists major plants of right-of-way as of high or low seasonal value to deer, grouse, turkey, and rabbit. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Courtesy Wildlife Rev. 93.36. 1959","Pennsylvania State U., University Park",,,,0,0,,0,0,0,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation",,,,,"Wildlife Management (Conservation)","07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Angiospermae [25200]; [herbs]/Animalia; Animals; Animalia [33000]; [animals] [wildlife]/Artiodactyla, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Artiodactyls, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Cervidae [85725]; [deer]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Ericaceae [26035]; [blueberry]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]; [turkey] [grouse]/Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Insecta [75300]; [insects]/Lagomorpha, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Lagomorphs, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Leporidae [86040]; [rabbit]/Plantae; Plants; Plantae [11000]; [plant]/Rodentia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Sciuridae [86405]; [woodchuck]/Plantae; Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Spermatophyta [25000]; [shrub]",,hormone,,,,,,,,,,,2018/06/21

Pollen studies indicate conifers and jack pine, especially, were dominant vegetative cover since last glacial period. Extensive logging operations, 1885-1920, caused major disruption of natural plant succession. Major Umber wolf range in Minn. covers approximately 12,000 sq. miles. Wolf population is largest remaining in U. S. Although wolves and deer are found throughout Border Study Area, populations of both are higher in cutover area north of Ely than in uncut areas for at least 25 years. Cutover and burned over area supports more deer, and consequently more wolves. It is estimated that Forest supports a population of 240 wolves on an area of 4100 sq. miles or 1 wolf per 17 sq. miles. Wolf numbers reached a high during 1925-1940 and have since declined to a level above and below which they fluctuate. Records of 8 wolf litters were received, largest 9, smallest 4. 67 stomachs taken from winter-killed wolves were examined; 16 were empty. Deer (Odocoilcus virginianus) comprised 95.5% of total contents by volume and 80.4% by occurrence. Hare (Lepus americanus), porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), and ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) together made up 4.5% of total by volume. Among 156 wolves the largest male weighed 112 lb. and measured 69 inches; the largest female weighed 80 lb. and measured 61.25 inches. Male pups weigh 50 lb. or more by Nov.; female pups weigh 40 lb. or more. Of 156 wolves examined, 64% were males. Of 112 observations made from air and on ground, a total of 318 wolves was seen. Single wolves (48) made up 41% of all observations; largest pack was one of 15. A total take of wolves by man approximates 1 wolf per 41 sq. miles, or 41% of the population in major wolf range. Original white-tailed deer population was low. Build-up to a peak period reached in 1930's was due to (1) transformation of a virgin coniferous forest relatively devoid of extensive good deer habitat into a 2d growth hardwoods forest; (2) presence of thousands of acres of unbrowsed cedar swamps; (3) several restrictions placed on deer hunting. Decline in deer numbers was not due to overhunting or wolf predation but due to starvation from general range deterioration. This range deterioration due to almost complete elimination of cedar as an available food;.(2) overbrows-ing of hardwoods; (3) 2d growth timber reached maturity; and (4) natural succession toward a coniferous forest. There is no apparent food preference by wolves for either sex of deer. Wolves kill annually 1.5 deer per sq. mile from an estimated deer population of 9 per sq. mile. Hunters remove less than 1 deer per square mile in parts of Forest. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author","Minnesota Dep.

Murray Valley encephalitis, investigated by Burnet, Miles, Anderson and others, was shown to be closely related to Japanese B. encephalitis - arthropod-borne from wild birds in some spp. of which the infection was enzootic. Psittocosis-ornithosis, common infections of Australian birds, was occasionally transmitted to man; antibiotic measures had greatly lowered the case-fatality rate. Q fever, due to infection by Rickettsia (Coxiella) burneti, was first observed in abattoir workers by Derrick; the occupational hazard was apparently not the only source of spread, for many instances occurred of illness in people not so associated. Leptospiral infections, actively studied in the Queensland Institute of Medical Research by Mackerras and his colleagues caused febrile illness, sometimes with jaundice, in cane-field workers; other types of Leptospira were discovered, and at least 10 types are known; animal reservoirs include cattle, pigs, dogs, rats, and some Australian fauna. Hydatid disease, from the development of the cyst stage of Echinococcus granulosus, occurred mainly in people associated with dogs fed on infested uncooked sheep offal; methods of health education were being used to get the cooperation of farmers and others in applying the simple preventive measures. The National Health and Medical Research Council (Australian) was providing grants for continued studies in zoonoses. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: A. R.

F.",,,,,,,,,"WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT BULL [OTTAWA] SER I",,1954,,1,(10A)-(10B),"1-79, 1-111",1,,English,,,,,,"Rangifer arcticus arcticus is physically adapted to an Arctic environment: the hoofs are broad and large enabling support of body weight on crusted snow, and a cavity on the sole of the foot makes for sure-footedness on ice. Pelage and protruding parts are so formed as to meet best the cold conditions. Fat storage is in several areas; the most important that deposited over the saddle and rump. Fat accumulation in cows occurs later in the season than it does in bulls. Actions of insect pests often interferes with fat deposition. Among food requirements of caribou, certain mushrooms, lichens, grasses, and willows -seemed to be preferred. Discarded antlers are avidly chewed in winter months. Caribous are gregarious animals, usually found in small bands or loose herds. They are nomadic and there seems to be little sense of territoriality. They are almost continually in migration with seemingly no one factor being responsible for this movement. The character of the environment is changed when they move from an area, for a large number of such animals as wolves, ravens, eagles, and gulls are dependent on the caribou for food, and so form a mobile community. A small sample of caribou under one month of age gave a sex ratio of 175 males to 100 females, but at maturity the ratio was 35.8 males to 100 females, indicating a greater mortality among males. Cows are sexually mature as early as 17 months, bulls do not reach maturity until at least 2 or 3 years of age. Annual calf increment is about 21.6% of the herd, or approximately 145,000 calves yearly. Approximate annual loss to the herd is 178,000, resulting in a deficit of about 32,000 animals per year. Next to man, the wolf is the most important predator, but the annual loss to them is probably less than 5%. Wolverines, grizzly bears, and golden eagles are possible predators, but losses to them are considered as insignificant. Other causes of mortality were external and internal parasites, bacterial diseases and accidents. Of these, accidents, which cause the death of many caribou annually, seem to be the most important as far as primary causes of herd loss. The presence of Echinococcus granulosis is important, because it is a parasite of man. A foreseeable danger to the herd is the possible hybridization with the introduced domestic reindeer (R. a. asiaticus). leading to a general debility of the herd with the possibility of extermination of the native race. Fortunately, such hybridization seems unlikely at present. Man exerts his heaviest influence as a direct predator, but other activities including range distraction through forest fires are very important. Destruction of winter range through fire may be of semi-permanent nature, because of the slow growth in the sub-Arctic region. The caribou in this region is a basic factor in the economy of approximately 20,000 Canadians providing them with food, shelter, and clothing. A drastic reduction of 62% of the herd since 1900 has caused great concern. With increased demand for caribou products brought about by the opening of the area for trade, an increase in human population in this area, and the introduction of efficient firearms, the present population of caribou is large enough only if the kill is confined to basic needs and wastage is reduced. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: P.

S. and Canada. It is valuable for wildlife, honey, erosion control, and livestock browse through much of its range, but tends to be a serious pasture weed in the eastern and northern areas. The sp. is particularly characteristic of the forest-prairie ecotone, where it functions in furthering the advance of the forest by invading the grassland by means of rhizomes. The shrub occurs naturally only in climates of a strongly continental type, and generally in well-lighted habitats. It tolerates a wide variety of soils, but does not occur on very acid, saline, organic, or permanently saturated substrates. The fleshy fruits are probably dispersed mostly by birds and mammals, in the digestive tracts of which at least some seeds seem to survive. The seeds have a double dormancy, requiring in nature the breakdown of their coats by fungal action in warm moist soil, followed by after-ripening and development during at least one winter in the soil. Germination takes place readily only between 5[degree] and 15[degree]C, occurring only in very early spring in nature. Drought, invertebrates, and damping-off fungi destroyed most of the first year seedlings in 1950 The mature stems vary in height, density, and diam. in response to age, position in the colony, and habitat. Shoot buds do not appear to have a long cold requirement. The roots are extensive, abundantly branched, and appear mycorrhizal. Mature plants are resistant to many extremes. Fire kills the stems but resprouting is abundant. Rhizome reproduction is very active, a much greater length of rhizomes often being produced than aggregate length of aerial stems. The sp. responds to long photoperiods, and flowers during much of the summer. The flowers are pollinated by a wide variety of insect types. Mechanisms preventing self-pollination are absent, but partial self-incompatibility appears to be present. Fruit production is heavy, but about half the seeds are defective. The main destruction of fruits appears to be by mice and livestock. Longevity of plants was observed to vary up to 13 years for stems and 40 years for rhizomes. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: J.

Viability of the parasites was indicated by functional flagella. Although the eggs were not opened (except in one instance) for 1-6 days after the death of the embryo (in 8-20 days), there was no evidence of lysis. Parasites were recovered from the blood, the cavities, and the tissues of the chick. Eggs were placed in a refrigerator for 4 days after 5 days of incubation. The death of the embryo did not interfere with the increase in numbers of the parasite. Active T. foetus were found 13, 15, and 22 days after the embryo's death. Lysis occurred in 2 instances of accidental bacterial contamination. Three trials of 8 days each were made using a 5-day-old embryo which had been removed from the egg to avoid the dilution and probably consequent reduction in activity of the parasite's secretion by the surrounding embryonic fluids.

The reduction was caused by a destruction of its habitat by the agricultural practices of the late 19th century. The present occupied range is the few areas of prairie which were never plowed, and those which have recently been returned to grassland. The text of this richly illustrated book consists chiefly of brief explanations of the 84 full-page photographs from life, which portray graphically the life-history, habits, and ecological requirements of the prairie chicken in Missouri. A particularly valuable contribution is the detailed description of the ""booming"" and courtship performance in the fall, which is more complete than heretofore described. Management recommendations for increasing the population include the following: annual censuses based on booming ground counts, continued legal protection, establishment of permanent ponds, avoiding the cultivation of soils suited only to grassland, avoiding overgrazing, avoiding uncontrolled burning, leaving some portion of hayfields unmoved. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: G.

Pittman-Robertson Projects",,1943,,,,"xx + 261p.",,,English,,,,,,"The distribution of all 6 recognized subspp. of wild turkeys is mapped, but only the eastern form (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) is considered in detail. While present turkey populations are only a small fraction of those in pre-colonial times the 4 subspp. found in the U. S. have apparently held their own in recent yrs., and increased in a few localities. In Virginia the 1938 wild turkey population was estimated at 22,575 birds in 2,020 flocks, distributed in 69 of the 99 counties. The present range in Virginia is 13,700 sq. miles, and an additional 2,200 sq. miles is potential range which should be developed. The annual kill 1927-1940 has averaged 6,808 birds as estimated by county game wardens. Regulations in 1941 allow hunting for 2 months except when a tracking snow covers the ground, but hunting pressure is increasing so more stringent laws are needed. Methods of hunting are described. The factors which caused the decline in turkey population and complete exterpation from many areas are: destruction of forests by lumbering, fire and agriculture; depredations by man and dogs; severe weather at critical periods; destruction of mast trees and other food plants by man and disease (chestnut blight); and possibly, diseases contracted from domestic poultry. The depredations by, man included trapping, in part for the market, until after 1900. The wt. of turkeys seldom exceeds 20 pounds, but a 30-lb. gobbler is reported, and a wild turkey raised in captivity reached 47 lbs. Hens averaged 8.32 lbs., gobblers 13.36 lbs. The turkey is polygamous, [male][male] attracting the [female][female] by gobbling. [male][male] seldom if ever mate until the 2d yr., but [female][female] mate the 1st yr. Of 27 nests of native wild turkeys studied, 67% were failures chiefly due to desertion. Man causes more destruction of wild turkeys than any other enemy. About 30% of the fall population is taken in hunting, 3% is wounded and lost, 10% illegally poached. Man is responsible for some of the nesting losses also. Predation by dogs, 5 wild mammals, and the great horned owl has been observed in Virginia; the owl is considered worst. The diseases and parasites of wild turkeys, including captive-reared, are: pullorum, coccidiosis, Leucocytozoon, blackhead, paratyphoid, tapeworms, roundworms, lice, mites, and hippoboscid flies. Studies based on 537 crops and gizzards, 495 of them taken in Nov. and Dec., revealed only the following foods in quantities over 1% (descending order of importance): Quercus, Cornus, Vitis, Zea mays, Smilax, Orthoptera, Rhus toxicodendron, Nyssa, Diptera, Fagus, Fraxinus, Rhus sp. Plant foods comprised 95% of the total. Turkeys prefer to escape by running rather than flying, but flights of a mile are recorded. Running speed is 12-18 m.p.h.; flight speed was measured from 32-43 m.p.h. Turkeys are propagated artificially under the ""game farm method"" and by use of large pens located in occupied turkey range where wild gobblers may enter to mate with the captive hens. Progeny from the ""game farm"" turkeys are of almost no value, those from ""wild mated"" stock are of some value, in restocking. The more important habitat requirements of the wild turkey are: an area 15,000 acres or more which is 50-90% forested with at least 25% of the trees mast-bearing hardwoods; free water well distributed; areas of 1000 acres or more which are refuge or otherwise undistributed; and suitable roosting sites, preferably in conifers. Chufa (Cyperus esculentus) was found to be one of the most promising of all plants used in turkey food plantings. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Gustav Swanson",,,,,0,0,,0,0,0,"[long dash]Division of Game and Inland Fisheries, Richmond",Richmond,"Biodiversity & Conservation",,,,,"Wildlife Management (Conservation)","07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial","Chelicerata, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Chelicerates, Invertebrates; Acarina [75403]; [mites]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Anacardiaceae [25565]; [Rhus] [Rhus toxicodendron]/Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Angiospermae [25200]; [crops]/Animalia; Animals; Animalia [33000]; [parasites]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [birds] [domestic poultry]/Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Canidae [85765]; [dogs]/Platyhelminthes, Helminthes, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Helminths, Invertebrates, Platyhelminths; Cestoda [45100]; [tapeworms]/Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [conifers]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Cornaceae [25860]; [Cornus]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Cyperaceae [25280]; [Cyperus esculentus]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Diptera [75314]; [hippoboscid flies] [Diptera]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Fagaceae [26070]; [Fagus] [Quercus] [chestnut]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]; [Meleagris gallopavo silvestris] [turkey] [hens]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [Zea mays]/Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Insecta [75300]; [lice]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Mammalia [85700]; [mammals]/Aschelminthes, Helminthes, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Aschelminths, Helminths, Invertebrates; Nematoda [51300]; [roundworms]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Nyssaceae [26460]; [Nyssa]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Oleaceae [26475]; [Fraxinus]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Orthoptera [75340]; [Orthoptera]/Plantae; Plants; Plantae [11000]; [plants]/Plantae; Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Spermatophyta [25000]; [trees]/Protozoa, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Invertebrates, Microorganisms, Protozoans; Sporozoa [35400]; [Leucocytozoon]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Strigiformes [85564]; [great horned owl] [owl]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Vitaceae [26940]; [Vitis]","chestnut blight; fungal disease/coccidiosis; Coccidiosis (MeSH); parasitic disease",,,,"Virginia; USA, North America; Nearctic region",,,,,,,,2018/06/21

H.",,,,,,,,,"YALE UNIV SCH FOREST BULL",,1942,,50,,,,,English,,,,,,"Western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) is said to be one of the most important forest trees in the Pacific Northwest, where it attains its maximum development. In cruising and marking for cutting, forest officers often encounter decays which are not typical of the brown stringy rot due to Echinodontium tinctorium, which has generally been considered ubiquitous on this species. Because of this observation the present study was initiated and carried out (1935-40), involving the dissection and analysis of 801 trees for decay. Fomes annosus root rot was found responsible for 21 percent of the board-foot volume decayed, F. pini conk rot for 19.2, F. ap planatus white mottled rot for 17.1, F. hartigii white trunk rot for 10.1, Ganoderma oregonense white spongy rot for 7.2, F. pinicola brown crumbly rot for 6.7, E. tinctorium brown stringy rot for 5.3, P. oria colorea spongy butt rot for 4.3, Armillaria mellea shoestring-fungus rot for 3.7, Polyporus sulphureus brown cubical rot for 2.3. F. officinalis brown trunk rot for 1.5 P. schweinitzii red-brown butt rot for 0.9, and Polystictus abietinus pitted sap rot, F. subroseus yellow-brown top rot, and Poria subacida feather rot each for 0.1%. The various infection courts for decay in this tree were knots, falling-tree scars, roots, mistletoe burls and knots, broken tops, fire scars, lightning scars, and frost cracks. Though more infections occurred through falling-tree scars than otherwise, those through mistletoe knots accounted for the greatest amount of decay. Ordinary knots ranked third in number of infections and 2d in % of total decay. Infection through mistletoe burls and swollen limbs adjacent to the trunk accounted for 30.9% of the decay volume in board-feet. In general, western hemlocks were frequently infected at 60-85 yrs. of age, and decay became extensive at about 200 yrs. Conk rot and white trunk rot were most frequent on the Cascade areas, but Fomes root and white mottled rots were more common on the coast areas.

The rate of freezing appears to have no effect on the number of bacteria present and little, if any, effect on the subsequent extent of surface desiccation or visceral taint. Taint development appears to depend primarily on the period during which the product is held above the freezing point, whether it occurs during precooling, freezing, or thawing.

These fires do not remove many of the small animals that depend partly upon forest-tree seeds for food. White-footed mice (Peromyscus spp.) are the commonest and heaviest seed consumers. In live-trap studies, occurrence of Peromyscus over the winter period on 2 burned slash sites, each 200 ft. square, was 34 and 35 individuals, respectively. The animals were numbered and their travel recorded. Shrews are numerous in the moist coastal area and are also seed consumers. Squirrels are of little importance in forest regeneration. Douglas fir, hemlock, Sitka spruce, and western red cedar seeds are preferred in the order listed. Artificial reforestation by planting of nursery-grown stock, mainly 2-yr.-old Douglas fir, is retarded by cropping by rabbits common to the area. Mountain beavers, pocket gophers, bears, grouse, and porcupines also contribute to re-tardation of plantations. The animal instrumental may at times be determined by the type of injury. Port Orford cedar, a valuable and desirable species, suffers but little and is apparently avoided. Efforts to develop indices of damage have been un-successful. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: A. W.

F.",,,,,,,,,PROC,,1939,,7,,231-233,231,233,English,,,,,,"The duck-raising industry on Long Island is of considerable importance. The high losses due to disease are mostly caused by fowl cholera and anati-pestifer infection. Symptoms of fowl cholera resemble those seen in chickens. The course of the disease is acute, losses up to 90% occurring in a week to 10 days. Those running a chronic course are thin and often lame, having swollen feet or joints. Severe hemorrhagic enteritis is usually present; the muscles are congested and dark; affected feet and joints contain reddish serous, whitish creamy, or yellowish cheesy exudate; affected air sacs are thickened and contain much cheesy exudate. Diagnosis rests primarily on bacteriological examination. Treatment except with extremely large doses of anti-hemorrhagic septi-cemia serum is of no value. Chemically killed autogenous bacterin is a means of control. Prompt disposal of dead birds by burning is important. Anatipestifer infection is a disease of young ducks caused by Pfiefferella anatipestifer. Death often occurs within 6-12 hrs. after symptoms are observed. Symptoms are those of depression which leads to complete prostration. Continual bobbing and jerking of the head are seen. A prominent lesion is an adherent fibrinous exudate covering the liver and heart. The lungs are congested, sometimes consolidated. Hemorrhagic enteritis is a prominent lesion. Diagnosis must be made by isolation of the causative organism. Treatment is of no avail. Control at the present time lies in strict sanitation an disposal of sick and dead birds by burning. Exptl. work indicates that a bacterin may be an aid to control. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth. summ",,,,,0,0,,0,0,0,,,Microbiology,,,,,Microbiology,"29500, Microorganisms - General","Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Anseriformes [85504]; [duck]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [birds]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]; [chickens] [fowl]/Organisms; Organisms; Organisms [00500]; [organism]","cholera; Cholera (MeSH); bacterial disease/enteritis; Enteritis (MeSH); digestive system disease/Severe hemorrhagic enteritis; Enteritis; disease/anati-pestifer infection; Infection; disease/Anatipestifer infection; Infection; disease/Hemorrhagic enteritis; Enteritis; disease/infection; Infection (MeSH); infectious disease/fowl cholera; Cholera; disease",,,,,,,"muscles; muscular system/heart; circulatory system/head/joints; skeletal system/lungs; respiratory system/liver; digestive system/air sacs; respiratory system/serum; blood and lymphatics",,,,,2018/06/21

Sportsmen of the stone age",,1937,,,,"xiv + 260p. Frontispiece, 15 pl.",,,English,,,,,,"Controversy over the date of extinction of the moas or giant struthionid birds of New Zealand has divided the ethnologists and palaeontologists of New Zealand into 2 schools, the one holding to the view of the great antiquity of this extinction and the other that this took place relatively recently. In its extreme form the earlier date is set at or about the time of the great migration to New Zealand or about 1350 AX). The evidence for this is the seeming absence of native records or legends about the birds, the apparent age of the steam-cooking ovens sunk in the earth, and in places the overlying shell middens of a later age. The 2d view is supported by somewhat questionable but internally consistent traditions, among older natives, as to the occurrence, habits, manner of hunting, and utilization as food of these giant birds. In places the shell and avian middens are intermingled. The latest date tentatively set for the view of recent extinction is about 300 years ago. The folklore indicates that the birds were stupid, harried to death by relays of hunters, or caught and roasted in forest fires. They were brought down from heights in mountain torrents in boats of rushes, cooked by steam over hot stones in sunken covered ovens. The long bones and in most cases the skull were broken open for the marrow and brain, respectively. The middens on old camp sites near the mouths of streams contain extensive deposits of dismembered skeletons, broken egg shells, mingled with gizzard stones (in some places), ashes, and wooden implements. Two types of stone implements, polished tools of a higher culture, and cruder flakes, the latter evidently used in carving the flesh of the moa and discarded, were also found. The author favors the view of the later date of extinction and of no great gap between an earlier and later culture of 2 successive peoples. The illustrations reveal the extensive deposits of skeletal remains. Lists of species identified at different camp sites which have been examined are given. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: C. A.

J,BCI:BCI19361000021896,,Article,,"Artificial reforestation in the southern pine region",,"WAKELEY, PHILIP C.",,,,,,,,,"U S DEPT AGRIC TECH BULL",,1935,,492,,1-115,1,115,English,,,,,,"Artificial reforestation in the southern pine region of the U. S. A. is carried on chiefly with Pinus palustris, P. caribaea, P. taeda, and P. echinata. Many exotic conifers have been tried but none with conspicuous success. Except in areas of extreme erosion, planting is most frequently necessary because of failure of natural reproduction on soila formerly occupied by nearly pure stands of P. palustris. P. caribaea is the favorite sp. for reforestation in or near its natural range. The usual process of reforestation involves seed collection and extraction, and production and planting of l-yr.-old nursery stock; direct-seeding on the planting site has been unsatisfactory. The ave. numbers of seed per pound are: P. palustris 5200, P. caribaea 15,500, P. taeda 21,300 and P. echinata 69,200. Extraction of seed in modern, internal-fan kilns is just beginning to supplant extraction at air temp, indoors or in convection kilns. Dewinging of P. palustris seed is too difficult to be ordinarily feasible. Viability of seed, especially of P. palustris, in storage, is uncertain under most conditions, but well-dried seed of all spp. keeps well in sealed or tight containers at 38[degree] F. Germination tests in sand, with the seed covered not more than inch, have proved most generally satisfactory; a method employing compressed mats of acid peat has also worked well. Stratification in moist, acid peat at approximately 38[degree] F. for 30 days before testing or sowing greatly increases rapidity and percentage of germination, especially of spp. other than P. palustris. Nursery beds are usually sown in Feb. or March, and stock lifted in Nov., Dec, and Jan. Fertilizer has been little used. P. palustris seedlings are practically stemless, but have needles 12-18 inches long; planting stock of the other 3 spp. is usually 6-16 inches tall. Use of high-grade stock greatly improves survival and growth. Roots are pruned to 8 inches at the time of lifting. Planting is usually done on unprepared sites, or in shallow furrows, by 2 men using a 10-pound iron planting bar with a wedge-shaped blade. Height growth is rapid, except that of P. palustris, which is delayed for several yrs. after planting and then commences irregularly, so that the young stands have an extremely irregular crown canopy, in contrast to the even canopies of the other 3 pines. Principal nursery pests and diseases are birds (at sowing time), Phyllo-phaga larvae, cutworms, scale insects, and brown-spot needle-blight caused by Septoria acicola. Damping off is relatively rare. In plantations, P. palustris suffers most seriously from hogs and brown-spot; P. caribaea from fire and rabbits, and from windthrow after sleet storms; and P. taeda and P. echinata from fire, rabbits, and the Nantucket tip moth, Rhyacionia frustrana. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: P.

Relatively fruitful areas, which are thickly inhabited, and which as a rule lie at lower altitudes, alternate with swampy or barren areas the extent of which is greatest on the higher watersheds. The first are the ""Kulturge-biete,"" the last ""Hinterland"" and ""Einodengebiete,"" depending on whether they are sparsely inhabited or quite barren. Few natural forest stands are to be found. Fires and forest clearing have been widespread until recent years. The great stretches of moor land have been least disturbed. Characteristic birds of the Kulturgebiete include Pica pica, Sturnus vulgaris, Passer domesticus, Chloris chloris, Emberiza citronella, E. hortulana, and others. Those characteristic of the local wooded centers, ""Hainzentren,"" are Coloeus monedula, Oriolus oriolns, Erythrina erythrina, Emberiza schoeniclus, Parus caeru-leus, and others. The ecological relations of the different spp. to the works of man and to the modified vegetation associated with civilization are various. Sturnus vulgaris, e.g., is much more widely distributed than would otherwise be the case as a result of providing nest boxes. Fires have caused the former fir woods to be replaced by deciduous timber, in consequence of which such birds as Parus major and Sylvia borin have extended their range. A number of spp. are quite intimately dependent on the parks, gardens, buildings, crops or grazing for which man is responsible. Others, as Sylvia atricapilla, are found only in those woods which approach most nearly to original conditions. Corvus corax, Cractes infaustus, Fringilla montijringilla, etc., occur in the ""Einodengebiete."" Some, as Pandion haliaetus, Colym-bus arcticus and C. stellatus, breed in the barrens, but feed on the lakes. The northward distr. of southern spp. of birds closely parallels the settlements of man. Most of the waterfowl, as Anas querquedula, Spatula clypeata, Nyroca ferina, and others, are restricted to the clay areas where as a rule are found waters rich in vegetation. Species vary greatly in the degree and character of their dependence on their surroundings. Climate may directly influence distribution of north-ranging birds of southerly affinities, or it may operate indirectly through its effect on soil factors. Most of the birds of southerly affinities belong to the youngest element in the fauna. Probably some of them have not as yet been able to occupy all accessible territory which is ecologically favorable. The average temp. of the summer months, especially July, is suggested as a possible factor limiting southward distr. of boreal spp. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: W. P.

Its habits, preservation and increase",,1931,,,,"xxix + 559p. 69 pl. (5 col.), 32 fig.",,,English,,,,,,"This work, the result of a 5-yr. investigation conducted under the auspices of the U. S. Biological Survey, represents one of the most comprehensive and detailed accounts that has been published on the life history of an avian species. It was prepared for ornithologists, conservationists, sportsmen, and others interested in increasing the numbers of the bobwhite as a game bird. The investigation was carried on mainly in the territory between Thomasyille, Georgia, and Tallahassee, Florida. Studies of habitat requirements, food, enemies, parasites, and diseases receive particular emphasis. The species thrives where agriculture is somewhat primitive and cover about the borders of fields is not removed. Detailed accounts are given of courtship, nesting, care of eggs and young, social behavior, miscellaneous habits, vocabulary, rate of growth, development of plumage, color variations, and sex ratio. About 55 to 57% of adult birds appear to be [male][male].[long dash]A chapter on food and feeding habits (pp. 113-165), by C. O. HANDLEY and CLARENCE COTTAM, shows that about 86% of the. average monthly food is vegetable, and about 14% animal. Legumes, mast, a.nd fruit are the largest items in the vegetable food, and Orthoptera constitute more than half of the animal food.[long dash]Banding studies indicate that birds lost from their coveys rejoin them as opportunity occurs. The average range of a covey is not over 1/4 mi. Mortality, both before and after hatching, is high, owing to nest desertion, various natural enemies, and the elements. Loss from disease is apparently negligible. The greatest single cause of decrease is hunting by man. [long dash]A chapter on internal parasites and parasitic diseases (pp. 229-313) is contributed by ELOISE B. CRAM, MYRNA F. JONES, and ENA A. ALLEN. Four kinds of protozoan parasites were found. Coccidiosis (caused by Eimeria dispersa) is apparently much more of a menace to captive birds than to wild ones. Evidence of blackhead (caused by Histomonas meleagridis) was also found. Other parasites include trematodes (2 species), nematodes (16 species), and cestodes (5 species). A systematic account (by Cram, pp. 240-296) of the nematodes includes host records, location, description, life history, distribution, damage, treatment, and prevention. New host records are: Syngamus trachea*, Gongylonema ingluvicola, Capillaria annulata*, C. contorta, C. retusa, Tetrameres americana, Habronema pileata*, Cheilo-spirura spinosa, Ascaridea lineata*, Heterakis bonasae*, Subulura strongylina*, and Strongyloides avium, in Colinus virginianus Capillaria contorta in Phasianus colchicus from New York, in P. c. torquatus from Pennsylvania, in Dafila acuta from Louisiana, and in Lophortyx californica from California; Capillaria retusa in Perdix perdix from Pennsylvania, and in Meleagris gallopavo and Nurnida meleagris Seurocyrnea colini and Gongylonema ingluvicola in Meleagris gallopavo. Filariidae: APROCTELLA (p. 294), near Aprocta, type A. stoddardi Cram (p. 294), in abdominal cavity of Colinus virginianus (Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina) and Bonasa umbellus (New England) ; type in U. S. Nat. Mus. The previously unknown life histories of several nematodes were ascertained experimentally. Experimental production of cross-infections of nematodes from other birds to bobwhites or vice versa was accomplished in several instances. A systematic account of 5 cestodes (by Jones, pp. 297-310) includes host records, location, description, life history, distribution, pathology, control measures, and treatment. Allen (pp. 310-313) reports malaria in quail from Georgia and trichqmoniasis from Virginia.[long dash]Of external parasites, 5 Mallophaga, 4 Ixodoidea, 3 Acarina, and 1 flea are reported. A number of non-parasitic diseases are described. In a study of fluctuations in population nothing of a cyclic nature has been noted. The relations of agricultural activities and domestic animals to the bobwhite are discussed.[long dash]A chapter on quail preserve development and management (by H. L. Stoddard and C. 0. Handley, pp. 359-400) includes a discussion of the cultivation of plant foods for the species.[long dash]Other chapters treat of the use and abuse of fire on preserves, the control of natural enemies, and methods of capturing bobwhites.[long dash]There is a chapter on artificial propagation (pp. 451-489) by W.B.COLEMAN and H. L. Stoddard. [long dash]An appendix includes detailed tables of food items found in stomachs of bobwhites and a list of birds harboring nematode parasites of the bobwhite. The numerous plates (5 colored) illustrate many phases of the life history and environment of the species.

The clinical symptoms are: Loss of flesh in the initial stages, fatigue, ruffling and dulling of plumage, and loss of appetite; comb, wattles, and mucous membranes appear pale; gait becomes unsteady; in rare cases diarrhoea and shortness of breath occur. Death follows without paroxysms. The pathological anatomical changes are: Intestinal inflammation of a catarrhal or even haemorrhagic nature, gastritis, red hepatic atrophy, atrophy of the heart, cholecystitis, icterus, and inflammation of the. lungs. The treatment consists especially in prophylactic precautions; disinfection of the coops; planing smooth all wood surfaces; cleansing the feeding and drinking vessels; collecting and burning the feces; digging up the discharge-infested soil and refilling with fresh sand; and permanently drying out the entire premises. For medical treatment, anise oil gave good results if used before loss of flesh and internal changes had progressed too far. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author's summary (transl. by L. M.
