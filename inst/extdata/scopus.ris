AB  - In the western United States, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a “snag specialist”, found predominantly in burned montane forests. While fire is a key disturbance agent in this system, recently, unprecedented large tracts of drought-stressed forest in the Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascades of California have succumbed to bark beetle outbreaks. Although this tree mortality could potentially be a boon for snag-dependent species, it is unclear whether the resulting snag forests provide sufficiently high-quality habitat for black-backed woodpeckers and other wildlife that are regionally associated with burned forests. We tested for differences in black-backed woodpecker occupancy between fire- and beetle-killed forests, and whether key environmental relationships driving woodpecker occupancy differed between stands affected by the two disturbance agents. Between 2016 and 2018, we surveyed for black-backed woodpeckers during 4448 surveys at 75 burned and 113 beetle-killed forest stands throughout the black-backed woodpecker's range in California, detecting at least one black-backed woodpecker on 448 surveys (16.2%) in burned forests and 115 surveys (6.8%) in beetle-killed forests. Controlling for a suite of environmental variables that can affect habitat quality, the odds of black-backed woodpeckers occurring in burned forests were predicted to be 12.6 times higher than in beetle-killed forest. Occupancy declined with time-since-disturbance in fire-killed but not beetle-killed forests, but occupancy increased similarly with snag density resulting from either disturbance agent. Across our broad study region, black-backed woodpeckers were more likely to occur in burned forests at higher latitudes and elevations; these patterns were even stronger in beetle-killed forests, where we found woodpeckers only at the more northerly and higher elevation sites. Our results demonstrate that for this disturbed-habitat specialist, disturbance agent matters; black-backed woodpeckers do not use habitat created by bark beetle outbreaks as readily as habitat created by fire. Given the likely increased magnitude and extent of bark beetle outbreaks in the future, further work is needed to assess the role of beetle-killed forests in longer-term population dynamics of black-backed woodpeckers beyond the first decade after disturbance, and to investigate whether these results can be generalized to other fire-associated wildlife species in the region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Extreme wildfires in coniferous forests produce large areas of dead trees (snags) that are expected to provide much needed habitat for the Black-backed Woodpecker, a postfire associate. In an attempt to better understand extreme fire effects (including increasing fire size and decreasing diversity of fire effects), we monitored Black-backed Woodpeckers during the 2014 and 2015 breeding seasons following two wildfires (the 2013 Rim and 2014 King fire) that burned in the Sierra Nevada, USA under extreme fire conditions. Despite an extensive sampling effort including 1025 broadcast surveys and targeted nest searching over 2040 ha of habitat typically used for nesting, we detected few Black-backed Woodpeckers. Positive detections of Black-backed Woodpeckers at broadcast points were positively associated with increases in the percent of surrounding forest that burned at high-severity and with the distance to the fire perimeter, indicating that the severity and scale of the fire per se did not affect use by Black-backed woodpeckers within the fire area. However, we suggest that the timing of these fires late in the fire season may have limited colonization of prey resources, leading to more limited use of these fires by Black-backed Woodpeckers. © 2019 by the author(s).

AB  - Forest harvesting reduces mean stand age and dead wood amount. Among species dependent upon older forests and dead wood, primary excavators such as woodpeckers play an important ecological role by providing cavities for many other species. Conservation of these species thus requires striking a balance between timber harvesting and dead wood supply, especially under moderate natural disturbance regimes. In this study, we quantified habitat use in two closely-related, sympatric species: Black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and American Three-toed (P. dorsalis) Woodpecker, in the highlands of northern New Brunswick, Canada. Natural fires are rare in this ecoregion and forest harvesting is the main agent of landscape change, along with infrequent outbreaks of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). Based on its habitat use patterns in other ecoregions, we hypothesized that Black-backed Woodpecker would select nest sites in mature coniferous forest stands and we expected that it would achieve a higher nest survival rate in forest stands than within, or at the edge of, cutblocks. Owing to sample size limitations for American Three-toed Woodpecker, statistical analyses were restricted to its occurrence patterns. Both species co-occurred, and there was no difference in detectability following conspecific and heterospecific playbacks. Contrary to our prediction, Black-backed Woodpecker selected nest sites with higher proportions of recently cut areas within 50 m than at randomly selected sites. Black-backed Woodpecker selected cutblocks for nesting when suitable snags were available and mature forest stands were present nearby as foraging habitat. For the species to persist in this landscape, the supply of snags must be continuous and forest stands must be sufficiently mature to host saproxylic insects. © 2019

AB  - Variation in fire characteristics, termed pyrodiversity, plays an important role in structuring post-fire communities, but little is known about the importance of pyrodiversity for individual species. The availability of diverse post-fire habitats may be key for fire-associated species if they require different resources at different life-history stages. We tested for age-specific habitat relationships in the black-backed woodpecker, a post-fire specialist. We used radio-telemetry to track fledgling and adult woodpeckers in burned forests and built resource selection functions to compare the effect of stand-, tree- and snag-level covariates between adults and fledglings. Fledgling black-backed woodpeckers selected habitat with more live trees than adults and used more heterogeneous habitats burned at lower severity, illustrating strong age-dependent effects on habitat selection. Within selected stands, fledglings were less likely to use snags and more likely to use live trees when compared to adults, but both age classes showed strong positive selection for larger-diameter trees (live and dead). Over the 60 days after leaving their nests, fledglings showed an increasing propensity to use snags rather than live trees. Our results provide evidence that the predation–starvation hypothesis, which posits a trade-off between foraging efficiency and the need to minimise predation risk, plays a role in structuring the age-dependent habitat use of a burned forest specialist. Adult black-backed woodpeckers selected resources associated with food availability, but these resources occurred in relatively open, exposed habitat. Fledglings selected habitat that provided increased cover, perhaps as a strategy to reduce predation risk. Synthesis and applications. Globally, fires are increasing in severity and extent, leading to increased focus on fire-associated species that play keystone roles in facilitating biodiversity resilience. Our findings suggest that a diversity of patches burned at different severities may benefit post-fire specialists like the black-backed woodpecker at multiple life-history stages. The increasing prevalence of large, homogeneously high-severity ‘megafires’ may present an emerging threat even to post-fire specialists, and we urge land managers to consider opportunities to promote pyrodiversity in the face of novel fire regimes. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Salvage logging after disturbances in forests substantially modifies vegetation structure and dead wood availability, but empirical evidence on its impact on biodiversity, especially in European boreal forest, is sparse. In this study we investigated the short-term effect of post-fire salvage logging on species richness and abundance of birds in recently burned mixed coniferous forest. Using point counts we estimated local species composition at 49 salvaged sites and 55 non-intervention sites (burnt forest left for natural regeneration) that were not logged after a fire in south-central Sweden. Local species richness, abundance and Simpson's species diversity index were significantly higher at non-intervention sites compared to salvaged sites. Forest birds that rely on structurally complex forest stands, such as tits (Parus major, Lophophanes cristatus, Poecile montanus), robin (Erithacus rubecula), mistle trush (Turdus viscivorus) and tree-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) were mainly associated with non-intervention sites, while species that are typically linked to farm- or shrublands, such as whinchat (Saxicola rubetra), white wagtail (Motacilla alba), red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), and meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) were more common at salvaged sites. These results are consistent with the idea that post-fire salvage logging has an immediate impact on the bird species composition and abundance in boreal forest. We conclude that although post-fire salvage logging may be beneficial for birds occurring in open landscapes, it has negative effects for forest bird species richness and abundance, at least over the short term. To protect typical forest communities with many forest specialists of high conservation concern, we recommend reducing the extent of post-disturbance salvaging in forests of high conservation value and updating the existing management policy to restore the amount of woody debris and facilitate long-term structural complexity and biodiversity in densely stocked conifer stands. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - A wide range of different biodiversity indicators have been identified in different biomes and types of environments. However, we currently lack a clear understanding under which circumstances proposed biodiversity indicators are valid indicators and when they are not. Here we conducted a large-scale restoration experiment by emulating natural disturbances through prescribed burning and gap-cutting. From this experiment data of resident forest birds was used to, (1) identify biodiversity indicators in the middle and northern boreal zone, (2) test the effect of forest restoration practices on biodiversity indicators and (3) explore the patterns when biodiversity indicator analyses are performed across a wider range of forest types including both restored and unrestored sites. Additionally, to understand the occurrence of species we correlated their occurrence with local habitat structures across different forest types. We found that both the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) were important biodiversity indicators for the middle/northern boreal zone. The occurrence of these species can generally be used to identify species rich areas across different forest types. However, the three-toed woodpecker, the best indicator for unrestored forest, lost its indicator value after prescribed burning; in these stands the goldcrest (Regulus regulus) was the best biodiversity indicator. Based on habitat associations, we suggest that biodiversity indicators in boreal forest not only indicate high species richness but also structural habitat complexity. Our results draw attention to the fact that one must be careful about using previously identified biodiversity indicators in ecosystems subjected to ecological restoration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently burned coniferous forests host wildlife communities that respond to variation in burn severity, post-fire habitat structure, and patch configuration. Habitat selection theory predicts that birds inhabiting these variable post-fire landscapes will select nesting locations that confer an adaptive advantage through increased fitness and reproductive success. Understanding the effect of post-fire habitat on avian nesting ecology can provide valuable information to guide restoration and management after wildfire. The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is strongly associated with recently burned forests in the western United States, where it is used as an indicator species for the effects of post-fire forest management. Between 2011 and 2018, we located and monitored 118 Black-backed Woodpecker nests in burned forests of northern California. We evaluated the influence of habitat and nest characteristics on nest site selection and daily nest survival. Our results demonstrate a pattern of neutral congruence between habitat selection and fitness. Blackbacked Woodpeckers showed strong selection for each of the nest habitat variables that we measured: Woodpeckers selected moderately sized trees in areas of high snag density burned at high severity, but also in areas relatively close to low-severity or unburned edges. However, only nest initiation date affected nest survival, with decreased survival in late-season nests. Our results suggest that management actions aimed at maintaining breeding habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers should prioritize retention and creation of pyrodiverse landscapes that include dense stands of snags (&gt;5 snags per 100 m2) within ~500 m of forest that burned at low severity or remained unburned. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press for the American Ornithological Society.

AB  - Fire creates challenges and opportunities for wildlife through rapid destruction, modification and creation of habitat. Fire has spatially variable effects on landscapes; however, for species that benefit from the ephemeral resource patches created by fire, it is critical to understand characteristics of fires that promote postfire colonization and persistence and the spatial scales on which they operate. Using a model postfire specialist, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), we examined how colonization and persistence varied across two spatial scales as a function of four characteristics of fire regimes—fire severity, fire size, fire ignition date and number of years since fire. We modelled black-backed woodpecker colonization and persistence using data from 108 recently burned forests in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades ecoregions of California, USA, that we monitored for up to 10 years following fire. We employed a novel, spatially hierarchical, dynamic occupancy framework which differentiates colonization and persistence at two spatial scales: across fires and within fires. We found strong effects of fire characteristics on dynamic rates, with colonization and persistence declining across both spatial scales with increasing years since fire. Additionally, at sites within fires, colonization decreased with fire size and increased with fire severity and for fires with later ignition dates. Our results support the notion that different aspects of a species’ environment are important for population processes at different spatial scales. As habitat quality is ephemeral for any given postfire area, our results illustrate the importance of time since fire in structuring occupancy at the fire level, with other characteristics of fires playing larger roles in determining abundance within individual fires. Our results contribute to the broader understanding of how variation in fire characteristics influences the colonization and persistence of species using ephemeral habitats, which is necessary for conserving and promoting postfire biodiversity in the context of rapidly shifting fire regimes. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The Black Hills population of black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) was petitioned, but deemed not warranted, to be listed as a threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act and more information on their population size in the region is needed. Our objective was to map abundance and provide a population estimate of black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains of South Dakota and Wyoming, USA. We conducted 3,666 and 3,384 5-minute point count surveys from late-March to late-June in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We characterized vegetation around each point using geographic information system-derived landscape variables and fit 3-level hierarchical time-removal models in R package unmarked using gmultmix. The global abundance model received the most support and included year, latitude, and percent area of green trees, beetle-killed trees, dead trees, 1- to 2-year-old wildfire, 3-year-old wildfire, and 4- to 5-year-old wildfire. Points with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees had the greatest density of black-backed woodpeckers, followed by 1- to 2-year-old wildfires. After 4 years, areas burned by wildfire supported lower densities of black-backed woodpeckers than undisturbed forests. Mean density was 0.528 birds/km2 in 2015 and 0.626 birds/km2 in 2016. There were an estimated 2,920 and 3,439 black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We suggest areas with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees may support high densities of black-backed woodpeckers and are important to sustaining populations when the availability of recent (&lt;4 years old) wildfire is declining or scarce.

AB  - The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a snag-associated species that colonizes and utilizes patches of burned forests typically within 10 years of fire. Previous research has indicated that salvage logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species. In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following logging operations that covered 45% of the burned area. We systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year, which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed Woodpeckers postlogging. © 2018 by the author(s).

AB  - Habitat suitability models can inform forest management for species of conservation concern. Models quantify relationships between known species locations and environmental attributes, which are used to identify areas most likely to support species of concern. Managers can then limit negative human impacts in areas of high suitability or conduct habitat improvements in areas of marginal suitability. Model applications are computationally intensive, requiring time and resources not available to most managers. We developed FIRE-BIRD, an ArcGIS toolbox, to streamline preliminary data processing and application of habitat suitability models to forest management planning for disturbance-associated woodpeckers of conservation concern. Tools are currently developed for black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and white-headed woodpecker (Dryobates albolvartus) in Inland Northwest burned forests; black-backed, white-headed, and hairy woodpecker (D. villosus) in Northern Sierra burned forests; and white-headed woodpecker in Inland Northwest unburned forests. This manual provides tool operating instructions and guidelines to interpret resulting habitat suitability maps. The suite of species currently included makes this toolset best suited for postfire management and restoration treatments in dry mixed-conifer forests. Incorporating additional species and forest conditions in the future will broaden the scope of this toolset. © 2018, USDA Forest Service. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many studies project future bird ranges by relying on correlative species distribution models. Such models do not usually represent important processes explicitly related to climate change and harvesting, which limits their potential for predicting and understanding the future of boreal bird assemblages at the landscape scale. In this study, we attempted to assess the cumulative and specific impacts of both harvesting and climate-induced changes on wildfires and stand-level processes (e.g., reproduction, growth) in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. The projected changes in these landscape- and stand-scale processes (referred to as “drivers of change”) were then assessed for their impacts on future habitats and potential productivity of black-backed woodpecker (BBWO; Picoides arcticus), a focal species representative of deadwood and old-growth biodiversity in eastern Canada. Forest attributes were simulated using a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and were used to infer future landscape suitability to BBWO under three anthropogenic climate forcing scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), compared to the historical baseline. We found climate change is likely to be detrimental for BBWO, with up to 92% decline in potential productivity under the worst-case climate forcing scenario (RCP 8.5). However, large declines were also projected under baseline climate, underlining the importance of harvest in determining future BBWO productivity. Present-day harvesting practices were the single most important cause of declining areas of old-growth coniferous forest, and hence appeared as the single most important driver of future BBWO productivity, regardless of the climate scenario. Climate-induced increases in fire activity would further promote young, deciduous stands at the expense of old-growth coniferous stands. This suggests that the biodiversity associated with deadwood and old-growth boreal forests may be greatly altered by the cumulative impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances under a changing climate. Management adaptations, including reduced harvesting levels and strategies to promote coniferous species content, may help mitigate these cumulative impacts. Copyright: © 2018 Tremblay et al.

AB  - Expanding the footprint of natural fire has been proposed as one potential solution to increase the pace of forest restoration programs in fire-adapted landscapes of the western USA. However, studies that examine the long-term socio-ecological trade-offs of expanding natural fire to reduce wildfire risk and create fire resilient landscapes are lacking. We used the model Envision to examine the outcomes that might result from increased area burned by what we call “restoration” wildfire in a landscape where the ecological benefits of wildfire are known, but the need to suppress high-risk fires that threaten human values is also evident. Our study area, in the eastern Cascades of Oregon, USA, includes the Deschutes National Forest where large tracts of mixed conifer forest structure are outside the historical range of variation and characterized by multi-layer, closed-canopy stands. We found that simulation of one restoration wildfire per year in addition to high-risk wildfires in the regular fire season and over the course of 50 yr resulted in a 23% increase in total area burned, but the same probability of fire-on-fire interactions. This translated into 0.3% of the national forest burned by restoration wildfire per year and had a small impact in area burned by high-risk fires albeit more likely in extreme fire years. Smoke production doubled in the restoration scenario relative to the scenario without restoration wildfire, but still resulted in minimal smoke production in most years. Restoration fires burned with low-to mixed-severity and led to a steady reduction in canopy cover and increase in resilient forest structure in dry-forest types. Habitat for the federally protected northern spotted owl declined with the inclusion of restoration fire, while habitat for species that use recently burned forest stands (e.g., black-backed woodpecker) increased. Our results suggest that restoration wildfire can improve forest resilience and contribute to restoration efforts in fire-adapted forests, but there are trade-offs (wildlife habitat, smoke, area burned in fire-sensitive forest types), and the level of restoration fire use we simulated is unlikely to have a significant impact on the occurrence of high-severity wildfires. © 2018, Wiley-Blackwell.

AB  - Existing fire policy encourages the maintenance of ecosystem integrity in fire management, yet this is difficult to implement on lands managed for competing economic, human safety, and air quality concerns. We discuss a fire management approach in the mid-elevations of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, that may exemplify similar challenges in other fire-adapted regions of the western USA. We also discuss how managing for pyrodiversity through mixed-severity fires can promote ecosystem integrity in Sierran mixed conifer and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws) forests. To illustrate, we show how coarse-filter (landscape-level) and complementary fine-filter (species-level) approaches can enhance forest management and conservation biology objectives as related to wildfire management. At the coarse-filter level, pyrodiverse mixed-severity fires provide landscape heterogeneity. Species and ecosystem characteristics associated with pyrodiversity can be maintained or enhanced by accommodating moderately severe fires, which hasten restoration by recreating a complex vegetation mosaic otherwise at risk from suppression. At the fine-filter level, managers can select focal species and species of conservation concern based on the degree to which those species depend on fire and accommodate their specific conservation needs. The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus [Swainson, 1832]) is an ideal focal species for monitoring the ecological integrity of forests restored through mixed-severity fire, and the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis [Xantus de Vesey, 1860]) is a species of conservation concern that uses post-fire habitat mosaics and is particularly vulnerable to logging. We suggest a comprehensive approach that integrates wildland fire for ecosystem integrity and species viability with strategic deployment of fire suppression and ecologically based restoration of pyrodiverse landscapes. Our approach would accomplish fire management goals while simultaneously maintaining biodiversity. © 2017 Association for Fire Ecology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Three-toed Woodpeckers Picoides tridactylus are known to use phloem sap of conifer trees as a food resource mostly in springtime. A local pair instantly began to forage sap of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris trees that were damaged in a prescribed forest burning; before the fire they had used phloem sap elsewhere in their territory. During three weeks after the fire, the pair intensively used sap of Scots pines which were exposed to fire. The woodpeckers were probably attracted by nutrients induced by damage reaction of the burned pines. Rapid sap use of newly burned trees has not been described before, and it indicates behavioural plasticity how this woodpecker species can use resources in disturbance driven, dynamic forest environments. © 2017, University of Lund.

AB  - Following wildfire, forest managers are challenged with meeting both socioeconomic demands (e.g., salvage logging) and mandates requiring habitat conservation for disturbance-associated wildlife (e.g., woodpeckers). Habitat suitability models for nesting woodpeckers can be informative, but tests of model transferability are needed to understand how broadly models developed at one location can be applied to inform post-fire forest management at other locations. We developed habitat suitability models and tested their transferability for 2 disturbance-associated woodpecker species, Black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and Lewis's (Melanerpes lewis) woodpecker. Habitat suitability models consisted of weighted logistic regression models comparing environmental conditions at nest versus non-nest sites. We developed models at each of 3 wildfire locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, and then examined predictive performance for each model at alternate ("application") locations. Models generally discriminated nest from non-nest sites well at locations where they were developed but performance was variable at application locations, indicating limited transferability. Models for Black-backed Woodpecker and those that included field-collected environmental covariates exhibited greater transferability than models for Lewis's Woodpecker and those that only included remotely sensed covariates. Transferability was also generally poor between Oregon and the other 2 locations. Limitations to model transferability observed in this study suggest models developed at any one wildfire location are unlikely to be generally applicable across the entire range of Black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers. Generally applicable models to inform post-fire forest management will therefore likely require integration of data from multiple wildfire locations. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.

AB  - It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Abundance, size, and spatial distribution of standing dead trees (snags), are key indicators of forest biodiversity and ecosystem health. These metrics represent critical habitat components for various wildlife species of conservation concern, including the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), which is strongly associated with recently burned conifer forest. We assessed the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) to detect and characterize conifer snags and identify Black-backed Woodpecker habitat using previously derived empirical thresholds of conifer snag basal area. Over the footprint of the Rim Fire, a megafire that extended (~104,000 ha) through a heterogeneous mosaic of conifer forests, oak woodlands, and meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, we identified conifer snags and estimated their basal area from single-tree ALS-derived metrics using Gaussian processes in four major steps. First, individual trees were mapped using the Watershed Segmentation algorithm, resulting in 87% detection of trees with stem diameter larger than 30cm. Second, the snag/live classification model identified snags with an overall accuracy of 91.8%, using the coefficient of variation of height and intensity together with maximum intensity and fractional cover as the most relevant metrics. Third, the conifer/hardwood snag classification model utilizing the maximum height, median height, minimum intensity, and area metrics separated snag forest types with an overall accuracy of 84.8%. Finally, a Gaussian process regression model reliably estimated conifer snag stem diameter (R2 = 0.81) using height and crown area, thus significantly outperforming regionally calibrated conifer-specific allometric equations. As a result, ~80% of the snag basal area have been mapped. Optimal and potential habitat for Black-backed Woodpecker comprise 53.7 km2 and 58.4 km2, respectively, representing 5.1 and 5.6% of the footprint of the Rim Fire. Our study illustrates the utility of high-density ALS data for characterizing recently burned forests, which, in conjunction with information about the habitat needs of particular snag-dependent wildlife species, can be used to assess habitat characteristics, and thus contribute greatly to forest management and biodiversity conservation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nest care is an important parental contribution to offspring. In woodpeckers, males often have an equal or greater contribution to parental care, including nest sanitation. The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a North American boreal woodpecker for which both parents are highly involved in parental care. By modifying their territory size in optimal and suboptimal habitat (e.g. burned vs unburned habitats), this species seems to have a large tolerance to variation in prey abundance at a landscape scale, and could provide a useful biological model to investigate the adaptability of parent care, particularly to relative contribution of each sex. We investigated sex-and habitat-specific parental care behaviour of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 9 nests by daily monitoring during the nestling period. Specifically, we examined two different aspects of parental care: 1) time spent at the nest, and 2) food delivery. We also compared relative contribution between sexes to nest sanitation. Despite our small sample sizes, our results show that males are more involved in nest sanitation and spend longer at the nest, and both sexes exhibit higher food delivery rates and spend less time at the nest in burned habitat. This latter result may suggest that greater effort is needed to provision Black-backed Woodpecker nestlings in unburned habitat compared to burned habitat. © 2016, BirdLife Hungary.

AB  - We conducted bird surveys in 10 of the first 11 years following a mixed-severity fire in a dry, low-elevation mixed-conifer forest in western Montana, United States. By defining fire in terms of fire severity and time-since-fire, and then comparing detection rates for species inside 15 combinations of fire severity and time-since-fire, with their rates of detection in unburned (but otherwise similar) forest outside the burn perimeter, we were able to assess more nuanced effects of fire on 50 bird species. A majority of species (60%) was detected significantly more frequently inside than outside the burn. It is likely that the beneficial effects of fire for some species can be detected only under relatively narrow combinations of fire severity and time-since-fire. Because most species responded positively and uniquely to some combination of fire severity and time-since-fire, these results carry important management implications. Specifically, the variety of burned-forest conditions required by fire-dependent bird species cannot be created through the application of relatively uniform low-severity prescribed fires, through land management practices that serve to reduce fire severity or through post-fire salvage logging, which removes the dead trees required by most disturbance-dependent bird species. © IAWF 2016.

AB  - Population age structure is important for understanding population dynamics, but can be difficult to resolve in landbirds due to the limited number of age classes discernible by examining plumage. In forests of western North America, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides articus) typically colonize burned areas shortly after fire, but densities decline within 6-10 yr. This pattern is often assumed to result from adult Black-backed Woodpeckers abandoning territories when food resources wane, yet long-distance breeding dispersal is relatively rare in birds, whereas long-distance natal dispersal is more common. To determine whether colonization of newly burned areas is driven primarily by breeding dispersal of adults or natal dispersal by young birds, we captured 57 adult Black-backed Woodpeckers in 6 burned areas in California between 1 and 8 yr after fire. We used patterns of multiple feather generations retained among primary coverts, secondaries, and secondary coverts to assign birds to 1 of 5 age classes (second-, third-, and fourth-calendar-year; after-third-calendar-year; and after-fourth-calendar-year). Population age structure varied dramatically across burned areas, with a preponderance of second-calendar-year birds in the 1 yr and 2 yr postfire areas, and a preponderance of birds at least 3 yr old in the older postfire areas. Poisson generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) revealed that the effect of years since fire on woodpecker age was highly significant (z = 3.575, P < 0.001). Our results indicate that natal dispersal is the primary means by which Black-backed Woodpeckers colonize recently burned areas in western forests, and that breeding dispersal is uncommon. The decline of Black-backed Woodpecker populations 6-10 yr after fire likely reflects the lifespan of individual birds that colonized the burned area, or of offspring that they produced in the early postfire years. Our discrimination of Black-backed Woodpeckers into 5 age classes confirms previous suppositions about plumage-based age determination in woodpeckers, and is likely applicable to other woodpecker species. © 2016 American Ornithologists' Union.

AB  - Important lessons emerge from studies of birds in ecosystems born of, and maintained by, mixed- to high-severity fire. Specifically, (1) the effect of fire on any one species is context dependent. It depends on the time since the fire, the fire severity, and vegetation type and condition. (2) Bird species respond differently to any given postfire condition and, given an appropriate time since the fire and postfire vegetation conditions, most benefit from severe fire. (3) Some bird species (the black-backed woodpecker being iconic) seem to depend on conditions created by severe fire, as evidenced by their distribution patterns, territory sizes, nest success, and other adaptations. (4) Given these facts, current management practices designed to prevent fire, suppress fire, mitigate fire severity, "restore" or "rehabilitate" burned forests after fire, and mimic the effects of severe fire are incompatible with the maintenance of bird populations and, therefore, ecosystem integrity. © 2015 by Dominick A.

AB  - Dead and decaying trees may be a limited resource for woodpeckers in managed forests, especially for species that rely on dead wood for nesting and foraging. Whereas recent nest web studies greatly increased our understanding of nest tree use by woodpeckers, knowledge on woodpeckers foraging requirements is much less developed. We quantified and compared tree selection patterns and foraging behavior of six bark-foraging woodpeckers - downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), American three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyropicus varius) and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) - that co-occur in eastern boreal forests of North America. A total of 271 observation bouts and more than 600 foraging trees were recorded at three study sites characterized as mixedwood, conifer, and burn. Our results show that dead wood represents an important foraging substrate for most bark-foraging woodpeckers in Canadian eastern boreal forests. However, significant differences in individual species were found with regard to substrate use patterns, foraging behavior and associated prey. Woodpeckers were categorized according to their selection for specific stages of tree degradation, with the yellow-bellied sapsucker and the pileated woodpecker representing opposite ends of this gradient. The black-backed woodpecker showed the highest use of dead wood and was very specific in its tree selection by using mostly recently dead trees. We emphasize that providing foraging substrates for most woodpecker species not only requires maintaining dead wood but also paying heed to the underlying dynamics of dead wood (e.g. recruitment and degradation) in managed boreal forest landscapes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dramatic fluctuations in food resources are a key feature of many habitats, and many species have evolved a movement strategy to exploit food resources that are unpredictable in space and time. The availability of food resources may be a particularly strong determinant of habitat quality for irruptive bird species. We studied the apparent foraging success of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), an irruptive species that responds opportunistically to pulsed food resources in burned forests and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations. Prior investigations revealed that the highest population growth rates of Black-backed Woodpeckers occurred in habitat created by summer wildfire, with intermediate population growth rates in MPB infestations, and the lowest population growth rates in habitats created by prescribed fire in fall. We tested whether apparent foraging success was associated with known habitat quality in order to assess the potential for food availability to regulate population growth. We counted the number of successfully captured wood-boring beetle larvae and "small" prey on each tree that a Blackbacked Woodpecker used for foraging and modeled these counts as a function of habitat, tree diameter, number of years postfire, and tree disturbance category. Total apparent foraging success (the sum of observed captures of woodboring beetle larvae and small prey per tree) did not vary across habitats, but woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by summer wildfire were expected to capture 2.2 and 2.0 times more wood-boring beetles than woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations, respectively. These results suggest that the availability of food resources may contribute to population regulation in this irruptive species. Furthermore, population growth in irruptive species may be highly sensitive to the availability of preferred food resources. Forests recently burned by summer wildfires provide relatively abundant food resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers and represent high-quality habitat for this species of conservation concern. © 2015 Cooper Ornithological Society.

AB  - Black-backed woodpecker is known to be a disturbance-associated species, being more abundant in disturbed forest stands than in undisturbed habitats, but its demography and population dynamic still need to be clarified. The present study was conducted in central Quebec within coniferous forests shaped largely by timber harvest and wildfire. The objectives were to compare the age composition of breeding black-backed woodpeckers, nest survival rate and productivity in both disturbed and undisturbed habitats (respectively recently burned and unburned habitats). In addition, we evaluated the general productivity of both habitat types in a simulated boreal landscape. There was a positive relationship between nest age and daily survival rates. Older woodpeckers were the most abundant breeders in unburned habitats and younger birds in oneyear-old burns. Although nests in recently burned forests produced more nestlings per successful nest, our simulation of a boreal forest landscape showed that unburned habitat produced about two-thirds more fledglings per year than burned habitat. Globally, unburned habitat may provide woodpeckers more temporally stable resources. Population dynamics of the black-backed woodpecker, at least in our study area, may be explained by resource pulse interactions where populations benefit opportunistically from short-term high-quality habitat, and rely on unburned habitats for long-term persistence. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Several studies have addressed the importance of woodpeckers as ecological engineers in forests due to their excavation of cavities. Although research in green, unburned forests has identified the influence of different excavators on secondary use by cavity-dependent species, little is known about the relative importance of cavities created by woodpeckers in recently burned forests. By excavating cavities, woodpeckers create habitat for secondary cavity users that can facilitate post-fire regeneration through seed dispersal, seed germination and regulation of insect populations that affect vegetative growth. In this study, we monitored 77 cavities created by three species of Picoides woodpeckers for use by secondary cavity species in a fire that burned in the Sierra Nevada, California. At each cavity we measured nest tree and site-specific parameters to determine if these characteristics could explain differential use by secondary cavity users. We found substantial overlap in cavity characteristics between woodpecker species, with the white-headed woodpecker differing most notably in their placement of cavities in larger diameter, shorter and more decayed trees in less dense stands than either hairy or black-backed woodpeckers. These differences in cavity placement may have resulted in the high diversity and large number of detections of secondary cavity species in white-headed woodpecker cavities. Black-backed and hairy woodpeckers were similar in the number of detections of secondary cavity use, although black-backed woodpecker cavities were used by more species than hairy woodpecker cavities. Secondary cavity use was high (86%) suggesting these woodpeckers, and the white-headed woodpecker in particular, can have an accelerating affect effect on ecological succession by providing valuable habitat features for seed dispersing birds and mammals, insectivorous birds, and small predators, thereby impacting ecological processes and functions. © 2015 The Zoological Society of London.

AB  - The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a species of conservation concern that is strongly associated with recently burned forests. Black-backed Woodpeckers are known to have variable home-range sizes, yet the ecological factors related to this variation have not been adequately explored and may hold insights into the natural history of the species and the management of its habitat. During 2011 and 2012, we radio-tracked Black-backed Woodpeckers nesting in 3 forested areas of California that burned between 2 and 5 years before the initiation of tracking. Among 15 individuals with robust tracking data, we found that home-range size varied by an order of magnitude, from 24.1 to 304.1 ha, as measured by movement-based kernel estimation. Using an information-theoretic approach, we evaluated the functional relationship between snag basal area-an a priori key resource-and home-range size, additionally controlling for sex, age, and years since fire as covariates. We found that snag basal area alone best predicted home-range size, explaining 54-62% of observed variation. As snag basal area increased, home-range sizes exponentially decreased. This relationship held true both with and without the inclusion of 3 individuals that nested in burned forest yet foraged predominantly outside the fire perimeter in unburned forest. Snag basal area, unlike other potential influences on home-range size, is an attribute that forest managers can directly influence. We describe a quantitative relationship between home-range size and snag basal area that forest managers can use to predict Black-backed Woodpecker pair density in burned forests and assess the likely population consequences of specific harvest treatments. Given that the birds in our study, foraging primarily in burned forest, all had home ranges with an average snag basal area ≥17 m2 ha-1, this may represent a benchmark for minimum habitat needs in postfire stands. © 2014 Cooper Ornithological Society.

AB  - Wildfire and mountain pine beetle infestations are naturally occurring disturbances in western North American forests. Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are emblematic of the role these disturbances play in creating wildlife habitat, since they are strongly associated with recently-killed forests. However, management practices aimed at reducing the economic impact of natural disturbances can result in habitat loss for this species. Although black-backed woodpeckers occupy habitats created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and mountain pine beetle infestations. Our finding that population growth rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the landscape. The lower growth rates in fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations may be attributed to differences in predator communities and food resources relative to summer wildfire.

AB  - Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a disturbance-dependent species that occupy recently burned forest and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of disturbed forest may lead to habitat loss for Black-backed Woodpeckers, which have recently been petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act. We studied home range size and resource selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers occupying habitat created by summer wildfire, fall prescribed fire, and MPB infestations in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We studied home range size and resource selection by attaching radio-transmitters to adult Black-backed Woodpeckers. We estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n=28 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n=19 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n=27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian framework (n=5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n=16 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n=8 in habitat created by MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat (mean home range size=79ha) and 2-year post fall prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size=143ha). Home range size was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size=307ha) and was greatest in 3-4year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home range size=430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size=460ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200ha by exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in summer wildfires &lt;200ha and retaining at least 50% of summer wildfires &gt;400ha. Ideally, recently burned forest patches should be composed of ≥27m2 basal area/ha of trees that burned at moderate or high severity, with at least 40% of the basal area composed of trees ≥27cm DBH. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is strongly associated with recently burned forest, which makes it vulnerable to salvage logging or other post-fire forest management that removes snags. As part of a larger radio-telemetry study of the species' resource use and habitat selection in a burned forest in California, we located radio-tagged Black-backed Woodpeckers at night to find and describe their roost sites. We found 14 unique roost locations during night-time searches for five individual birds. Description of the micro-site on the tree that the bird used was impossible at five roosts where we could not visually locate the bird in the dark. At the nine roosts confirmed visually, none of the birds roosted in excavated cavities. Rather, they roosted in sheltered spaces within burned-out hollows of trunks (5 instances), in the crook of a forked trunk (1 instance), wedged between adjacent trunks of two closely spaced trees (1 instance), in a deep, natural bark furrow (1 instance), and clinging to a trunk directly above a horizontal branch (1 instance). Eleven of the 14 roosts (79%) were in dead trees. Our results suggest that in burned forests the Black-backed Woodpecker may benefit if, during salvage logging, emphasis is placed on retaining snags with burned-out hollows, forked trunks, or other relatively unusual structures that may create crevices or other opportunities for shelter.

AB  - Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a rare habitat specialist typically found in moderate and high severity burned forest throughout its range. It also inhabits green forest but little is known about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas, especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011 - 2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since 1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects, number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest, and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05 and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in efforts to conserve this rare species. © 2014 by the author(s).

AB  - To conserve habitat for disturbance specialist species, ecologists must identify where individuals will likely settle in newly disturbed areas. Habitat suitability models can predict which sites at new disturbances will most likely attract specialists. Without validation data from newly disturbed areas, however, the best approach for maximizing predictive accuracy can be unclear (Northwestern U.S.A.). We predicted habitat suitability for nesting Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus; a burned-forest specialist) at 20 recently (≤6 years postwildfire) burned locations in Montana using models calibrated with data from three locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. We developed 8 models using three techniques (weighted logistic regression, Maxent, and Mahalanobis D2 models) and various combinations of four environmental variables describing burn severity, the north-south orientation of topographic slope, and prefire canopy cover. After translating model predictions into binary classifications (0 = low suitability to unsuitable, 1 = high to moderate suitability), we compiled "ensemble predictions," consisting of the number of models (0-8) predicting any given site as highly suitable. The suitability status for 40% of the area burned by eastside Montana wildfires was consistent across models and therefore robust to uncertainty in the relative accuracy of particular models and in alternative ecological hypotheses they described. Ensemble predictions exhibited two desirable properties: (1) a positive relationship with apparent rates of nest occurrence at calibration locations and (2) declining model agreement outside surveyed environments consistent with our reduced confidence in novel (i.e., "no-analogue") environments. Areas of disagreement among models suggested where future surveys could help validate and refine models for an improved understanding of Black-backed Woodpecker nesting habitat relationships. Ensemble predictions presented here can help guide managers attempting to balance salvage logging with habitat conservation in burned-forest landscapes where black-backed woodpecker nest location data are not immediately available. Ensemble modeling represents a promising tool for guiding conservation of large-scale disturbance specialists. © 2013 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - An exciting advance in the understanding of metapopulation dynamics has been the investigation of how populations respond to ephemeral patches that go 'extinct' during the lifetime of an individual. Previous research has shown that this scenario leads to genetic homogenization across large spatial scales. However, little is known about fine-scale genetic structuring or how this changes over time in ephemeral patches. We predicted that species that specialize on ephemeral habitats will delay dispersal to exploit natal habitat patches while resources are plentiful and thus display fine-scale structure. To investigate this idea, we evaluated the effect of frequent colonization of ephemeral habitats on the fine-scale genetic structure of a fire specialist, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) and found a pattern of fine-scale genetic structure. We then tested for differences in spatial structure between sexes and detected a pattern consistent with male-biased dispersal. We also detected a temporal increase in relatedness among individuals within newly burned forest patches. Our results indicate that specialist species that outlive their ephemeral patches can accrue significant fine-scale spatial structure that does not necessarily affect spatial structure at larger scales. This highlights the importance of both spatial and temporal scale considerations in both sampling and data interpretation of molecular genetic results. © 2013 Pierson et al.

AB  - We examined foraging-habitat selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in burned forests of southwestern Idaho during 2000 and 2002 (6 and 8 years following wildfire). This woodpecker responds positively to large-scale fire disturbances and may be at risk from logging and post-fire management. With 100 radio-locations of four adult males, we used resource-selection probability functions in logistic form in an information-theoretic framework to model the Black-backed Woodpecker's selection of foraging habitat at fine and coarse spatial scales. Fine-scale data included characteristics of the foraging tree (tree level) and local habitat surrounding foraging trees (plot level, 0.04 ha), whereas coarse-scale data (224-778 ha) included patch characteristics within home ranges. Model selection by Akaike's information criterion identified a multi-scale model containing tree- and plot-level covariates, and their interaction, as the best model to characterize foraging trees. The positive effect of interaction between foraging-tree diameter and plot-level tree density suggested that foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers select both patches with dense trees and larger-diameter trees. Fire severity was not important, possibly because of the time since fire and the birds' habit of foraging on recently dead trees in adjacent unburned forests. Salvage logging that retains large-diameter trees in clumped distributions is most likely to provide long-term foraging habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers in dry coniferous forests of the interior western U.S. Following wildfire, conservation of forest patches containing weakened trees may extend the suitability of habitat for foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers by up to 8 years. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2012.

AB  - A stand-replacing fire in 404 ha of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and mixed pine forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in 2007 resulted in Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) nesting at high density in 2008, the second possible nesting season post-fire. Nests were found within a 93-ha study area and a 19-ha stand (a subset of the 93-ha study area) in 199.5 survey hours concentrated in March-July. The 19-ha stand had six nests, a density of 0.31 nests/ha or 0.63 individuals/ha, while the 93-ha study area had 20 nests yielding 0.21 nests/ha or 0.42 individuals/ha. These nest densities are higher than previously reported in the literature for comparable stands, indicating a large influx of nesting woodpeckers post-fire. High nesting densities in this study may have resulted from: (1) optimal timing of the fire for wood-boring beetle exploitation of burned trees, (2) the discrete nature of burned habitat in the study due to impacts of salvage logging, or (3) our focus on regions of the burn where high nesting densities occurred, as the entire burned area (404 ha) was not included in nest density calculations. © 2011 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

AB  - Burned forests represent high-quality habitats for many deadwood-dependent species. Yet, post-fire conditions may vary greatly within and among burns and thereby may affect habitat suitability for these species. We studied habitat selection of nesting black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus Swainson) in recently burned spruce-dominated boreal forests. Our objectives were to (i) identify factors involved in snag selection for both nesting and foraging and (ii) examine selection of nest sites within the burned landscape. A total of 92 nests and 1612 foraging observations were used to investigate snag selection. Our results show that both pre-fire forest conditions and fire severity are important in determining the quality of burned forests for black-backed woodpeckers. This species selected large snags for both nesting (>20 cm DBH) and foraging (>15 cm DBH). Woodpeckers selected deciduous and degraded "pre-fire" snags for nesting whereas black spruce snags that had been created by fire and that were moderately burned were preferred for foraging. Nest sites were concentrated in burned mature stands and supported higher densities of large snags (e.g., >15 cm DBH). Our results suggest that burned forest patches of at least 20 ha and composed mainly of burned mature and old-growth forests should be maintained during post-fire harvesting. The decrease in the amount of late seral stands in managed forest landscapes raises concerns about the future availability of high-quality burned forests for this species.

AB  - Salvage logging practices in recently burned forests often have direct effects on species associated with dead trees, particularly cavity-nesting birds. As such, evaluation of postfire management practices on nest survival rates of cavity nesters is necessary for determining conservation strategies. We monitored 1,797 nests of 6 cavity-nesting bird species: Lewis's woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), black-backed woodpecker (P. arcticus), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), and mountain bluebird (S. currucoides) from 1994 to 2004 in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), mixed-severity burned forests (partially logged and unlogged) of Idaho, USA. Based on a priori hypotheses, we modeled daily survival rate (DSR) of nests as a function of abiotic (temperature, precipitation), temporal (time since fire, calendar year) and biotic factors (distance to unburned forest, nest height, and tree harvest [partial-salvage logging vs. unlogged]). Multiple abiotic and biotic factors, other than direct effects of salvage logging, affected daily survival rates of breeding cavity-nesting birds. Hairy woodpecker was the only species in which partial-salvage logging had a measurable, negative impact on DSR. Managers implementing carefully planned salvage logging prescriptions that include both unlogged reserves and partially logged areas can expect to maintain habitat for successfully breeding cavity-nesting birds of the interior northwestern United States. Our results also suggest that nest survival for some species of cavity-nesting birds could be improved if unlogged reserves are located centrally in postfire forests, distant from unburned habitats that potentially serve as sources of nest predators. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) has been designated by the USDA Forest Service as a management indicator species for snags in burned conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. However, little is known about the characteristics that affect between-fire and within-fire habitat selection by the species in the region. Here we report on the first broad-scale survey of Black-backed Woodpeckers on wildfire-affected forests of the Sierra Nevada. We implemented a Bayesian hierarchical model to: 1) estimate Black-backed Woodpecker occupancy probability in fire areas burned within a time window of 1-10 years; 2) identify relationships between occupancy probability and habitat covariates (fire age, change in canopy cover pre-to-post fire, and snag basal area), elevation, and latitude; and 3) estimate detection probability and relate it to survey interval length and survey type (passive v. broadcast). We included random fire-area effects in our model of occupancy probability to accommodate clusters of nonindependent points surveyed within the larger set of fire areas. Mean occupancy probability was estimated to be 0.097. Elevation (after controlling for latitude) had the strongest effect on occupancy probability (higher occupancy at higher elevation) followed by latitude (higher occupancy at northerly sites). Fire age was also important; occupancy probability was about 43higher on the youngest compared to oldest fires. Although the direction of regression coefficients were in the expected direction (positive), snag basal area and canopy cover change were of minor importance in affecting occupancy probability. There was some indication, however, that the importance of snag basal area increased with fire age. Weak links between occupancy and canopy cover change suggested the species uses a range of burn severities, and such heterogeneity may promote habitat longevity. Our estimate of overall detection probability (across all survey intervals) was 0.772. We found strong effects of survey interval length (higher for longer interval) and, especially survey type (higher for broadcast survey) on detection probability. Our modeling framework and implementation illustrates the flexibility of the Bayesian hierarchical approach for handling complexities such as estimating derived parameters (and variances) and modeling random effects, and should prove generally useful for occupancy studies. © 2011 Saracco et al.

AB  - Fuel-reduction/forest restoration treatments that consist of thinning followed by prescribed burning are becoming increasingly important land management actions that likely affect various wildlife species. To assess potential effects on bark-gleaning birds, we compared the foraging patterns of five cavity-nesting species in thinned and burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest sites and control sites. We recorded foraging behavior, location on forage tree, and tree characteristics that may be important in the selection of foraging substrates. Foraging surveys were conducted on three replicate 20-ha thinned/burned plots located within larger treatments that ranged from 60 - 250 ha, paired with three replicate control plots. Red-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta canadensis) foraged more often in control sites. Mountain Chickadees (Poecile gambeli) foraged at similar rates on both treatment types. Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), Hairy Woodpeckers (P. villosus) and White-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis) foraged almost exclusively in thinned/burned sites. Overall, all species selectively foraged on larger diameter trees. In control sites, Red-breasted Nuthatches selected larger ponderosa pine trees and Mountain Chickadees selected larger, live trees. In thinned/burned sites, Red-breasted Nuthatches selected larger, live trees, Mountain Chickadees selected larger trees with more canopy connections, Black-backed Woodpeckers selected trees with beetle evidence present and Hairy Woodpeckers selected recently dead trees. These results suggest fuel reduction/forest restoration treatments in dry ponderosa pine forests may be compatible with providing foraging substrates for cavity-nesting species often present in post-fire habitats. © Pierson et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.

AB  - Fire severity can vary greatly within and among burns, even in the Canadian boreal forest where fire regimes consist mostly of stand-replacing fires. We investigated the effects of fire severity on the long-term occupancy of burns by (i) saproxylic insects and (ii) three wood-foraging birds. Based on observations made 6 to 11 years after fire in burned conifer forests that varied in fire severity in Quebec, Canada, our results indicate that low-severity portions of the burns likely provided snag conditions suitable for the long-term presence of deadwood-associated insects and birds. The black-backed woodpecker, a post-fire forest specialist, was still abundant 6 and 8 years after fire. This pattern was likely explained by the persistence of several saproxylic insect species that are associated with recently dead trees and by the positive effect of lower fire severity on the abundance of Arhopalus foveicollis, a cerambycid with a long life cycle in dead wood. The American three-toed woodpecker and the brown creeper, and their associated prey (Scolytinae beetles), were more abundant in burned stands of lower v. higher severity. We conclude that less severely burned snags and stands within high-severity burns may favour the long-term presence of trophic webs that involve saproxylic insects and wood-foraging birds in burned boreal forests. © 2010 IAWF.

AB  - We used population- and individual-based genetic approaches to assess barriers to movement in black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), a fire-specialist that mainly occupies the boreal forest in North America. We tested if male and female woodpeckers exhibited the same movement patterns using both spatially implicit and explicit genetic analyses to define population structure and movement patterns of both sexes among populations. Three genetic groups were identified, a large, genetically continuous population that spans from the Rocky Mountains to Quebec, a small isolated population in South Dakota and a separate population in the western portion of their distribution (Oregon). Patterns of genetic diversity suggest extensive gene flow mediated by both males and females within the continuous boreal forest. However, male-mediated gene flow is the main form of connectivity between the continuously distributed group and the smaller populations of South Dakota and Oregon that are separated by large areas of unforested habitat, which apparently serves as a barrier to movement of female woodpeckers. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Areas of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks in the Black Hills can provide habitat for black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), a U.S. Forest Service, Region 2 Sensitive Species. These outbreaks are managed through removal of trees infested with mountain pine beetles to control mountain pine beetle populations and salvage timber resources. To minimize impacts to black-backed woodpeckers while meeting management objectives, there is a need to identify characteristics of these areas that support black-backed woodpeckers. We examined the habitat associations of this species nesting in areas of beetle outbreaks in the Black Hills, South Dakota in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic approach and discrete choice models to evaluate nest-site selection of 42 woodpecker nests at 3 spatial scales-territory, nest area, and nest tree. At the territory scale (250 m around nest), availability and distribution of food best explained black-backed woodpecker selection of beetle outbreaks versus the surrounding forest. Selection at the territory scale was positively associated with densities of trees currently infested by mountain pine beetles and indices of wood borer (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) abundance, and was greatest at distances of 50-100 m from the nearest patch of infestation. At the nest-area scale (12.5 m radius around the nest), densities of snags positively influenced nest-area selection. Finally, at the nest-tree scale, aspen (Populus tremuloides) and 3-5-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags were important resources. The association between abundant wood-boring insects and black-backed woodpeckers creates a difficult challenge for forest managers. In the absence of fire, areas of beetle outbreak might serve as the only substantial source of habitat in the Black Hills. Regulating insect populations via salvage logging will reduce key food resources to black-backed woodpeckers during nesting. Therefore, given the relatively infrequent occurrence of large-scale fire in the Black Hills, management should recognize the importance of beetle-killed forests to the long-term viability of the black-backed woodpecker population in the Black Hills. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is considered a fire specialist throughout its breeding range. Given its high abundance in recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time. Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success declined from 84% the first year after fire to 73% and 25%, respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests. Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests. Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature and over-mature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Prescribed fire is a management tool used to reduce fuel loads on public lands in forested areas in the western United States. Identifying the impacts of prescribed fire on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive, threatened, and migratory bird species. Recent developments in occupancy modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for detection probability, and we demonstrate the model's usefulness for identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities. Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the flexibility of the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our modeling of the impacts of prescribed fire on avian communities in a ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed fire treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several bark-insectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed fire, whereas three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined following treatments. Land management agencies interested in determining the effects of habitat manipulations on wildlife communities can use these methods to provide guidance for future management activities. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Accurate estimates of Black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and Hairy Woodpecker (P. villosus) nests and nest survival rates in post-fire landscapes provide land managers with information on the relative importance of burned forests to nesting woodpeckers. We conducted multiple-observer surveys in burned and unburned mixed coniferous forests in Oregon to identify important factors influencing detection rates of wood-pecker nests. We found 21 Black-backed Woodpecker nests and 38 Hairy Woodpecker nests in burned forest, and three Hairy Woodpecker nests in unburned forest. Competing models of detection probability in Program MARK indicated that nest-detection probability differed by nest stage. We found no evidence to indicate that detection rates of nests were associated with survey timing during the nesting season. Raw nest counts in burned coniferous forests may underestimate nest numbers, especially for nests in early stages of development. Black-backed Woodpecker nests were slightly more detectable than those of Hairy Woodpeckers in burned forests, and observers may differ in their abilities to detect nests.

AB  - In coniferous forests of western North American, fire is an important disturbance that influences the structure and composition of floral and faunal communities. The impacts of postfire management, including salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5-6 snags retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon. We used analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three hypotheses concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage on densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds, and two hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage logging on relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined the relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species. We did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities or relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P. villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment. We detected significant differences between years for four species of birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting robust patterns that transcend particular locations. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large wildfire events in coniferous forests of the western United States are often followed by postfire timber harvest. The long-term impacts of postfire timber harvest on fire-associated cavity-nesting bird species are not well documented. We studied nest-site selection by cavity-nesting birds over a 10-year period (1994-2003), representing 1-11 years after fire, on two burns created by mixed severity wildfires in western Idaho, USA. One burn was partially salvaged logged (the Foothills burn), the other was primarily unlogged (the Star Gulch burn). We monitored 1367 nests of six species (Lewis's Woodpecker Melanerpes lewis, Hairy Woodpecker Picoides villosus, Black-backed Woodpecker P. arcticus, Northern Flicker Colaptes auratus, Western Bluebird Sialia mexicana, and Mountain Bluebird S. currucoides). Habitat data at nest and non-nest random locations were characterized at fine (field collected) and coarse (remotely sensed) spatial scales. Nest-site selection for most species was consistently associated with higher snag densities and larger snag diameters, whereas wildfire location (Foothills versus Star Gulch) was secondarily important. All woodpecker species used nest sites with larger diameter snags that were surrounded by higher densities of snags than at non-nest locations. Nests of Hairy Woodpecker and Mountain Bluebird were primarily associated with the unlogged wildfire, whereas nests of Lewis's Woodpecker and Western Bluebird were associated with the partially logged burn in the early years after fire. Nests of wood-probing species (Hairy and Black-backed Woodpeckers) were also located in larger forest patch areas than patches measured at non-nest locations. Our results confirm previous findings that maintaining clumps of large snags in postfire landscapes is necessary for maintaining breeding habitat of cavity-nesting birds. Additionally, appropriately managed salvage logging can create habitat for some species of cavity-nesting birds that prefer more open environments. Our findings can be used by land mangers to develop design criteria for postfire salvage logging that will reserve breeding habitat for cavity-nesting birds.

AB  - Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are burned-forest specialists that rely on beetles (Coleoptera) for food. In the Black Hills, South Dakota, standing dead forests resulting from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks offer food resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers, in addition to providing habitat similar to burned forest. However, data on reproductive rates in these habitats are lacking. We estimated nest success and evaluated factors affecting nest survival of Black-backed Woodpeckers in beetle-killed forests in the Black Hills in 2004 and 2005. Nest success was 78% (n = 12) in 2004 and 44% (n = 31) in 2005. Fledging rates per pair were 2.0 ± 0.3 SE (n = 12) and 1.4 ± 0.3 SE (n = 28) in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Our results showed that temporal effects (e.g., age, date, and year) had the greatest influence on nest survival. Nest age was the most important predictor of daily nest survival; survival was higher in older nests. Nest survival was also lower later in the breeding season. The difference in nest success between the two years requires further study; however, nest success of Black-backed Woodpeckers in beetle-killed forests in the Black Hills was within the range of nest success within postfire habitats in this area. In the Black Hills, forests experiencing beetle outbreaks offer available habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2008.

AB  - Many scientists and forest land managers concur that past fire suppression, grazing, and timber harvesting practices have created unnatural and unhealthy conditions in the dry, ponderosa pine forests of the western United States. Specifically, such forests are said to carry higher fuel loads and experience fires that are more severe than those that occurred historically. It remains unclear, however, how far these generalizations can be extrapolated in time and space, and how well they apply to the more mesic ponderosa pine systems and to other forest systems within the western United States. I use data on the pattern of distribution of one bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) as derived from 16 465 sample locations to show that, in western Montana, this bird species is extremely specialized on severely burned forests. Such specialization has profound implications because it suggests that the severe fires we see burning in many forests in the Intermountain West are not entirely "unnatural" or "unhealthy." Instead, severely burned forest conditions have probably occurred naturally across a broad range of forest types for millennia. These findings highlight the fact that severe fire provides an important ecological backdrop for fire specialists like the Black-backed Woodpecker, and that the presence and importance of severe fire may be much broader than commonly appreciated. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - In forests, high-severity burn patches-wherein most or all of the trees are killed by fire-often occur within a mosaic of low- and moderate-severity effects. Although there have been several studies of postfire salvage-logging effects on bird species, there have been few studies of effects on bird species associated with high-severity patches in forests that have otherwise burned at lower severities. From 2004 to 2006, we investigated the foraging presence or absence of three woodpecker species, the Black-backed (Picoides arcticus), Hairy (P. villosus), and White-headed (P. albolarvatus) Woodpeckers, within four different forest habitat conditions in Sierra Nevada conifer forests: unburned; moderate-severity and unlogged; high-severity and unlogged; and high-severity and logged. We found Black-backed Woodpecker foraging was restricted to unlogged high-severity patches. Hairy Woodpeckers foraged most in unlogged high-severity patches, and White-headed Woodpeckers showed no significant difference in presence among conditions. These results suggest that unlogged, high-severity forest is important habitat for the Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2008.

AB  - We examined home range size of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) / Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests of southwestern Idaho during 2000 and 2002 (6 and 8 years following fire). Home range size for 4 adult males during the post-fledging period was 115.6-420.9 ha using the 95% fixed-kernel method, and 150.4-766.1 ha using the 100% minimum convex polygon method. Smoothed bootstrap estimates (95%) were 130.0-521.9 ha. Home range sizes were significantly smaller 6 years after fire than 8 years after fire. Each male had from 2 to 8 areas of concentrated use within his home range. We provide recommendations for estimating area requirements of Black-backed Woodpeckers in post-fire ponderosa pine / Douglas-fir forests.

AB  - Models of habitat suitability in postfire landscapes are needed by land managers to make timely decisions regarding postfire timber harvest and other management activities. Many species of cavity-nesting birds are dependent on postfire landscapes for breeding and other aspects of their life history and are responsive to postfire management activities (e.g., timber harvest). In addition, several cavity nesters are designated as species at risk. We compare the ability of 2 types of models to distinguish between nest and non-nest locations of 6 cavity-nesting bird species (Lewis's woodpecker [Melanerpes lewis], black-backed woodpecker [Picoides arcticus], hairy woodpecker [P. villosus], northern flicker [Colaptes auratus], western bluebird [Sialia mexicana], and mountain bluebird [S. currucoides]) in the early postfire years for a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in Idaho, USA. The 2 model sets consisted of 1) models based on readily available remotely sensed data and 2) models containing field-collected data in addition to remotely sensed data (combination models). We evaluated models of nesting habitat by quantifying the model's ability to correctly identify nest and non-nest locations and by determining the percentage of correctly identified nest locations. Additionally, we developed relative habitat-suitability maps for nesting habitat of black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers from the best models. For all species except Lewis's woodpeckers, model performance improved with the addition of field-collected data. Models containing remotely sensed data adequately distinguished between nest and non-nest locations for black-backed woodpecker and Lewis's woodpecker only, whereas models containing both field-collected and remotely sensed data were adequate for all 6 species. Improvements in the availability of more accurate remote sensing technology would likely lead to improvements in the ability of the models to predict nesting locations. External validation with data from other wildfires is necessary to confirm the general applicability of our habitat-suitability models to other forests. Land managers responsible for maintaining habitat for cavity-nesting birds in postfire landscapes can use these models to identify potential nesting areas for these species and select areas in burned forests where postfire salvage logging is most likely to have minimal impacts on cavity-nesting bird habitats.

AB  - Canadian boreal forests are increasingly modified by post-fire removal of trees (salvage logging), yet the ecological consequences of this practice are little studied. As mixed-wood forests have recently become accessible for salvage operations, we studied woodpeckers in mixed-wood (trembling aspen Populus tremuloides and white spruce Picea glauca) and adjacent coniferous (black spruce Picea mariana and jack pine Pinus banksiana) areas to examine the effects of salvage logging and burn severity on these species. During 2003-2004 we carried out transect counts in 24 landscape units (625 ha each) that varied in pre-fire amount of merchantable mixed-wood (low = 7-15% and high = 25-35% of the unit area), salvage logging intensity (from control = no salvaging to high = 60-70% of merchantable mixed-wood harvested) and burn severity (estimates based on tree survival after fire). Six main findings are presented: (1) in mixed-wood areas subjected to salvage, total woodpecker abundance and woodpeckers of the genus Picoides (most notably black-backed woodpecker Picoides arcticus) responded negatively to increasing salvage logging intensity; (2) northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) showed a marginally significant positive response to salvage in the mixed-wood areas; (3) the salvage response of the black-backed woodpecker was season dependent (first post-fire summer, winter and second post-fire summer compared); (4) in coniferous but not in mixed-wood areas, black-backed woodpecker responded positively to increasing burn severity. Moreover, the response in coniferous habitat was stronger in the first post-fire summer, compared to the subsequent winter and the second post-fire summer. In the retained mixed-wood areas, northern flicker responded positively to increasing burn severity; (5) the majority of the detected 73 woodpecker nests with chicks were in trembling aspen trees or in mixed-wood stands; (6) among coniferous tree species, dead standing jack pine and white spruce trees had much greater evidence of woodpecker foraging than had black spruce (ca. 65-75% versus 15% of trees). These results indicate the crucial influence of salvage logging, the amount of retained mixed-wood forests and burn severity on woodpecker abundance. Hence we recommend retention of large, burned mixed-wood areas during salvage harvesting to support these dead-wood dependent birds. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We monitored the nest densities and nest survival of seven cavity-nesting bird species, including four open-space foragers (American Kestrel [Falco sparverius], Lewis's Woodpecker [Melanerpes lewis], Western Bluebird [Sialia mexicana], and Mountain Bluebird [S. currucoides]) and three wood-foragers (Hairy Woodpecker [Picoides villosus], Black-backed Woodpecker [P. arcticus], and Northern Flicker [Colaptes auratus]), after two wildfires (one partially salvage-logged and one unlogged) in western Idaho from 1994-2004. We estimated the relationship between nest density and time since fire, tested for statistical differences in nest densities and nest survival in the partially salvage-logged vs. unlogged wildfires, and tested for differences in nest survival between early (1-4 years after fire) and late (5-12 years after fire) postfire periods. Nest densities of open-space foragers and Northern Flickers generally increased with time since fire, whereas nest densities of Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers peaked 4-5 years postfire. Nest densities of wood-foraging species and Mountain Bluebirds were significantly higher in the unlogged burn, whereas Lewis's Woodpeckers had significantly higher nest densities in the partially logged burn. Kestrels tended to favor the partially logged burn, while Western Bluebird nest densities were nearly equal in both burned areas. For most species, postfire period and treatment (partially logged vs. unlogged) had little influence on nest survival. However, Hairy Woodpecker nest survival was significantly lower in the partially logged burn versus the unlogged wildfire in the early postfire period, and Lewis's Woodpecker nest survival was significantly reduced in the later postfire period versus the early postfire period in the partially logged burn. Importantly, the salvage logging was designed to retain more than half of the snags over 23 cm in diameter, which provided suitable nesting habitat for open-space foragers during the decade following fire. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2007.

AB  - We investigated the effects of postfire salvage logging on cavity-nesting birds by comparing nest densities and patterns of nest reuse over a three-year period in seven logged and eight unlogged patches of mixed-conifer forest in the Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife Management Area, Montana. We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots, but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots. Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in the salvage-logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent species in the northern Rocky Mountains - American Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters, which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots, nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially populations of primary cavity-nesting species. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2006.

AB  - The bird species in western North America that are most restricted to, and therefore most dependent on, severely burned conifer forests during the first years following a fire event depend heavily on the abundant standing snags for perch sites, nest sites, and food resources. Thus, it is critical to develop and apply appropriate snag-management guidelines to implement postfire timber harvest operations in the same locations. Unfortunately, existing guidelines designed for green-tree forests cannot be applied to postfire salvage sales because the snag needs of snag-dependent species in burned forests are not at all similar to the snag needs of snag-dependent species in green-tree forests. Birds in burned forests have very different snag-retention needs from those cavity-nesting bird species that have served as the focus for the development of existing snag-management guidelines. Specifically, many postfire specialists use standing dead trees not only for nesting purposes but for feeding purposes as well. Woodpeckers, in particular, specialize on wood-boring beetle larvae that are superabundant in fire-killed trees for several years following severe fire. Species such as the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) are nearly restricted in their habitat distribution to severely burned forests. Moreover, existing postfire salvage-logging studies reveal that most postfire specialist species are completely absent from burned forests that have been (even partially) salvage logged. I call for the long-overdue development and use of more meaningful snag-retention guidelines for postfire specialists, and I note that the biology of the most fire-dependent bird species suggests that even a cursory attempt to meet their snag needs would preclude postfire salvage logging in those severely burned conifer forests wherein the maintenance of biological diversity is deemed important. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - Presence-absence data is often used to determine the preferred habitat of a given organism. However, with presence-absence datasets there is a problem associated with the comparison between habitats when there is an inter-habitat variation in the proportion of false zeros. Using conspecific playbacks and time of reaction of black-backed woodpeckers in burned and unburned forests, the present study determined whether detection probabilities were similar. The period of time required to detect this species was shorter in recently burned sites than in mature forest stands (F2,235 = 22.1, df = 2, P &lt; 0.0001). To accurately compare these habitats it is important to assure the same proportion of presence and false zeros in each habitat during the census. To achieve this, we propose a time corrected method. Because inter-habitat differences in detectability exist for black-backed woodpeckers, and probably many other organisms, caution is needed when interpreting presence-absence data in the context of habitat comparisons or when monitoring biodiversity in different habitats. © Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2006.

AB  - Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) may depend on recently burned forest patches to maintain viable population levels. We wanted to determine how these habitats are colonized by this species and by which age classes. Data collected at the Observatoire d'oiseaux de Tadoussac (situated on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River (Québec, Canada)) suggest that an important movement of juveniles occurs during the autumn. It was therefore hypothesized that in the year following fire, burned forest sites would be colonized by a higher percentage of juvenile birds than intact mature stands. In accordance to this hypothesis, there was a difference in woodpecker age structure between the two habitat types (χ2 = 9.43, df = 2, P = 0.0088, n = 186). However, differences are mainly explained by the higher number of third calendar year birds at burned forest sites, suggesting that a part of the colonization occurs in the same year as the fire by second year birds, rather than by juveniles during the autumn. © Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2006.

AB  - We compared how bird communities differed between burned and logged stands in black spruce (Picea mariana) forests of the boreal shield in Quebec and mixed-wood forests on the boreal plain in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Bird community composition was quite different in burns and clearcuts shortly after disturbance. In burns, cavity nesters and species that forage on beetles in dead trees predominated, whereas clearcuts were dominated by open-country species. Generally, snag-dependent species decreased and shrub-breeding species increased by 25 yr postfire. Species that forage and nest in canopy trees were more common 25 yr postlogging because of the retention of live residual trees. The bird communities tended to converge over time as the vegetation in burns and logged areas became more similar. Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) and Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus) exploit recently burned coniferous forest to forage on woodboring insect larvae (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) and bark beetle larvae (Scolytidae) for a short period after fire and then decline. Black-backs were absent from mature forests and found at low density in old-growth forest. Over the long term, burns may be temporary sources for fire specialists. The major conservation issue for fire- associated species is salvage logging, because woodpecker foraging and nesting trees are removed. Maintenance of suitable amounts of postfire forests spared from salvage logging is essential for sustainable forest management. Climate change is predicted to alter fire cycles: they will be shorter in the prairies leading to a shortage of old-growth forest and will be longer in Quebec leading to a shortage of younger forest.

AB  - The effect of food supply on the Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus breeding density and productivity was investigated by comparing the pattern of annual changes in prey abundance in habitats with declining vs. stable woodpecker populations. In a bumt area of eastern Finland, where the woodpecker breeding population has been continuously diminishing, following a major increase the first year after fire, only the abundance of spruce bark beetles (Col., Scolytidae) (the woodpecker autumnspring main insect prey) decreased through the years. Conversely, the abundance of longhorn beetles (Col., Cerambycidae) (the nestling main food supply) increased dramatically. On the other hand, in neighbouring old-growth patches where one pair was breeding annually, abundance of spruce bark and longhorn beetles did not change significantly between years, although the abundance level ofthe bark beetles differed among patches. Hence, my results suggest the woodpecker breeding population to be limited by food supply available outside the breeding season, as shown for other forest bird species. The finding, however, that woodpeckers breeding 6-7 years after the fire reared larger broods than earlier pairs, while brood size did not change annually under old-growth conditions, suggests longhorn beetle availability to be critical to reproductive success.

AB  - We studied snag use for foraging by Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) one year after a fire in an eastern black spruce (Picea mariana) boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. We searched for signs of foraging (bark flaking and excavation holes) by Black-backed Woodpeckers on 6,536 snags sampled in 56 plots located in portions of the burned forest that had not been salvage logged. A logistic regression model was developed based on the presence or absence of foraging signs. Results showed that Black-backed Woodpeckers used larger snags that were less deteriorated by fire (qualified as high-quality snags). Direct field observations of individuals foraging on 119 snags also indicated that used snags corresponded to those of high predicted quality. Finally, we assessed the relationship between food availability and snag characteristics by measuring the density of wood-boring beetle larvae holes on 30 snags of different size and deterioration classes. High-quality snags contained higher prey densities (wood-boring beetle holes) than smaller and more deteriorated snags. We recommend that forest blocks characterized by large and less deteriorated trees be preserved from salvage logging in recently burned boreal forests in northeastern North America.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and three-toed woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus) might decrease in abundance because of habitat loss from fire suppression and short-rotation logging in landscapes managed for forestry. We examined black-backed and three-toed woodpecker occupancy of stands in a 2-year post-fire forest, mature and old-growth spruce and pine forests, and six post-fire coniferous forests of different ages. Three-toeds were detected in old stands and in the 2-year-old burn, and their probability of occupancy of burned forests decreased between 3 and 8 years post-fire. Within 50 km of the 2-year-old burn, black-backs were only detected in the burn and not in old-growth or mature conifer stands. However, they did occupy old coniferous stands located 75 and 150 km from the recent burn. They had a similar probability of occupying stands in the 3-, 4-, and 8-year-old burns but were not detected in the 16-year-old burn. The persistence of three-toed woodpeckers in boreal Alberta will likely depend on the presence of both old-growth and recently burned coniferous forests or forests with old-growth structural characteristics. Black-backed woodpeckers appear to be more burn dependent than three-toeds, and their long-term persistence may depend on the frequency of recently burned forests within their dispersal range.

AB  - A stand-replacement prescribed fire in an over-mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.)-subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) stand (snag area) and in a mature lodgepole pine thicket (thicket area) resulted in lower plant diversity within the first year after burning, and as fire energy outputs increased, postburn plant cover and diversity decreased. There was no reestablishment of the original plant cover where total heat output exceeded 100 000 kcal/m2. Apparently, most plants in this habitat were not fire resistant. Postfire recovery appears to depend on immigration of seeds from adjacent unburned areas or on seeds and rhizomes that survive on unburned microsites (refugia) within the burn. After fire, temperatures increased in the forest floor fermentative layer (FL) (10 to 19 °C) and upper 10 cm of the soil layer (SL) (3 to 7 °C) on several dates in summer 1976. Increased pH levels in FL (about 2 units) and SL (about 0.5 unit) after burning provided an improved environment for bacterial development, and counts of total bacteria and proteolytic bacteria both increased. Both nitrogen fixation and nitrification were increased after burning. Despite the apparent increase in microbiological activity, microbial respiration declined after burning-apparently because of reduced forest floor organic carbon energy reservoir. Diversity of birds increased the year after burning. New species of birds included hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), common flicker (Colaptes auratus), and mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides). Numbers of needle-foraging species, such as Townsend's warbler (Dendroica townsendi), hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus), golden-crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa), and western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana), declined or were absent after fire. Responses of small mammals to fire were not definitive, but there was a marked decline in Townsend's chipmunk (Tamias townsendii) after burning. In the first year after burning, forage for elk (Cervus elaphus) in the burned area was higher in crude protein than in unburned areas, but low productivity and distance from water diminished the value of the burned area for elk.

AB  - The diet composition of the Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) before the onset of egg laying was investigated in eastern Finland. This was carried out in 1997 and 1998 by collecting bark samples from woodpecker territories in six old-growth and two burnt forest patches during the two month period preceding the start of reproductive activities. Bark samples (10 x 15 cm) were removed from the immediate vicinity of a freshly exploited area, either directly after a foraging bird left the tree or from trees recently exploited. A total of 55 bark samples were collected, from which 33 were found after direct foraging observation. Recently dead spruce comprised 89% of foraging substrates. Including adult, larva and pupa development stages, 3236 potential insect prey were collected and identified. Among them, Scolytids, or bark beetles, represented 96.9% of the insect prey. This proportion did not differ between territories, sexes and years. Some 78.5% of adult bark beetles found were classified as mature spruce forest interior specialists.

AB  - Comparisons of the effects of logging and fire as disturbance agents on the composition of bird assemblages in boreal ecosystems are stall lacking or are limited to the short-term impacts of clear-cutting. In Quebec, where the boreal forest is largely dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B S.P) stands, we surveyed 140 point-count stations in 3 postlogging and 4 postfire development stages determined according to the height of the regenerating spruce trees. Species richness did not vary among forest development stages, but bird abundance was higher in recent clearcuts. Recently disturbed areas were characterized by open-land bird assemblages dominated by Neotropical migrants, which reached their highest abundance in clearcuts. Moreover, logged stands were distinguished from burned sites by the absence of cavity-nesting birds Forest-bird assemblages reestablished themselves as soon as young spruces reached the sapling stage. However, the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), and Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) were restricted to mature stands or recent burns and are thus likely to be negatively affected by modern forestry, which revolves fire suppression and short logging rotations. We suggest that retention of larger areas of continuous mature forest might be essential to maintain these species in managed regions.

AB  - A current paradigm in conservation biology is that forest harvest practices that better approximate natural disturbance processes are more likely to conserve biodiversity. We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having ≥95% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with 1-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfire than on postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), Black-and-White Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Red-start (Setophaga ruticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of standing dead trees on the landscape.

AB  - Throughout its geographic range, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is rare and appears very similar in its foraging ecology to 2 broadly sympatric congeners, the three-toed (P. tridactylus) and hairy woodpecker (P. villosus). The purposes of our study were to test for differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek fire near Fairbanks. Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2 years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ha. Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts, woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986. Our results suggest the black-backed woodpecker is extremely specialized in its foraging niche, exploiting outbreaks of wood-boring beetles in dying conifers for only 2-3 years after fires. Consequently, this species may be particularly vulnerable to local and regional extinction as fire suppression intensifies and programs of intensive salvage logging are pursued following fires.

AB  - An active Black-backed Woodpecker nest was found in a forested area that had been severely burned the same summer. By backdating, nest excavation was estimated to have started within a few days after the passage of the fire. This observation indicates that the Black-backed Woodpecker is not only closely associated with recently-burned forests, but that it can nest successfully immediately after the occurrence of a forest fire.

AB  - Abstract: During the two breeding seasons immediately following the numerous and widespread fires of 1988, I estimated bird community composition in each of 34 burned‐forest sites in western Montana and northern Wyoming. I detected an average of 45 species per site and a total of 87 species in the sites combined. A comppilation of these data with bird‐count data from more than 200 additional studies conducted across 15 major vegetation cover types in the northern Rocky Mountain region showed that 15 bird species are generally more abundant in early post‐fire communities than in any other major cover type occurring in the northern Rockies. One bird species (Black‐backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing dead forests created by stand‐replacement fires. Bird communities in recently burned forests are different in composition from those that characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including early‐successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding guilds are especially abundant therein: woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters. Standing, fire‐killed trees provided nest sites for nearly two‐thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites. Broken‐top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for cavity‐nesting species significantly more often than expected on the basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the broken‐top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest conditions prior to a fire (especially the presence of snags) may be important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity‐nesting birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or relatively restricted to burned forests, stand‐replacement fires may be necessary for long‐term maintenance of their populations. Unfortunately, the current fire policy of public land‐management agencies does not encourage maintenance of stand‐replacement fire regimes, which may be necessary for the creation of conditions needed by the most fire‐dependent bird species. In addition, salvage cutting may reduce the suitability of burned‐forest habitat for birds by removing the most important element—standing, fire‐killed trees–needed for feeding, nesting, or both by the majority of bird species that used burned forests.
