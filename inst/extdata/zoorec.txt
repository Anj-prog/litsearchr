AB Recently burned coniferous forests host wildlife communities that
   respond to variation in burn severity, post-fire habitat structure, and
   patch configuration. Habitat selection theory predicts that birds
   inhabiting these variable post-fire landscapes will select nesting
   locations that confer an adaptive advantage through increased fitness
   and reproductive success. Understanding the effect of post-fire habitat
   on avian nesting ecology can provide valuable information to guide
   restoration and management after wildfire. The Black-backed Woodpecker
   (Picoides arcticus) is strongly associated with recently burned forests
   in the western United States, where it is used as an indicator species
   for the effects of post-fire forest management. Between 2011 and 2018,
   we located and monitored 118 Black-backed Woodpecker nests in burned
   forests of northern California. We evaluated the influence of habitat
   and nest characteristics on nest site selection and daily nest survival.
   Our results demonstrate a pattern of neutral congruence between habitat
   selection and fitness. Black-backed Woodpeckers showed strong selection
   for each of the nest habitat variables that we measured: woodpeckers
   selected moderately sized trees in areas of high snag density burned at
   high severity, but also in areas relatively close to low-severity or
   unburned edges. However, only nest initiation date affected nest
   survival, with decreased survival in late-season nests. Our results
   suggest that management actions aimed at maintaining breeding habitat
   for Black-backed Woodpeckers should prioritize retention and creation of
   pyrodiverse landscapes that include dense stands of snags (> 5 snags per
   100 m2) within [approximately]500 m of forest that burned at low
   severity or remained unburned.

AB Habitat suitability models can inform forest management for species of
   conservation concern. Models quantify relationships between known
   species locations and environmental attributes, which are used to
   identify areas most likely to support species of concern. Managers can
   then limit negative human impacts in areas of high suitability or
   conduct habitat improvements in areas of marginal suitability. Model
   applications are computationally intensive, requiring time and resources
   not available to most managers. We developed FIRE-BIRD, an ArcGIS
   toolbox, to streamline preliminary data processing and application of
   habitat suitability models to forest management planning for
   disturbance-associated woodpeckers of conservation concern. Tools are
   currently developed for black-backed (Picoides arcficus) and
   white-headed woodpecker (Dryobates albolvartus) in Inland Northwest
   burned forests; black-backed, white-headed, and hairy woodpecker (D.
   villosus) in Northern Sierra burned forests; and white-headed woodpecker
   in Inland Northwest unburned forests. This manual provides tool
   operating instructions and guidelines to interpret resulting habitat
   suitability maps. The suite of species currently included makes this
   toolset best suited for postfire management and restoration treatments
   in dry mixed-conifer forests. Incorporating additional species and
   forest conditions in the future will broaden the scope of this toolset.

AB Forest harvesting reduces mean stand age and dead wood amount. Among
   species dependent upon older forests and dead wood, primary excavators
   such as woodpeckers play an important ecological role by providing
   cavities for many other species. Conservation of these species thus
   requires striking a balance between timber harvesting and dead wood
   supply, especially under moderate natural disturbance regimes. In this
   study, we quantified habitat use in two closely-related, sympatric
   species: Black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and American Three-toed (P.
   dorsalis) Woodpecker, in the highlands of northern New Brunswick,
   Canada. Natural fires are rare in this ecoregion and forest harvesting
   is the main agent of landscape change, along with infrequent outbreaks
   of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). Based on its habitat use
   patterns in other ecoregions, we hypothesized that Black-backed
   Woodpecker would select nest sites in mature coniferous forest stands
   and we expected that it would achieve a higher nest survival rate in
   forest stands than within, or at the edge of, cutblocks. Owing to sample
   size limitations for American Three-toed Woodpecker, statistical
   analyses were restricted to its occurrence patterns. Both species
   co-occurred, and there was no difference in detectability following
   conspecific and heterospecific playbacks. Contrary to our prediction,
   Black-backed Woodpecker selected nest sites with higher proportions of
   recently cut areas within 50 m than at randomly selected sites.
   Black-backed Woodpecker selected cutblocks for nesting when suitable
   snags were available and mature forest stands were present nearby as
   foraging habitat. For the species to persist in this landscape, the
   supply of snags must be continuous and forest stands must be
   sufficiently mature to host saproxylic insects.

AB Salvage logging after disturbances in forests substantially modifies
   vegetation structure and dead wood availability, but empirical evidence
   on its impact on biodiversity, especially in European boreal forest, is
   sparse. In this study we investigated the short-term effect of post-fire
   salvage logging on species richness and abundance of birds in recently
   burned mixed coniferous forest. Using point counts we estimated local
   species composition at 49 salvaged sites and 55 non-intervention sites
   (burnt forest left for natural regeneration) that were not logged after
   a fire in south-central Sweden. Local species richness, abundance and
   Simpson's species diversity index were significantly higher at
   non-intervention sites compared to salvaged sites. Forest birds that
   rely on structurally complex forest stands, such as tits (Parus major,
   Lophophanes cristatus, Poecile montanus), robin (Erithacus rubecula),
   mistle trush (Turdus viscivorus) and tree-toed woodpecker (Picoides
   tridactylus) were mainly associated with non-intervention sites, while
   species that are typically linked to farm- or shrublands, such as
   whinchat (Saxicola rubetra), white wagtail (Motacilla alba), red-backed
   shrike (Lanius collurio), and meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) were more
   common at salvaged sites. These results are consistent with the idea
   that post-fire salvage logging has an immediate impact on the bird
   species composition and abundance in boreal forest. We conclude that
   although post-fire salvage logging may be beneficial for birds occurring
   in open landscapes, it has negative effects for forest bird species
   richness and abundance, at least over the short term. To protect typical
   forest communities with many forest specialists of high conservation
   concern, we recommend reducing the extent of post-disturbance salvaging
   in forests of high conservation value and updating the existing
   management policy to restore the amount of woody debris and facilitate
   long-term structural complexity and biodiversity in densely stocked
   conifer stands. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Variation in fire characteristics, termed pyrodiversity, plays an
   important role in structuring post-fire communities, but little is known
   about the importance of pyrodiversity for individual species. The
   availability of diverse post-fire habitats may be key for
   fire-associated species if they require different resources at different
   life-history stages. We tested for age-specific habitat relationships in
   the black-backed woodpecker, a post-fire specialist. We used
   radio-telemetry to track fledgling and adult woodpeckers in burned
   forests and built resource selection functions to compare the effect of
   stand-, tree- and snag-level covariates between adults and fledglings.
   Fledgling black-backed woodpeckers selected habitat with more live trees
   than adults and used more heterogeneous habitats burned at lower
   severity, illustrating strong age-dependent effects on habitat
   selection. Within selected stands, fledglings were less likely to use
   snags and more likely to use live trees when compared to adults, but
   both age classes showed strong positive selection for larger-diameter
   trees (live and dead). Over the 60days after leaving their nests,
   fledglings showed an increasing propensity to use snags rather than live
   trees. Our results provide evidence that the predation-starvation
   hypothesis, which posits a trade-off between foraging efficiency and the
   need to minimise predation risk, plays a role in structuring the
   age-dependent habitat use of a burned forest specialist. Adult
   black-backed woodpeckers selected resources associated with food
   availability, but these resources occurred in relatively open, exposed
   habitat. Fledglings selected habitat that provided increased cover,
   perhaps as a strategy to reduce predation risk.Synthesis and
   applications. Globally, fires are increasing in severity and extent,
   leading to increased focus on fire-associated species that play keystone
   roles in facilitating biodiversity resilience. Our findings suggest that
   a diversity of patches burned at different severities may benefit
   post-fire specialists like the black-backed woodpecker at multiple
   life-history stages. The increasing prevalence of large, homogeneously
   high-severity megafires' may present an emerging threat even to
   post-fire specialists, and we urge land managers to consider
   opportunities to promote pyrodiversity in the face of novel fire
   regimes. Globally, fires are increasing in severity and extent, leading

AB Extreme wildfires in coniferous forests produce large areas of dead
   trees (snags) that are expected to provide much needed habitat for the
   Black-backed Woodpecker, a postfire associate. In an attempt to better
   understand extreme fire effects (including increasing fire size and
   decreasing diversity of fire effects), we monitored Black-backed
   Woodpeckers during the 2014 and 2015 breeding seasons following two
   wildfires (the 2013 Rim and 2014 King fire) that burned in the Sierra
   Nevada, USA under extreme fire conditions. Despite an extensive sampling
   effort including 1025 broadcast surveys and targeted nest searching over
   2040 ha of habitat typically used for nesting, we detected few
   Black-backed Woodpeckers. Positive detections of Black-backed
   Woodpeckers at broadcast points were positively associated with
   increases in the percent of surrounding forest that burned at
   high-severity and with the distance to the fire perimeter, indicating
   that the severity and scale of the fire per se did not affect use by
   Black-backed woodpeckers within the fire area. However, we suggest that
   the timing of these fires late in the fire season may have limited
   colonization of prey resources, leading to more limited use of these
   fires by Black-backed Woodpeckers.

AB Fire creates challenges and opportunities for wildlife through rapid
   destruction, modification and creation of habitat. Fire has spatially
   variable effects on landscapes; however, for species that benefit from
   the ephemeral resource patches created by fire, it is critical to
   understand characteristics of fires that promote postfire colonization
   and persistence and the spatial scales on which they operate. Using a
   model postfire specialist, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus), we examined how colonization and persistence varied across
   two spatial scales as a function of four characteristics of fire
   regimesfire severity, fire size, fire ignition date and number of years
   since fire. We modelled black-backed woodpecker colonization and
   persistence using data from 108 recently burned forests in the Sierra
   Nevada and southern Cascades ecoregions of California, USA, that we
   monitored for up to 10years following fire. We employed a novel,
   spatially hierarchical, dynamic occupancy framework which differentiates
   colonization and persistence at two spatial scales: across fires and
   within fires. We found strong effects of fire characteristics on dynamic
   rates, with colonization and persistence declining across both spatial
   scales with increasing years since fire. Additionally, at sites within
   fires, colonization decreased with fire size and increased with fire
   severity and for fires with later ignition dates. Our results support
   the notion that different aspects of a species' environment are
   important for population processes at different spatial scales. As
   habitat quality is ephemeral for any given postfire area, our results
   illustrate the importance of time since fire in structuring occupancy at
   the fire level, with other characteristics of fires playing larger roles
   in determining abundance within individual fires. Our results contribute
   to the broader understanding of how variation in fire characteristics
   influences the colonization and persistence of species using ephemeral
   habitats, which is necessary for conserving and promoting postfire
   biodiversity in the context of rapidly shifting fire regimes.

AB The Black Hills population of black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides
   arcticus) was petitioned, but deemed not warranted, to be listed as a
   threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act and
   more information on their population size in the region is needed. Our
   objective was to map abundance and provide a population estimate of
   black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains of
   South Dakota and Wyoming, USA. We conducted 3,666 and 3,384 5-minute
   point count surveys from late-March to late-June in 2015 and 2016,
   respectively. We characterized vegetation around each point using
   geographic information system-derived landscape variables and fit
   3-level hierarchical time-removal models in R package unmarked using
   gmultmix. The global abundance model received the most support and
   included year, latitude, and percent area of green trees, beetle-killed
   trees, dead trees, 1- to 2-year-old wildfire, 3-year-old wildfire, and
   4- to 5-year-old wildfire. Points with high percent cover of
   beetle-killed trees had the greatest density of black-backed
   woodpeckers, followed by 1- to 2-year-old wildfires. After 4 years,
   areas burned by wildfire supported lower densities of black-backed
   woodpeckers than undisturbed forests. Mean density was 0.528birds/km2 in
   2015 and 0.626birds/km2 in 2016. There were an estimated 2,920 and 3,439
   black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains in
   2015 and 2016, respectively. We suggest areas with high percent cover of
   beetle-killed trees may support high densities of black-backed
   woodpeckers and are important to sustaining populations when the
   availability of recent (<4 years old) wildfire is declining or scarce.

   within 10 years of fire. Previous research has indicated that salvage
   logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a
   negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One
   strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on
   Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense
   snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely
   untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag
   islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve
   habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species.
   In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were
   effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following
   logging operations that covered 45% of the burned area. We
   systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed
   Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and
   compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to
   other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined
   significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed
   Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral
   unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat
   for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this
   study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the
   first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year,
   which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed
   Woodpeckers postlogging.

AB Many studies project future bird ranges by relying on correlative
   species distribution models. Such models do not usually represent
   important processes explicitly related to climate change and harvesting,
   which limits their potential for predicting and understanding the future
   of boreal bird assemblages at the landscape scale. In this study, we
   attempted to assess the cumulative and specific impacts of both
   harvesting and climate-induced changes on wildfires and standlevel
   processes (e.g., reproduction, growth) in the boreal forest of eastern
   Canada. The projected changes in these landscape-and stand-scale
   processes (referred to as "drivers of change") were then assessed for
   their impacts on future habitats and potential productivity of
   black-backed woodpecker (BBWO; Picoides arcticus), a focal species
   representative of deadwood and old-growth biodiversity in eastern
   Canada. Forest attributes were simulated using a forest landscape model,
   LANDIS-II, and were used to infer future landscape suitability to BBWO
   under three anthropogenic climate forcing scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5
   and RCP 8.5), compared to the historical baseline. We found climate
   change is likely to be detrimental for BBWO, with up to 92% decline in
   potential productivity under the worst-case climate forcing scenario
   (RCP 8.5). However, large declines were also projected under baseline
   climate, underlining the importance of harvest in determining future
   BBWO productivity. Present-day harvesting practices were the single most
   important cause of declining areas of old-growth coniferous forest, and
   hence appeared as the single most important driver of future BBWO
   productivity, regardless of the climate scenario. Climate-induced
   increases in fire activity would further promote young, deciduous stands
   at the expense of old-growth coniferous stands. This suggests that the
   biodiversity associated with deadwood and old-growth boreal forests may
   be greatly altered by the cumulative impacts of natural and
   anthropogenic disturbances under a changing climate. Management
   adaptations, including reduced harvesting levels and strategies to
   promote coniferous species content, may help mitigate these cumulative
   impacts.

AB Three-toed Woodpeckers Picoides tridactylus are known to use phloem sap
   of conifer trees as a food resource mostly in springtime. A local pair
   instantly began to forage sap of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris trees that
   were damaged in a prescribed forest burning; before the fire they had
   used phloem sap elsewhere in their territory. During three weeks after
   the fire, the pair intensively used sap of Scots pines which were
   exposed to fire. The woodpeckers were probably attracted by nutrients
   induced by damage reaction of the burned pines. Rapid sap use of newly
   burned trees has not been described before, and it indicates behavioural
   plasticity how this woodpecker species can use resources in disturbance
   driven, dynamic forest environments.

AB Following wildfire, forest managers are challenged with meeting both
   socioeconomic demands (e.g., salvage logging) and mandates requiring
   habitat conservation for disturbance-associated wildlife (e.g.,
   woodpeckers). Habitat suitability models for nesting woodpeckers can be
   informative, but tests of model transferability are needed to understand
   how broadly models developed at one location can be applied to inform
   post-fire forest management at other locations. We developed habitat
   suitability models and tested their transferability for 2
   disturbance-associated woodpecker species, Black-backed (Picoides
   arcticus) and Lewis's (Melanerpes lewis) woodpecker. Habitat suitability
   models consisted of weighted logistic regression models comparing
   environmental conditions at nest versus non-nest sites. We developed
   models at each of 3 wildfire locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho,
   and then examined predictive performance for each model at alternate
   ("application") locations. Models generally discriminated nest from
   non-nest sites well at locations where they were developed but
   performance was variable at application locations, indicating limited
   transferability. Models for Black-backed Woodpecker and those that
   included field-collected environmental covariates exhibited greater
   transferability than models for Lewis's Woodpecker and those that only
   included remotely sensed covariates. Transferability was also generally
   poor between Oregon and the other 2 locations. Limitations to model
   transferability observed in this study suggest models developed at any
   one wildfire location are unlikely to be generally applicable across the
   entire range of Black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers. Generally
   applicable models to inform post-fire forest management will therefore
   likely require integration of data from multiple wildfire locations.

AB Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus, (BBWO)) and American
   three-toed woodpeckers (P. dorsalis, (ATTW)) are uncommon inhabitants of
   conifer forests and are sympatric in some areas, including the Black
   Hills. Both species exhibit genetic characteristics associated with
   isolated populations, are species of special management concern, and for
   which data are lacking concerning populations and habitats. We developed
   resource selection models of forest vegetation within 500 m radius plots
   (78.5 ha) for BBWOs and ATTWs to provide forest managers with
   stand-level information to estimate how forest management might affect
   habitat for these species in the Black Hills. Relative probability of
   selection by BBWOs increased with greater area of ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) stands 41-70% overstory canopy cover up to approximately 20%
   (16 ha) of the surrounding area then declined when these stands
   comprised greater than 20% of the area. Relative probability of
   selection by ATTWs increased with greater area of white spruce (Picea
   glauca) up to a maximum of approximately 66% (50 ha) of the surrounding
   area and subsequently declined when white spruce comprised greater than
   66% of the surrounding area. Increased area of aspen (Populus
   temuloides) stands increased the relative probability of selection by
   ATTWs. During a period when the Black Hills lacked extensive disturbance
   from fire or insect infestation, BBWPs selected areas that were managed
   for moderate overstory canopy of ponderosa pine and ATTWs selected
   stands with large diameter spruce and aspen at the higher elevations
   that were not extensively harvested.

AB 1. It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are
   likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are
   supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy
   and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes. 2. Here
   we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale
   occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can
   conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or
   territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories
   based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species
   rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model
   is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using
   resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory.
   3. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests.
   Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density
   given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory
   size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and
   home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers
   at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with
   independently collected survey data, showing that the model is
   successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as
   relative abundance within and among fires. 4. The conceptual model
   presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modelling of density
   and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and
   occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely
   utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors
   that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful
   biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model
   provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining
   burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as
   salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal.

AB Nest care is an important parental contribution to offspring. In
   woodpeckers, males often have an equal or greater contribution to
   parental care, including nest sanitation. The Black-backed Woodpecker
   (Picoides arcticus) is a North American boreal woodpecker for which both
   parents are highly involved in parental care. By modifying their
   territory size in optimal and suboptimal habitat (e.g. burned vs
   unburned habitats), this species seems to have a large tolerance to
   variation in prey abundance at a landscape scale, and could provide a
   useful biological model to investigate the adaptability of parent care,
   particularly to relative contribution of each sex. We investigated sex-
   and habitat-specific parental care behaviour of Black-backed Woodpeckers
   at 9 nests by daily monitoring during the nestling period. Specifically,
   we examined two different aspects of parental care: 1) time spent at the
   nest, and 2) food delivery. We also compared relative contribution
   between sexes to nest sanitation. Despite our small sample sizes, our
   results show that males are more involved in nest sanitation and spend
   longer at the nest, and both sexes exhibit higher food delivery rates
   and spend less time at the nest in burned habitat. This latter result
   may suggest that greater effort is needed to provision Black-backed
   Wood-pecker nestlings in unburned habitat compared to burned habitat.

AB Population age structure is important for understanding population
   dynamics, but can be difficult to resolve in landbirds due to the
   limited number of age classes discernible by examining plumage. In
   forests of western North America, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides
   articus) typically colonize burned areas shortly after fire, but
   densities decline within 6-10 yr. This pattern is often assumed to
   result from adult Black-backed Woodpeckers abandoning territories when
   food resources wane, yet long-distance breeding dispersal is relatively
   rare in birds, whereas longdistance natal dispersal is more common. To
   determine whether colonization of newly burned areas is driven primarily
   by breeding dispersal of adults or natal dispersal by young birds, we
   captured 57 adult Black-backed Woodpeckers in 6 burned areas in
   California between 1 and 8 yr after fire. We used patterns of multiple
   feather generations retained among primary coverts, secondaries, and
   secondary coverts to assign birds to 1 of 5 age classes (second-,
   third-, and fourth-calendar-year; after-third-calendar-year; and
   after-fourth-calendar-year). Population age structure varied
   dramatically across burned areas, with a preponderance of
   second-calendar-year birds in the 1 yr and 2 yr postfire areas, and a
   preponderance of birds at least 3 yr old in the older postfire areas.
   Poisson generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) revealed that the effect
   of years since fire on woodpecker age was highly significant (z = 3.575,
   P < 0.001). Our results indicate that natal dispersal is the primary
   means by which Black-backed Woodpeckers colonize recently burned areas
   in western forests, and that breeding dispersal is uncommon. The decline
   of Black-backed Woodpecker populations 6-10 yr after fire likely
   reflects the lifespan of individual birds that colonized the burned
   area, or of offspring that they produced in the early postfire years.
   Our discrimination of Black-backed Woodpeckers into 5 age classes
   confirms previous suppositions about plumage-based age determination in
   woodpeckers, and is likely applicable to other woodpecker species.

AB Dead and decaying trees may be a limited resource for woodpeckers in
   managed forests, especially for species that rely on dead wood for
   nesting and foraging. Whereas recent nest web studies greatly increased
   our understanding of nest tree use by woodpeckers, knowledge on
   woodpeckers foraging requirements is much less developed. We quantified

   bark-foraging woodpeckers downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), hairy
   woodpecker (Picoides villosus), American three-toed woodpecker (Picoides
   dorsalis), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), yellow-bellied
   sapsucker (Sphyropicus varius) and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus
   pileatus) that co-occur in eastern boreal forests of North America. A
   total of 271 observation bouts and more than 600 foraging trees were
   recorded at three study sites characterized as mixedwood, conifer, and
   burn. Our results show that dead wood represents an important foraging
   substrate for most bark-foraging woodpeckers in Canadian eastern boreal
   forests. However, significant differences in individual species were
   found with regard to substrate use patterns, foraging behavior and
   associated prey. Woodpeckers were categorized according to their
   selection for specific stages of tree degradation, with the
   yellow-bellied sapsucker and the pileated woodpecker representing
   opposite ends of this gradient. The black-backed woodpecker showed the
   highest use of dead wood and was very specific in its tree selection by
   using mostly recently dead trees. We emphasize that providing foraging
   substrates for most woodpecker species not only requires maintaining
   dead wood but also paying heed to the underlying dynamics of dead wood
   (e.g. recruitment and degradation) in managed boreal forest landscapes.

AB Several studies have addressed the importance of woodpeckers as
   ecological engineers in forests due to their excavation of cavities.
   Although research in green, unburned forests has identified the
   influence of different excavators on secondary use by cavity-dependent
   species, little is known about the relative importance of cavities
   created by woodpeckers in recently burned forests. By excavating
   cavities, woodpeckers create habitat for secondary cavity users that can
   facilitate post-fire regeneration through seed dispersal, seed
   germination and regulation of insect populations that affect vegetative
   growth. In this study, we monitored 77 cavities created by three species
   of Picoides woodpeckers for use by secondary cavity species in a fire
   that burned in the Sierra Nevada, California. At each cavity we measured
   nest tree and site-specific parameters to determine if these
   characteristics could explain differential use by secondary cavity
   users. We found substantial overlap in cavity characteristics between
   woodpecker species, with the white-headed woodpecker differing most
   notably in their placement of cavities in larger diameter, shorter and
   more decayed trees in less dense stands than either hairy or
   black-backed woodpeckers. These differences in cavity placement may have
   resulted in the high diversity and large number of detections of
   secondary cavity species in white-headed woodpecker cavities.
   Black-backed and hairy woodpeckers were similar in the number of
   detections of secondary cavity use, although black-backed woodpecker
   cavities were used by more species than hairy woodpecker cavities.
   Secondary cavity use was high (86%) suggesting these woodpeckers, and
   the white-headed woodpecker in particular, can have an accelerating
   affect effect on ecological succession by providing valuable habitat
   features for seed dispersing birds and mammals, insectivorous birds, and
   small predators, thereby impacting ecological processes and functions.

AB Dramatic fluctuations in food resources are a key feature of many
   habitats, and many species have evolved a movement strategy to exploit
   food resources that are unpredictable in space and time. The
   availability of food resources may be a particularly strong determinant
   of habitat quality for irruptive bird species. We studied the apparent
   foraging success of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), an
   irruptive species that responds opportunistically to pulsed food
   resources in burned forests and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations.
   Prior investigations revealed that the highest population growth rates
   of Black-backed Woodpeckers occurred in habitat created by summer
   wildfire, with intermediate population growth rates in MPB infestations,
   and the lowest population growth rates in habitats created by prescribed
   fire in fall. We tested whether apparent foraging success was associated
   with known habitat quality in order to assess the potential for food
   availability to regulate population growth. We counted the number of
   successfully captured wood-boring beetle larvae and "small'' prey on
   each tree that a Black-backed Woodpecker used for foraging and modeled
   these counts as a function of habitat, tree diameter, number of years
   postfire, and tree disturbance category. Total apparent foraging success
   (the sum of observed captures of wood-boring beetle larvae and small
   prey per tree) did not vary across habitats, but woodpeckers foraging in
   habitats created by summer wildfire were expected to capture 2.2 and 2.0
   times more wood-boring beetles than woodpeckers foraging in habitats
   created by fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations, respectively.
   These results suggest that the availability of food resources may
   contribute to population regulation in this irruptive species.
   Furthermore, population growth in irruptive species may be highly
   sensitive to the availability of preferred food resources. Forests
   recently burned by summer wildfires provide relatively abundant food
   resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers and represent high-quality
   habitat for this species of conservation concern.

AB Black-backed woodpecker is known to be a disturbance-associated species,
   being more abundant in disturbed forest stands than in undisturbed
   habitats, but its demography and population dynamic still need to be
   clarified. The present study was conducted in central Quebec within
   coniferous forests shaped largely by timber harvest and wildfire. The
   objectives were to compare the age composition of breeding black-backed
   woodpeckers, nest survival rate and productivity in both disturbed and
   undisturbed habitats (respectively recently burned and unburned
   habitats). In addition, we evaluated the general productivity of both
   habitat types in a simulated boreal landscape. There was a positive
   relationship between nest age and daily survival rates. Older
   woodpeckers were the most abundant breeders in unburned habitats and
   younger birds in one-year-old burns. Although nests in recently burned
   forests produced more nestlings per successful nest, our simulation of a
   boreal forest landscape showed that unburned habitat produced about
   two-thirds more fledglings per year than burned habitat. Globally,
   unburned habitat may provide woodpeckers more temporally stable
   resources. Population dynamics of the black-backed woodpecker, at least
   in our study area, may be explained by resource pulse interactions where
   populations benefit opportunistically from short-term high-quality
   habitat, and rely on unburned habitats for long-term persistence.

AB Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are usually associated with
   forest disturbance resulting in recently killed trees. While
   black-backed woodpeckers are attracted to areas affected by these
   disturbances, in the Black Hills they exist during interim disturbance
   periods in largely undisturbed forests. In 2012, a petition for listing
   black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills as a distinct population
   segment identified current population size and the population size
   necessary to minimize risk of extinction as key components of the
   decision process. Our objective was to estimate the population size of
   black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills National Forest of South
   Dakota and Wyoming during a period of relatively low disturbance (e.g.,
   2000-2001). The estimated population was 641 (95% CI = 405-990) and 456
   (95% CI = 293-705) breeding pairs in 2000 and 2001, respectively. The
   average density of 0.12/km2 (95% CI = 0.07-0.18) was similar to
   densities in other undisturbed forests. This population estimate
   provides a starting point for population viability analyses during
   periods of relatively low disturbance by fire or insects.

AB The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a species of
   conservation concern that is strongly associated with recently burned
   forests. Black-backed Woodpeckers are known to have variable home-range
   sizes, yet the ecological factors related to this variation have not
   been adequately explored and may hold insights into the natural history
   of the species and the management of its habitat. During 2011 and 2012,
   we radio-tracked Black-backed Woodpeckers nesting in 3 forested areas of
   California that burned between 2 and 5 years before the initiation of
   tracking. Among 15 individuals with robust tracking data, we found that
   home-range size varied by an order of magnitude, from 24.1 to 304.1 ha,
   as measured by movement-based kernel estimation. Using an
   information-theoretic approach, we evaluated the functional relationship
   between snag basal area an a priori key resource and home-range size,
   additionally controlling for sex, age, and years since fire as
   covariates. We found that snag basal area alone best predicted
   home-range size, explaining 54-62% of observed variation. As snag basal
   area increased, home-range sizes exponentially decreased. This
   relationship held true both with and without the inclusion of 3
   individuals that nested in burned forest yet foraged predominantly
   outside the fire perimeter in unburned forest. Snag basal area, unlike
   other potential influences on home-range size, is an attribute that
   forest managers can directly influence. We describe a quantitative
   relationship between home-range size and snag basal area that forest
   managers can use to predict Black-backed Woodpecker pair density in
   burned forests and assess the likely population consequences of specific
   harvest treatments. Given that the birds in our study, foraging
   primarily in burned forest, all had home ranges with

AB Wildfire and mountain pine beetle infestations are naturally occurring
   disturbances in western North American forests. Black-backed woodpeckers
   (Picoides arcticus) are emblematic of the role these disturbances play
   in creating wildlife habitat, since they are strongly associated with
   recently-killed forests. However, management practices aimed at reducing
   the economic impact of natural disturbances can result in habitat loss
   for this species. Although black-backed woodpeckers occupy habitats
   created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle
   infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We
   studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and
   reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black
   Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile
   survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and
   habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival
   models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated
   demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile
   survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer
   wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat
   created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of
   population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created
   by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and
   mountain pine beetle infestations. Our finding that population growth
   rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire
   underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the
   landscape. The lower growth rates in fall prescribed fire and MPB
   infestations may be attributed to differences in predator communities
   and food resources relative to summer wildfire.

AB Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a disturbance-dependent
   species that occupy recently burned forest and mountain pine beetle
   (MPB) infestations. Forest management practices that reduce the amount
   of disturbed forest may lead to habitat loss for Black-backed
   Woodpeckers, which have recently been petitioned for listing under the
   Endangered Species Act. We studied home range size and resource
   selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers occupying habitat created by
   summer wildfire, fall prescribed fire, and MPB infestations in the Black
   Hills, South Dakota. We studied home range size and resource selection
   by attaching radio-transmitters to adult Black-backed Woodpeckers. We
   estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n = 28
   in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 19 in habitat created by fall
   prescribed fire, and n = 27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource
   selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian
   framework (n = 5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 16 in
   habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 8 in habitat created by
   MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2 year post summer
   wildfire habitat (mean home range size = 79 ha) and 2-year post fall
   prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size = 143 ha). Home range size
   was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size = 307 ha) and
   was greatest in 3-4 year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home
   range size = 430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size =
   460 ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a
   tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal
   area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest
   1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative
   value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more
   important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of
   1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200 ha by
   exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This
   recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in
   summer wildfires <200 ha and retaining at least 50% of summer wildfires
   >400 ha. Ideally, recently burned forest patches should be composed of
   >=27 m2 basal area/ha of trees that burned at moderate or high severity,
   with at least 40% of the basal area composed of trees >=27 cm DBH. (C)

AB The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is strongly associated
   with recently burned forest, which makes it vulnerable to salvage
   logging or other post-fire forest management that removes snags. As part
   of a larger radio-telemetry study of the species' resource use and
   habitat selection in a burned forest in California, we located
   radio-tagged Black-backed Woodpeckers at night to find and describe
   their roost sites. We found 14 unique roost locations during night-time
   searches for five individual birds. Description of the micro-site on the
   tree that the bird used was impossible at five roosts where we could not
   visually locate the bird in the dark. At the nine roosts confirmed
   visually, none of the birds roosted in excavated cavities. Rather, they
   roosted in sheltered spaces within burned-out hollows of trunks (5
   instances), in the crook of a forked trunk (1 instance), wedged between
   adjacent trunks of two closely spaced trees (1 instance), in a deep,
   natural bark furrow (1 instance), and clinging to a trunk directly above
   a horizontal branch (1 instance). Eleven of the 14 roosts (79%) were in
   dead trees. Our results suggest that in burned forests the Black-backed
   Woodpecker may benefit if, during salvage logging, emphasis is placed on
   retaining snags with burned-out hollows, forked trunks, or other
   relatively unusual structures that may create crevices or other
   opportunities for shelter.

AB Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a rare habitat
   specialist typically found in moderate and high severity burned forest
   throughout its range. It also inhabits green forest but little is known
   about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas,
   especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count
   and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011
   -2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green
   forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since
   1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high
   severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used
   occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found
   positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects,
   number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest,
   and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green
   forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site
   colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05
   and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals
   detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the
   landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively
   stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole
   pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these
   elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next
   century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers
   significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in
   efforts to conserve this rare species.

AB Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are well-known to occur at
   higher densities in recently burned forests than they do in nearby green
   forests. In the forests of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, there is
   relatively little information on the types of nest trees that these
   birds use in recently burned forests. From 2009 to 2011, we studied
   nest-tree preference by black-backed woodpeckers in 2 burned forests in
   the northern Sierra Nevada. For each of 31 nest trees and 389 randomly
   selected trees, we recorded decay class, diameter at breast height, top
   condition, and species. We also recorded the number of snags with >23 cm
   diameter at breast height within an 11.3-m radius of each nest tree and
   randomly selected tree. We evaluated nest-tree preference by comparing
   the characteristics of nest trees to randomly selected trees.
   Black-backed woodpeckers preferred dead but not heavily decayed trees
   and moderate (29-61 cm dbh) diameter trees. There was no evidence that
   black-backed woodpeckers had strong preferences for trees with broken
   tops or trees of particular species. Snag density around nest trees was
   higher than around randomly selected trees. Our results suggest that in
   conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada, the distribution of black-backed
   woodpeckers in post-fire environments is influenced more by surrounding
   snag densities than by particular characteristics of potential nest
   trees. [copyright] 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB We examined foraging-habitat selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers
   (Picoides arcticus) in burned forests of southwestern Idaho during 2000
   and 2002 (6 and 8 years following wildfire). This woodpecker responds
   positively to large-scale fire disturbances and may be at risk from
   logging and post-fire management. With 100 radio-locations of four adult
   males, we used resource-selection probability functions in logistic form
   in an information-theoretic framework to model the Black-backed
   Woodpecker's selection of foraging habitat at fine and coarse spatial
   scales. Fine-scale data included characteristics of the foraging tree
   (tree level) and local habitat surrounding foraging trees (plot level,
   0.04 ha), whereas coarse-scale data (224-778 ha) included patch
   characteristics within home ranges. Model selection by Akaike's
   information criterion identified a multi-scale model containing tree-
   and plot-level covariates, and their interaction, as the best model to
   characterize foraging trees. The positive effect of interaction between
   foraging-tree diameter and plot-level tree density suggested that
   foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers select both patches with dense trees
   and larger-diameter trees. Fire severity was not important, possibly
   because of the time since fire and the birds' habit of foraging on
   recently dead trees in adjacent unburned forests. Salvage logging that
   retains large-diameter trees in clumped distributions is most likely to
   provide long-term foraging habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers in dry
   coniferous forests of the interior western U.S. Following wildfire,
   conservation of forest patches containing weakened trees may extend the
   suitability of habitat for foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers by up to 8
   years.

AB A stand-replacing fire in 404 ha of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and
   mixed pine forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in 2007 resulted in
   Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) nesting at high density in
   2008, the second possible nesting season post-fire. Nests were found
   within a 93-ha study area and a 19-ha stand (a subset of the 93-ha study
   area) in 199.5 survey hours concentrated in March July. The 19-ha stand
   had six nests, a density of 0.31 nests/ha or 0.63 individuals/ha, while
   the 93-ha study area had 20 nests yielding 0.21 nests/ha or 0.42
   individuals/ha. These nest densities are higher than previously reported
   in the literature for comparable stands, indicating a large influx of
   nesting woodpeckers post-fire. High nesting densities in this study may
   have resulted from: (1) optimal timing of the fire for wood-boring
   beetle exploitation of burned trees, (2) the discrete nature of burned
   habitat in the study due to impacts of salvage logging, or (3) our focus
   on regions of the burn where high nesting densities occurred, as the
   entire burned area (404 ha) was not included in nest density
   calculations. Received 23 April 2010. Accepted 28 December 2010.

AB Burned forests represent high-quality habitats for many
   deadwood-dependent species. Yet, post-fire conditions may vary greatly
   within and among burns and thereby may affect habitat suitability for
   these species. We studied habitat selection of nesting black-backed
   woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus Swainson) in recently burned
   spruce-dominated boreal forests. Our objectives were to (i) identify
   factors involved in snag selection for both nesting and foraging and
   (ii) examine selection of nest sites within the burned landscape. A
   total of 92 nests and 1612 foraging observations were used to
   investigate snag selection. Our results show that both pre-fire forest
   conditions and fire severity are important in determining the quality of
   burned forests for black-backed woodpeckers. This species selected large
   snags for both nesting (>20 cm DBH) and foraging (>15 cm DBH).
   Woodpeckers selected deciduous and degraded "pre-fire" snags for nesting
   whereas black spruce snags that had been created by fire and that were
   moderately burned were preferred for foraging. Nest sites were
   concentrated in burned mature stands and supported higher densities of
   large snags (e. g., >15 cm DBH). Our results suggest that burned forest
   patches of at least 20 ha and composed mainly of burned mature and
   old-growth forests should be maintained during post-fire harvesting. The
   decrease in the amount of late seral stands in managed forest landscapes
   raises concerns about the future availability of high-quality burned
   forests for this species.

AB Salvage logging practices in recently burned forests often have direct
   effects on species associated with dead trees, particularly
   cavity-nesting birds. As such, evaluation of postfire management
   practices on nest survival rates of cavity nesters is necessary for
   determining conservation strategies. We monitored 1,797 nests of 6
   cavity-nesting bird species: Lewis's woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis),
   hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), black-backed woodpecker (P.
   arcticus), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), western bluebird (Sialia
   mexicana), and mountain bluebird (S. currucoides) from 1994 to 2004 in
   ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), mixed-severity burned forests
   (partially logged and unlogged) of Idaho, USA. Based on a priori
   hypotheses, we modeled daily survival rate (DSR) of nests as a function
   of abiotic (temperature, precipitation), temporal (time since fire,
   calendar year) and biotic factors (distance to unburned forest, nest
   height, and tree harvest (partial-salvage logging vs. unlogged)).
   Multiple abiotic and biotic factors, other than direct effects of
   salvage logging, affected daily survival rates of breeding
   cavity-nesting birds. Hairy woodpecker was the only species in which
   partial-salvage logging had a measurable, negative impact on DSR.
   Managers implementing carefully planned salvage logging prescriptions
   that include both unlogged reserves and partially logged areas can
   expect to maintain habitat for successfully breeding cavity-nesting
   birds of the interior northwestern United States. Our results also
   suggest that nest survival for some species of cavity-nesting birds
   could be improved if unlogged reserves are located centrally in postfire
   forests, distant from unburned habitats that potentially serve as
   sources of nest predators. [copyright] 2011 The Wildlife Society.

AB The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) has been designated by
   the USDA Forest Service as a management indicator species for snags in
   burned conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. However,
   little is known about the characteristics that affect between-fire and
   within-fire habitat selection by the species in the region. Here we
   report on the first broad-scale survey of Black-backed Woodpeckers on
   wildfire-affected forests of the Sierra Nevada. We implemented a
   Bayesian hierarchical model to: 1) estimate Black-backed Woodpecker
   occupancy probability in fire areas burned within a time window of 1-10
   years; 2) identify relationships between occupancy probability and
   habitat covariates (fire age, change in canopy cover pre-to-post fire,
   and snag basal area), elevation, and latitude; and 3) estimate detection
   probability and relate it to survey interval length and survey type
   (passive v. broadcast). We included random fire-area effects in our
   model of occupancy probability to accommodate clusters of
   non-independent points surveyed within the larger set of fire areas.
   Mean occupancy probability was estimated to be 0.097. Elevation (after
   controlling for latitude) had the strongest effect on occupancy
   probability (higher occupancy at higher elevation) followed by latitude
   (higher occupancy at northerly sites). Fire age was also important;
   occupancy probability was about 4X higher on the youngest compared to
   oldest fires. Although the direction of regression coefficients were in
   the expected direction (positive), snag basal area and canopy cover
   change were of minor importance in affecting occupancy probability.
   There was some indication, however, that the importance of snag basal
   area increased with fire age. Weak links between occupancy and canopy
   cover change suggested the species uses a range of burn severities, and
   such heterogeneity may promote habitat longevity. Our estimate of
   overall detection probability (across all survey intervals) was 0.772.
   We found strong effects of survey interval length (higher for longer
   interval) and, especially survey type (higher for broadcast survey) on
   detection probability. Our modeling framework and implementation
   illustrates the flexibility of the Bayesian hierarchical approach for
   handling complexities such as estimating derived parameters (and
   variances) and modeling random effects, and should prove generally
   useful for occupancy studies.

AB We used population- and individual-based genetic approaches to assess
   barriers to movement in black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), a
   fire-specialist that mainly occupies the boreal forest in North America.
   We tested if male and female woodpeckers exhibited the same movement
   patterns using both spatially implicit and explicit genetic analyses to
   define population structure and movement patterns of both sexes among
   populations. Three genetic groups were identified, a large, genetically
   continuous population that spans from the Rocky Mountains to Quebec, a
   small isolated population in South Dakota and a separate population in
   the western portion of their distribution (Oregon). Patterns of genetic
   diversity suggest extensive gene flow mediated by both males and females
   within the continuous boreal forest. However, male-mediated gene flow is
   the main form of connectivity between the continuously distributed group
   and the smaller populations of South Dakota and Oregon that are
   separated by large areas of unforested habitat, which apparently serves
   as a barrier to movement of female woodpeckers.

AB Areas of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins)
   outbreaks in the Black Hills can provide habitat for black-backed
   woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), a U.S. Forest Service, Region 2
   Sensitive Species. These outbreaks are managed through removal of trees
   infested with mountain pine beetles to control mountain pine beetle
   populations and salvage timber resources. To minimize impacts to
   black-backed woodpeckers while meeting management objectives, there is a
   need to identify characteristics of these areas that support
   black-backed woodpeckers. We examined the habitat associations of this
   species nesting in areas of beetle outbreaks in the Black Hills, South
   Dakota in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic approach and
   discrete choice models to evaluate nest-site selection of 42 woodpecker
   nests at 3 spatial scales-territory, nest area, and nest tree. At the
   territory scale (250 m around nest), availability and distribution of
   food best explained black-backed woodpecker selection of beetle
   outbreaks versus the surrounding forest. Selection at the territory
   scale was positively associated with densities of trees currently
   infested by mountain pine beetles and indices of wood borer
   (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) abundance, and was greatest at distances
   of 50-100 m from the nearest patch of infestation. At the nest-area
   scale (12.5 m radius around the nest), densities of snags positively
   influenced nest-area selection. Finally, at the nest-tree scale, aspen
   (Populus tremuloides) and 3-5-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
   snags were important resources. The association between abundant
   wood-boring insects and black-backed woodpeckers creates a difficult
   challenge for forest managers. In the absence of fire, areas of beetle
   outbreak might serve as the only substantial source of habitat in the
   Black Hills. Regulating insect populations via salvage logging will
   reduce key food resources to black-backed woodpeckers during nesting.
   Therefore, given the relatively infrequent occurrence of large-scale
   fire in the Black Hills, management should recognize the importance of
   beetle-killed forests to the long-term viability of the black-backed
   woodpecker population in the Black Hills. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is considered a fire
   specialist throughout its breeding range. Given its high abundance in
   recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source
   habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to
   evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed
   woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central
   Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally
   and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential
   source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time.
   Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined
   significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success
   declined from 84% the first year after fire to 73% and 25%,
   respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density
   and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of
   burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests.
   Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests.
   Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates
   indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats
   for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a
   function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire
   forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone
   ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature
   and over-mature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats
   important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated
   species.

AB Prescribed fire is a management tool used to reduce fuel loads on public
   lands in forested areas in the western United States. Identifying the
   impacts of prescribed fire on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies
   with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive,
   threatened, and migratory bird species Recent developments in occupancy
   modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of
   management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a
   Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for
   detection probability, and we demonstrate the model's usefulness for
   identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities.
   Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the
   effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the
   intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection
   probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the flexibility of
   the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite
   estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed
   species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our
   modeling of the impacts of prescribed fire on avian communities in a
   ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed fire
   treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several
   bark-insectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species
   of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial
   insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus
   migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed fire, whereas
   three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark's Nutcracker
   (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined
   following treatments. Land management agencies interested in determining
   the effects of habitat manipulations on wildlife communities can use
   these methods to provide guidance for future management activities.

AB Accurate estimates of Black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and Hairy
   Woodpecker (P. villosus) nests and nest survival rates in post-fire
   landscapes provide land managers with information on the relative
   importance of burned forests to nesting woodpeckers. We conducted
   multiple-observer surveys in burned and unburned mixed coniferous
   forests in Oregon to identify important factors influencing detection
   rates of woodpecker nests. We found 21 Black-backed Woodpecker nests and
   38 Hairy Woodpecker nests in burned forest, and three Hairy Woodpecker
   nests in unburned forest. Competing models of detection probability in
   Program MARK indicated that nest-detection probability differed by nest
   stage. We found no evidence to indicate that detection rates of nests
   were associated with survey timing during the nesting season. Raw nest
   counts in burned coniferous forests may underestimate nest numbers,
   especially for nests in early stages of development. Black-backed
   Woodpecker nests were slightly more detectable than those of Hairy
   Woodpeckers in burned forests, and observers may differ in their
   abilities to detect nests.

AB In coniferous forests of western North American, fire is an important
   disturbance that influences the structure and composition of floral and
   faunal communities. The impacts of postfire management, including
   salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We
   compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in
   unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of
   salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5[long
   dash]6 snags retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central
   Oregon. We used analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate
   three hypotheses concerning the influence of different intensities of
   salvage on densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds,
   and two hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage
   logging on relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined
   the relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species.
   We did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities
   or relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We
   detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns
   differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the
   black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P.
   villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee
   (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata)
   were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the
   unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco
   hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the
   moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment.
   We detected significant differences between years for four species of
   birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting
   species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond
   uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species
   that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage
   intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage
   logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important
   habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings
   parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting
   robust patterns that transcend particular locations.

AB Large wildfire events in coniferous forests of the western United States
   are often followed by postfire timber harvest. The long-term impacts of
   postfire timber harvest on fire-associated cavity-nesting bird species
   are not well documented. We studied nest-site selection by
   cavity-nesting birds over a 10-year period (1994[long dash]2003),
   representing 1[long dash]11 years after fire, on two burns created by
   mixed severity wildfires in western Idaho, USA. One burn was partially
   salvaged logged (the Foothills burn), the other was primarily unlogged
   (the Star Gulch burn). We monitored 1367 nests of six species (Lewis's
   Woodpecker Melanerpes lewis, Hairy Woodpecker Picoides villosus,
   Black-backed Woodpecker P. arcticus, Northern Flicker Colaptes auratus,
   Western Bluebird Sialia mexicana, and Mountain Bluebird S. currucoides).
   Habitat data at nest and non-nest random locations were characterized at
   fine (field collected) and coarse (remotely sensed) spatial scales.
   Nest-site selection for most species was consistently associated with
   higher snag densities and larger snag diameters, whereas wildfire
   location (Foothills versus Star Gulch) was secondarily important. All
   woodpecker species used nest sites with larger diameter snags that were
   surrounded by higher densities of snags than at non-nest locations.
   Nests of Hairy Woodpecker and Mountain Bluebird were primarily
   associated with the unlogged wildfire, whereas nests of Lewis's
   Woodpecker and Western Bluebird were associated with the partially
   logged burn in the early years after fire. Nests of wood-probing species
   (Hairy and Black-backed Woodpeckers) were also located in larger forest
   patch areas than patches measured at non-nest locations. Our results
   confirm previous findings that maintaining clumps of large snags in
   postfire landscapes is necessary for maintaining breeding habitat of
   cavity-nesting birds. Additionally, appropriately managed salvage
   logging can create habitat for some species of cavity-nesting birds that
   prefermore open environments. Our findings can be used by landmangers to
   develop design criteria for postfire salvage logging that will reserve
   breeding habitat for cavity-nesting birds.

AB Many scientists and forest land managers concur that past fire
   suppression, grazing, and timber harvesting practices have created
   unnatural and unhealthy conditions in the dry, ponderosa pine forests of
   the western United States. Specifically, such forests are said to carry
   higher fuel loads and experience fires that are more severe than those
   that occurred historically. It remains unclear, however, how far these
   generalizations can be extrapolated in time and space, and how well they
   apply to the more mesic ponderosa pine systems and to other forest
   systems within the western United States. I use data on the pattern of
   distribution of one bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides
   arcticus) as derived from 16 465 sample locations to show that, in
   western Montana, this bird species is extremely specialized on severely
   burned forests. Such specialization has profound implications because it
   suggests that the severe fires we see burning in many forests in the
   Intermountain West are not entirely "unnatural'' or "unhealthy.''
   Instead, severely burned forest conditions have probably occurred
   naturally across a broad range of forest types for millennia. These
   findings highlight the fact that severe fire provides an important
   ecological backdrop for fire specialists like the Black-backed
   Woodpecker, and that the presence and importance of severe fire may be
   much broader than commonly appreciated.

AB In forests, high-severity burn patches[long dash]wherein most or all of
   the trees are killed by fire[long dash]often occur within a mosaic of
   low- and moderate-severity effects. Although there have been several
   studies of postfire salvage-logging effects on bird species, there have
   been few studies of effects on bird species associated with
   high-severity patches in forests that have otherwise burned at lower
   severities. From 2004 to 2006, we investigated the foraging presence or
   absence of three woodpecker species, the Black-backed (Picoides
   arcticus), Hairy (P. villosus), and White-headed (P. albolarvatus)
   Woodpeckers, within four different forest habitat conditions in Sierra
   Nevada conifer forests: unburned; moderate-severity and unlogged;
   high-severity and unlogged; and high-severity and logged. We found
   Black-backed Woodpecker foraging was restricted to unlogged
   high-severity patches. Hairy Woodpeckers foraged most in unlogged
   high-severity patches, and White-headed Woodpeckers showed no
   significant difference in presence among conditions. These results
   suggest that unlogged, high-severity forest is important habitat for the
   Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers.

AB Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are burned-forest
   specialists that rely on beetles (Coleoptera) for food. In the Black
   Hills, South Dakota, standing dead forests resulting from mountain pine
   beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks offer food resources for
   Black-backed Woodpeckers, in addition to providing habitat similar to
   burned forest. However, data on reproductive rates in these habitats are
   lacking. We estimated nest success and evaluated factors affecting nest
   survival of Black-backed Woodpeckers in beetle-killed forests in the
   Black Hills in 2004 and 2005. Nest success was 78% (n = 12) in 2004 and
   44% (n = 31) in 2005. Fledging rates per pair were 2.0 [plus or minus]
   0.3 SE (n = 12) and 1.4 [plus or minus] 0.3 SE (n = 28) in 2004 and
   2005, respectively. Our results showed that temporal effects (e.g., age,
   date, and year) had the greatest influence on nest survival. Nest age
   was the most important predictor of daily nest survival; survival was
   higher in older nests. Nest survival was also lower later in the
   breeding season. The difference in nest success between the two years
   requires further study; however, nest success of Black-backed
   Woodpeckers in beetle-killed forests in the Black Hills was within the
   range of nest success within postfire habitats in this area. In the
   Black Hills, forests experiencing beetle outbreaks offer available
   habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers.

AB Despite an abundance of studies describing nest selection in
   cavity-nesting birds, few account for the variation in habitat
   availability across the geographic range of a species and through time.
   Changes in the frequency of disturbances such as fires, timber harvests,
   and insect outbreaks can dramatically alter habitat. Responses by
   cavity-nesting birds to these changes provide an opportunity to evaluate
   underlying determinants of nest selection. We compared nest site
   attributes to available resources for 3 species of cavity-nesting birds:
   the Pileated Wood-pecker (Dryocopus pileatus), Williamson's Sapsucker
   (Sphyrapicus thyroideus), and Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus). Data collected in 2003-2004 were compared to data collected
   in the 1970s in the same study area to identify changes in patterns of
   selection. Due to severe insect outbreaks, available resources differed
   greatly between the 2 time periods. In studies separated by 30 y,
   Pileated Woodpeckers and Black-backed Woodpeckers exhibited remarkable
   consistency in patterns of nest site selection. Both species still
   selected Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags preferentially for
   nesting despite their decline in availability. Williamson's Sapsuckers
   were less selective and nested in the most abundant snag species during
   both time periods. Selection for factors such as tree size and degree of
   decay remained consistent regardless of differences in habitat
   availability for the 3 species. By identifying these general patterns of
   nest site selection, our conclusions are applicable to a wider variety
   of habitat conditions.

   arcticus) in burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) / Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests of southwestern Idaho during 2000 and
   2002 (6 and 8 years following fire). Home range size for 4 adult males
   during the post-fledging period was 115.6-420.9 ha using the 95%
   fixed-kernel method, and 150.4-766.1 ha using the 100% minimum convex
   polygon method. Smoothed bootstrap estimates (95%) were 130.0-521.9 ha.
   Home range sizes were significantly smaller 6 years after fire than 8
   years after fire. Each male had from 2 to 8 areas of concentrated use
   within his home range. We provide recommendations for estimating area
   requirements of Black-backed Woodpeckers in post-fire ponderosa pine /
   Douglas-fir forests.

AB We monitored the nest densities and nest survival of seven
   cavity-nesting bird species, including four open-space foragers
   (American Kestrel (Falco sparperius), Lewis's Woodpecker (Melanerpes
   lewis), Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana), and Mountain Bluebird (S.
   currucoides)) and three wood-foragers (Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides
   villosus), Black-backed Woodpecker (P. arcticus), and Northern Flicker
   (Colaptes auratus)), after two wildfires (one partially salvage-logged
   and one unlogged) in western Idaho from 1994-2004. We estimated the
   relationship between nest density and time since fire, tested for
   statistical differences in nest densities and nest survival in the
   partially salvage-logged vs. unlogged wildfires, and tested for
   differences in nest survival between early (1-4 years after fire) and
   late (5-12 years after fire) postfire periods. Nest densities of
   open-space foragers and Northern Flickers generally increased with time
   since fire, whereas nest densities of Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers
   peaked 4-5 years postfire. Nest densities of wood-foraging species and
   Mountain Bluebirds were significantly higher in the unlogged burn,
   whereas Lewis's Woodpeckers had significantly higher nest densities in
   the partially logged burn. Kestrels tended to favor the partially logged
   burn, while Western Bluebird nest densities were nearly equal in both
   burned areas. For most species, postfire period and treatment (partially
   logged vs. unlogged) had little influence on nest survival. However,
   Hairy Woodpecker nest survival was significantly lower in the partially
   logged burn versus the unlogged wildfire in the early postfire period,
   and Lewis's Woodpecker nest survival was significantly reduced in the
   later postfire period versus the early postfire period in the partially
   logged burn. Importantly, the salvage logging was designed to retain
   more than half of the snags over 23 cm in diameter, which provided
   suitable nesting habitat for open-space foragers during the decade
   following fire.

AB Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) may depend on recently
   burned forest patches to maintain viable population levels. We wanted to
   determine how these habitats are colonized by this species and by which
   age classes. Data collected at the Observatoire d'oiseaux de Tadoussac
   (situated on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada))
   suggest that an important movement of juveniles occurs during the
   autumn. It was therefore hypothesized that in the year following fire,
   burned forest sites would be colonized by a higher percentage of
   juvenile birds than intact mature stands. In accordance to this
   hypothesis, there was a difference in woodpecker age structure between
   the two habitat types ([chi]2 = 9.43, df = 2, P = 0.0088, n = 186).
   However, differences are mainly explained by the higher number of third
   calendar year birds at burned forest sites, suggesting that a part of
   the colonization occurs in the same year as the fire by second year
   birds, rather than by juveniles during the autumn.

AB Presence-absence data is often used to determine the preferred habitat
   of a given organism. However, with presence-absence datasets there is a
   problem associated with the comparison between habitats when there is an
   inter-habitat variation in the proportion of false zeros. Using
   conspecific playbacks and time of reaction of black-backed woodpeckers
   in burned and unburned forests, the present study determined whether
   detection probabilities were similar. The period of time required to
   detect this species was shorter in recently burned sites than in mature
   forest stands (F2.235 = 22.1, df = 2, P  0.0001). To accurately compare
   these habitats it is important to assure the same proportion of presence
   and false zeros in each habitat during the census. To achieve this, we
   propose a time corrected method. Because inter-habitat differences in
   detectability exist for black-backed woodpeckers, and probably many
   other organisms, caution is needed when interpreting presence-absence
   data in the context of habitat comparisons or when monitoring
   biodiversity in different habitats.

AB We compared how bird communities differed between burned and logged
   stands in black spruce (Picea mariana) forests of the boreal shield in
   Quebec and mixed-wood forests on the boreal plain in Alberta and
   Saskatchewan. Bird community composition was quite different in burns
   and clearcuts shortly after disturbance. In burns, cavity nesters and
   species that forage on beetles in dead trees predominated, whereas
   clearcuts were dominated by open-country species. Generally,
   snag-dependent species decreased and shrub-breeding species increased by
   25 yr postfire. Species that forage and nest in canopy trees were more
   common 25 yr post-logging because of the retention of live residual
   trees. The bird communities tended to converge over time as the
   vegetation in burns and logged areas became more similar. Black-backed
   Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) and Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides
   tridactylus) exploit recently burned coniferous forest to forage on
   wood-boring insect larvae (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) and bark beetle
   larvae (Scolytidae) for a short period after fire and then decline.
   Black-backs were absent from mature forests and found at low density in
   old-growth forest. Over the long term, burns may be temporary sources
   for fire specialists. The major conservation issue for fire- associated
   species is salvage logging, because woodpecker foraging and nesting
   trees are removed. Maintenance of suitable amounts of postfire forests
   spared from salvage logging is essential for sustainable forest
   management. Climate change is predicted to alter fire cycles: they will
   be shorter in the prairies leading to a shortage of old-growth forest
   and will be longer in Quebec leading to a shortage of younger forest.

AB We studied snag use for foraging by Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides
   arcticus) one year after a fire in an eastern black spruce (Picea
   mariana) boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. We searched for signs of
   foraging (bark flaking and excavation holes) by Black-backed Woodpeckers
   on 6,536 snags sampled in 56 plots located in portions of the burned
   forest that had not been salvage logged. A logistic regression model was
   developed based on the presence or absence of foraging signs. Results
   showed that Black-backed Woodpeckers used larger snags that were less
   deteriorated by fire (qualified as high-quality snags). Direct field
   observations of individuals foraging on 119 snags also indicated that
   used snags corresponded to those of high predicted quality. Finally, we
   assessed the relationship between food availability and snag
   characteristics by measuring the density of wood-boring beetle larvae
   holes on 30 snags of different size and deterioration classes.
   High-quality snags contained higher prey densities (wood-boring beetle
   holes) than smaller and more deteriorated snags. We recommend that
   forest blocks characterized by large and less deteriorated trees be
   preserved from salvage logging in recently burned boreal forests in
   northeastern North America.

AB The Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus is an uncommon bird of
   the boreal forest that is dependent on recent burns and Spruce Bark
   Beetle Dendroctonus rufipennis infestation for foraging (Fig. 1).
   Populations of Three-toed Woodpeckers in south-central Utah have
   increased recently due to the large scale spread of spruce bark beetle
   infestation. Subsequently, much of this area has been targeted for
   salvage logging. We studied habitat use and behavior of Three-toed
   Woodpeckers in logged and unlogged portions of beetle-infested Engelmann
   spruce Picea engelmannii forest on Monroe Mountain, Utah, Fishlake
   National Forest, from May to August 2000. Micro and macro-habitat data
   and bird behavior were recorded at 60 sites where Three-toed Woodpeckers
   were observed. Comparisons of habitat parameters were made between feed,
   nest, and drum trees. Engelmann spruce was used most heavily for feeding
   and comprised 97 % of feed trees. Forty-four percent of nest trees were
   in Aspen Populus tremutoides, with the remaining 56 % in broken top
   conifers. Average forest canopy cover differed between the three types
   of trees (p < 0.05), with feed trees having the highest canopy cover
   (69.7 [plus or minus] 16 %) (mean [plus or minus] SD), and nest trees
   the lowest (19.9 [plus or minus] 18 %). Canopy cover was also less in
   logged than in unlogged areas (p< < 0.001). Outer debarking was
   significantly greater (p > 0.05) on feed (55 [plus or minus] 27 %) and
   drum trees (31 [plus or minus] 34 %) than on nest trees (6 [plus or
   minus] 10%). Nest trees were found to occur in less aggregated stands of
   surrounding random trees than were feed and drum trees (p < 0.05).
   Distance to habitat edge was less in logged areas than in unlogged areas
   (p< 0.10). These findings suggest that according to certain habitat
   parameters, Three-toed Woodpeckers use different types of trees for
   feeding, nesting, and drumming, and in logged and unlogged areas. This
   indicates that perpetuation of mature aspen and old-growth Engelmann
   spruce is important in maintaining Three-toed Woodpecker populations.

AB The effect of food supply on the Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides
   tridactylus breeding density and productivity was investigated by
   comparing the pattern of annual changes in prey abundance in habitats
   with declining vs. stable woodpecker populations. In a burnt area of
   eastern Finland, where the woodpecker breeding population has been
   continuously diminishing, following a major increase the first year
   after fire, only the abundance of spruce bark beetles (Col., Scolytidae)
   (the woodpecker autumn-spring main insect prey) decreased through the
   years. Conversely, the abundance of longhorn beetles (Col.,
   Cerambycidae) (the nestling main food supply) increased dramatically. On
   the other hand, in neighbouring old-growth patches where one pair was
   breeding annually, abundance of spruce bark and longhorn beetles did not
   change significantly between years, although the abundance level of the
   bark beetles differed among patches. Hence, my results suggest the
   woodpecker breeding population to be limited by food supply available
   outside the breeding season, as shown for other forest bird species. The
   finding, however, that woodpeckers breeding 6-7 years after the fire
   reared larger broods than earlier pairs, while brood size did not change
   annually under old-growth conditions, suggests longhorn beetle
   availability to be critical to reproductive success.

AB Comparisons of the effects of logging and fire as disturbance agents on
   the composition of bird assemblages in boreal ecosystems are still
   lacking or are limited to the short-term impacts of clear-cutting. In
   Quebec, where the boreal forest is largely dominated by black spruce
   (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands, we surveyed 140 point-count
   stations in 3 postlogging and 4 postfire development stages determined
   according to the height of the regenerating spruce trees. Species
   richness did not vary among forest development stages, but bird
   abundance was higher in recent clearcuts. Recently disturbed areas were
   characterized by open-land bird assemblages dominated by Neotropical
   migrants, which reached their highest abundance in clearcuts. Moreover,
   logged stands were distinguished from burned sites by the absence of
   cavity-nesting birds. Forest-bird assemblages reestablished themselves
   as soon as young spruces reached the sapling stage. However, the
   Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker
   (Picoides tridactylus), and Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) were
   restricted to mature stands or recent burns and are thus likely to be
   negatively affected by modern forestry, which involves fire suppression
   and short logging rotations. We suggest that retention of larger areas
   of continuous mature forest might be essential to maintain these species
   in managed regions.

AB Throughout its geographic range, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus) is rare and appears very similar in its foraging ecology to 2
   broadly sympatric congeners, the three-toed (P. tridactylus) and hairy
   woodpecker (P. villosus). The purposes of our study were to test for
   differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and
   hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the
   importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the
   black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic
   population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and
   black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek
   fire near Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased
   markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained
   high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2
   years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ha. Black-backed
   woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately to heavily
   burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval wood-boring
   beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on less-burnt spruces
   and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark beetle (Scolytidae)
   larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to earlier studies, our
   results demonstrate substantive differences in foraging sites, behavior,
   and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology of male hairy woodpeckers
   and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly females, was similar. In all
   3 species, particularly the hairy woodpecker, females fed lower on trees
   and were far less numerous than males in the study area, which suggested
   intersexual displacement from foraging sites and habitats selected by
   males. In summer 1985, following initial adult emergence of the 1983
   cerambycid and scolytid cohorts, woodpeckers declined markedly and were
   absent by late spring 1986.

AB An active Black-backed Woodpecker nest was found in a forested area that
   had been severely burned the same summer. By backdating, nest excavation
   was estimated to have started within a few days after the passage of the
   fire. This observation indicates that the Black-backed Woodpecker is not
   only closely associated with recently-burned forests, but that it can
   nest successfully immediately after the occurrence of a forest fire.

AB During the two breeding seasons immediately following the numerous and
   widespread fires of 1988, I estimated bird community composition in each
   of 34 burned-forest sites in western Montana and northern Wyoming. I
   detected an average of 45 species per site and a total of 87 species in
   the sites combined. A compilation of these data with bird-count data
   from more than 200 additional studies conducted across 15 major
   vegetation cover types in the northern Rocky Mountain region showed that
   15 bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire
   communities than in any other major cover type occurring in the northern
   Rockies. One bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus)
   seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing
   dead forests created by stand-replacement fires. Bird communities in
   recently burned forests are different in composition from those that
   characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including
   early-successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding
   guilds are especially abundant therein: woodpeckers, flycatchers, and
   seedeaters. Standing, fire-killed trees provided nest sites for nearly
   two-thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites.
   Broken-top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for
   cavity-nesting species significantly more often than expected on the
   basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the
   broken-top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest
   conditions prior to a fire (especially the presence of snags) may be
   important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity-nesting
   birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or
   relatively restricted to burned forests, stand-replacement fires may be
   necessary for long-term maintenance of their populations.

AB During December 1988-June 1989, in a small forest burn area composed
   mainly of White Pine (Pinus strobus), male Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides
   villosus) tended to forage on smaller diameters and at greater heights
   than male Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus). Males of both species
   still overlapped greatly in their foraging heights and diameters. In all
   (n = 22) interspecific contacts, Black-backed Woodpeckers stopped
   foraging and moved to a more distant tree when Hairy Woodpeckers
   approached within 10 m.

AB Birds in a 6.25 ha quadrat in a 73 yr old jack pine-black spruce forest
   (Pinus banksiana-Picea mariana) in Cook County, Minnesota [USA] were
   intensively studied in June 1976. A wildfire burned through the area in
   Aug. The following spring the same quadrat was resurveyed to determine
   the 1st yr changes in bird populations. Species and guilds were compared
   by density, territorial space, existence energy and importance values.
   Twelve species had territories in the study grid before the fire
   [Dendroica castanea, D. fusca, Parus hudsonicus, Vireo olivaceus,
   Regulus calendula, V. solitarius, D. coronata, Certhia familiaris, Sitta
   canadensis, Catharus guttatus, Seiurus aurocapillus, Troglodytes
   troglodytes]; six [V. olivaceus, V. solitarius, Sitta canadensis, C.
   guttatus, Seiurus aurocapillus, T. troglodytes] were not there the
   following spring, but 8 additional species [Nuttallornis borealis,
   Picoides arcticus, Catharsus minimus, C. ustulatus, Carpodacus
   purpureus, Turdus migratorious, Junco hyemalis and Zonotrichia
   albicollis] had established territories. Tree-foliage searchers had the
   greatest importance value before the fire and ground-brush foragers the
   greatest value afterwards. Density, total biomass, and combined
   existence energy of birds decreased after the fire by 50, 23 and 41%,
   respectively, but species using the area after the fire were 63% heavier
   on the average. Average energy consumption per unit of body weight was
   calculated to be 23% less after the fire. Fire apparently reduced the
   total food available for birds, but increased the kinds of food,
   especially at or near the ground.
