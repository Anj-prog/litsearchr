White et al. (2011) stated that equal prior probabilities were used to compute overall correct classification rates for logistic regression models (page 539, column 1, lines 22–24), and that 62.5% was used as the criterion to judge whether overall correct classification rates were higher than chance classification (page 539, column 1, lines 28–31). K.J.G. realized recently, however, that at the time of the analyses, he misinterpreted information in SAS Proc Logistic software (SAS Institute) about how to code for equal prior probabilities and information in Hair et al. () about when the 62.5% criterion is applicable. Regarding the first issue, we drew inferences about an area that we were not able to sample completely. When sample sites may not be representative of the conditions about which inferences are being drawn, one should use a conservative approach and use equal prior probabilities (0.5 for each presence-absence group in our case) to compute correct classification rates instead of using sample proportions for these prior probabilities (Hair et al.). Hair et al. () and Hahs-Vaughn () recommend this same approach. Although we stated this information in the article (page 539, column 1, lines 17–24), by mistake sample proportions (default setting in SAS Proc Logistic) of site types (species present or species absent), not equal probabilities, were used as prior probabilities to compute overall correct classification rates. Regarding the second issue, the 62.5% rule-of-thumb criterion is appropriate for 2-group analyses only when the sample sizes of the 2 groups are equal (Hair et al,). In the context of our paper, that would mean that the number of sites where a species was present would need to be the same as the number of sites where that species was absent. This was not the case for the species involved. An alternative approach was identified for assessing the significance of an overall correct classification rate for logistic regression (Press's Q statistic) (Hair et al,; Hahs-Vaughn) that enables a probabilistic inference and that does not require equal sample sizes for the 2 groups. We reported (page 541, column 1, lines 6–9) that the overall correct classification rate was greater than chance classification accuracy for all 9 models (3 annual models each for Scaled Quail [Callipepla squamata], Loggerhead Shrike [Lanius ludovicianus], and Rock Wren [Salpinctes obsoletus]). Using equal prior probabilities and Press's Q in reanalyses of the data for the 9 models, we found that 5 of the models had an overall correct classification rate that was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than chance accuracy: Scaled Quail (1999–2000) 69%, Scaled Quail (2000–2001) 75%, Loggerhead Shrike (2000–2001) 69%, Scaled Quail (2001–2002) 70%, and Rock Wren (2001–2002) 69%. Thus, the general conclusions about the predictive ability of these 5 models did not differ from our original conclusions. For the remaining 4 models, the overall correct classification rate was not significantly higher than the rate expected by chance: Loggerhead Shrike (1999–2000) 56%, Rock Wren (1999–2000) 53%, Rock Wren (2000–2001) 53%, and Loggerhead Shrike (2001–2002) 52%. Hence, the conclusions about the predictive ability of these 4 models differed from our original conclusions. All the original models themselves were appropriate because all statistical assumptions were met and the models accounted for modest but important amounts of variation in the relative probability of species’ occurrences. The updated results indicate, however, that the 5 models that had overall correct classification rates that were significantly higher than the chance rate were likely to be applicable to the 70 sites and to a larger population of sites with similar conditions; whereas, for the 4 models that had overall correct classification rates that were not significantly higher than the chance rate, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that their results apply to a larger population of sites. The emphasis in White et al. (2011) was on how to combine mechanistic and statistical models to project how climate change and fire management may affect species’ occurrences. The article's methodological information on combining mechanistic and statistical models was not affected by correction of the 2 errors, but the projected relative probabilities of occurrence for Loggerhead Shrike (1999–2000, 2001–2002) and Rock Wren (1999–2000, 2000–2001) were probably not as accurate as we believed. This lower predictive ability may have added some uncertainty to the projected probabilities of occurrence for these species and years. We thank M. Burgman, D.

Habitat loss and degradation, largely related to fire suppression, are believed to be the major causes of population declines, but these relationships are less studied at the northern range-extent. Hence, we investigated habitat selection of Bachman's Sparrow on Fort Bragg Military Installation, where vegetation is characterized by extensive fire-maintained Pinus palustris (Longleaf Pine) uplands. We surveyed breeding male sparrows using repeat-visit point-counts. We visited 182 points 3 times from April to July during the 2014 and 2015 breeding seasons. We measured vegetation and distance to other habitat features (e.g., wildlife openings, streams) at each point. We recorded presence or absence of Bachman's Sparrows and fit encounter histories into a single-season occupancy model in program Unmarked, including a year effect on detection. Occupancy probability was 0.52 and increased with greater grass-cover and at intermediate distances from wildlife openings, and decreased with years-since-fire and with greater shrub height. Predictors of Bachman's Sparrow occupancy were similar to those reported for other portions of the range, supporting the importance of frequent prescribed fire to maintain herbaceous groundcover used by birds for nesting and foraging. However, our study indicated that other habitat features (e.g., canopy openings) provided critical cover within extensive upland Longleaf Pine-Aristida stricta (Wiregrass) forest. © 2018 IEEE Computer Society.

Forest fire is one such disaster which when occurs at large scale not only destroys the flora, fauna, vegetation of the forest but also puts the life of human being and animals at a very high risk. In the recent past years, managing this type of crisis, viz., a large scale fire has become a very difficult and challenging task. Things that are common in most of the forest fire that occur at large scale are loss of life (human or animal), loss of vegetation, loss of flora and fauna, and communication failure. Therefore, a comprehensive survey on the existing forest fire detection and monitoring mechanisms is highly desired.

We address this issue by studying the neuromuscular origins of display behavior in a small tropical passerine bird, the golden-collared manakin (Manacus vitellinus). Males of this species court females by dancing around the forest floor and rapidly snapping their wings together above their back. Using radio-Telemetry, we collected electromyographic (EMG) recordings from the three main muscles that control avian forelimb movement, and found how these different muscles are activated to generate various aspects of display behavior. The muscle that raises the wing (supracoracoideus, SC) and the primary muscle that retracts the wing (scapulohumeralis caudalis, SH) were activated during the wing-snap, whereas the pectoralis (PEC), the main wing depressor, was not. SC activation began before wing elevation commenced, with further activation occurring gradually. By contrast, SH activation was swift, starting soon after wing elevation and peaking shortly after the snap. The intensity of this SH activation was comparable to that which occurs during flapping, whereas the SC activation was much lower. Thus, light activation of the SC likely helps position the wings above the back, so that quick, robust SH activation can drive these appendages together to generate the firecracker-like snap sonation. This is one of the first looks at the neuromuscular mechanisms that underlie the actuation of a dynamic courtship display, and it demonstrates that even complex, whole-body display movements can be studied with transmitter-Aided EMG techniques. © 2017.

Retrofitting poles through increasing clearances (separation) between components, adding insulation to components, or adding redirection materials like perch discouragers reduces risk, but electrocutions may occur even on retrofitted poles. We evaluated 52 retrofitted poles where 56 birds, including 17 Golden Eagles, were electrocuted after retrofitting. We used burns on pole equipment and carcasses to identify precise pole-top locations where electrocutions occurred, and we identified three categories of retrofitting errors: product design, mitigation plan, and application. Product design errors (n = 9 poles, 6 Golden Eagles) occurred when products did not sufficiently cover energized equipment. Mitigation plan errors (n = 30 poles, 6 Golden Eagles) occurred when retrofitting plans did not include coverage of all energized components on a pole. Application errors (n = 13 poles, 5 Golden Eagles) occurred when the correct products were installed incorrectly. Retrofitting mistakes were identified in this study retroactively when avian electrocutions occurred on poles described as retrofitted. This is typical of how retrofitting mistakes are identified by the electric industry, which can lead to expensive duplicate efforts, and ongoing avian electrocutions. These can be avoided if retrofitting is done correctly initially. This study provides insight to electric utility personnel and wildlife managers interested in proactively evaluating the thoroughness of retrofitting, facilitating immediate identification and correction of retrofitting errors, increasing cost effectiveness, and reducing avian electrocution mortality. © 2017 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.","power line",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028943237

Disturbance events often alter habitat, which in turn can modify behaviors of individuals in affected areas, including changes in habitat use and associated changes in social structure. To better understand these relationships, we investigated aspects of habitat selection and social connectivity of a small passerine bird, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus), before vs. after naturally occurring fire disturbance in Northern Territory, Australia. We utilized a social network framework to evaluate changes in social dynamics pre- vs. post-fire. Our study covered the non-breeding season in two consecutive years in which fires occurred, and individuals whose habitat was affected and those that were not affected by fire. Individuals in habitat affected by fires had stronger social ties (i.e. higher weighted degree) after fires, while those that were in areas that were not affected by fire actually had lower weighted degree. We suggest that this change in social connections may be linked to habitat. Before fires, fairywrens used habitat that had similar grass cover to available habitat plots randomly generated within our study site. Fire caused a reduction in grass cover, and fairywrens responded by selecting habitat with higher grass cover relative to random plots. This study demonstrates how changes in habitat and/or resource availability caused by disturbance can lead to substantive changes in the social environment that individuals experience. © 2017 Lantz, Karubian.

We report on a 20-year mark-recapture investigation (1991–2010) of the distribution and density of breeders, temporal and spatial variability in breeding, nestling sex ratios, local versus immigrant recruitment of breeders, breeding age structure, age-specific survival rates, and rate of population change (λ) of this species on the Kaibab Plateau, a forested sky island in northern Arizona, USA. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of annual fluctuations in precipitation on the annual frequency of goshawk breeding and fledgling production. We studied 125 goshawk breeding territories, representing approximately 87% of an estimated 144 total territories based on a mean distance of 3.8 km between territory centers in a 1,728-km2 study area. The salient demographic feature of the population was extensive annual variation in breeding, which manifested as large inter-annual variation in proportions of pairs laying eggs, brood sizes, nest failure rates, and fledgling production. The percent of territories known in a prior year in which eggs were laid in a current year ranged from 8% to 86% (x = 37%, SE = 4.51), annual mean nest failure rate (active nests that failed) ranged from 12% to 48% (overall (x) = 23%, SE = 2.48), and mean annual brood size of successful nests (fledged ≥1 fledgling) ranged from 1.5 young to 2.5 young (overall x = 2.0 young, SE = 0.03). Inter-annual variation in reproduction closely tracked inter-annual variation in precipitation, which we hypothesize influenced primary forest productivity and bird and mammal prey abundance. The best breeding years (1992–1993, 77–87% of pairs laid eggs) were coincident with a record-long El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) wet period and the worst breeding year (2003; 8% of pairs laid eggs) was the last of a 3-year record drought. Overall breeding success was 83% with most failures occurring during incubation; once eggs hatched, goshawks tended to fledge young. The pooled 20-year nestling sex ratio did not differ from unity (53% M; n = 410 M, 366 F) but was significantly male-biased in 2 years and female-biased in 1 year. Nonetheless, the overall greater production of male fledglings followed a strong trend of greater male production in other goshawk populations, suggesting that breeders might have been adaptively adjusting their offspring sex ratio, perhaps to produce more of the rarer (male) sex. Annual recruitment of new individuals into the breeding population averaged 43% during the study. Study area recruitment rate of hawks locally born (in situ) and banded was 0.12. Both sexes had equal tendencies to return to the Kaibab Plateau to breed (no differences in philopatry) and there were no differences in natal dispersal distances (natal to first breeding site) between the sexes. During the final years of study (1999–2010), an estimated 46% of breeding recruits were locally born and 54% were immigrants from distant forests. Minimum age at first breeding was 2 years and mean age at first breeding by known-age hawks (banded as nestlings or aged on plumage at first breeding) was 3.7 years for males and 3.5 years for females. Mean lifespan (yr from first banding as nestling to last resighting) of known-age goshawks was 6.9 years for both sexes. Mean minimum apparent lifespan of breeders aged ≥4 years based on plumage at first capture was 6.5 years for both sexes. Average age of goshawks at their first detection was 3.9 years old, at which time apparent survival was estimated at 0.77 for both sexes, which was just slightly less than the peak survival of 0.78 as a function of age. Age-specific survival estimates showed a steady decline after 9 years old and approached 0 at 20 years of age. Estimates of λ for breeding adults (M, 0.94, SE = 0.037; F, 0.98, SE = 0.038) provided only weak evidence for a population decline during the study. Although sex was not in the top survival model, models including age + sex were competitive, evidencing lower male than female survival, a finding corroborated by the occurrence of sex effects in the top λ model. Lower male survival may result from higher mortality associated with hunting agile prey in vegetation-filled environments during long breeding seasons when they are the primary forager. Lower survival may be compensated by the more frequent production (53%) of male fledglings. High-severity crown fire was an existential threat to the population. In addition to 4 large high-severity fires that burned roughly 3,770 ha (equal to 3 goshawk territories) in the 30 years preceding 1991, 6 high-severity fires burned another 30,945 ha during our study and killed most (&gt;64%) of the forests in 8 known territories and possibly another 2 that were burned before we completed surveys. Based on a lack of any recent demographic perturbations in age structure, a relatively high and time-constant annual adult survival rate, confidence intervals around adult λ estimates overlapping 1.0, and a study area saturated with territories, we surmise that the goshawk population on the Kaibab Plateau was stable during the 20-year study. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains regarding the population's future status because of a declining trend in breeding frequency, uncertain status (dead, alive, emigrated) of non-breeding adults, extensive temporal and spatial variation in breeding, and high frequency of immigrant recruits to the breeding population on the Kaibab Plateau. If the century-long decline in precipitation persists, especially at the increased rate seen since 1980, and manifests as deeper droughts, diminished wet periods, and weaker pulses in forest productivity, then the Kaibab Plateau goshawk population would be expected to show unambiguous evidence of decline. Evidence would include reduced local and regional goshawk reproduction and survival, reduced frequency of immigration, and further habitat loss to catastrophic fire. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017","Accipiter gentilis; age structure; Arizona; brood sex ratio; demography; immigration; Kaibab Plateau; lambda; precipitation; recruitment; reproduction; survival",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018347937

Marconi, 446, Rome, Italy","Monk Parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) is a successful invader of many European urbanised habitats. Here, we report evidence of interspecific interactions between this species and some synanthropic co-occurring birds in three urban parks of Rome (central Italy). In both nesting and feeding sites, we recorded 158 interactions with seven syntopic species in eight colonial focal nests (0.74 events/hr). The number and frequency of interactions significantly differ among nests and species, the Italian Sparrow (Passer italiae) being the most interactive species. For this species, the frequency of interactions was normally distributed between different months with a peak in June. We also observed a case of nest cohabitation, as well as predatory attacks carried out by Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix). As far as foraging sites are concerned, 11 out of 74 clusters of parakeets (15%) hosted four bird species, mainly Starling, Sturnus vulgaris, but we did not observe any interactions. Although Monk Parakeet is a social bird generally tolerant towards other species near their nests and in foraging areas, we observed interspecific interactions in nesting sites as a response to competitive or predatory mechanisms. Italian Sparrows interact because they use parakeet nests as a secondary structure for nesting (cohabitation) and, probably, because of the wide availability of food resources (invertebrates) useful for juvenile recruitment. The interaction of parakeets with Hooded Crow is a response to predatory attacks on eggs or juveniles. However, interspecific interactions seem to be occasional events in nesting sites and are apparently absent in feeding sites, where competitive behaviour is probably reduced due to high availability of plant resources. In urbanised areas, where Monk Parakeets have recently been introduced, the number of competitors and predators might be very reduced (both in number of events and species) in comparison to native areas where competition and predatory mechanisms reflect long-term co-evolutionary dynamics. © 2016 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.","cohabitation; Corvus cornix; Passer italiae; secondary nesters; Sturnus vulgaris",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964622043

This worldwide zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii also affects several domestic and wild mammal species, birds and arthropods, which can serve as reservoirs. The transmission between or within populations mainly occurs via inhalation or ingestion of this bacterium, which is also classified as a category B bioterrorism agent. Consequently, the epidemiological triad (i.e., agent, host and environment) assumes a crucial significance for the scientific knowledge of C. burnetii to understand its dynamic circulation within animal and human ecosystems and its pathogenicity in different populations. All of these aspects are deeply discussed in the present book. Moreover, risk factors, spatial epidemiology, the impact of climate change, pathogenicity, diagnosis in animals and humans, diagnostic and typing methods, and immunity improvement against C. burnetii within hosts are also described. Other than scientific research, this book also reports evidence-based medicine attained by several expert researchers in biological sciences, medical doctors and veterinary physicians, and their vision regarding Q fever trends and challenges. A significant amount of comprehensive information based on the One Health approach is shared with the readers. We expect that the contents of this book, as an integrated and holistic update about Q fever and its etiologic agent C. burnetii, may contribute to a better comprehension of this important and widespread zoonosis, to trigger and fuel scientific research, which will undoubtedly aid in the improvement of world biosafety. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This ended with the introduction of mammalian herbivores by European settlers in the 19th century. For at least 40 yr researchers have speculated about how New Zealand's vegetation communities might have responded to the ‘herbivore gap’. Did plant taxa once consumed by moa flourish in forest understoreys without large herbivores to browse them? Did forest understoreys become denser, preventing regeneration of long-lived conifers and altering forest composition? Such questions remain to be tested using palaeoecological records. Location: Three locations on South Island, New Zealand (from <20 to 750 m a.s.l) where forest has not been burned since human settlement, and where there has been no obvious geological or climatic disturbance events over the past 1000 yr that have influenced vegetation dynamics. Methods: We identified and quantified pollen grains and fern spores from soil/peat cores taken beneath, or adjacent to, tall forest canopies. Soil/peat samples from the cores were radiocarbon dated and Bayesian age–depth models were constructed for each core, from which depths corresponding to the herbivore gap period were identified. Changes in pollen/spore abundances occurring within the herbivore gap were identified and critically examined for consistency between cores and likelihood of being caused by loss of browsing pressure from large herbivores (through comparison with plant taxa known to have been consumed by moa). Results: Ground fern spores and Coprosma pollen exhibited increases in relative abundance at all three sites during the herbivore gap. Both occur frequently in moa coprolites and gizzard content, and so can be interpreted as possible responses to moa extinction. However, other changes in pollen assemblages at this time were inconsistent between sites, or could be better explained as being related to anthropogenic burning in the local region. Conclusions: New Zealand forest plant communities appear to have experienced only relatively minor changes during the herbivore gap. Our results contradict long-standing hypotheses that shrubs and ferns had flourished in New Zealand forest understoreys at this time, preventing podocarp regeneration. However, due to the relatively recent extinction of moa, and long life span of many forest trees, there may be an extinction debt where the long-term consequences of moa extinction are still to be fully realized. © 2016 International Association for Vegetation Science","Birds; Dinornithiformes; Extinction; Forests; Herbivores; New Zealand; Palaeoecology; Palynology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996599796

This reclamation can provide a novel opportunity to conserve northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We evaluated the influence of habitat management activities on nest survival, nest-site selection, and brood resource selection on managed and unmanaged units of a reclaimed surface mine, Peabody Wildlife Management Area (Peabody), in west-central Kentucky, USA, from 2010 to 2013. We compared resource selection, using discrete-choice analysis, and nest survival, using the nest survival model in Program MARK, between managed and unmanaged units of Peabody at 2 spatial scales: the composition and configuration of vegetation types (i.e., macrohabitat) and vegetation characteristics at nest sites and brood locations (i.e., microhabitat). On managed sites, we also investigated resource selection relative to a number of different treatments (e.g., herbicide, disking, prescribed fire). We found no evidence that nest-site selection was influenced by macrohabitat variables, but bobwhite selected nest sites in areas with greater litter depth than was available at random sites. On managed units, bobwhite were more likely to nest where herbicide was applied to reduce sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) compared with areas untreated with herbicide. Daily nest survival was not influenced by habitat characteristics or by habitat management but was influenced by nest age and the interaction of nest initiation date and nest age. Daily nest survival was greater for older nests occurring early in the breeding season (0.99, SE < 0.01) but was lower for older nests occurring later in the season (0.08, SE = 0.13). Brood resource selection was not influenced by macrohabitat or microhabitat variables we measured, but broods on managed units selected areas treated with herbicide to control sericea lespedeza and were located closer to firebreaks and disked native-warm season grass stands than would be expected at random. Our results suggest the vegetation at Peabody was sufficient without manipulation to support nesting and brood-rearing northern bobwhite at a low level, but habitat management practices improved vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing resource selection. Reproductive rates (e.g., nest survival and re-nesting rates) at Peabody were lower than reported in other studies, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies caused by the abundance of sericea lespedeza. On reclaimed mine lands dominated by sericea lespedeza, we suggest continuing practices such as disking and herbicide application that are targeted at reducing sericea lespedeza to improve the vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing bobwhite. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016","brood; Colinus virginianus; habitat management; Kentucky; nest survival; nest-site selection; northern bobwhite; reclaimed surface mine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995608176

Here, we use the functional trait structure of Amazonian forest bird assemblages to explore the impacts of land-cover change on two ecosystem processes: seed dispersal and insect predation. We show that trait structure in assemblages of frugivorous and insectivorous birds remained stable after primary forests were subjected to logging and fire events, but that further intensification of human land use substantially reduced the functional diversity and dispersion of traits, and resulted in communities that occupied a different region of trait space. These effects were only partially reversed in regenerating secondary forests. Our findings suggest that local extinctions caused by the loss and degradation of tropical forest are non-random with respect to functional traits, thus disrupting the network of trophic interactions regulating seed dispersal by forest birds and herbivory by insects, with important implications for the structure and resilience of human-modified tropical forests. Furthermore, our results illustrate how quantitative functional traits for specific guilds can provide a range of metrics for estimating the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem processes, and the response of such processes to land-cover change. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We quantified the effects of military training on vertebrates in a 5-year study at Beecroft Weapons Range in south-eastern Australia by contrasting the occurrence of birds, mammals and reptiles between 24 sites within an area subject to repeated weapons use and a matched set of non-impacted sites. Species richness of mammals and reptiles was similar within versus outside the impact area, although many individual species responded to fire, which occurred more frequently in impacted sites. Bird species richness, the occurrence of larger-bodied and migratory bird species, and the occurrence of most individual bird species, was reduced within the impact area. Many bird species that displayed low prevalence in impacted sites also declined over time across the whole study area. Differences in biota between the impact and non-impact areas were detectable after controlling for the effects of recent fire, suggesting that weapons use impacted vertebrates through mechanisms additional to altered fire regimes. Overall, our data indicated that Beecroft Weapons Range maintained considerable biodiversity value despite prolonged military use. Hence, MTAs have the potential to make a substantial contribution to conservation outside the formal protected area network. However, managers of MTAs need to explicitly state their environmental objectives. This is because management practices may be different if the aim is to maximize species richness rather than to secure populations of particular species. ï¿½ 2016","Birds; Fire; Mammals; Military training effects on biodiversity; Reptiles; South-Eastern Australia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006275007

Endogenous factors are directly related to density-dependent forces, whereas exogenous factors are environmental drivers (e.g. climate). Several studies have reported the effects of endogenous and exogenous factors using exponential population models in mammals, birds or insects, but few works have explored the effects on reptiles, specifically in tortoises. In this study, we developed logistic population growth models to decipher the role of these factors on the population dynamics of the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca. The role of environmental drivers in the distribution, movement, survival, reproduction or individual growth has been described for this species in previous works, but no studies have examined the effects of both endogenous and exogenous factors in population growth rates. Using long-term data of T. graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula (1999–2013), we fitted non-linear logistic models with endogenous and exogenous effects. The results showed that endogenous processes are important drivers of the population dynamics of this species, and that exogenous factors, such as freezing hours in winter, also directly affect the population growth rate. Intolerance of extreme winter temperatures may especially affect hatchlings and juvenile tortoises. Our models also showed that perturbations (i.e. a fire occurred during the monitoring period) have a lasting impact by reducing the carrying capacity of the population. This study shows that simple quantitative approaches based on population dynamic theory are useful for deciphering the ecological mechanisms underlying dynamics of tortoise populations. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London","climate; disturbance; endogenous; exogenous; non-linear logistic models; population density; temperature; Testudo graeca",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981333298

However, during the last glacial cycle, between ∼120 and 15 ka, unprecedented irreversible changes in flora and fauna occurred, and in that same interval modern humans established their first firm presence in the landscape. Disentangling the impacts of the first-order trend toward a colder, drier planet through the Late Quaternary from the impacts of human colonization has been challenging, from both the chronological and paleoenvironmental perspectives. We utilize the stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen preserved in near-continuous time series of Dromaius (emu) eggshell from five regions across Australia to provide independent reconstructions of ecosystem status and climate over the past 100 ka. Carbon isotopes are determined by the diet consumed by the female bird, whereas oxygen isotopes record the status of local moisture balance in the months prior to breeding. Together, δ13C and δ18O provide ecosystem status and climate from the same dated sample, reducing correlation uncertainties between proxies. Combined with recent improvements in the chronologies of Late Quaternary shorelines fringing inland lake basins and deflation during arid times, these data collectively reaffirm that Australia generally became increasingly, albeit irregularly, drier from the last interglaciation through to the last glacial maximum. Dromaius eggshell δ18O documents peak aridity between 30 and 15 ka, but shows no evidence of exceptional climate change between 60 and 40 ka. In contrast, Dromaius δ13Cdiet documents an irreversible loss of the majority of palatable summer-rainfall-related C4 grasses across the Australian arid zone between 50 and 45 ka, about the same time that the giant megafaunal bird, Genyornis, became extinct, and coincident with human dispersal across the continent. Our data indicate that changes unique to Australia occurred between 50 and 45 ka that led to a new climate-vegetation relationship and an overall reduction in effective moisture across much of the continent. The large summer-rainfall-dominated lakes of interior Australia failed to re-fill subsequently, despite a wide range of global climate states. A full explanation for the mechanisms behind these changes remains elusive, but they are almost certainly related to human agency. Plausible explanations include a change in fire regime resulting from human-lit fires, a change in fire regime following extinction of megafaunal browsers, and/or a threshold response to increasing aridity. Of these, the climate change explanation is least likely, given the lack of evidence for unprecedented aridity between 60 and 40 ka, and the successful adaptation of Australian ecosystems to 2.5 Ma of similar changes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Abrupt; Amino acid racemization; Arid zone; Australia; Ecosystem; Extinction; Paleoclimatology; Stable isotopes",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986328050

Its impacts on fauna can be both direct (e.g., mortality) and indirect (e.g., altered habitat), resulting in population recovery being driven by several possible mechanisms. Separating direct from indirect impacts of fire on faunal population recovery can be valuable in guiding management of biodiversity in fire-prone environments. However, resolving the influence of direct and indirect processes remains a key challenge because many processes affecting fauna can change concomitantly with time since fire. We explore the mechanisms influencing bird response to fire by posing the question, can temporal changes in vegetation structure predict changes in bird occurrence on sites, and can these be separated from other temporal changes using the surrogate of time since fire? We conducted a 12-yr study of bird and vegetation responses to fire at 124 sites across six vegetation classes in Booderee National Park, Australia. Approximately half of these sites, established in 2002, were burned by a large (>3000 ha) wildfire in 2003. To disentangle collinear effects of temporal changes in vegetation and direct demographic effects on population recovery that are subsumed by time since fire, we incorporated both longitudinal and cross-sectional vegetation effects in addition to time since fire within logistic structural equation models. We identified temporal changes in vegetation structure and richness of plant and bird species that characterized burned and unburned sites in all vegetation classes. For nine bird species, a significant component of the year trend was driven by temporal trends in one of three vegetation variables (number of understory or midstory plant species, or midstory cover). By contrast, we could not separate temporal effects between time since fire and vegetation attributes for bird species richness, reporting rate, and the occurrence of 11 other bird species. Our findings help identify species for which indirect effects of vegetation dominate recovery and thus may benefit from vegetation management where conservation actions are required and, conversely, those species for which direct effects of time since fire drive recovery, where simply leaving a system to recover following the last disturbance will be sufficient. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Biodiversity conservation; Disaggregation; Moderated-mediation analysis; Multiple regression; Occurrence; Vegetation; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988864217

It is becoming increasingly popular in both domestic and foreign consumers and has realized its health benefits to people. But Penaeus vannamei is a kind of product with seasonal characteristics for harvest and has short storage period due to the vulnerability to infection by the microbes and spoilages during storage. As a result, we may suffer a great loss in the end. So the drying of Penaeus vannamei is becoming an important processing. The drying of Penaeus vannamei is mainly the traditional natural drying at present. It has many disadvantages: products being spoilt due to wind, rain, and dust, great loss due to animals and birds, and deterioration due to decomposition by fungi and insect. Further, the process will spend much time, need a lot of labors and occupy a large area for spreading the produce out to dry. So the natural drying under the open sky can not guarantee the quality of final products. It is difficult to meet the needs of industrial production. The drying using coal-fire needs a lot of energy consumption and causes heavy pollution during the drying process. Whatever, the artificial mechanical drying such as vacuum freeze-drying and hot-air drying is energy intensive and expensive, and it will ultimately increase the product cost. Solar drying system can process Penaeus vannamei in clean and sanitary conditions. It takes little time and energy, occupies fewer areas and improves product quality. Solar drying is efficient and can protect the environment. To reduce the Penaeus vannamei drying energy consumption and improve the drying quality, the effects of solar drying temperature, drying capacity and airflow rate on the drying process were investigated in the laboratory. The results showed that the increase of the drying temperature and airflow rate and the reduction of the drying capacity could improve the drying rate and shorten the drying time. In the later stage of drying, the effect of drying parameters on water activity was significant. Different drying temperature had significant effect on the texture of Penaeus vannamei after rehydration. The change of color was not so obvious with different drying parameters but had a big difference with raw Penaeus vannamei. The 3 drying parameters had significant effect on dry shrinkage and rehydration ratio. With the increase of temperature and airflow rate, the energy consumption had a significant increase. Increasing the drying capacity could improve the utilization of the energy consumption. The drying time also had much relationship with the energy consumption. Through laboratory experiment, the drying temperature was 45-55℃, airflow rate was 6-8 m/s, and drying capacity was 3-4 kg. And the relationships between the drying temperature, drying capacity and airflow rate and energy consumption were analyzed through the response surface method. The quadratic regression models were established. The optimal parameters were as follows: solar drying temperature of 53.40℃, airflow rate of 7.43 m/s, and drying capacity of 3.65 kg. Based on the laboratory test, the pilot scale test of solar drying of Penaeus vannamei was carried out. It have dried 100 kg Penaeus vannamei (69.5 kg after Salt solution pre-cooking), got 38.16 kg final product and took 4.5 hours. The total energy consumption of solar drying was 549827.05 kJ, including effective use of solar energy 379619.05 kJ and the electric power 47.28 kW·h. The energy consumption was 0.68 kW·h/kg.Compared with electric heating drying,it could save 1.51 kW·h/kg energy consumption. Compared with coal drying, it could make 0.75 kg/kg CO2 emission reduction. The results will provide the basis for the industrial production of Penaeus vannamei solar drying. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Currently, several federal laws protect eagles and other migratory birds, meaning that utility companies may be liable for electrocution-related deaths. Veterinarians and veterinary pathologists called upon to diagnose and treat electrocuted birds should keep this in mind when conducting clinical and postmortem examinations. This review details necropsy findings and methods used to diagnose electrocution. A combination of gross, subgross, and radiographic examinations can aid in identification of subtle injury. Diagnosis is made based on the presence of skin and/or feather burns. Other necropsy findings may include skin lacerations, subcutaneous burns, bruising, limb avulsion, hemopericardium, and vascular rupture. At the US Fish and Wildlife Service’s National Forensics Laboratory, from 2000 to 2015, 417 raptor deaths were determined to have been caused by electrocution. Bald eagles and golden eagles were the most commonly submitted species. In a retrospective review of 377 cases, for which whole bodies were submitted, 18% of the electrocuted birds had only a single, small (less than 3 cm in diameter) external burn. Small, isolated burns tended to occur on the undersides of the wings at and distal to the elbow and on the lower legs and feet. These areas should be most carefully examined in cases where electrocution injury is not immediately apparent. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","bald eagle; electric injuries; forensic necropsy; golden eagle; hawk; owl; power lines; raptors; wildlife forensic pathology",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983336735

In particular, these grasslands serve as biodiversity repositories for a myriad of imperilled animal species. One such group is grassland birds, which have experienced significant declines, predominantly caused by extensive loss and degradation of native grasslands. Rangeland management that promotes increasing and sustaining livestock production through reducing the inherent, disturbance-driven variability that historically occurred in grasslands is considered a major contributing factor to these declines. An alternative approach to this homogeneous management paradigm attempts to restore a shifting mosaic of disturbance patches across the landscape through the spatial and temporal interactions of fire and grazing (i.e. pyric herbivory). Application of pyric herbivory through patch-burn grazing increases overall habitat heterogeneity, likely a critically important factor in maintaining and enhancing grassland bird populations. We compared reproductive rates and estimates of fecundity of three grassland birds nesting in grasslands maintained by traditional and patch-burn grazing management paradigms in the Southern Great Plains of North America. Additionally, we used a sensitivity analysis approach to assess population stability (i.e. λ = 1) and source–sink population dynamics under the two management practices. Nest survival for dickcissels Spiza americana and grasshopper sparrows Ammodramus savannarum was higher in patch-burned grasslands than in traditionally managed grasslands, while nest survival for eastern meadowlarks Sturnella magna was higher in traditionally managed grasslands than in patch-burned grasslands. Dickcissels and grasshopper sparrows responded positively to patch burning with source habitats occurring over a wider range of survival rates under patch burning than traditional management, while no clear pattern emerged in source–sink dynamics of eastern meadowlarks. Synthesis and applications. Management strategies such as patch-burn grazing offer opportunities to restore landscape heterogeneity to benefit bird communities while maintaining livestock production goals. Applying patch-burn grazing to rangelands can increase productivity of grassland birds and could be effective for reversing the decline of grassland birds by providing source habitats more consistently than traditional rangeland management. Our results emphasize the utility of using sensitivity analyses to determine source–sink population dynamics when evaluating management practices. However, land managers should consider that source–sink models have shortcomings and designation of a habitat as a sink does not necessarily mean the habitat has low conservation value. © 2016 The Authors.

Trimmings around this channel, which are sometimes fed to dogs, may contain lead particles. The aim of this study was to assess potential health effects of feeding dogs such trimmings. Results: Lead ingestion most commonly causes gastrointestinal and neurological clinical signs, although renal, skeletal, haematological, cardiovascular and biochemical effects have also been reported. Experimental data indicate that a daily dose of around 1 mg lead as lead acetate/kg body weight for ten days may be considered as a Lowest Observed Effect Level in dogs. Acute toxicity documentation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates 300 mg/kg body weight as the lowest dose of lead acetate causing death in dogs after oral ingestion. Our assessment suggests that dogs fed trimmings of lead-shot game may be affected by the amounts of lead present, and that even deadly exposure could occasionally occur. The intestinal absorption of lead from bullets was assumed to be 10-80 % of that of lead acetate, reflecting both the variability in particle size and uncertainty about the bioavailability of metallic lead in dogs. Conclusions: Despite data gaps, this study indicates that feeding dogs trimmings of lead-shot game may represent a risk of lead intoxication. More research is needed to assess the exact consequences, if lead-based bullets are still to be used. Meanwhile, we recommend that trimmings close to the wound channel should be made inaccessible to dogs, as well as to other domestic or wild animals. © 2016 The Author(s).","Ammunition; Dogs; Hunting; Lead toxicity; Review",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979239851

These are important not only intrinsically, but also for ecological functioning and as flagships for South Africa's economically valuable avitourism sector. Little is known about population sizes or realised distribution ranges of these six species, but projected range modelling based on occurrence from the South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP) has suggested these species are vulnerable to climate change. We estimate global population sizes for these six endemics based on densities calculated from two intensive biome-wide point count surveys in 2012. We modelled regions of suitable climatic space, from which we established that mean annual temperature and the temperature of the warmest quarter of the year appear to limit Cape Rock-jumper Chaetops frenatus and Protea Canary Serinus leucopterus ranges. Both species have seen an apparent > 30% decrease in range and reporting rates (a proxy for abundance) in the twenty years between SABAP atlas periods (1987-1991 and 2007-ongoing). The Cape Rock-jumper result is unexpected: encounter rates are higher in shorter vegetation, dry slopes and habitats with more recent occurrence of fire-all proxies for proximate causes of climate change on the Fynbos. Although coastal plains are highly transformed, mountain Fynbos is the best protected of all the world's Mediterranean-climate habitats, with relatively little anthropogenic land transformation. Long term weather datasets from the Fynbos demonstrate significant warming since 1960. We conclude from these lines of evidence that these decreases are consistent with the loss of suitable climate space and inability of these species to adjust physiologically to increasing temperatures. © 2015 BirdLife International.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960298080

We characterized the community structure and niche characteristics (niche position, marginality, breadth) of upland and lowland boreal birds at scales relevant to both natural and human disturbance patterns in western boreal forests undergoing rapid and extensive multi-sector resource development. Our goal was to identify the degree of ecological specialization in order to inform activities directed at conserving a diversity of species (e.g. specialists and generalists) within the western boreal bird community. We used avian data (>5,220 point counts) and environmental variable data comprised of forest composition, stand, and landscape pattern metrics at local (7.1. ha), landscape (1,963. ha), and regional (11,310. ha) scales to determine boreal bird distribution and community-level associations using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis. OMI analysis explained a high proportion of variance in the dataset (71.8%) and separated boreal birds along two axes associated with moisture-productivity and age-structural complexity gradients. Niche position was influenced by local scale variables (height, age, area of mature-old forest, area of wet soil types), but also landscape and regional scale variables (total area of hardwood and conifer, mean nearest neighbour distance of conifer, and total core area of productive upland conifer). Only 15 of 67 species (22%) had marginal (atypical) niches and narrow niche breadths exhibiting specialization in old hardwood and white spruce forests and burned, open, and lowland habitats.

Not only does this strategy depart from dormant season to growing season prescriptions, but the strategy also moves from stand-scale to landscape-scale implementation (>1,000 ha). This being so, agencies are making considerable commitments in terms of time and resources to this management strategy, but the effects on wildlife in upland forests, especially those dominated by hardwood canopy species, are relatively unknown. We initiated our study to assess whether this management strategy affects eastern wild Turkey reproductive ecology on the Ozark-St. Francis National Forest. We marked 67 wild Turkey hens with Global Positioning System (GPS) Platform Transmitting Terminals in 2012 and 2013 to document exposure to prescribed fire, and estimate daily nest survival, nest success, and nest-site selection. We estimated these reproductive parameters in forest units managed with prescribed fire (treated) and units absent of prescribed fire (untreated). Of 60 initial nest attempts monitored, none were destroyed or exposed to prescribed fire because a majority of fires occurred early than a majority of the nesting activity. We found nest success was greater in untreated units than treated units (36.4% versus 14.6%). We did not find any habitat characteristic differences between successful and unsuccessful nest-sites. We found that nest-site selection criteria differed between treated and untreated units. Visual concealment and woody ground cover were common selection criteria in both treated and untreated units. However, in treated units wild Turkey selected nest-sites with fewer small shrubs (<5 cm ground diameter) and large trees (>20cm DBH) but not in untreated units. In untreated units wild Turkey selected nest-sites with more large shrubs (>5cm ground diameter) but did not select for small shrubs or large trees. Our findings suggest that wild Turkey have not benefited from the reintroduction of prescribed fire to the WRERA. © Pittman 2016 et al.

They have a wide range of industrial and consumer applications such as stain, paints, hydraulic fluids, firefighting foams, production of fluoropolimers, cosmetics, insecticide formulations, textile treatments, surface coatings for carpets and furniture, cookware and water- and oil- resistant coatings for food contact materials. PFCs are extremely resistant towards thermal, chemical and biological degradation processes. There is now no evidence for their degradability and they decompose only at very high temperatures using a specially prepared furnaces. PFCs tend to accumulate in food chain and animal and human target organs. They have been detected globally as pollutants in water, plants, sediments, foodstuffs, and in animals such as fish, birds, mammals, as well as in human breast milk and blood. Currently, human are on the increased risk as PFCs are resistant to hydrolysis, photolysis, microbial degradation or metabolism. The two most frequently studied PFCs are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), generally considered as reference substances. Their estimated elimination half-life is about 3.8 years for PFOA and 5.4 years for PFOS. It is fully justified, because all of the perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluorine (POSF)-based compounds biologically break down or become metabolised to PFOS. PFOA, in addition to its production and use as a surfactant, is also formed as a degradation product of several fluoropolymers and fluorotelomer alcohol. There is currently no legislation for perfluorinated organic substances such as PFOA and PFOS in food or feed within the EU. There is a number of pathways by which PFCs contamination of humans can take place including diet, food contact materials, non-food personal items, and indoor and outdoor air pollution. Perfluorinated compounds bind to serum albumin and other cytosolic proteins and accumulate mainly in liver and kidney. An important number of studies show that PFCs cause a wide range of negative effects, including hepatic diseases, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. An in vitro and in vivo studies have started to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which PFOA and PFOS exert their adverse effects. However, the specific mechanisms related to these adverse effects is far from being clear.

The vast areas of logged tropical forest are often vulnerable to relogging, clear-felling, burning or conversion to plantations, despite evidence that logged forests retain a large proportion of tropical forest species at high abundances compared with alternate land uses. However, the demographic processes (e.g. survival, fecundity) that drive community or species properties (e.g. occurrence, density) in response to logging have never been examined. We used a novel capture-recapture-based sampling design to separate in situ reproduction from immigration-fuelled recruitment to investigate the demographic vital rates of six forest-dependent understorey insectivorous bird species along a logging continuum in the Eastern Himalaya Global Biodiversity Hotspot. We expected a positive relationship between forest intactness and reproductive rates, and that intact patches would contribute 'excess' individuals to logged patches from natal dispersal. Contrary to our expectations, we found: (i) a positive relationship between logging intensity and reproduction, and (ii) evidence of natal dispersal from more logged to less logged and intact forest patches. Our results indicate that for certain forest-dependent species in particular contexts, selectively logged habitats can have surprising and hitherto unrecognized demographic value that might be superior even to primary forest. Synthesis and applications. In most tropical settings, logged forests can not only support a greater subset of forest biodiversity than other forms of land use (for instance, agriculture), but can also play an important role in supporting populations of certain forest-dependent species. The ongoing conversion of large swathes of logged forest to non-forest habitat (such as oil palm plantation) because of their perceived lack of importance for biodiversity is a cause for serious concern for the conservation of tropical biodiversity.

We collected data for 93 nests over two breeding seasons (2012-2014). We assessed how some covariates influence the daily survival rates and affect nest survival, building models in Program MARK. Breeding begins in early October, peaks in late November, and continues until early March, lasting approximately 150 days. The mean size of breeding territories was 1.1 ha, and territories located in burned areas were smaller than those in unburned areas. Only the females build the small open-cup nests, in clumps of grass (mainly composed of Andropogon lateralis, Schizachyrium tenerum and Sorghastrum setosum) at 36.2 cm above the ground. The clutch size is three (67%) or two eggs (n = 52), and laying occurs on consecutive days. Incubation is performed by the female and lasts 13.7 days. The mean period of on-bouts was 73.5 min and the mean period of off-bouts was 39 mins. The hatching is synchronized and the hatching rate was 94%. In most nests, both the female and male fed the nestlings (biparental care). The frequency of visits/hr to feed the young did not differ with nestling age, but the length of visits was longer when the nestlings were younger. Nestlings fledged after 9-12 days. The apparent success was 42%, with 39% and 35% breeding success when calculated with the Mayfield estimate and the MARK software program, respectively. Predation was the main cause of failure, affecting 76% of the unsuccessful nests. The best models included time-specific factors (nest age and year) and nest-site features (nest height and habitat) influencing nest survival. Daily survival rates decreased through the nest cycle, and were much lower in the nestling stage. The re-nesting interval after nest failure was 2.7 days, and the mean distance between consecutive nesting attempts was 104.2 m. Up to four attempts (n = 5) by the same female were observed in the same breeding season. Although little published information is available for this species, the basic reproductive features are very similar to those found in a population in Argentina. In Brazil, the breeding season is slightly shorter, and clutches of two eggs are more common. © 2015 The Wilson Ornithological Society.","nest survival; parental care; predation; Program MARK; territoriality",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943162124

Sampling across broad temporal and spatial scales, we found that western bluebirds, the more competitive species, bias the birth order of offspring by sex in a way that influences offspring aggression and dispersal, setting the stage for rapid increases in population density that ultimately result in the replacement of their sister species.

Habitat for shrubland birds is typically dynamic, in which available habitat changes temporally and spatially in response to disturbance and succession. Despite widespread concerns among conservationists about shrubland birds, much is still poorly understood regarding fundamental demographic processes associated with the persistence of species in dynamic landscapes, such as the age of colonists, their success upon establishment, the fate of birds displaced by disturbance, and the effect of displaced birds on neighboring territories. To address these knowledge gaps, we studied prairie warblers (. Setophaga discolor) between 2008 and 2012 in a pitch pine-scrub oak (. Pinus rigida-. Quercus ilicifolia) barren consisting of newly created, maturing, and disturbed habitat patches. We found that newly created habitat patches were colonized primarily by younger, second-year males, whereas slightly older shrubland habitat was occupied by site-faithful older birds. Second-year males arrived later on the breeding grounds and had slightly lower pairing success compared to older males; however, they had similar reproductive output as older males. Based on mark-resight analyses, we calculated that 72% of adult males and 14% of banded nestlings returned to the study site in a following year. When territories were subject to high-intensity mowing, fire, or selective herbicide during the non-breeding season, only 14% of the males that returned to the study site stayed on their territories the following year. These returning males that acquired a territory within the study area had similar reproductive success to other birds in the study area and did not negatively affect the pairing or reproductive success of birds occupying adjacent areas. Disturbed territories made up a relatively small portion of the suitable habitat in the study area and disturbance affected a low number of territorial males in any given year. Overall, we found that the short-term effects of shrubland management and habitat disturbance on birds are minimal and subsequently allow young birds to colonize and breed. Moreover, the long-term effects of management are beneficial by maintaining ephemeral shrubland habitat for immigrating and site-faithful birds. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Early-successional; Management; Pitch pine-scrub oak; Prairie warbler; Reproductive success; Site fidelity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910065981

When food resources provided by the parents are insufficient to rear a whole litter successfully, dominants may kill their subordinate siblings, either directly by physical damage, or indirectly through enforced starvation. This phenomenon is termed ""facultative siblicide"" and occurs in a wide range of bird species and at least one mammalian species. In contrast, when the lowest ranking sibling is routinely killed by its dominant brood mate or littermate this is called ""obligate siblicide"", and seems to affect in particular large, long-lived species characterized by intense competition for breeding sites. This ""obligate siblicide"" has intrigued researchers for decades, trying to find an evolutionarily satisfactory explanation for this extreme behaviour. We review all scientific literature concerning sibling aggression published in the last 66 years. A bibliography search resulted in 104 references during the last 66 years, where birds represented 88% of the total published papers. Eleven hypotheses have been formulated for explaining these results, finding that siblicide is a complicated behaviour not controlled only for parents or chicks or environmental changes, but for a whole range of factors. These hypotheses have been identified and discussed according to actual supporting data. The relationship between food resources and brood reduction was widely documented; a sustained increase in food availability led to a highly significant decrease in both frequency and intensity of aggressiveness of the older chick towards its younger sibling in facultative species, also finding similar results in obligate siblicidal species. These results would suggest siblicide is an adaptive behaviour. This review tends to show that there is probably more than a single cause behind this behaviour. We conclude that more aspects must be considered in the design of future studies in order to understand the potential evolutionary sense of aggressive behaviour among siblings, especially those concerning food allocation decisions by parents. © 2014 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.","brood reduction; evolutionary hypotheses; facultative siblicide; hatchling asynchrony; obligate siblicide; resource allocation; siblicide",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918835360

Past studies have focused on nest site selection and survival but information is needed on factors influencing their space use when away from the nest. We examined space use by white-headed woodpeckers during the nesting (May-Jul) and post-nesting (Jul-Oct) periods and compared the role of environmental factors (e.g., landcover) and socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, breeding success) in home range size and selection of location. Average size of 99% kernel home ranges was 125 ha (SD ± 59 ha; n = 19) in the nesting period and 137 ha (SD ± 70 ha; n = 30) in the post-nesting period. Minimum convex polygons were generally comparable to or smaller than ranges reported from previous radio-telemetry studies with this species. Although bird weight and age best explained variation in home range size compared to other factors, neither parameter estimate was significant in our models. Thus, even though weight and age were the most-supported factors in our analysis, home range size was largely influenced by factors that we did not measure. We found that most woodpeckers selected home ranges within forest patches that had undergone a recent disturbance; these areas included forests that had recently been burned with prescribed fire by the United States Forest Service (82%) or subject to disease (16%). Most burned patches in our study were small (approx. 4.8 ha) and occurred within otherwise live forest but had nearly complete mortality of adult trees. We suggest that recent forest disturbances, especially mixed-severity prescribed burns, may have been selected by white-headed woodpeckers because they created snags for nesting and future studies should explore this hypothesis.

A total number of 720 Ross 308 broiler chicks that were 1 d old were reared up to 49 d of age. Corn- and soybean meal (SBM)-based starter and grower diets were supplemented with 0, 1.5, and 2 g/kg Aromabiotic and provided to the birds ad libitum. Inclusion of 2 g/kg Aromabiotic in the diet significantly improved weight gain of the birds during 1 to 21 d of age compared with control birds (P < 0.001). A significant reduction in mortality (P = 0.004) and a significant increase in European performance efficiency index (EPEI; P = 0.036) were noted in the birds that received diets containing 2 g/kg Aromabiotic compared with control birds at 49 d of age. The birds grown in a placement density of 18 birds/m2 had significantly improved FCR along with reduced feed intake (FI) during 1 to 49 d of age compared with those reared in a density of 14 birds/m2. The mean EPEI was significantly greater in the birds raised in a density of 16 birds/m2 (P < 0.001). At 48 d of age, litter caking was significantly increased in the birds raised in a density of 18 birds/m2 and decreased in the birds that received dietary supplementation of Aromabiotic (P < 0.05). The influence of dietary Aromabiotic was significant related to reduced incidence and severity of footpad lesions and hock burns (P < 0.01). Frequency of lesions with a score of 2 to 5 on footpad and hock significantly increased for the birds raised in densities higher than 14 birds/m2. It was concluded that dietary supplementation of 2 g/kg Aromabiotic improved early productive performance of broiler chickens and enhanced the PEI mainly due to decreased mortality. Dietary Aromabiotic improved broiler welfare as indicated by reduced foot defects in the birds raised in placement densities of 16 and 18 birds/m2. © 2015 Poultry Science Association, Inc.","Broiler chicken; Carcass defects; Heat stress; Medium-chain fatty acids; Performance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941882477

The droughts, forest fires, winter frosts become more frequent that affects the abundance and diversity of animals, including commercial species and crop pests. The deviation of timing of the phases of ontogeny from multiyear is a sensitive indicator of the state and the processes of ecosystems. In order to identify the features of the biota response to extreme weather conditions we studied the reaction of animals of the East Russian Plain (Kirov Region) to weather anomalies of cold winter in 2009-2010 and the hot summer of 2010 according to phenological (1890-2013 years) and phytosanitary (2000-2013 years) monitoring of 52 species Clitellata, Bivalvia, Gastropoda, Insecta, Aves, Mammalia. The observations were carried out on the territory of the boreal ecotone with different changes of hydrothermal regime within Vyatsko-Verkhnekamsk District of the Volga Region. The phenological monitoring carried out by a standard technique involving public opinion poll from permanent correspondents. We analyzed the date of the seasonal phases of development: the end of winter diapause, the beginning of oviposition, hatching of eggs, the emergence of the imago insects; spring arrival, the beginning of the breeding cycle, autumn departure of birds and others. In 2010 the survey of additional information on phenology of biological objects was conducted by method of questioning of permanent observers in 23 geographical locations of the Kirov Region. We examined the impact of agro-climatic conditions for the development of pests within permanent control areas of Kumenskii Hospital District Department of the Federal Phytosanitary Service during the active vegetation. Long frosts below -35 °C were pessimal and sublethal for different stages of ontogenesis in Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Aelia acuminata, Agrotis segetum, Oscinnella frit and others. Extreme summer heat above 30 °C and drought were pessimal for Phyllotreta vittula, Leptinotarsa decemlineata and sub-lethal for eggs and larvae of Oscinnella frit, Aelia acuminata, Elateridae, but contributed to the early emergence of Apion apricans adults. Exceeding monthly average air temperature at the 1 °C resulted in advancing the timing of microthermal insects development by 1.9 days and advancing the arrival dates of near migrant birds by 1 day in April, and in advancing the timing of mesothermal insects development by 1.3 days and advancing the arrival dates of distant migrant birds by 1.4 day in May. The 100 °C excess of the effective temperature in May led to emergence of Oscinnella frit, Leptino-tarsa decemlineata, Pieris brassicae adults 2.9-3.8 days ahead of due time. In June it resulted in larvae emerging 2.7-4.8 days ahead of due time, and in July their adult summer generation occurred 1.6-1.7 days earlier. Negative impact of pests on crops in abnormal seasons can be reduced by spring crops sowing in early summer, while winter rye should optimally be sowed in later date. In the conditions of mid-latitude of Eastern European Plain the temperatures below -40 °C in winter and long heat up to 40 °C with a summer drought are within the adaptive capacities of the regional biota. Their influence does not cause irreversible consequences in the functioning of wildlife, particularly animals, including pests.","Animals; Climatic anomalies; Phenological events; The Russian Plain",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943775119

Although snag availability is believed to limit populations in managed and non-managed forests, little data are available to evaluate the relative effect of stand conditions and management on snag occurrence.We analyzed point sample data from an intensive forest inventory within an 80,000. ha landscape for four major forest types to support the hypotheses that routine low-intensity prescribed fire would increase, and thinning would decrease, snag occurrence.We employed path analysis to define a priori causal relationships to determine the direct and indirect effects of site quality, age, relative stand density index and fire for all forest types and thinning effects for loblolly pine and longleaf pine.Stand age was an important direct effect for loblolly pine, mixed pine-hardwoods and hardwoods, but not for longleaf pine.Snag occurrence in loblolly pine was increased by prescribed fire and decreased by thinning which confirmed our initial hypotheses.Although fire was not important in mixed pine-hardwoods, it was for hardwoods but the relationship depended on site quality.For longleaf pine the relative stand density index was the dominant variable affecting snag occurrence, which increased as the density index decreased.Site quality, age and thinning had significant indirect effects on snag occurrence in longleaf pine through their effects on the density index.Although age is an important condition affecting snag occurrence for most forest types, path analysis revealed that fire and density management practices within certain forest types can also have major beneficial effects, particularly in stands less than 60. years old. © 2014.","Cavity-nesting species; Forest management; Silviculture; Southeastern United States; Wildlife habitat",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906737768

These two shrubs occur in tropical and subtropical dry forests, including forests that have been subjected to recent disturbance. Despite their importance to the endangered warbler, the disturbance ecology of these shrubs is poorly understood. We sought to determine, based on functional characteristics of the plants, whether their presence is favored by a particular type or regime of disturbance. Methods We used data from field experiments (seed broadcasting and shrub cutting) conducted on the island of Eleuthera, The Bahamas to determine mechanisms of and conditions favoring establishment and persistence ('vital attributes') of E. fruticosa and L. involucrata, which enabled categorization according to the plant functional types defined by Noble and Slatyer (1980). We then compared hypothesized distributions of these plant functional types among different anthropogenic disturbance regimes to observed distributions of E. fruticosa and L. involucrata in order to identify disturbance regimes most likely to produce habitat used by Kirtland's Warblers. Important Findings E. fruticosa and L. involucrata were functionally categorized as widely dispersed but largely shade intolerant species capable of establishing or regenerating individuals after disturbance via both seeds and vegetative mechanisms. Both hypothesized and observed distribution patterns indicated the shrubs were favored by a regime of frequent disturbance producing open canopy and ground layers. Among the anthropogenic disturbances we examined, areas of large-scale land clearing combined with subsequent goat grazing most often supported E. fruticosa and L. involucrata, while the shrubs were relatively rare in burned areas. Utilizing the plant functional type framework in combination with field data to evaluate predictions of species occurrence among different disturbances regimes provides a strong theoretical basis for conservation strategies. Understanding which disturbance types favor a habitat of concern and the mechanisms by which they do so can aid the prioritization of areas for protection or the design of habitat management protocols. © 2015 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Botanical Society of China 2015.","Anthropogenic disturbance; Black torch; Plant functional type; Vital attributes; Wild sage",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950104222

This has caused many scientists to identify the conservation of early-successional species as a high priority. In this synthesis, we discuss the conservation implications of this loss of early-successional habitats using examples from the literature on songbirds. Early-successional ""shrubland"" bird species require conditions and resources present in recently disturbed sites. These conditions are ephemeral and change rapidly over time as sites become dominated by later-seral species. Historical disturbance regimes such as wind-throw, fire and flooding have been altered or suppressed in eastern forests through human activity such as conversion of forests to younger aged stands more resistant to wind, fire suppression and mesophication of fire-adapted communities, and suppression of beaver activity and flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic disturbance has shifted over much of the region to types of land use that provide less shrubland habitat of lower quality than historically. Despite scientific evidence in support of this concern, there is still misunderstanding about the role of disturbance in maintaining biodiversity, and public opposition to management remains a challenge to conserving these communities. Contemporary approaches use natural disturbance regimes to inform management practices that employ historical agents where possible or surrogates when necessary to achieve desired future conditions defined on the basis of regional population or community status. Conservation of early-successional communities occurs within the context of other potentially conflicting ecological values, such as the conservation and enhancement of biologically mature forest. Recent findings, however, show shrubland habitat can augment diversity in forested landscapes by providing seasonal resources for mature-forest species, such as food or predator-free space for juvenile forest songbirds that seek out early-successional habitats during the transition to independence. Balancing the conservation of early-successional shrubland species with other, sometimes conflicting values is an active area of current conservation research. In some cases the conservation of shrubland birds can be coordinated with commercial activities like silviculture or maintenance of infrastructure (e.g. powerline corridors), although our work indicates that deliberate efforts expressly directed at conservation of early-successional shrubland species are more effective. © 2014.","Bird; Conservation; Habitat; Management; Shrubland; Succession",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902086399

Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are emblematic of the role these disturbances play in creating wildlife habitat, since they are strongly associated with recently-killed forests. However, management practices aimed at reducing the economic impact of natural disturbances can result in habitat loss for this species. Although black-backed woodpeckers occupy habitats created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and mountain pine beetle infestations. Our finding that population growth rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the landscape.

Nest-sites are generally selected to reduce the risk of nest predation. In this study we provide information on the reproductive biology of Siamese fireback (Lophura diardi) at Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve, Thailand and identify habitat characteristics that influence nest site selection. At this site the species is found both in pristine and disturbed habitats. During a three year period (2010-2012), we found 21 nest-sites. Egg laying occurred from April to early August and the average clutch size was 6.4 ± 0.3 SE eggs (range four-eight). Incubation lasted 23-24 days and daily nest survival was estimated at 0.90 ± 0.02 SE (95% CI = 0.85-0.94), giving an estimated overall nest success of 0.08 ± 0.04 SE. Predation was the main cause of nest failure. Siamese fireback appeared to prefer to site nests between the buttresses of large trees (62.5%), which presumably have the potential to serve as shelter from potential predators. Analyses indicated that Siamese fireback significantly preferred to place nests in an area associated with dense vegetation coverage below 0.5 m, on steeper slopes, large basal areas of trees DBH >10 cm and with low potential predation pressure.

Less universal have been the declines caused by post-colonial changes in fire regime after 40000 years of Indigenous fire management. Climate change and a disengagement by Australians from nature loom as threats for the future. However, Australia is a country of climatic extremes and many birds are well-adapted to stressful conditions. Given adequate investment, all the major classes of threat have potential solutions, with particular success in recent decades in the removal of feral predators from islands and in reducing the by-catch from fishing. The biggest threat of all is possibly a failure to invest in conservation as modern lifestyles take people further and further away from the natural environment. Introduction Australia’s birds are, like those in so much of the world, travelling poorly. Of the 1239 species and subspecies regularly occurring in Australia, 17% are Threatened or Near Threatened on the basis of the IUCN Red List Criteria (Garnett et al. 2011). This number has been increasing steadily (Szabo et al. 2012a) and, while originally it was taxa of Australia’s oceanic islands that were most likely to be threatened, taxa from the mainland are now starting to slip away (Szabo et al. 2012b). Sadly some of those most threatened are the most distinctive; birds at the end of long slender branches of the evolutionary tree whose closest relatives are long gone. Other species, however, are thriving under the conditions that have arisen over the past few centuries of intense development. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953735630

Objectives: Our goal was to investigate the effects of rangeland management on resource selection and nest survival of upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda). Methods: We conducted our project at Konza Prairie, a Long-Term Ecological Research site. The station has 60 experimental units with replicated grazing and fire treatments that create a heterogeneous landscape of different habitat patches. We radio-tracked sandpipers for two breeding seasons (2003–2004, n = 37 birds) and monitored sandpiper nests for eight seasons (2001–2008, n = 246 nests). We used resource utilization functions to examine resource selection with respect to five landscape features. Results: Home ranges of sandpipers were large in contiguous prairie (Formula presented.) and explain area-sensitive occurrence in fragmented prairie. Upland sandpipers selected grazed and burned sites with short vegetation within their home range. In contrast, nest site selection was influenced by fire frequency and birds selected infrequently burned sites with greater vegetative structure. Settlement decisions affected fitness because nest survival was low in burned and grazed sites (0.068), but higher in unburned and ungrazed sites (0.201–0.247). Conclusions: Our results raise concerns for conservation because private rangelands managed for livestock production are often homogeneous landscapes with heavy grazing and frequent fires. Rotational grazing and fire could be used to restore heterogeneity to grasslands but the duration of rotation, patch size, and optimal configuration require further investigation. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bartramia longicauda; Fire; Grassland; Habitat selection; Home range; Landscape heterogeneity; Nest survival; Radio-telemetry; Resource utilization functions; Tallgrass prairie",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925510226

The second objective was to survey the types of soils present and understand the processes involved. We found the water velocity at Tram Chim was close to zero. The pH values at Tram Chim indicate that water levels at unit A4 have kept too dry for too long, causing acid soils to oxidize, creating acid water when the wet season occurs.

The Siju Cave of Meghalaya, also known as cave of the bat, is among the longest caves on the Indian subcontinent. The palynological study of fifty bat-guano samples from Siju Cave and of thirty surface soil and moss cushion from the area immediate surrounding the cave reflects the close similarity between the modern pollen and vegetation in the region in the two areas sampled. The resulting palynodata comprise mainly the native flora, dominated by riparian taxa like Duabanga, Syzygium, Careya, and Ficus, along with evergreen and deciduous elements in the region. The evergreen taxa Mesua, Elaeocarpus, and Garcinia, along with Impatiens, reflect the high precipitation in the region. The climate of the region and the vegetation are strongly influenced by the Simsang River, and the heavy rainfall results in the dominance of riparian taxa and other high-rainfall indicator taxa. The occurrence of pollen from Nepenthes khasiana, an endemic and endangered plant of Meghalaya, in bat guano is significant and may be due to its insectivorous and entomophilous nature. However, medicinal plants like Swertia chirata, Cinchona, and Rauvolfia are not encountered in the bat-guano sediments, despite their luxuriant growth around the cave, and these species could be avoided by the insects due to their alkaloid contain and bitter taste. The presence of highland taxa such as Pinus, Abies, Picea, and Larix in the bat guano deposit is significant and suggestive of high winds from higher altitudes, or the pollen may be introduced by the return of migratory Siberian birds during winter to the nearby Siju wildlife and bird sanctuary. The recovery of cerealia along with Areca catechu and Citrus pollen indicate the human activity in the region. The abundance of fungal remains, namely Meliola, Glomus, and Microthyriaceae along with degraded palynomorphs are suggestive of strong microbial activity under warm and humid conditions during sedimentation in the region. The main objective of this study is to identify the potential of bat guano for palaeoecological research and as supportive data for surface and sedimentary soil profiles in the South Garo Hills of Meghalaya. The palynodata from the bat guano of the Siju Cave provides a useful source for palaeoecological information for the South Garo Hills, where intensive natural and human-caused forest fires, heavy rainfall, and soil erosion occur every year and there is a relative scarcity of the lake, wetland, and swamp habitats that normally preserve pollen. © 2014, National Speleological Society Inc.

Those remaining are problematic to manage, with modified water regimes, invasive weeds and grazing by livestock. Before settlement, wetland habitats supported diverse avian herbivores, the majority of which are now extinct. However, introduced birds are increasing in wetlands. We sought to understand the role of grazing birds in the maintenance of local turf communities in a lacustrine environment in Otago, New Zealand. To determine the causes of the vegetation patterns, we investigated the influence of abiotic (water table and soil nutrients) and biotic (direct via grazing and indirect via faeces deposition) effects of the birds on the vegetation. Four plant communities were distinguished, two dominated by Leptinella and two by Carex species. The occurrence of the communities was correlated with the distance from the nearest permanent water, soil phosphorus levels, and amount of faecal deposition. The results indicate that avian grazing decreased the proportion of dominant exotic plant species by biomass removal, but not through enhanced nutrient inputs via faecal deposition. Results from this site suggest that naturalised geese facilitate the maintenance of indigenous plant species in the face of exotic invasion, and have a conservation role in highly modified wetland systems, perhaps restoring a herbivore function lost with the extinction of native avian grazers. The long-term conservation management of wetlands in New Zealand may require the utilisation of both native and introduced avian grazers to facilitate the dominance of indigenous plants. © New Zealand Ecological Society.","Avian herbivory; Grazing; Positive-feedback switch; Turf; Wetland restoration",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885738155

However, few studies have determined the mechanisms underlying lag phases. Such a mechanistic understanding is vital if the potential ecosystem-level impacts are to be predicted and the invasion risks to be managed proactively. Here we examine Banksia ericifolia, introduced for floriculture to South Africa, as a case study. We found 18 sites where the species has been planted, with self-sustaining (naturalized) populations at four sites, and an invasive population at one site. The invasion originated from around 100 individuals planted 35 years ago; after several fires this population has grown to approximately 10000 plants covering about 127ha. The current invasion of B.ericifolia already has ecosystem-level impacts, for example the nectar available to bird pollinators has more than doubled, potentially disrupting native pollination networks. If fires occurred at the other naturalized sites we anticipate populations would rapidly spread and densify with invaded areas ultimately become banksia-dominated woodlands. Indeed the only site other than the invasive site where fire has occurred regularly is already showing signs of rapid population growth and spread. However, recruitment is mainly immediately post fire and no seed bank accumulates in the soil, mechanical control of adult plants is cheap and effective, and immature plants are easily detected. This study is a first in illustrating the importance of fire in driving lag phases and provides a valuable example for why it is essential to determine the mechanisms that mediate lag phases in introduced plant species. Serotinous species that have been introduced to areas where fire is suppressed could easily be misinterpreted as low risk species whilst they remain in a lag phase, but they can represent a major invasion risk. © 2013 Ecological Society of Australia.","Biological invasion; Early detection and rapid response; Eradication; Fynbos; Horticulture; Proteaceae; Time lag",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888351864

In the absence of fire, fuels have accumulated in these forests causing concerns over the potential for catastrophic wildfires. Fuel reduction treatments are being used on federal and state lands to reduce the threat of wildfire by mechanically removing biomass. Although these treatments result in a reduction in fire hazard, their impact on wildlife is less clear. We use a multi-species occupancy modeling approach to build habitat-suitability models for 46 upland forest birds found in the Lake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra Nevada based on forest structure and abiotic variables. Using a Bayesian hierarchical framework, we predict species-specific and community-level responses to changes in forest structure and make inferences about responses of important avian foraging guilds. Disparities within and among foraging group responses to canopy cover, tree size and shrub cover emphasized the complexities in managing forests to meet biodiversity goals. Based on our species-specific model results, we predicted changes in species richness and community similarity under forest prescriptions representing three management practices: no active management, a typical fuel reduction treatment that emphasizes spacing between trees, and a thinning prescription that creates structural heterogeneity. Simulated changes to structural components of the forest analogous to management practices to reduce fuel loads clearly affected foraging groups differentially despite variability in responses within guilds. Although species richness was predicted to decrease slightly under both simulated fuels reduction treatments, the prescription that incorporated structural heterogeneity retained marginally higher species richness. The composition of communities supported by different management alternatives was influenced by urbanization and management practice, emphasizing the importance of creating heterogeneity at the landscape scale. © 2013 .","Biodiversity; Forest management; Functional group; Hierarchical modeling; Imperfect detection; Occurrence modeling",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878695782

Fire management for wildlife conservation requires understanding how species respond to burning at different frequencies, severities, and over time. In an earlier study, we experimentally assessed how breeding bird communities and species responded to fuel reduction treatments by mechanical understory reduction, low-severity prescribed fires, or mechanical understory reduction followed a year later by high-severity prescribed fires in upland hardwood forest. Here, we assess longer-term response to the initial mechanical treatment (M), and a second low-intensity burn in twice burned (B2) and mechanical. +. twice burned (MB2) treatments and controls (C). Initial (2003) higher dead fuel loadings and consequently high-severity fires in MB2 created open-canopy structure with abundant snags, resulting in much higher species richness and density of breeding birds compared to other treatments. Relative bird density and richness remained much higher in MB2 after a second burn, but few changes were evident that were not already apparent after one burn. The initial (2003) burn in B2 had cooler, low-severity fires that killed few trees. Delayed tree mortality occurred in both burn treatments after one burn, and continued in both after a second low-intensity burn. In B2, this resulted in gradual development of a ""perforated,"" patchy canopy structure with more snags. Abundance of total birds and most species in B2 was similar to C, but several additional species associated with open-forest conditions occurred at low levels, increasing richness in B2. In both burn treatments, burning temporarily reduced habitat suitability for ground-nesting birds. Bird communities in M were similar to C, as shrubs recovered rapidly. Results indicate that one or two relatively low-intensity burns with patches of hotter fire may result in gradual, subtle changes to canopy cover and structure that may slightly increase bird species richness over time. In contrast, a single high-intensity, high severity fire can create young forest conditions and a heterogeneous canopy structure that can be maintained by repeated burning and increase breeding bird relative abundance and richness by attracting disturbance-adapted species while retaining most other forest species. © 2013.","Breeding birds; Burn severity; Fire surrogate; Fuel reduction; Prescribed fire; Repeated burn",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878368766

For pairs data, the model-averaged mean of fire-related effects on colonization and extinction probabilities resulted in a 0.062 lesser site-occupancy probability in burned sites 1-year post-fire relative to unburned sites. Post-fire salvage logging reduced occupancy an additional 0.046 relative to sites that only burned. We documented a threshold-type relationship between extinction and colonization probabilities and the amount of forested habitat (conifer or hardwood tree cover types) that burned at high severity within a 203-ha core area around spotted owl nests and roost centroids. Sites where approximately 0-50 ha of forested habitat within the core area burned at high severity had extinction probabilities similar to unburned sites, but where more than approximately 50 ha of forested habitat burned severely, extinction probability increased approximately 0.003 for every additional hectare severely burned. The majority (75%) of sites burned below this threshold. Sites where high-severity fire affected >50 ha of forested habitat could still support spotted owls, so all burned sites should be monitored for occupancy before management actions such as salvage logging are undertaken that could be detrimental to the subspecies. We also recommend that managers strive to reduce human-caused ignitions along the wildland-urban interface, particularly at lower elevations where owl sites are at higher risk of extinction from fire. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

Among the most important cyanobacterial phycotoxins are microcystins, nodularin, cylindrospermopsin, Lyngbya toxins, anatoxins, saxitoxins, and β-METHYLAMINO-l-ALANINE; the most important marine phycotoxins from diatoms or dinoflagellates include saxitoxins, domoic acid, brevetoxins, and ciguatoxins. At least 100 different species of organisms may harbor toxins. Toxicoses from marine phycotoxin producers in man, other mammals, and birds can occur from direct contact via skin, inhalation, or ingestion of toxigenic organisms or lysates, or by ingestion after passage of the toxins through food chains to shellfish or finfish. Large die-offs of fish may also occur. Concentrated harmful algal blooms (HABs) can color the waters, and some of the marine organisms cause what are known as ""red tides."" However, clear water may also harbor toxic levels of phycotoxins. Exposure to cyanobacterial toxins in freshwater environments is most frequently through direct consumption of contaminated water, but inhalation or wound absorption is also possible, and with some of the neurotoxins, food chain exposure can be important. Eutrophication of fresh, estuarine, or brackish marine waters can result in massive blooms of toxic cyanobacteria. Excessive nutrient runoff can result from burning, fertilization, overgrazing, herbicide- or tillage-related absence of plant cover, and urban/suburban development. Nutrient loading also frequently arises from additions of animal and human excreta, and atmospheric deposition from fossil fuel burning. Droughts, storms, and/or El Niño events that produce warmer water may shorten generation times of toxigenic cyanobacteria, diatoms, and dinoflagellates, thereby increasing risks. Also, elimination of plants that overhang, live in, or emerge from fresh water allows more UV and infrared to enter water bodies and promote cyanobacterial replication. The effects of different phycotoxins range from peracute lethality from respiratory paralysis to acute liver failure and death, prolonged nervous system damage, skin irritation, and tumor promotion. Analytical methods, such as liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), immunoassays, and mouse bioassays, have been developed to determine the presence of the phycotoxins in source materials, digestive tract contents, tissues, and seafood. However, presumptive diagnoses of phycotoxin poisonings are frequently made based on a combination of a history of consumption or exposure to a suspected source of toxin, clinical signs, and in some cases compatible lesions. While necropsy and histopathology should be relied upon, the evidence from such examinations is often supportive rather than pathognomonic of a specific phycotoxicosis. © 2013 Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In Europe, Dupont's Lark Chersophilus duponti is a threatened open-habitat bird. Prescribed burning has sometimes been proposed for its conservation, but without evidence of its effectiveness. To evaluate the short-term effects of a summer wildfire on this species, we performed several transect counts in the burnt and unburnt parts of a shrubsteppe in central Spain. The same transects were counted within a three-year interval prior to the fire and were repeated during the first two springs after the fire. We also measured the vegetation during the first two springs after the fire. In the burnt area, we observed a decrease of about 85-100% in Dupont's Lark abundance, and about 7-15% in the control area. The disappearance of the scrub cover after fire and its slow regeneration, as well as the large increase in grass cover during the second year, may explain the decrease in this habitat-specialist bird species. Fire should be avoided in areas occupied by the Dupont's Lark, as its negative effects in the short-term may cause local extinctions. However, prescribed burning may be used in neighboring areas to create new open habitats that may be subsequently colonized by this species.","conservation tool; disturbance; fire; Genista pumila; Mediterranean; páramo; shrub-steppe habitat",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896834253

Diagnosis is usually achieved by detailed history and ruling out other causes through evaluation of CBC and biochemical profile. Prolonged crack-cocaine misuse could cause digit or nail lesions in humans. In this report similar clinical manifestations in two African gray parrots owned by crack-cocaine addicted users have been reported. Cases: Two African gray parrots were referred with pruritic foot, discoloration of digits, black and brown patching of the scales on the feet and legs associated with soft tissue swelling. Gross necrosis and self mutilation were also observed. According to the history, both birds had been suffering from the lesions for the past few weeks. A detailed history was obtained for each patient, including environmental condition and their main diet was nuts and fruits. Common causes were ruled out through evaluation of CBC and biochemical profile. Based on gross characteristics and distribution of lesions, foot necrosis was diagnosed. Husbandry recommendations were given and antibiotics were prescribed to prevent possible infections. However, no improvements were seen, following the prescribed medication. Also deterioration of the clinical signs and feet lesions were observed. Typical finger tips showed gangrenous necrosis and very severe dark discoloration. After scrutiny in history taking, and visit of the owner's residence, it was evident that the birds have been exposed to the owner's crack-cocaine smoking area for at least two years. One of the owners accepted the recommendation of amputation of the affected digits and changing either the owner or environment. Follow-up showed no further lesion progression. Discussion: This clinical report presents two cases of parrots exposed to long term crack-cocaine smoke released to the environment. Generally speaking pet birds such as African gray parrots, used to share in many social activities with their owners, and such a behavior makes them more vulnerable to develop lesions in polluted environment. The history of both patients did not show any exposure to external or internal irritant of epithelial tissues except that they were continuously in close contact with crack-cocaine smoke. Clinical manifestations of both cases were similar in the first visit and followup clinical examination. So, according to the history and physical examination finding and ruling out other possibilities, it is assumed that foot necrosis may occur following long-term exposure of a bird in a crack-heroin-polluted area. Skin lesions such as burns and blackened hyperkeratosis on hands or digits of human associated with the use of crack have been reported before. Vasoconstriction (due to cocaine exposure) would be able to cause persistent hypoxia at the periphery. Another possible reason for these signs is acute peripheral arterial thrombosis associated with cocaine. Cocaine has also been associated with small vessel vasculitis. It is therefore postulated that, prolonged habitual use of crack-cocaine by parrot owners may result in visible digital changes (caused by multiple prolonged episodes of vasoconstriction, peripheral arterial thrombosis, hypoxia and ischemia) in parrots and could be one of the reasons for foot necrosis.","African gray parrot; Avian pathology; Cocaine use; Crack use; Digit necrosis; Parrot foot necrosis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877315773

For populations occupying such environments, fire-induced landscape change is likely to influence population processes, and genetic patterns and structure among populations. The Mallee Emu-wren Stipiturus mallee is an endangered passerine whose global distribution is confined to fire-prone, semi-arid mallee shrublands in south-eastern Australia. This species, with poor capacity for dispersal, has undergone a precipitous reduction in distribution and numbers in recent decades. We used genetic analyses of 11 length-variable, nuclear loci to examine population structure and processes within this species, across its global range. Populations of the Mallee Emu-wren exhibited a low to moderate level of genetic diversity, and evidence of bottlenecks and genetic drift. Bayesian clustering methods revealed weak genetic population structure across the species' range. The direct effects of large fires, together with associated changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of suitable habitat, have the potential to cause population bottlenecks, serial local extinctions and subsequent recolonisation, all of which may interact to erode and homogenise genetic diversity in this species. Movement among temporally and spatially shifting habitat, appears to maintain long-term genetic connectivity. A plausible explanation for the observed genetic patterns is that, following extensive fires, recolonisation exceeds in-situ survival as the primary driver of population recovery in this species. These findings suggest that dynamic, fire-dominated landscapes can drive genetic homogenisation of populations of species with low-mobility and specialised habitat that otherwise would be expected to show strongly structured populations. Such effects must be considered when formulating management actions to conserve species in fire-prone systems. © 2013 Brown et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876576631

Consequently, the extent of ornament expression can act as an honest indicator of quality, condition or susceptibility to parasites, and influence the behavior of mates or competitors. We used reflectance spectrometry to quantify non-iridescent, ultraviolet (UV) and blue structurally-based plumage color and character size in relation to individual condition (feather growth rate) and occurrence of disease caused by a parasite infestation (knemidokoptic mange) in wild male Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri). We then attempted to experimentally reduce parasite load prior to molt and quantified the relative change in plumage and condition. Those birds with faster feather growth rates (i.e., in better condition) had lower hues (i.e., reflected shorter wavelengths, displaying a more intense, brilliant UV-blue color), suggesting the possibility of condition or feather growth rate-dependent production of color. We found that UV reflectance (UV chroma) was positively related to the occurrence of disease. We detected no effect of experimental treatment on plumage or condition. In conclusion, our results are suggestive of possible condition-dependent development of structurally-based plumage, and the positive relationship between macro-parasite-caused disease intensity and UV blue plumage color, demonstrated for the first time in this study, did not support the parasite-mediated handicap hypothesis. © 2013 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Italia.","condition-dependent; Cyanocitta stelleri; handicap; parasites; ptilochronolgy; Steller's jay; structural color; ultraviolet reflectance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876478463

Long-distance dispersal may shape the genetic structure of these new closed forest formations. We analyzed eight microsatellite loci using a single-time approach to understand contemporary pollen and effective seed dispersal of the tropical tree, Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. (Fabaceae), occurring in a Brazilian fire- and livestock-protected savanna. We sampled all adult trees found within a 10.24 ha permanent plot, young trees within a subplot of 1.44 ha and open-pollinated seeds. We detected a very high level of genetic diversity among the three generations in the studied plot. Parentage analysis revealed high pollen immigration rate (0.64) and a mean contemporary pollen dispersal distance of 74 m. In addition, half-sib production was 1.8 times higher than full-sibs in significant higher distances, indicating foraging activity preference for different trees at long distances. There was a significant and negative correlation between diameter at breast height (DBH) of the pollen donor with the number of seeds (r = -0.640, P-value = 0.032), suggesting that pollen donor trees with a higher DBH produce less seeds. The mean distance of realized seed dispersal (recruitment kernel) was 135 m due to the large home range dispersers (birds and mammals) in the area. The small magnitude of spatial genetic structure found in young trees may be a consequence of overlapping seed shadows and increased tree density. Our results show the positive side of closed canopy expansion, where animal activities regarding pollination and seed dispersal are extremely high.© 2013 The Authors.

In this study, we set up a 2 × 2 factorial design with nectar-robbing ants and hummingbird pollination to test for non-additive effects on fruit set, seed mass, and seed germination of the leafless mistletoe Tristerix aphyllus (Loranthaceae). Even though ants caused conspicuous damage at the base of the floral tubes, nectar availability was reduced by only 8 % in the presence of ants. The green-backed firecrown Sephanoides sephaniodes was insensitive to the presence of ants. Rather, the bird responded to flower number and the presence or the absence of damage, but not to the extent of damage within inflorescences. As hummingbirds were largely insensitive to variation in nectar robbing, the interaction ant × hummingbird had no effect on plant-reproductive success. Thus, the factorial experiment did not provide evidence for indirect negative effects of nectar robbing on plant reproduction. These results suggest that indirect effects of nectar robbers on pollinator behaviour may occur under a more restricted set of conditions than those previously considered. We suggest that the low amount of nectar removed by nectar-robbing ants was insufficient for hummingbirds to avoid robbed flowers, which restricted the potential for non-additive effects. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Chile; Flower damage; Fruit set; Germination; Indirect effects; Mistletoe; Sephanoides; Tristerix",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876451962

The following experiment was designed to assess the physiological responses of White Pekin ducks to nonterminal submersion in water- based foam compared with water. The hypothesis of this experiment was that submersion of ducks in water or water-based foam would trigger the diving reflex and lead to bradycardia. All treatments led to pronounced bradycardia. Heart rate was not significantly different between treatments during the final 30 s of the 60-s treatment period. Heart rate dropped significantly faster for the water dip and foam dip treatments and rose significantly faster than the foam pour treatment after the termination of the 60-s treatment period. Duration of bradycardia approached significance for the foam pour treatment, leading to a longer duration of bradycardia compared with the water pour, water dip, and foam dip treatments. The results of this experiment demonstrated that apnea and bradycardia as a result of the diving reflex can occur as a result of submersion in foam, which may have an impact on the time it takes White Pekin ducks to reach unconsciousness and death during water-based foam depopulation. © 2013 Poultry Science Association Inc.","Bradycardia; Depopulation; Diving reflex; Duck; Foam",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872355038

These declines may be in part related to contemporary reductions in small-scale forest interior disturbances such as fire, windthrow, and treefalls. To mitigate the negative impacts of disturbance alteration and suppression on some late-successional species, strategies that emulate natural disturbance regimes are often advocated, but large-scale evaluations of these practices are rare. Here, we assessed the consequences of experimental disturbance (using partial timber harvest) on a severely declining late-successional species, the cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea), across the core of its breeding range in the Appalachian Mountains. We measured numerical (density), physiological (body condition), and demographic (age structure and reproduction) responses to three levels of disturbance and explored the potential impacts of disturbance on source-sink dynamics. Breeding densities of warblers increased one to four years after all canopy disturbances (vs. controls) and males occupying territories on treatment plots were in better condition than those on control plots. However, these beneficial effects of disturbance did not correspond to improvements in reproduction; nest success was lower on all treatment plots than on control plots in the southern region and marginally lower on light disturbance plots in the northern region. Our data suggest that only habitats in the southern region acted as sources, and interior disturbances in this region have the potential to create ecological traps at a local scale, but sources when viewed at broader scales. Thus, cerulean warblers would likely benefit from management that strikes a landscape-level balance between emulating natural disturbances in order to attract individuals into areas where current structure is inappropriate, and limiting anthropogenic disturbance in forests that already possess appropriate structural attributes in order to maintain maximum productivity.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871879675

On the other hand, most infectious agents, especially commensal viruses, are component parts of the ecosystems in which their wild avian hosts occur, they have co-evolved, and the infectious agents do not necessarily cause disease. But, some viral diseases have killed wild waterfowls including ducks, geese, swans, and captive ones, as well. Considerable environmental change has occurred in Japan over the last 150 years. With the increased availability of firearms following the Meiji Restoration (1860s), the populations of duck (Anas and Aythya spp.), geese (Anser and Branta spp.), and swans (Cygnus spp.) were dramatically depleted during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Furthermore considerable impact as a result of industrial development during the 20th century (particularly during the post 1945 rapid development phase) led to extensive environmental damage to marine, coastal, lowland, freshwater, and montane ecosystems, with extensive areas of natural habitat being entirely destroyed (coastal and lowland wetlands have been particularly hard hit). As a consequence of this, avian habitats have been greatly altered and populations mostly reduced. Although waterfowl populations steadily increased during the latter part of the 20th century as persecution has declined (Japanese Association for Wild Geese Protection 1994), continued habitat loss has led to extensive concentration of populations. Not only are waterfowl populations greatly concentrated at shrinking wetland sites, both during migratory stop-over, and during the main winter period, but they are also remaining at fewer sites for longer periods of time, thus greatly increasing the risk of, and facilitating, bird-to-bird spread of such pathogens. An understanding of the infectious and parasitic avian disease organisms that are present in Japan, their ecology, transmission, and symptoms is an essential conservation tool. Our aim in this chapter is, therefore, to provide an overview of viral disease organisms, their recognition, their implications for avian populations in Japan, and potential strategies for risk reduction, in the hope of helping to prevent a severe epidemic event among bird concentrations in Japan. Although viral diseases have not been recognized as major causes of illness and death in wild birds in Japan, there has been significant concern about such diseases since the 1970s in the USA because of severe outbreaks of Duck plague there, although it is not deemed indigenous there. Duck plague, or duck viral enteritis, is caused by a herpes virus (Family Herpesviridae). Although duck viral enteritis has not yet been recorded from Japan, there has been a case of another lethal herpes viral infection among wild birds in Japan, namely of Marek's disease virus (MDV) (Family Herpesviridae). In spring, prior to breeding in Russia, and in autumn, prior to wintering in Honshu, most of approximately 60,000 individual White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons) spend several weeks feeding on the Ishikari River plain in west Hokkaido, near Bibai City, with the majority of them roosting each night at one particular swamp - Miyajima-numa (approximately 30 ha). From an ornithological and conservation perspective Miyajima-numa is a remarkably important site for the White-fronted Goose and for a wide range of other waterfowl species. It is also a highly significant site from an epidemiological viewpoint as the lethal case involving a tumor lesion, caused by Marek's disease, in an adult female White-fronted Goose was obtained from Miyajima-numa in November 2001. Marek's disease is caused by a highly contagious herpes virus with a worldwide distribution, and it is normally found amongst chickens, but lesions resembling those caused by MDV also have been reported in owls, pheasants, partridge, ducks, geese, swans and a kestrel. In Japan, Marek's disease is most commonly found among domestic chickens especially among battery chickens. As MDV has been shown to be transmitted through diresct and indirect contact with contaminated aerosols, it is very risky that too highly congestion of geese in roosting sites. Hence, a preliminary epidemiological survey of 45 individuals of geese utilising Miyajima-numa was done by us in April 2002.

Most cases are mild, yet some severe cases have been reported. Symptoms of acute Q fever may include: chest pain with breathing, cough, fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pains, and shortness of breath. Symptoms of chronic Q fever may include chills, fatigue, night sweats, prolonged fever, and shortness of breath. Q fever is diagnosed with a blood antibody test. The main treatment for the disease is with antibiotics. For acute Q fever, doxycycline is recommended. For chronic Q fever, a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine is often used long term. Complications are cirrhosis, hepatitis, encephalitis, endocarditis, pericarditis, myocarditis, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, meningitis, and pneumonia.

Non-Indigenous societies typically do not relate to the land, sea, and sky in the same manner as Indigenous peoples, instead extracting natural resources and demanding absolute control of nature itself. Over the decades, Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Rim have observed changes in the environment, including both local phenomena such as changing land management practices and global alterations such as shifts in bird migration or water levels. Tribal histories note that the times, indeed, ""are a' changin'."" One example in Aotearoa/New Zealand illustrates the larger trends: ""Images of eel have appeared on Maori artifacts and throughout oral histories. According to the oral histories, never has the eel migration been so erratic. Eel migrations correspond with changes in local water temperature and rainfall. But New Zealand's weather has been increasingly volatile, throwing the eel off"" (Dawson 2006). Historically when environmental shifts occurred, the Indigenous people shifted habitation to another location, returning later if the climate permitted. With the colonization of Indigenous lands (driven by consumerism exploding at a global scale), there simply is no longer a place to go-and most likely no longer a place to return. Aotearoa, Australia, and other countries on the Pacific Rim are running out of land that can sustain nature. In Indigenous terms, ""Nature"" is viewed as a garden, distinct from cultivated fields and yards but not a ""wilderness,"" as in Western thinking. The Native garden requires tending with prescribed burns, tree and brush thinning, weeding, planting of preferred cultural plants, and management of culturally important animals. In short, Indigenous peoples have long practiced what Western society today calls ""sustainability."" In his 2006 song ""After the Garden is Gone,"" Neil Young sings, After the garden is gone What will people do? After the garden is gone What will people say? After the garden is gone ... In Native Science, Native educator Gregory Cajete writes, ""Native science's view on sustainability has begun to take effect. The survival of Planet Earth may be contingent on Western science, governments and private industry to relinquish their monopoly on accepted 'knowledge,' and listen to the voices of the indigenous cultures"" (2000:269). Indigenous cultures are locally based but maintain a universal view of nature that can be applied anywhere in the world. The phrase ""think globally, act locally,"" now more imperative than ever, has special resonance in the Indigenous world. Perhaps this is the true vision of ""homeland security,"" developing local strategies in Indigenous communities to change the course for planet Earth. Climate change awareness is relatively low throughout developed countries, and the general understanding of the phenomenon is still quite poor. Issues of ""global warming"" are so complex that many people feel helpless or frustrated. For some Indigenous people and tribes, the terms ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" might not be in their vernacular. In improving people's understanding of climate change and empowering them to do something about it, the local context is most important to consider: what is affecting them locally? Chemical changes caused by climate change may result in warmer waters, which may lead tuna or anchovy (instead of sockeye salmon) to traditional fishing areas. In the words of Terry Williams, the Fisheries and Natural Resources Commissioner of the Tulalip Tribes in Washington state, the ""People of the Salmon"" may become the ""Mahi-Mahi People."" If most tribal members in the Pacific Northwest of North America were asked about the effects of climate change on the environment of the Pacific Rim, they would likely not know how to respond. However, if the question concerned the natural resource management process, chances are they would be quick to recognize climate change's environmental impact on their locale. This connection is evident with regard to the sockeye salmon diversion, and the devastating effects of the increasingly intense El Niño and La Niña cycles, including storms, floods, and droughts-to name just a few. Since time immemorial, Pacific Northwest Indian tribes have depended on natural resources for cultural, spiritual, and economic necessities. It is not coincidental that the tribes have been situated in each major watershed in the region and have been able to adapt quickly to the changes of the ecosystems. Tribes hold thousands of years of knowledge and experience to share with non-Native people and organizations that are willing to work with them. The Treaty tribes in Washington state have the power to successfully preserve, protect, and restore natural resources for the benefit of all. For example, climate change and urban development have severely affected water resources and aquatic ecosystems in western Washington state. The Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC), with a membership of twenty tribes in Washington state, has recognized the need for a comprehensive assessment of the quantity and quality of water resources in western Washington as the starting point for informed management of them. This assessment plan involves gathering information about the quantity and quality of fresh water available in western Washington. It can produce the scientific information useful for a wide range of tribal resource management, administrative, and legal activities. NWIFC recognizes the importance of managing water resources while protecting tribal rights, and working in collaboration with non-Native citizens and agencies to protect and repair our river basins, such as those in the Nisqually watershed. © 2012 Zoltán Grossman and Alan Parker.

We study here the usefulness of a general-purpose monitoring programme for the calibration of hybrid SDMs. As a benchmark case, we take the calibration with data from a monitoring programme that specifically surveys those areas where environmental changes expected to be relevant occur. Location Catalonia, north-east of Spain. Methods We modelled the distribution changes of twelve open-habitat bird species in landscapes whose dynamics are driven by fire and forest regeneration. We developed hybrid SDMs combining correlative habitat suitability with mechanistic occupancy models. We used observations from two monitoring programmes to provide maximum-likelihood estimates for spread parameters: a common breeding bird survey (CBS) and a programme specifically designed to monitor bird communities within areas affected by wildfires (DINDIS). Results Both calibration with CBS and DINDIS data yielded sound spread parameter estimates and range dynamics that suggested dispersal limitations. However, compared to calibration with DINDIS data, calibration with CBS data leads to biased estimates of spread distance for seven species and to a higher degree of uncertainty in predicted range dynamics for six species. Main conclusions We have shown that available monitoring data can be used in the calibration of the mechanistic component of hybrid SDMs. However, if the dynamics of the target species occur within areas not well covered, general-purpose monitoring data can lead to biased and inaccurate parameter estimates. To determine the potential usefulness of a given monitoring data set for the calibration of the mechanistic component of a hybrid SDM, we recommend quantifying the number of surveyed sites that are predicted to undergo habitat suitability changes. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biogeography; Bird atlas data; Hybrid SDM; Maximum-likelihood optimization; Metapopulation dynamics; Range shifts",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865866426

The frequency of ice storms may increase in response to climate change. Typically, warm, moist air overruns a shallow body of cold air, rain from warm air may become supercooled when it falls from the warmer clouds, causing it to freeze immediately upon contact. Ice-snow damage occurs when the ice loaded on crown exceeds the maximum bending moment for a tree of given size and species. Ice-snow damage of forests dependents on ice accumulation. Accumulation ice can cause tree damage ranged from the loss of tissues to structural failure. Ice-snow damage to trees can range from mere breakage of a few twigs, to bending stems to the ground, to moderate crown loss, to outright breakage of the trunk. There is a close relationship between ice- snow damage and forest characteristics, such as stand density and species composition as well as tree characteristics, such as diameter at breast height, tree height, stem taper, leaf area, crowns symmetry, root system and stand age, etc. The stands with the highest density are the most vulnerable to ice-snow damage, especially for a few years after thinning. Softwoods suffer less damage from the same degree of ice loading than do hardwoods. Trees with branches that droop or have pliable stems and limbs are better withstand ice-snow damage. Dominant canopy trees incur more ice-snow damage than sub-canopy trees. Moreover, ice-snow damage is affected by some external factors, such as topography and soil conditions, including elevation, slope grade, slope aspect, slope position, soil type, soil thickness and soil water content. Higher elevations are more prone to freezing rain. Elevation and aspects increasing exposure to stronger winds result in higher damage. Ice-snow damage also exerts an impact on forest understory light, soil, litter, disease fungi and wildlife. The understory light condition that followed ice-snow damages has great significance to species regeneration, forest dynamic and recovery. A transient increase in understory light following an ice-snow damage may accelerate the conversion of early successional stands to more shade-tolerant species. The rapid decrease in understory light following an ice-snow damage is likely a result of the recovery of both the overstory and understory vegetation. An ice-snow damage indirectly impacts natural plant regeneration by its impact on fruit and seed production. Wildlife first must endure the perils of the ice-snow storm-low temperatures, ice buildup, falling debris, and reduced mobility. Birds are especially vulnerable. Wounds caused by ice-snow damages permit infection by a wide array of disease fungi and become breeding grounds for bark beetles or other pests, especially when the injuries are large and do not heal rapidly. Ice damages also increase potential fire risk by elevating fuel loads. Future research in the field of ice-snow damage to forests should focus on effects of ice-snow damage on natural forests and the long-term research of nutrient cycling and soil, especially microorganism, wildlife, forest dynamics and forest understory light, and reducing the risk of ice-snow damage through forest management.","Forest characteristics; Ice-snow damage; Soil; Topography",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866513782

The ants attack is harmful at any stage of the cycle, but the damage is greater in the training phase of the plant, when temporarily paralyzes growth. In an attempt to reduce the damage caused by these insects farmers make the control of fire ants through the use of mechanical methods, biological and chemical. The mechanical control is to dig the nest to remove the queen (individual responsible for placing the eggs that give rise to other individuals in the colony), which are larger in size than workers, causing a disruption of the nest, since the queen controls all activities and individuals in the colony. This type of control has been recommended only for newly formed nests, otherwise, the queen will be housed in great depth, making its removal. It should be noted that in practice such control is not a good alternative in commercial plantations due to the large extent of the property. Chemical control can be accomplished by applying powder, liquid insecticide, thermonebulization and granulated bait. The powder is a type of insecticides formulated in solid vehicles, such as talc, and the application is through hand pumps. The death of ants occurs by direct contact with the chemical. However, this type of control has limitations such as the impossibility of penetration of the product in the deepest chambers of nesting adults, and has now been replaced by liquid thermonebulized, through which the product is injected into the nest with the help of hose, and toxic bait, which is considered more efficient due to easy handling, fast action and lower costs. The bait is distributed on the tracks near the colony of ants to be transported into the nest by workers. This method can cause much damage to non-target ants and even other bodies. Finally, it has been used the biological control, which is the introduction of natural enemies in plantations, such as birds, some species of spiders, beetles, mites and even other species of ants, and much research is currently focused on creating natural insecticides that have repellent action or lethal to the ants, such as castor oil, or fungicidal against the garden of fungus that feeds the colony, as is the case of sesame. Studies on the morphology of the reproductive organs of these ants could also be an important tool in the search for new methods of control. Some studies have been conducted on the morphology of the spermathecae of ants, the body that produces all the elements capable of maintaining viable sperm inside, where it was observed that products circulating in the hemolymph, due to the thin wall thickness of the the spermatheca, also could enter the environment within this structure, where are the sperm and thus affect their viability. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The species is confined to three mountain massifs in the south of the country and is classified as globally 'Endangered'. This study re-evaluates its conservation status by assessing its population size and habitat preferences on Mount Mulanje, where forest patches are threatened by illegal logging and an increasing frequency of uncontrolled fires. These fires also cause a proliferation of invasive plant species, especially the Himalayan yellow raspberry Rubus ellipticus. We surveyed the Yellow-throated Apalis in 41 forest patches during the breeding season. The apalises favoured forest edge habitat, occurring in forest patches as small as 0.01 ha. Their occurrence was positively correlated with the presence of R. ellipticus, although this relationship may be driven primarily by canopy architecture and the existence of an understorey shrub layer. At a conservative estimate, 7,900 Yellow-throated Apalises were calculated to be present in cedar forest habitat alone on Mount Mulanje. Given that the birds occurred in other native forests at the same altitude at densities of 8.6-10.9 birds ha-1, the true population size on Mount Mulanje alone is likely to approach or even exceed IUCN's most optimistic estimate of the global population (10,000). © 2011 BirdLife International.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862579764

By ‘microhabitats’ we mean discrete parts of a tree that host different species assemblages. Some of the microhabitats are only present in living trees, typically in mature or old individuals (Figure 7.1), and additional ones become available after the trees die. Wounds, rot holes and cavities; attached dead branches and roots; phloem (inner bark), sapwood and heartwood; fruiting bodies and mycelia of decomposer fungi etc. each host very different species assemblages. In this chapter, we describe in more detail the various dead-wood microhabitats, and the many ways in which saproxylic species can be dependent on their particular microenvironments. We present the microhabitats in the order in which they appear in a tree, starting from wounds and sap exudations that can occur even in young trees, followed by cavities and other microhabitats that develop as a result of decay in mature living trees, and ending with those microhabitats, such as subcortical space, that become available only after a tree has died. Some microhabitats, especially sap exudations and cavities, are far more common in broadleaved than in coniferous trees. Wounds and sap exudations in living trees Many factors can cause injuries to trees. Mechanical damage includes branch and stem breakages by wind, wounds made by falling trees hitting adjacent trees, lightning strikes, fire scars, frost cracks and snow breakage. Pathogenic fungi and bacteria can create necrotic patches, termed cankers, in the phloem layer. Most of the fungi that induce cankers kill the phloem and do not bring about sap flows. ‘Bleeding cankers’ are generally caused either by bacteria (Schmidt et al., 2008) or by Phytophthora species (Oomycetes) (Brown and Brasier, 2007) and produce only small amounts of exudates. Some vertebrate species, such as woodpeckers, and many invertebrate species can injure the bark, which may result in sap exudation and provide an opportunity for microbial colonization. For instance, cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) are known to cause sap exudation by piercing the bark with their stylet-like mouthparts to feed on sap (Yamazaki, 2007), and carpenterworm (Lepidoptera: Cossidae) larvae can initiate and maintain sap exudation by gnawing the bark (Yoshimoto and Nishida, 2007). © J.

The mangroves are quite old, arising some 60 million years ago. Currently the global mangrove coverage is about 15.2 million hectares in 124 countries, and restricted to the latitudes between 30°N and 30°S. There are three major types of mangroves: river-dominated; tide-dominated; and, interior swamp; influenced by tidal and river waters. The mangroves occur in low-lying, broad coastal plains where the topographic gradients are small and the tidal amplitude large. They find it difficult to colonize the coastal zone with waves of high energy and hence they normally establish themselves in sheltered shorelines. The ecological factors that strongly influence the mangroves are wave action, rainfall, freshwater runoff, erosion/sedimentation rates, aridity, salinity, nutrient inputs, and soil quality. The mangroves are not a single genetic group but representing a large variety of plant families (20) and species (71) adapted to tropical inter-tidal environment. Mangrove taxonomy needs much attention. Several species are poorly identified. There are several natural hybrids, but their parental species are not clearly understood. Another problem in the taxonomy of mangroves is the confusion between the species of ""true mangroves"" and mangrove associates. Often the same species is named differently at different sites. Molecular analyses may eventually help resolve the taxonomic problems. There are mangrove species endemic to certain places. Discontinuous distribution of mangrove species is also of interest. Asia region is rich in mangrove biodiversity with 55 species and it also has the largest extent of mangrove coverage (38.5% of total). Globally two species are critically endangered, three endangered and six are at vulnerable status and these species pose problems of slow growth and low seed viability. Two species, Sonneratia griffithii and Heritiera fomes exhibited high global loss that ranged from 50-80%. Such an assessment of conservation status of the mangrove species in different countries assumes great importance. In India, 67% of mangrove plants, 52% of macroalgae, 10% of invertebrates and 4% of vertebrates associated with mangrove systems are at threat. However, a methodology exclusively for assessing conservation status of mangrove species is yet to be perfected. Mangroves are unique to have genes for betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase and several antioxidative enzymes which play role in stress tolerance of mangrove species. The mangroves display high genetic diversity as a result from genotype differences, or from phenotypic responses to local environments. The molecular markers used to study genetic variability in mangroves are (i) allozymes, (ii) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), (iii) random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), (iv) amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), (v) microsatellites (SSR), (vi) Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR), and (vii) DNA sequence. Mangroves are able to adapt to themselves to practically all types of adverse conditions except frost, and hence they are distributed mostly in the tropical regions. Probably there are no other groups of woody plants in the entire plant kingdom with such highly developed adaptations. These adaptations vary among mangrove species and with physicochemical nature of their habitats. The mangroves have exposed breathing roots, extensive support roots, salt-excreting leaves, and viviparous water-dispersed propagules. The mangroves have xerophytic and hydrophytic characters in leaves and roots respectively. The aerial parts of the mangroves are equipped with lenticels helping in gas exchange, and they are also rich in phenolic compounds which confer protection against pest and parasites. The mangroves are adapted to salinity based on any of the three mechanisms: (i) salt exclusion; (ii) salt excretion; and, (iii) salt accumulation. The salt regulation at the cellular level is a remarkable adaptation in maintaining osmobalance between cytoplasm (occupying 20% of cell volume) and cell vacuole (covering 80% of cell volume). Mangroves reproduce mostly sexually by flowers. The flowers produce large numbers of pollen grains (around 5-7 lakhs per flower of Rhizophora), but stigma receptivity lasts for a short period, at which pollination should take place. Pollination is by both self and cross mechanisms. The latter is facilitated by wind, insects and birds and in some instances bats. The fertilized flowers may set fruits. Sprouting of propagules may be of different types: vivipary, cryptovivipary, and normal germination on soil. The viviparity allows seedlings to develop salinity tolerance and efficiency in nutrient storage, while attached with the mother plant. The survival and growth of the propagules from mangroves are strongly influence by physicochemical factors. Much of the ecological service of mangroves lies in protecting the coast from solar UV-B radiation, =green house' effects, and fury of cyclones, floods, sea-level rise, wave action and coastal erosion. The root systems of the plants keep the substrate firm, and thus contribute to a lasting stability of the coast. Mangrove swamps act as traps for the sediments, and recycling of nutrients through microbial decomposition processes. The mangroves provide a source of food, breeding grounds and nurseries for many fishes, shellfishes, and other kinds of wildlife such as reptiles, birds and mammals. They further help in offering protection to other associated flora and fauna of the coastal ecosystems and in contributing to complex food webs and energy transfers in the coastal and marine ecosystems. Mangrove forests are extremely important coastal resources, providing forestry products (firewood, charcoal, timber, honey etc.) and fishery products (fish, prawn, crab, mollusk etc.). The mangroves also contain rich sources of novel chemicals with biological activities and bioprospecting potential for development useful products like drugs. Mangroves may be further developed as sources of highly valued commercial products and fishery resources and also as sites for developing a burgeoning eco-tourism, if the mangroves are sustainably managed. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Unfortunately, as these resources diminish outside Pas, the pressure on them becomes more intense. For this reason, landscape approaches are required to protect and restore the ecosystem services of PAs. This is especially critical due to the fact that by 2025 over 60% of the world's ""absolute"" poor will live in rural areas, depending directly on the natural resources around them. There are many instances where PAs support local requirements while discouraging commercial interests of outside from rapidly depleting resources. PAs also directly contribute to increased resources - for example-in agriculture, through services such as pollination, or in fisheries through the creation of ""no take"" zones that allow fish stocks to recover. All over the world, PAs are established by governments, nongovernmental organizations and private entities with the aim of conserving biodiversity, and in most cases, without considering how PAs would affect the interested parties and their livelihoods. As a result, today PAs are seen as controversial tools for biodiversity conservation, since according to the mainstream narrative, they have caused the impoverishment of the local population through evictions and denial of access to natural resources. Taking this into account, the linkages between PAs and well-being of people living in or around them has therefore become a practical and ethical necessity. It is a practical necessity, because to survive and achieve their conservation objectives, protected areas need the support of local population and international community. It is an ethical necessity, because as it is widely recognized, conservation objectives cannot be pursued at the expenses of people's well-being. Protected areas such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries are physically shared by ecologically important flora and fauna, tourists, government officials, scientists and communities living in and around them. The benefits of protected areas extend to users at different scales, from local people who depend on particular species for their livelihood, to nations that depend on abundant freshwater and global community that depends on nature's capacity to regulate climate. Worldwide, many countries and regions, rich in biodiversity and poor in economy, have been vigorously promoting ecotourism as a conservation tool in their PAs since 1990s. PAs have played significant roles in tourist attraction in many countries since their establishment. Tourism can be an effective tool in the conservation and management of PAs. It can provide financial and political supports to conservation, and lead to a greater understanding of the value of PAs - which in turn can lead to more areas being protected. There is a wide range of opportunities for ecotourism in PAs. Such opportunities are revenue generation (i.e., user fees, entranced fees and donations), employment opportunities, and justification for protected areas, healthier economy, environmental education, and improved conservation efforts. In addition, Participatory development is consistence with planners in the direction of ""with and for people"" planning. Identifying what types of ecosystem services a protected area provides, who captures the benefits, what would happen if the services were lost, who would pay to replace them or who would suffer, is a good starting point. Material and methods: This study is based on a survey to study the importance of Ghale Shadab Prohibited Hunting Area (GSPHA), 30km north of Dezful in Khuzestan Province, from the perspective of stakeholders. This region (5000ha) was established as Prohibited Hunting Area in 2008. Maximum and minimum absolute temperatures are 28.5°c and -6.5°c, respectively, whereas average annual precipitation is about 474mm. typical large mammals include Ursus arctos, Panthera pardus, Capra aegagrus, Hyaena hyaena. Also, notable bird species include Alectoris chukar and Ammoperdix griseogularis. People living in or around GSPHA are mainly engaged in animal husbandry, agriculture, fishery and tourism. Findings revealed that 38% of visitors are unemployed. To collect data and information, a query was conducted in the study area. Stakeholder's survey was conducted to evaluate the importance of GSPHA. Stakeholders were divided in three groups including tourists, local communities and organizations. Also, three types of questionnaires were prepared. A total of 750 respondents were interviewed representing different socio-economic and occupational groups. The respondents were selected randomly to avoid serious bias. The aim of the survey was to gather information related to demography of stakeholders (e.g., age, education and occupation), willingness to environment and wildlife, sustainable use of environmental resources, willingness to participate in environmental conservation, study of problems in GSPHA, and tourism potential of the region. Descriptive statistics were derived to summarize the property of the dataset, while analytical methods (correlation and chi-squared test) were used to analyze the data and test their differences (at 95% level of significance). Analysis was conducted using SPSS ver. 11.5 and Excel. Results and Discussion: Establishment of PAs has been the most widely accepted means of biodiversity conservation so far, supported by national and international agencies. Most communities have developed their identity and cultural characteristics over time by devising and applying a strategy to cope with a given environment, and manage its natural resources. They possess a distinctive form of social organization, and their members share in varying degrees of political, economical, social and cultural characteristics (in particular language, behavioral norms, values, aspirations and often also health and disease patterns). They also function, or have functioned in the past, as micro-political bodies with specific capacities and authority. Findings showed that stakeholders use wide range of environmental resources in this region. Study findings showed that 61.5% of tourists, 78.7% of local communities and 92% of organization personnel were male and the rest were female. This study also showed that 66.5% of tourists, 16% of local communities and 64% of organization personnel had college educations. Findings revealed that 46.4% of tourists, 41.3% of local communities and 35% of organization personnel belonged to young groups between the ages of 20-30. 50.7% of local communities were farmers, husbandmen and fishermen. Furthermore, 38 % of these communities were unemployed. The results revealed that the tourists are varied by age, sex, education, culture and occupation. In general, the number of male visitors is higher than that of female visitors in outdoor recreation and youth groups are more interested in outdoor recreation. The visitors belonged to more than 21 provinces of Iran. High percentage of younger groups and visitors with college education indicates a high tourism potential of this region. The results also revealed that education can play a vital role in determining the demand for recreational activities at the GSPHA. Lake of Dez Dam, beautiful landscapes, rivers and springs beauty, wilderness region and wildlife, Shadab historical castle and living methods of local communities were important factors for tourist attraction. This finding corresponds with the opinion of Ceballos-Lascurain (1993) that green spaces with their landscapes, flora and fauna as well as their cultural elements form attractions for tourists. According to the visitors, the remarkable problems are insufficient toilets, accommodation problem, nonavailability of drinking water, and lack of proper communication facilities, lack of sufficient safety, security and guiding, lack of parking spaces for motor vehicle. Studies on people participation in outdoor recreation found that it revitalizes human spirit, restores people's initiatives of life, and produces feeling of well-being, satisfaction, creativeness and physical conditions. Government can create opportunities to develop the tourist industry based on natural resources and protected areas (ecotourism). Tourism as a tool for wildlife and wilderness areas conservation can be promoted, and from a community perspective it is expected to provide benefits that ultimately enhance local support for the conservation of natural resources. GSPHA's resources provide a wide range of products that are used for income and subsistence by the local communities. The majority of local communities (gt;70%) believed that their dependence to GSPHA is high and very high. Supplying the forage for livestock, outdoor recreation, water supply, exploitation of wild growing medicinal plants, firewood supply, food supply, handicrafts production and Exploitation of sand and gravel are the most important uses of indigenous communities in this area. An increasing number of studies show this type of correlation between household status and livelihood dependence on ecosystem goods and services, often sourced from protected areas. Estimates of the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services can provide powerful and much needed arguments to leverage additional protection for natural ecosystems which are important for development and poverty reduction. Unfortunately, economic planning has still largely failed to internalize the importance of protected areas for poverty reduction.","Ghale Shadab; Khuzestan Province; Protected areas; Stakeholders; Tourism",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857286075

Here we present a model for estimating the transport of combustion gases into cylindrical, single-entrance cavities during exposures caused by different wildland fire scenarios. In these shelters, the entrance occurs near the top of the cavity. This empirical model was developed from a suite of numerical experiments using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Fire Dynamics Simulator, which spanned a range of entrance diameters, wind speeds, gas temperatures, and vertical angles of incidence. To evaluate the model's predictions, it was used to replicate, with great accuracy, a time series of carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in a controlled experiment where a fabricated cylindrical cavity was exposed to combustion products. The time constant for cavity filling is proportional to the ratio of cavity volume to entrance area. Hot gases lead to significant stratification within the cavity during exposures. To demonstrate the model's potential use in predicting faunal exposures in the context of land management, we show that the model can be used to estimate dosage within red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis Vieillot, 1809) cavities without requiring temporally detailed, local measurements of wind speed and combustion product concentrations.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051750038

We use two natural disturbances, fire and grazing, to examine the response of bird and arthropod communities in grasslands of Serengeti, Tanzania. Both burning and grazing by migrant ungulates take place at the end of the rains in June-July. We documented the communities before disturbance, then 1, 4 and 20weeks after disturbance on three replicate plots and compared them with three undisturbed plots. Birds were recorded by observation, arthropods from pitfall, tray trap and sweepnet samples. We expected that as the grass biomass was reduced by either disturbance, bird communities would change with concomitant change in arthropod food abundance. Alternatively, bird communities would change not with the absolute amount of food but with the greater accessibility of food as the grass structure changed from long to short grass. Results showed first that both bird species richness and abundance increased after both types of disturbance, but burnt sites showed a greater increase than that for grazed sites. Second, there was a change in bird species composition with disturbance. The functionally equivalent athi short-toed lark (Calandrella athensis) was replaced by the red-capped lark (Calandrella cinerea). Third, the abundance of most groups of arthropods was lower on disturbed sites than those on undisturbed sites, and the reduction of arthropod numbers was greatest on burnt sites. These results imply that bird abundance did not occur through an increase in arthropod abundance but rather through a change in the grass structure making food more accessible; and the higher predation could have caused the lower arthropod abundance. In addition, some bird species replaced others thus functionally compensating for their loss. © 2010 The Authors.

The negative effects of agricultural intensification and policies, use of pesticides, fertilisers and mechanised harvesting on several populations of pseudo-steppe birds have increasingly required more detailed and effective habitat suitability models. Distribution models of farmland species are prone to incur recordings of false absence data. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) allows identification of environmental predictors of species distribution by using presence data only. Aims. We quantified the diurnal habitat preferences and niche width of one steppe species, the stone curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus), with unfavourable conservations status in a Mediterranean area and reclassified a map with respect to habitat suitability classes according to the resulting distribution model. Methods. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis was used with GIS cartography customised with habitat and anthropogenic variables recorded during field surveys carried out in four study plots (∼500 ha) and at different spatial scales. Key results. The stone curlew selected areas with low vegetation cover, such as fields following artichoke harvesting and tillage, close to rural buildings and unpaved roads. In contrast, the stone curlew avoided areas with high vegetation cover and areas highly disturbed by human-induced fires. The occurrence of natural vegetation was neither preferred nor avoided. The most robust model was based on a large-scale analysis (200mfrom the bird location points), according to which the optimal area for stone curlew distribution during its breeding season was restricted to 1% of the entire study area. Conclusions. Two uncorrelated factors, 'marginality' and 'tolerance', described the stone curlew's niche in the area. The first index indicated selection for habitats that were marginal with respect to those available in the area, whereas the second indicated a species with a medium-wide environmental niche. In particular, the stone curlew occupied a much more restricted niche (low tolerance) in relation to individual variables. The use of customised databases at a large scale of analysis was found to more effectively reveal ecological requirements of this marginal and specialised species. Implications. Our results allowed us to indicate practical land management actions for the stone curlew, such as prevention of human-induced fires and increase of pastoral activities. Our results indicated a potentially positive role of littledisturbed service roads along rural buildings in stone curlew distribution, which warrants further research. In addition, studies are needed to verify the presence of an ecological trap in artichoke fields, their preferred habitat. As we showed for the stone curlew, niche analyses conducted at a large scale using customised databases could greatly improve habitat suitability models of farmland species. © CSIRO 2011.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955393871

To improve our knowledge on these mechanisms, we examine cavity abundance, cavity occupation and reproductive performance of SCN in Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests subjected to two management systems: (i) dense ""young forests"" , maintained at such stage by clear-cuttings and burns, and (ii) ""old forest"" , subjected to extensive traditional grazing and scarce firewood extraction by selective cutting. Young forests had considerably lower density of cavities (1.29±0.71 vs 15.09±2.00 cavities ha-1), SCN species (0.18±0.11 vs 0.61±0.07 species ha-1) and nests (0.40±0.27 vs 2.67±0.25 nests of all SCN ha-1) than old forests, indicating that a low availability of cavities may limit SCN assemblages in young oak forests. However, reproductive parameters of great (Parus major) and blue (Cyanistes caeruleus) tits associated with the availability of food (laying date, clutch size, nestling number and weight, adult weight) did not differ between both forest types, suggesting that food supply was not reduced in young forests, at least for tits during the breeding season. Large diameter (up to 170cm dbh) decayed trees were the most likely to hold cavities, but birds preferred smaller living cavity-trees for nesting (90% of nests in 21-65cm dbh trees). The preservation of cavity-trees within traditionally managed old oak forests is crucial in providing nesting opportunities to SCN. Besides, the protection of these traditionally managed forests would also benefit to other forest organisms that depend on old and open oak forests. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Cavity occupation; Cavity-nesting birds; Dehesa; Quercus pyrenaica; Reproductive performance; Traditional management",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952039476

Methods: We collected data on the density of forest woody species in plots located on rocky outcrops and in open fields subject to different management regimes. We evaluated the influence of outcrops on the density of forest plants <60 cm tall, and the effects of other environmental variables and of site on plant density; we also used information on diaspore traits of the species to discuss the way in which plants disperse to the outcrops. Results: Rocky outcrops harbored a significantly higher density of forest plants than open fields, irrespective of site effect, and rock height was the best predictor for plant density on outcrops. Diaspores of all recorded species possess characteristics associated with dispersal by birds or mammals or by both. Conclusions: Small rocky outcrops markedly influence forest expansion by acting as perches for vertebrate dispersers and as nurse objects and safe sites for plants. Forest expansion starting in small outcrops possibly occurs as follows: perching of dispersers and increase of seed rain on rocks, promotion of better conditions of establishment for forest plants by nurse rocks, protection of plants sensitive to grazing and fire, and nucleation of forest vegetation. © 2010 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Araucaria forest; Campos; Nucleation; Nurse objects; Nursing effect; Perching effect; Safe sites; Seed dispersal",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651357581

Currently, most fuel reduction projects do not include riparian, due to the perception that these riparian areas are negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbance. However, there is very little information on the ecological consequences of including riparian areas in fuel reduction projects. We compared the effects of non-commercial thin and handpile treatments followed by prescribed burns in riparian areas of intermittent and perennial streams that were treated to the streamside (unbuffered), to the typical prescription in which sites were treated only in the adjacent upland (buffered). Unbuffered fuel reduction treatments have the potential to affect bird density and reproductive success differently than buffered treatments by altering (1) available nest habitat, (2) predator and nest parasite abundance, and (3) food availability in riparian areas. This study assessed whether unbuffered fuel reduction treatments yielded similar bird response as buffered treatments by quantifying differences in density and reproductive success of five bird species, vegetation structure, the frequency of occurrence of predators and a nest parasite, and arthropod biomass. Density was greater for the shrub and tree-nesting Pacific-slope Flycatcher in buffered streams post treatment. Reproductive success showed a minimal, near-term effect for the shrub-nesting Black-headed Grosbeak. For potential causal factors, we found differences between buffered and unbuffered streams only for available nest habitat in the upper-ground strata and frequency of occurrence of raptors. Overall, results suggest that fuel reduction in riparian areas as compared with typical upland treatments with buffers had a small effect on bird density and a near-term effect on reproductive success. Additional study of fuel reduction in riparian areas is warranted because of its effectiveness in reducing the risk of unnaturally severe wildfire and, correspondingly, the potential benefit to bird communities over the long-term. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Birds; Density; Fuel reduction; Prescribed fire; Reproductive success; Riparian",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149465276

More than 2500 species were processed, dominated by macro-invertebrates, vascular flora and macrofungi. Few significant impacts were evident, and most species groups were resilient to the disturbances imposed. Regeneration stocking did not meet specified standards on two gap release and seven shelterwood grids subjected to silvicultural treatment in the period 1988–2002. Six treated grids had a retained basal area of more than 18 m2 ha−1, which obviated the need for further regeneration. More than 50 y may be needed for biological processes to reverse the increase in bulk density of soil caused during harvesting. Cryptogams (especially lichens) were the species group most sensitive to disturbance, although recovery of species richness was nearly complete 10 y after disturbance. For cryptogams and vascular flora, species recorded in only one grid (singletons) were more likely to occur on reference grids than on silviculturally treated grids. For all species groups studied, the imprint of harvesting 40 or more years earlier on species composition had become indistinguishable from that on grids never harvested. Soil nutrient status correlated with species richness for fungi on wood (negatively), light-trapped invertebrates (positively), birds (positively) and terrestrial vertebrates (frogs, reptiles and mammals, negatively). Silvicultural disturbance (timber harvesting and associated burning) correlated with species richness for fungi on wood (positively), terrestrial vertebrates (positively) and cryptogams (negatively). Time since the last (prescribed) fire did not correlate with any species group. Plant disease decreased species richness of light-trapped invertebrates by about 35%. Very few taxa were sufficiently widespread or sufficiently responsive to silvicultural disturbance to be of value as bio-indicators, demonstrating the superiority of biodiversity monitoring over bio-indicator monitoring. It is recommended that FORESTCHECK be expanded into a biological survey of the lower south-west of Western Australia. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Biodiversity; Disturbed forests; Disturbed soils; Jarrah; Monitoring; Reviews; Silviculture; Western Australia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855280321

In this paper, we outline the establishment phase of a new long-term ecological restoration experiment in south-eastern Australia, that will test ways of improving critically endangered box gum grassy woodlands for biodiversity. In the experimental design, treatments include the addition of 2000 tonnes of coarse woody debris, exclusion of kangaroos and fire. Random variation in biophysical variables occurs at several levels. To facilitate accurate estimation of key main effects, selected high order interactions are partially confounded with 'random' block terms. Response variables include: plants, birds, small mammals, reptiles and invertebrates. Analysis of baseline data across selected response variables confirmed no pre-treatment effects. The experiment provides a strong inferential framework for tracking the effects of restoration treatments on woodland biodiversity over coming years. It also provides a model for other similar experiments that integrate restoration and research. A newly constructed feral animal-proof fence, that will allow reintroduction of locally extinct species, including ecosystem engineers, will provide additional opportunities to research the woodland restoration process. This experiment will become a long-term ecological research site, and an 'outdoor laboratory' for ecological restoration research, and community and student learning.","Box-gum grassy woodlands; Eucalyptus blakelyi; Eucalyptus melliodora; Evidence-based conservation; Feral animal-proof fence; Mulligans flat - Goorooyarroo woodland experiment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81755162889

In general, riparian zone management has focused on the production and maintenance of high quality aquatic habitat, including wood recruitment, sediment storage, and water quality, to benefit in-stream populations, primarily fish. However, the way in which different riparian management strategies influence the population dynamics of terrestrial wildlife is less well understood. I discuss 3 case studies to illustrate the difficulties in assessing population responses to management when temporal and spatial scales of research and management are not aligned: the responses of passerine birds to different buffer sizes, population changes in snag-dependent birds in response to intensive forest management, and occupancy dynamics of streamassociated amphibians. Numerous research results exist for these topics, but very few studies have uncovered causal mechanisms that describe the link between management actions and population responses. In part, these results may be attributed to research methods that were poorly suited to questions of interest, but also because sampling of local populations cannot capture dynamics that may influence regional populations. Also, I discuss how current management-characterized by uniform, localized disturbances, primarily harvest of individual stands-has been substituted for historic disturbances-such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires-that are characterized by patchy effects that occur over thousands of acres. Most riparian management strategies do not recognize the role of disturbance events that occur on larger scales, and instead focus on retaining small scale disturbances, such as debris flows, to provide in-stream habitat features. As implemented, current forest practices rules dictate novel landscape patterns and our research base is not prepared to address the consequences of these practices.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650469631

The purpose of the new management area is to restore pre-European settlement forest conditions and recreate habitat for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. Approach: This study explored the effects of restoring an ecosystem, from changes in the growth patterns of individual trees to ecosystem valuation of the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. It developed procedures for estimating the magnitude of economic impacts resulting from changes in timber production in the pine-bluestem management to project the value of conserving red-cockaded woodpeckers. Results: Over the entire simulation period, pine-bluestem management returns 75% of the undiscounted revenue generated by traditional management (660 versus 875 million dollars). For all 40,245 ha of the new management area managed for pine-bluestem, this cost amounts to $2.9 million per year. When combined with the $137 million decline in the present value of projected timber sale revenue from the area, the total cost rises to $4.2 million per year. Conclusion: The implied value for each pair of woodpeckers is either $10,550 per year for the desired 400 total pairs or $16,880 per year for the 250 reproducing pairs. Judging from the changes resulting from the transition to pine-bluestem management, adopting the new scenario will not cause significant adverse regional economic consequences. The success of the pine-bluestem restoration requires the maintenance of a burning regime that prevents competing vegetation from occupying the middle canopy layer. © 2010 Science Publications.","Economic impact assessment; Ecosystem valuation; Ouachita national forest; Pine-bluestem; Pinus echinata Mill; Red-cockaded woodpecker; Shortleaf pine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951799801

The DINDIS database results from the monitoring of bird communities occupying all areas affected by large wildfires in Catalonia since 2000. We used bird surveys conducted from 2006 to 2009 and performed a principal components analysis to describe two main gradients of variation in the composition of bird communities, which were used as descriptors of bird communities in subsequent analyses. We then analysed the relationships of these community descriptors with bioclimatic regions within Catalonia, time since fire and pre-fire vegetation (forest or shrubland). We have conducted 1,918 bird surveys in 567 transects distributed in 56 burnt areas. Eight out of the twenty most common detected species have an unfavourable conservation status, most of them being associated to open-habitats. Both bird communities' descriptors had a strong regional component and were related to pre-fire vegetation, and to a lesser extent to the time since fire. We came to the conclusion that the responses of bird communities to wildfires are heterogeneous, complex and context dependent. Large-scale monitoring datasets, such as DINDIS, might allow identifying factors acting at different spatial and temporal scales that affect the dynamics of species and communities, giving additional information on the causes under general trends observed using other monitoring systems.","Dispersion; Landscape context; Open-habitat species; Pre-fire vegetation; Recently burnt areas; Species colonisation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952158173

Logging implies an additional disturbance occurring shortly after fire, although its ecological effects can be somewhat mitigated by leaving wood debris on site. The composition of the bird community and its capacity to provide ecosystem services such as seed dispersal of fleshy-fruited plants have been shown to be affected by postfire logging. We assessed the effects of the habitat structure resulting from different postfire management practices on the bird community, in three burned pine forests in Catalonia (western Mediterranean). For this purpose, we focused on the group of species that is responsible for seed dispersal, a process which takes place primarily during the winter in the Mediterranean basin. In addition, we assessed microhabitat selection by seed disperser birds in such environments in relation to management practices. Our results showed a significant, positive relationship between the density of wood debris piles and the abundance of seed disperser birds. Furthermore, such piles were the preferred microhabitat of these species. This reveals an important effect of forest management on seed disperser birds, which is likely to affect the dynamics of bird-dependent seed dispersal. Thus, building wood debris piles can be a useful practice for the conservation of both the species and their ecosystem services, while also being compatible with timber harvesting. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In 2004-2005, researchers initiated a project to investigate the feasibility and practicality of in-house composting of turkey mortalities (heavy hens and toms) as a method of disposal and disease containment. Occurrences of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) in West Virginia and Virginia in 2007 provided an opportunity for first responders to verify composting as an effective carcass disposal method. Many lessons learned from these experiences have led to improvements in the application of this technology. Market-weight turkeys, once thought too large for effective composting, were composted sufficiently for land application within 4 to 6 weeks. Additionally, fire-fighting foam, a new method of mass depopulation, proved to be compatible with composting. Knowledge gained from these incidents will be valuable not only for future responses to LPAI but also for outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza such as the H5N1 virus, which currently causes disease in both animals and humans in many parts of the world. Since three-quarters of all recent emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have arisen from animals, control of disease in animals is the principal way to reduce human exposure and prevent EIDs. Many of the general approaches and specific techniques used to eradicate the avian influenza virus can also be used to control other EIDs such as H1N1, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever, and plague.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954917950

Intensive fire and grazing denude and homogenize vegetation whereas their suppression increases woody cover. Although habitat loss is implicated in grassland bird declines, degradation through intensive management or neglect also decreases breeding habitat and may reduce nesting success through increased rates of nest predation. Snakes are important nest predators, but little is known about how habitat use in snakes relates to predation risk for grassland birds nesting within tallgrass prairie subjected to different grazing and fire frequencies. We evaluated nest survival in the context of habitat used by nesting songbirds and two bird-eating snakes, the eastern yellowbelly racer Coluber constrictor flaviventris and Great Plains ratsnake Pantherophis emoryi. Daily nest survival rates decreased with increasing shrub cover and decreasing vegetation height, which characterize grasslands that have been neglected or intensively managed, respectively. Discriminant function analysis revealed that snake habitats were characterized by higher shrub cover, whereas successful nests were more likely to occur in areas with tall grass and forbs but reduced shrub cover. Because snakes often use shrub habitat, birds nesting in areas with increased shrub cover may be at higher risk of nest predation by snakes in addition to other predators known to use shrub habitat (e. g., mid-sized carnivores and avian predators). Depredated nests also occurred outside the discriminant space of the snakes, indicating that other predators (e. g., ground squirrels Spermophilus spp. and bullsnakes Pituophis catenifer) may be important in areas with denuded cover. Targeted removal of shrubs may increase nest success by minimizing the activity of nest predators attracted to shrub cover. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Fire; Grazing; Nest success; Predator-prey relationships; Tallgrass prairie",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949268938

We quantified nest survival and identified nest predators of shrub-nesting songbirds within 4 large (approx. 40-ha) exclosures and 4 control sites within a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. During 2003-2006, we located and monitored 535 shrub nests (222 with videography) for 4,804 nest-days to quantify daily nest survival and document predation events. We found no support for a treatment effect, suggesting mesopredators had little impact on daily nest survival (0.9303 in controls and 0.9260 in exclosures) of shrub-nesting songbirds. For the 5 most commonly monitored species, daily nest survival within species was constant. Our analysis suggested that shrub nests were most vulnerable during the nestling stage and presence of cameras on nests increased survival with the increase in survival being more pronounced during the incubation stage. We filmed 107 nest predation events, identifying predators at 88 nests. Of these 88 nests, snakes caused 33%, red imported fire ants (hereafter fire ants, Solenopsis invicta) 28%, raptors 17%, corvids 8%, mesopredators 6%, and small mammals 8% of nest predations. Cause-specific nest predation in controls and exclosures did not differ from expectation, providing evidence that compensatory predation did not occur. Nest predators differed from expectation with regard to nest stage; fire ants and raptors only depredated nests during the nestling stage. Presence of cameras had no effect on nest abandonment. Fire ants were the most prevalent nest predator, and nest predation by fire ants was only observed on nestlings, potentially reducing likelihood of renesting. Magnitude and timing of fire ant predation suggests that fire ants may be the most influential nest predator of shrub-nesting birds within the longleaf pine ecosystem. Our data suggest that controlling mesopredators will have no effect on nest success of shrub-nesting birds within longleaf pine forests. © 2010 The Wildlife Society.","Avian productivity; Longleaf pine ecosystem; Mesomammal; Nest success; Pinus palustris; Predator control; Predator exclosure; Red imported fire ant; Shrub-nesting bird; Solenopsis invicta",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73449138730

Large groups occurred at burnt sites, while at unburnt sites group size was smaller owing to a higher proportion of pair-sized groups. Bush fire destroyed habitat and forced resident birds to emigrate. Conversely, unburnt sites were used as a refuge during fires. However, in the non-breeding season, such stable habitats were occupied by stable and small-sized groups and were already saturated. Therefore, individuals that immigrated into these habitats during fires were forced to emigrate again. After a fire, many birds invaded burnt sites from the surrounding area and aggregated in large but unstable flocks that consequently diminished due to the individual separation of young males just before the breeding season.

However, no such significant differences have been detected in the nest predation rate, incubation period, fledging period, number of broods per season. Insuffcient data exists regarding the provisioning rate, food size and total amount of foods for chicks. In Australian monsoon tropics, which are characterized by a small seasonal change in temperature and by the distinct alteration of six-month dry season and wet season, the seasonal variation of food abundance, mainly invertebrates and nectar, is smaller than in northern temperate areas. Although breeding occurs in every month throughout avian communities, there are diverged patterns of breeding seasons among species. Most life history traits show a similar tendency to those of birds in other tropical areas. Low adult mortality and low population turnover cause the delayed first breeding in young and delayed natal dispersal, which is a causal factor for the cooperative breeding system that prevails among Australian bird species. Frequent wildfires adversely influence the breeding of grass-nesting species. In contrast, some adaptation to fires is evident, e.g., enhanced reproductive success by virtue of new food resources and foraging habitats created by fires or behaviours in lessening the damage of fires. © Yamashina Institute for Ornithology.","Clutch sizeLife; History; Monsoon tropics; Protracted breeding season; Savannah",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952935726

Extinction debt is the term used to describe the ongoing loss of species from fragmented landscapes long after the original loss and fragmentation of habitat. However, losses may also result from habitat changes that are unrelated to fragmentation, which reduce breeding success and recruitment. Many woodland birds have declined in fragmented landscapes in Australia, probably due to loss of small, isolated populations, though the ecological processes are poorly understood. We record the progressive regional loss of two ground-foraging, woodland birds, the Brown Treecreeper Climacteris picumnus and Hooded Robin Melanodryas cucullata, in northern New South Wales, over 30 years. This has happened despite most habitat loss occurring over 100 years ago, suggesting the payment of an extinction debt. Our observations suggest that several ecological processes, caused by habitat loss, fragmentation or degradation, and operating over different time scales, have led to both species' declines. Female Brown Treecreepers disperse poorly among vegetation remnants, leaving only males in isolated populations, which then go extinct. In contrast, Hooded Robins suffer high nest predation in fragmented landscapes, producing too few recruits to replace adult mortality. Foraging by both species may also be affected by regrowth of ground vegetation and shrubs. We found little support for a major role played by drought, climate change or aggressive Noisy Miners Manorina melanocephala. We propose that both extinction debt in the classical sense and ongoing habitat change frequently contribute to species' decline in modified landscapes. Management to arrest and reverse such declines needs to consider these multiple causes of decline. For instance, reconnecting isolated populations may be inadequate alone, and activities such as appropriate grazing, fires and the addition of woody debris may also be required. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Brown Treecreeper Hooded Robin; Dispersal; Eucalypt woodland; Habitat change; Habitat fragmentation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350571797

Given its high abundance in recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time. Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success declined from 84% the first year after fire to 73% and 25%, respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests. Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests. Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature and over-mature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Sidamo lark Heteromirafra sidamoensis, confined to the Liben Plain grassland in southern Ethiopia, is critically endangered by bush encroachment, permanent settlement and agricultural conversion.

Density estimates from multi-model inference analysis of distance transect data provided a global population estimate of 90-256 adults (possibly with a serious sex-ratio bias towards males). Logistic regression models of habitat selection showed that males preferentially occurred in areas of grassland with greater cover of medium-length grass (5-15 cm), less cover of bare ground and fewer bushes. Habitat transects extending outward from its core range revealed massive and rapid bush encroachment, corroborating information from semi-structured interviews. The survival of both local Borana pastoralism and this species -mainland Africa's likeliest first avian extinction -depends on restoring seasonal patterns of grazing, resisting agricultural conversion of grasslands, reversing fire suppression policies and clearing bush. © Journal compilation © 2009 The Zoological Society of London.","Borana; Bush encroachment; Ethiopia; Fire suppression; Heteromirafra sidamoensis; Liben plain; Multi-model inference; Pastoralism; Savanna; Sidamo lark; Transhumance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65649113607

It is widely appreciated that management shapes the dynamics of many ecological systems, but ecologists rarely consider the reverse interaction, that is, the ecological influences on management decisions. Reciprocal feedback between management and ecology can cause complex system behaviour. Therefore, better predictions about how external policy-drivers or climate change will affect semi-natural ecosystems may be made when both the ecological and human dimensions are considered. 2. We develop a spatially-explicit model of moorland vegetation dynamics and management decisions about sheep grazing and heather burning in the Peak District National Park, UK. Competition between dwarf shrubs, bracken and graminoids is mediated by grazing, dwarf shrub age (determined by burning rotation) and environmental gradients. Management decisions depend on vegetation cover in a model parameterized through interviews with upland managers. 3. Current management regimes are designed to reverse historical dwarf shrub losses, and simulations suggest that this reversal should occur in the future. After equilibration, grazing densities fall and dwarf shrubs have expanded from their current distribution, mainly at the expense of graminoids. This causes more land to come under managed burning, but current intensities are maintained. 4. Enforcing winter or summer grazing densities influences model vegetation cover and causes other aspects of the management strategy to adapt. For example, when summer grazing is banned, dwarf shrub cover increases and there is a shift towards grouse moor management. 5. Simulations with warmer temperatures indicate that climate change may increase bracken invasion of the moorland and prevent re-vegetation of bare peat. This is associated with a reduction in managed burning that causes the dwarf shrub community to become dominated by the older, degenerate growth phase. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our model suggests that current management paradigms could achieve their aim of restoring historically degraded moorland over the coming century, but that climate change may prevent this from occurring. One application of the model would be to try to design management paradigms that are robust to this. As such, models of coupled human-natural systems can provide a valuable tool for assessing the impacts of policy decisions and climate change on semi-natural ecosystems at landscape scales. © 2009 British Ecological Society.","Calluna vulgaris; Heathland; Landscape ecology; Molinia caerulea; Pteridium aquilinum; Red grouse",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61449175918

Occurrence was recorded on 110 sites a year before, and for 3 years after a major unplanned fire in 2003. Although the Eastern Bristlebird is thought to be sensitive to wildfire, data indicated that the species either persisted continuously on burned sites or returned to previously occupied sites within 2 years. Post-fire site occupancy was associated with several factors: (1) pre-fire site occupancy; (2) vegetation type; (3) spatial heterogeneity in fire and the amount of unburned vegetation surrounding a site; and (4) site-level vegetation structure (e.g. diversity of understorey and midstorey plants). The most likely mechanism underpinning rapid re-occupancy was movement by resident birds to unburned parts elsewhere within their territories. The addition of intensive feral predator baiting within the present study suggests that predation may have a more important effect on populations after unplanned fires than formerly recognised. Our results have significant implications for fire management in areas where the Eastern Bristlebird occurs. Care should be taken with back-burning during unplanned fires and the spatial and temporal arrangement of prescribed fires to ensure unburned vegetation remains as refugia to facilitate bird persistence.","Avifauna; South-eastern Australia; Vegetation management.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60849096126

Building several models that incorporate different potential causal factors is a useful way of formalising alternative hypotheses. We developed a series of models to test hypotheses about the factors influencing the distribution of a species of conservation importance - the hen harrier Circus cyaneus. A climate-based model using continental distribution data was consistent with the continental distribution and observational studies in Britain. According to the climate-model the parts of Britain occupied by the hen harrier are the least climatically suitable. Habitat-based models using detailed distribution data from seven Scottish areas explained the recent British distribution well, with birds largely confined to heather dominated areas. These patterns were inconsistent with historical data on the species' distribution, its habitat use in other parts of its range and with the climate-based model. Our burn intensity index of gamekeeper activity was highly correlated with climatic suitability within the best 25% of 10 km squares by modelled habitat suitability, negatively associated with the productivity data and associated with a decrease in abundances between 1998 and 2004. Gamekeeper activity may be keeping hen harriers out of the most climatically suitable areas with habitat similar to that which they currently occupy within Britain and or keeping the population numbers too low and isolated for the natural re-expansion of the species into parts of the range where it was historically extirpated. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimate the global population size to be 16,821 individuals (range 8431-39, 104), 68% greater than the previously estimated 10,000 individuals, with a single large reserve containing the majority (∼92%) of the global population. The Mallee Emu-wren is a habitat specialist, primarily occurring in mallee-Triodia vegetation that has not been burnt for at least 15 years. The highest densities were in vegetation associations containing at least a 15% cover of Triodia, however, time since the habitat was last burnt was the overriding factor in determining densities. Large-scale wildfires are a pervasive threat to the global status of the Mallee Emu-wren, and the risk to remaining populations is exacerbated by the adverse impact of prolonged drought and the potential for altered fire regimes caused by global warming. Evaluation of the global population status, and the continued wildfire threat warranted recent reclassification of the Mallee Emu-wren from Vulnerable to Endangered according to IUCN Red List categories and criteria. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Q fever may be present as an acute or a chronic infection and can be reactivated during subsequent pregnancies. Although its exact prevalence remains unknown, it is likely that the number of cases of Q fever in pregnant women is underestimated. During pregnancy, the illness is likely to be asymptomatic, and diagnosis is based on serology. Acute infection results in appearance of IgM and IgG antibodies mainly directed against the avirulent form of C. burnetii (phase II). Chronic Q fever results in particularly high level of IgG and IgA antibodies directed against both virulent (phase I) and avirulent (phase II) forms of the bacterium. Q fever may result in adverse pregnancy outcome, including spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, oligoamnios, intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), and premature delivery. Obstetric complications occur significantly more often as C. burnetii infects the patient at an early stage of her pregnancy. Occurrence of IUFD is correlated with the presence of placental infection by C. burnetii and might be the consequence of direct infection of the fetus. The mother is exposed to the risk of chronic Q fever and endocarditis with potential fatal evolution. Long-term cotrimoxazole therapy prevents from placental infection, IUFD, and maternal chronic Q fever. Such treatment should be used to treat pregnant women with Q fever. Women with previous history of Q fever should have a regular serological follow up. Obstetricians' knowledge about Q fever must be improved. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.","Coxiella burnetii; Pregnancy; Q fever; Stillbirth; Trimethoprim- Sulfamethoxazole combination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649713492

Human intoxications are due to consumption of seafood and respiratory exposure to aerosolized toxins. Algal toxins are also responsible for extensive die-offs of fish and shellfish, as well as mortality in seabirds, marine mammals and other animals depending on marine food web. Lots of information are available concerning acute intoxications, while little is known about environmental health effects of chronic exposure to low levels of algal toxins. Toxins are produced by two algal groups, dinoflagellates and diatoms, representing about 2% of known phytoplankton species (60-80 species out of 3400-4000) and can reach humans directly (via consumption of shellfish) or through food web transfer to higher trophic levels (zooplankton and herbivorous fish). Most toxins are neurotoxins and all are temperature stable, so cooking does not ameliorate toxicity in contaminated seafoods; five seafood poisoning syndromes exists: paralytic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, ciguatera fish poisoning, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, and amnesic shellfish poisoning. Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) is caused by the consumption of molluscan shellfish contaminated with a suite of heterocyclic guanidines collectively called saxitoxins (STXs), causing almost 2,000 cases of human poisonings per year, with a 15% mortality rate. In addition to human intoxications, PSP has been implicated in deaths of birds and humpback whales. STX elicits its effects by inhibiting sodium channel conductance and there-by causing blockade of neuronal activity, mainly at the peripheral nervous system level, where its binding results in rapid onset of symptoms (less than 1 hr) that are classic for PSP: tingling and numbness of the perioral area and extremities, loss of motor control, drowsiness, incoherence, and in the case of high doses, respiratory paralysis. Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP) generally results from consumption of molluscan shellfish contaminated with brevetoxins (PbTx), a suite of nine structurally related ladderlike polycyclic ether toxins. Brevetoxins bind with high affinity sodium channel altering the voltage sensitivity of the channel, resulting in inappropriate opening of the channel under conditions in which it is normally closed, and inhibiting channel inactivation, resulting in persistent activation or prolonged channel opening. Symptoms of NSP include nausea, tingling and numbness of the perioral area, loss of motor control, and severe muscular ache. NSP has not been documented as a fatal intoxication in humans. Gymnodinium breve red tides are also frequently associated with massive fish kills. The extreme sensivity of fish may result from lysis of cells passing through the gills, with direct transfer of toxin across the gill epithelium. G. breve was also responsible of a manatees dieoff in Florida concurrent with a persistent red tide. The demonstration of brevetoxin immunoreactivity in lymphoid tissue of the manatees raises the possibility of immunosuppression as a second mode by which brevetoxin exposure may affect human health, particularly in individuals with chronic exposure to aerosolized toxin during prolonged red tide incidents. Ciguatera Fish Poisoning (CFP) is another seafood intoxication caused by ladderlike polyether toxins, primarily attributed to the dinoflagellate, Gambierdiscus toxicus, which produces a precursors to ciguatoxin which is biotransformed to ciguatoxins and bioaccumulated in the highest trophic levels. Large carnivorous fishes associated with coral reefs are a frequent source of ciguatera. Baracuda, snapper, grouper, and jacks are particularly notorious for their potential to carry high toxin loads; however, smaller herbivorous fishes may also be ciguatoxic, particularly when viscera are consumed. CFP is estimated to affect over 50,000 people annually and is no longer a disease limited to the tropics because of travel to the tropics and shipping of tropical fish species to markets elsewhere in the world; outbreaks are sporadic and unpredictable at others. The symptoms of ciguatera vary somewhat geographically as well as between individuals and incidents and may also vary temporally within an area, but they generally include early onset (2-6 hr) gastrointestinal disturbance-nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea-and may be followed by a variety of later onset (18 hr) neurologic sequelae such as numbness of the perioral area and extremities, reversal of temperature sensation, muscle and joint aches, headache, itching, tachycardia, hypertension, blurred vision, and paralysis. Ciguatera on rare occasions can be fatal. A chronic phase may follow acute intoxication and can persist for weeks, months, or even years. Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) is a comparatively milder seafood intoxication that consists of rapid onset (3 hr) gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea that generally resolve within 2-3 days. The diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DTX) are a class of acidic polyether toxins consisting of at least eight congeners including the parent compound, okadaic acid. Okadaic acid, DTX-1, and DTX-2 are the primary congeners involved in shellfish poisoning, with the other congeners believed to be either precursors or shellfish metabolites of the active toxins. The DTXs are inhibitors of ser/thr protein phosphatases. Ser/thr protein phosphatases are critical components of signaling cascades in eukaryotic cells that regulate a diverse array of cellular processes involved in metabolism, ion balance, neurotransmission, and cell cycle regulation. Diarrhea associated with DSP is most likely due to the hyperphosphorylation of proteins, including ion channels, in the intestinal epithelia, resulting in impaired water balance and loss of fluids. Okadaic acidlike polyether toxins have been identified as tumor promotors, thus raising the question of what effect low levels of chronic exposure to DSP toxins may have on humans as well as wildlife such as marine turtles. Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) is the only shellfish intoxication caused by a diatom (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.). The first recorded occurrence of ASP was in Prince Edward Island, Canada in 1987 when approximately 100 people became ill and several died after consuming contaminated mussels. The toxic agent involved in the outbreak was identified as domoic acid. Domoic acid is a water-soluble tricarboxylic amino acid that acts as an analog of the neurotransmitter glutamate and is a potent glutamate receptor agonist. The symptoms of ASP include gastrointestinal effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and neurologic effects such as dizziness, disorientation, lethargy, seizures, and permanent loss of short-term memory. Persistent activation of the kainate glutamate receptor results in greatly elevated intracellular Ca 2+ through cooperative interactions with N-methyl-d-aspartate and non-N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor subtypes followed by activation of voltage dependent calcium channels. Neurotoxicity due to domoic acid results from toxic levels of intracellular calcium, which leads to neuronal cell death and lesions in areas of the brain where glutaminergic pathways are heavily concentrated. The CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, an area responsible for learning and memory processing, are particularly susceptible. However, memory deficits occur at doses below those causing structural damage. Domoic acid has been identified as the causative agent in the mass mortality of pelicans and cormorants in Monterey Bay, California, in 1991 and in the extensive die-off of California sea lions in the same region in 1998. In both instances the vector for toxin transfer was anchovy. Pfiesteria Piscicida, a fish-killing dinoflagellate first identified in aquaculture tanks in North Carolina, has been linked to fish kills in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States and is characterized by the presence of open, ulcerative lesions. Pfiesteria has been termed an ""ambush predator"" because it is believed to release a toxin that narcotizes or kills fish and then phagocytizes the sloughed tissue from its prey. Pfiesteria has been linked to a human intoxication syndrome, with symptoms that include fatigue, headache, respiratory irritation, skin lesions or burning sensations on contact, disorientation, and memory loss. The toxins responsible for fish lethality or neurologic symptoms have not yet been identified. There is currently no evidence that toxicity is transferred through food. In conclusion we can state that marine algal toxins impact human health through seafood consumption and respiratory routes. The apparent increase in their occurrence over the past three decades has raised alarm and lead to the establishment of algal and toxin monitoring programs which will assist in providing time series needed to assess interannual and long-term variability in algal and toxin occurrence. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Algae; Syndromes; Toxins; Treatment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961197303

Every year many parts of the biome change from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and vice-versa. The degree of inundation creates a range of major habitats. Flooding occupies about 80% of the whole Pantanal. In contrast, during the dry season, most of the flooded areas stay dry, when the water returns to the river beds or evaporates. The Pantanal is a large continental savanna wetland (147,574 km2 in Brazil), touching Bolivia to the north and Paraguay to the south. The maze of fluctuating water levels, nutrients, and biota forms a dynamic ecosystem. The vegetation comprises 1,863 phanerogam plant species listed for the floodplain and 3,400 for the whole basin and 250 species of aquatic plants. The complex vegetation cover and seasonal productivity support a diverse and abundant fauna within the floodplain: 263 species of fish, 41 of amphibians, 113 of reptiles (177 for the basin), 463 of birds and 132 mammal species. Many endangered species occur, including jaguar (Panthera onca Linnaeus, 1758). Waterfowl are exceptionally abundant during the dry season. Analysis of the root causes of the threats to biodiversity indicated that deforestation (17% of the Pantanal and 63% of the surrounding uplands) with modification and loss of natural habitats due to cattle ranching, unsustainable agriculture, mining, environmental contamination (including mercury, pesticides, urban sewage), non organized tourism, fire, disturbances at the upstream region modifying hydrological flow, erosion, weak implementation and enforcement of legislation are the major issues to face conservation action and sustainable use. Under an evolutionary focus, local biodiversity seems to be well adapted to seasonal shrinking and expansion of natural habitats due to flooding. However, the conversion of natural vegetation due to human occupation is a real threat to biodiversity.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Fauna; Flora; Pantanal",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60049093628

Because most species of grassland birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines, especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an alternative grassland management practice known as patch-burning has been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296 dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures. Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides further evidence that this practice can be a useful tool for grassland bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation, patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g., trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects of grazing, which are not available under traditional management. Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains.","Dickcissel; Grazing; Logistic exposure; Nest success; Oklahoma; Patch-burn management; Prescribed fire; Spiza americana; Tallgrass prairie",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53049110594

However, their spatial effects have not been evaluated. Our goal was to model the human footprint across the western United States. We first delineated the actual area occupied by anthropogenic features, the physical effect area. Next, we developed the human footprint model based on the ecological effect area, the zone influenced by features beyond their physical presence, by combining seven input models: three models quantified top-down anthropogenic influences of synanthropic predators (avian predators, domestic dog and cat presence risk), and four models quantified bottom-up anthropogenic influences on habitat (invasion of exotic plants, human-caused fires, energy extraction, and anthropogenic wildland fragmentation). Using independent bird population data, we found bird abundance of four synanthropic species to correlate positively with human footprint intensity and negatively for three of the six species influenced by habitat fragmentation. We then evaluated the extent of the human footprint in relation to terrestrial (ecoregions) and aquatic systems (major rivers and lakes), regional management and conservation status, physical environment, and temporal changes in human actions. The physical effect area of anthropogenic features covered 13% of the western United States with agricultural land (9.8%) being most dominant. High-intensity human footprint areas (class 8-10) overlapped highly productive low-elevation private landholdings and covered 7% of the western United States compared to 48% for lowintensity areas (class 1-3), which were confined to low-productivity high-elevation federal landholdings. Areas within 1 km of rivers were more affected by the human footprint compared to lakes. Percentage human population growth was higher in low-intensity human footprint areas. The disproportional regional effects of the human footprint on landscapes in the western United States create a challenge to management of ecosystems and wildlife populations. Using footprint models, managers can plan land use actions, develop restoration scenarios, and identify areas of high conservation value at local landscapes within a regional context. Moreover, human footprint models serve as a tool to stratify landscapes for studies investigating floral and faunal response to human disturbance intensity gradients. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Abiotic interaction; Anthropogenic disturbance; Ecological human footprint; Human footprint; Human population growth; Land stewardship; Landscape management; Physical human footprint; Western United States",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55949107812

It plays an important role in nutrient cycling and is an important food resource for many vertebrate species, especially migratory birds. We used data collected over a 16-year period to examine population dynamics of a tagged population of C. florida in a 6.4 ha area in the context of change in the protected Quercus-Carya forest of the Ross Biological Reserve, Indiana. We examined the hypothesis that forest dynamics result from interactions between long-term ecological succession and pathogens. The C. florida population at the Ross Reserve declined by 50% between 1983 and 2000, with a survivorship of 24%. Analysis of 40 years of forest survey data showed that Quercus and Carya populations declined in importance, while Acer saccharum increased dramatically. This change in forest structure is consistent with successional changes occurring throughout the Midwest and can be attributed to suppression of disturbance. Cornus florida declined more sharply where A. saccharum increased. From 1983 to 1999, C. florida were less likely to survive if they were within 5 m of a A. saccharum. Light measurements showed that A. saccharum abundance correlated negatively with light available to C. florida, suggesting that increased shading by A. saccharum contributed to C. florida decline. The fungus, Discula destructiva causes the disease dogwood anthracnose that is associated with widespread decline of C. florida in the eastern United States. Tests for this pathogen in our study area were mostly negative. Other tests revealed that Armillaria root rot infected most C. florida, but this disease seemed to be a secondary effect of shading by A. saccharum. These results suggest that the lack of fire and other anthropogenic disturbances has resulted in an accelerated shift in dominance from Quercus and Carya to A. saccharum in the main canopy, and this shift, in turn, has resulted in increased shading of C. florida and its decline in previously more open Midwestern forests. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cornus florida; Forest dynamics; Pathogens; Succession",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38749145580

Although occurring at low densities in the plains as larvae, when they estivate gregariously densities reach high levels, so that any chemicals carried by them are concentrated. One such chemical is arsenic, which is concentrated to phytotoxic levels in the soils surrounding estivation sites. Vegetation may recover as arsenic is made unavailable by time or by fire. This may be a cyclical process that has occurred many times in the past. Bogong moths are an important food for birds and small mammals, and arsenic has been found in the food chain, although bird deaths and population declines in small mammals cannot be positively ascribed to arsenic.

To test the hypothesis that shrub seedling density in wet pine savannas was limited by dispersal and thus the availability of perches for seed-dispersing birds, seed traps and artificial perches were placed near and away from pines. To measure fire-induced mortality of trees and shrubs, Pinus elliottii juveniles and shrub seedlings that had emerged during a fire-free interval were quantified before and after fires. Trees provided perches for birds that dispersed shrubs, thereby reducing dispersal limitation of shrubs. Significantly more seeds of the shrubs, Ilex glabra and I. vomitoria, were encountered in seed traps at the bases of P. elliottii than in areas away from trees in two consecutive years. Seedlings of woody species with fleshy fruits occurred more frequently at the bases of artificial perches than away from perches, and the effect of the perches on seedling density was greater away from trees. Eight- and nine-year periods without fire were not long enough for the majority (>99%) of post-fire recruits of P. elliottii to grow large enough to survive growing-season fires. A small but greater fraction of shrub seedlings (10%) survived the fires. We argue that periodic fires are sufficient to preclude further invasion of wet pine savannas by P. elliottii, expansion of shrub thickets, and associated declines in plant diversity.","Dispersal limitation; Fire interval; Ilex glabra; Pine savanna; Pinus elliottii",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349126838

Soil erosion is described as an accelerated process under which soil is bodily displaced and transported away faster than it can be formed. The agents of soil erosion are principally running water, glaciers, waves and wind. These are natural agents of erosion. Anthropogenic factors also contribute to soil erosion, particularly in this zone. Erosion usually transports rocky materials or soil particles after the processes of weathering have broken them down into smaller pieces which are moveable. Soil erosion starts with the delayed type of rainfall droplets, dislodging particles of soils, removing them and eventually depositing them at new location different from the original site. When the surface of soil is not protected by plant covers or any other materials, it erodes or washes away easily. An area is subject to erosion when certain factors are considered. These include geology, landuse practices, geomorphology, climate, soil texture, nature and biodiversity, land conservation practices and environmental management. Soil erosion constitutes the major ecological problems in Southeastern Nigeria. Three types of soil erosion occur in the area, namely sheet, rill and gully erosion. Gully erosion is however the most prominent feature in the landscape of Southeastern Nigeria. The topography, geology, nature and texture of soil, vegetation as well as activities of man contribute to the speedy development and expansion of gullies in the area. The focus of this research project is therefore on gully erosion and its impact in Southeastern states of Anambra, Abia, Enugu, Imo and Ebonyi. Gully erosion in this area is a causative action of nature and man (anthropogenic factors). Man, in most cases remain nonchalant, unconcerned to the consequences of his actions and inactions to the environment. The natural causes of gully erosion are also indirect actions of man which in some cases are even orchestrated for political reasons. In the cause of this study we identified such activities as laterite excavations, bad farming practices, unplanned road construction and urbanization, wood harvesting for fuel and bush burning to clear lands for farming, among others. These activities, coupled with annual flooding from rain water are causing havoc and untold hardship as gullies continue to develop and expand rapidly in the area. Utilizing the opportunities offered by Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS), this research project came up with vital spatial datasets on the spatial distribution, development and impact of gully erosion in Southeastern Nigeria. This paper therefore presents the results of this study, which include i. Comprehensive landcover and landuse mapping of the 5 states of the area with a view to depicting the spatial distribution of gully sites in the area. ii. Comprehensive study of the impact of gully sites on their immediate surroundings, determine the impact on settlements, agricultural farmlands, vegetation and topography. iii. Development of 3D - Digital Terrain Models (DTM) of critical areas in the States for the purpose of studying topography, characteristics and patterns of gully sites. iv. Integration of the DTMs with processed satellite images to generate data for slope analysis and other spatial attributes of gullying. v. Soil loss analyses for the critical areas using Universal Soil loss models to determine the volume of annual soil loss in erosion in the areas.

They are poisonous substances, which occur naturally and are perhaps the most prevalent source of food related health risk in field crops. However, they are almost unrecognized publicly. Consumption of food with high levels can be fatal. Long-term exposure can, amongst other things, increase cancer risk and suppress the immune system. An invaluable web site http://www.inchem.org is available as ""a means of rapid access to internationally peer reviewed information on chemicals commonly used throughout the world, which may also occur as contaminants in the environment and food"". Mycotoxins are a significant component of the site and should be consulted for further information. Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in nature and responsible for producing mycotoxins in agricultural crops. The fungi and mycotoxins are considered generally as being natural and unavoidable. It is accepted that St Anthony's fire (Holy fire), a disease that affected many parts of Europe in the tenth century, was caused by the consumption of rye contaminated with ergot alkaloids, a known mycotoxin of Claviceps purpurea (CAST, 2003). Mycotoxins have plagued mankind before and since the beginning of organized crop production, i.e. always. They attract worldwide scientific, political and economic attention because of the significant economic losses associated with impacts on human health, animal productivity and international trade. Unfortunately, they are also considered as potential weapons and so could enter the food chain by this route. A recent report (CAST, 2003) has a wealth of information regarding mycotoxins, and has been referred to liberally in this overview. It is also available on the World Wide Web. Food contamination with mycotoxins has only been fully appreciated since the 1960's, when an unknown disease of animals occurred in England (CAST, 2003). Over 100 000 turkeys and a large number of ducks and pheasants died. After a huge research effort, a toxic compound produced by the microscopic fungus Aspergillus flavus was discovered in the feeds and was named aflatoxin after the fungus. It is currently thought that many diseases have been caused by mycotoxins (Table 1). Indeed, the consumption of foods with high levels of certain mycotoxins can cause severe illness characterised by vomiting, abdominal pains, pulmonary oedema, convulsions, coma, and (rarely) death. Notable outbreaks were the death of 3 people in Taiwan in 1967 and 100 people in India in 1974, from aflatoxin in rice and corn respectively. Of equal or even greater importance, are long term effects particularly cancer and immune deficiency. Aflatoxins are of particular concern in populations with high levels of hepatitis B as they are shown to be 60 times higher when people have been exposed to the metabolite. The impact of mycotoxins on human and animal health is now recognized and it is estimated that they cause high economic losses. For example, the annual cost in the US alone was estimated as US$1.4 billion (CAST, 2003). The field of mycotoxins is complex and interdisciplinary. It involves 5 interrelated systems (Paterson et al. 2004): - commodity system consists of all aspects of production, marketing, and utilisation; - spoilage system has many interrelated factors, e.g. biological, chemical, physical, micro- and macro-environmental; - mycotoxin system involves 5 subsystems -productivity, metabolism, toxicology, health and wealth; - control system comprises prevention, mycotoxin analysis and segregation of contaminated material, and detoxification. A hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) approach is considered the optimal system for control; and - socio-economic system described as cultural, political and economic. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892331993

Historically stoat research and management has focused on beech forests and little is known about the ecology of stoats in the alpine grasslands occurring above the natural altitudinal limit of beech forest. Several stoat control operations in beech forest valley floors in southern New Zealand assume that adjacent montane areas act as a barrier to stoat immigration. Stoats were live-trapped and radio-tracked in alpine grasslands above the Borland Burn, Fiordland National Park, during the summer and autumn of 2003 and 2004. Seventeen stoats were radio-collared and home ranges were estimated for 11 of them. These home ranges were used in a compositional analysis which showed that these stoats spent significantly more time in alpine grassland than in adjacent beech forest. Range cores calculated for six of these stoats were located high up in alpine grassland and contained very little beech forest. This means that montane areas that contain alpine grasslands are unlikely to be barriers to stoat immigration; rather they may be a source of dispersing stoats that reinvade control areas. Also, endemic animal species that inhabit alpine grasslands could be at risk from stoat predation. © New Zealand Ecological Society.","Chionochloa; Habitat use; Home range",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36048958898

Four experimental units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of 3 replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, North Carolina, USA. Treatments were 1) prescribed burn, 2) mechanical understory reduction (chainsaw-felling of shrubs and small trees), 3) mechanical + burn, and 4) controls. We conducted mechanical treatments in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls. Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird spedes did not detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species richness, total bird density, and some species, induding indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year delay, eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus) dedined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions, and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open habitat while retaining many forest and generalist spedes, but may have short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.","Breeding birds; Burn; Fire surrogate; Fuel reduction; Prescribed fire; Southern appalachians",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48249130385

The three most common zoonotic atypical pathogens are Chlamydophila psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Coxiella burnetii (Q fever). Atypical CAPs are suggested by a distinctive pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement. Zoonotic CAP may be differentiated from nonzoonotic CAP (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionnaire's disease) by a recent zoonotic vector contact history. Zoonotic atypical CAP occurs sporadically, but not randomly, and require close association with the appropriate zoonotic vector to transmit the infection. CAP accompanied by the extrapulmonary finding of splenomegaly in a normal host limits differential diagnostic possibilities to Q fever and psittacosis. Splenomegaly does not occur with other typical or atypical CAP. Another common extrapulmonary finding occurs with some atypical pneumonias, that is, Q fever, psittacosis, and Legionnaire's disease is early mild/transient elevations of serum transaminases indicative of (hepatic) extrapulmonary organ involvement. The case presented is a middle-aged man with longstanding Crohn's disease who was further immunosuppressed by chronic prednisone therapy. The patient presented with CAP and extrapulmonary findings, that is, splenomegaly and increased serum transaminases. He denied recent contact with birds or animals. Because Crohn's disease and Q fever CAP may be accompanied by splenomegaly, the cause of his splenomegaly was a diagnostic dilemma. The patient was treated with levofloxacin. Serologic tests for atypical pathogens (Q fever, psittacosis, Legionnaire's disease, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae) were ordered. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology for Q fever was positive with elevated acute immunoglobulin-M (phase II) titers. Re-questioning of the patient revealed a recent exposure to a neighbor's parturient cat, providing the necessary zoonotic vector contact history for Q fever. The patient responded to levofloxacin, which resulted in resolution of the patient's symptoms, right lower lobe pneumonia, and splenomegaly. Because a prior abdominal computed tomography scan indicated no splenomegaly and his splenomegaly resolved with antimicrobial therapy, the splenomegaly was related to Q fever CAP. © 2007 Mosby, Inc.

In a quasi-natural experiment we examined long-term monitoring data on different components of the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem to trace the effects of disturbances and thus to elucidate cause-and-effect connections between them. The long-term data illustrated the role of food limitation in population regulation in mammals, particularly in migratory wildebeest and nonmigratory buffalo. Predation limited populations of smaller resident ungulates and small carnivores. Abiotic events, such as droughts and floods, created disturbances that affected survivorship of ungulates and birds. Such disturbances showed feedbacks between biotic and abiotic realms. Interactions between elephants and their food allowed savanna and grassland communities to co-occur. With increased woodland vegetation, predators' capture of prey increased. Anthropogenic disturbances had direct (hunting) and indirect (transfer of disease to wildlife) effects. Slow and rapid changes and multiple ecosystem states became apparent only over several decades and involved events at different spatial scales. Conservation efforts should accommodate both infrequent and unpredictable events and long-term trends. Management should plan on the time scale of those events and should not aim to maintain the status quo. Systems can be self-regulating through food availability and predator-prey interactions; thus, culling may not be required. Ecosystems can occur in multiple states; thus, there may be no a priori need to maintain one natural state. Finally, conservation efforts outside protected areas must distinguish between natural change and direct human-induced change.

While PBDEs play a key role in reducing loss of human life and property from fires, these flame retardants have become pervasive organic contaminants in the environment and in the tissues of fish, birds, marine mammals, and humans. Levels of PBDEs in wildlife and humans continue to rise, raising concerns about potential ecological and health risks associated with exposure to these chemicals. Nevertheless, there is little currently known about the toxicological effects of PBDE exposure. Here, we examined the developmental toxicity of the PBDE congener 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE 47) using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an ontogenetic model. Zebrafish embryos were exposed continuously to dissolved phase PBDE 47 (100-5000 μg/l) beginning 3-5 h post-fertilization (hpf). Fish treated with the highest concentrations of PBDE 47 delayed hatching, had reduced growth post-hatching, and displayed an abnormal dorsal curvature of the body with flexion at the hindbrain. By 96 h post-fertilization larvae exposed to PBDE 47 had significant tachycardia, which progressed into atrioventricular block arrhythmias. Microinjection of fluorescent dye into the hindbrain ventricle revealed that cerebrospinal fluid in the neural tube and brain ventricles flowed more slowly in fish larvae exposed to PBDE 47, a likely etiology for the dorsal curvature. Similar, though much less pronounced, developmental toxicity also occurred in larvae exposed to PBDE 47 only for a 20 h period during early embryogenesis (3-23 hpf), suggesting that PBDEs incorporated in lipid of the egg are bioavailable and cause toxicity later in life. Taken together, this work indicates that exposure to PBDE 47 can cause morphological abnormalities, impair cardiovascular function and cerebrospinal fluid flow, and provides a tractable starting point for using the zebrafish model to explore molecular mechanisms of PBDE toxicity. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Territ. 0831, Australia","We studied the response of vegetation and vertebrate assemblages to fire and grazing, and their interacting effects, in Eucalyptus woodland in north-eastern Australia. In this vegetation type, many pastures remain free of cattle grazing due to the occurrence of a native shrub poisonous to livestock. Vegetation (floristic data and 22 habitat variables) and vertebrate fauna (birds, mammals, reptiles) were sampled in 29 standardized 50 × 50-m quadrats in the 2001 wet season, representing four treatments: sites burnt recently (within 2 y) and grazed by cattle (4-8 ha per livestock unit); sites unburnt (last burnt >2 y ago) and grazed; sites burnt recently and ungrazed; and unburnt and ungrazed sites. Fire and grazing had a significant influence on vegetation: both grazing and fire reduced ground cover (fire in grazed sites 51-23%, fire in ungrazed sites 68-39%) and increased the cover of forbs (8% in burnt and grazed sites, 3% if ungrazed) and tussock grasses (20% in grazed and unburnt sites and 5% when ungrazed). Grazing caused a shift in floristic composition from the perennial hummock grass Trioda pungens to tussock grasses (e.g. Aristida spp., Enneapogon spp.), forbs (e.g. Phyllanthus spp.) and shrubs (e.g. Acacia spp.). Of the vertebrate groups, birds responded more to fire effects (9 species), reptiles to grazing effects (6 species) and mammals to the interaction (2 species). Species reacted to increases in bare ground (e.g. crested pigeon Ocyphaps lophotes, hooded robin Melanodryas cucullatus, Ctenophorus nuchalis) and to the dominant ground cover (e.g. Ctenotus pantherinus) or change in vegetation architecture (e.g. singing honeyeater Lichenostomus virescens, variegated fairy-wren Malurus lamberti). The clearest example of an interacting effect was the cycle of complementary dominance between the rodents Pseudomys delicatulus and P. desertor, the latter's post-fire recovery becoming more muted in sites where cattle grazed (modelled time for population recovery twice as long as in ungrazed sites).

However, it is only recently that an appreciable amount of scientific data has emerged on this topic. In this report, we present our review of the similarities and differences between the ecological effects of fire- and harvesting-induced disturbances that have been noted in the scientific literature. Comparisons of the effects of these disturbances on numerous forest attributes (coarse woody debris, soil nutrients, productivity, plant diversity, wildlife response) are presented at two distinct spatial scales: stand and landscape. At the stand scale, our review noted significant differences between harvesting and wildfire early after disturbance. Structurally, young post-fire stands are characterized by more snags, less downed woody debris, and significantly thinner forest floors than logged sites. Additionally, while both disturbances generate a pulse of extractable nutrients, the intensity of the pulse is greater after wildfire than clearcut harvesting and an increase in soil pH is observed after fire as opposed to little change or a slight decrease after harvesting. Early after disturbance, biodiversity elements significantly differ between burned and logged sites. Dissimilar understory vascular and non-vascular communities generally colonize burned and logged sites, although differences are usually a question of abundance rather than species absence/presence. As compared to fire, faunal assemblages, be it mammals, invertebrates or birds, all seem to respond differently to harvesting. Among these faunal groups, species specifically associated with snags were the most likely to show a contrasting response to harvesting- and wildfire-induced disturbances. Tree species respond differently to fire- and harvesting-induced disturbances, with harvesting favouring the establishment of deciduous species (notably trembling aspen, Populus tremulpides) and of coniferous tree species not adapted to fire such as balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Furthermore, there are commonly more residual deciduous trees in clearcuts than in fires. Because of this and the differential response of tree species to these two types of disturbances, divergent successional patterns with respect to overstory tree species compositions can be observed in burned and harvested stands. While we noted some variability among studies, stand and tree productivity are generally similar in burned and logged sites. When the effects of harvesting- and wildfire-induced disturbances are compared at longer temporal scales, our review noted that most forest attributes that were reported as dissimilar early after disturbance converged a few decades post-disturbance. Nonetheless, thicker forest floors observed after logging as compared to fire appear to persist numerous decades after disturbance. Additionally, while faunal communities do become less different as time passes, late in succession, some species present in burned stands are either significantly less abundant or absent in similarly aged logged stands. Finally, several studies warn that while the effects of wildfire- and harvesting-induced disturbances do not significantly differ after a few decades, there is some concern about the ability of harvesting-induced disturbances to recreate the full range of natural variability observed during post-fire stand succession. Unfortunately, little research has compared the effects of alternative silvicultuial interventions (partial retention, partial cutting, etc.) or site preparation techniques (controlled burning, scarification, etc.) to the effects of wildfires. However, the few studies comparing the effects of post-logging control burns and different levels of retention indicate that these practices may attenuate some of the differences observed early after disturbance. Our review indicates that as compared to wildfire alone, salvage logging can have significant effects on ecological processes, biological legacies and the abundance of species commonly encountered only after fire. Removal of fire-killed trees can affect tree regeneration, understory composition, the abundance and distribution of dead wood, wildlife habitat, and soil properties. Nonetheless, many of these effects are site-specific; hence, additional investments in research are needed to support management decisions and policy development. At the landscape scale, the main difference between fire and harvesting regimes is the distribution of stand age classes. The proportion of stands older than the rotation period (usually 100 yrs) tends toward zero under a fully regulated harvesting regime, while it is around 35% under a fire regime of similar rotation period. This fundamental difference results in a significant loss of advanced seral stage forests in managed landscapes, thereby affecting organisms that are primarily associated with such stands. Interestingly, since harvesting-induced disturbances are unable to recreate the conditions commonly found in young burned stands, landscapes under the influence of harvesting will also be characterized by a reduction of stands capable of replacing the ecological role of young burned stands within landscapes. Unfortunately, only a few studies have empirically compared the effects of wildfire and harvesting at the landscape scale under similar rotation periods. Nonetheless, research demonstrates that fires usually produce more heterogeneous landscapes than clearcuts, with more remnant islands. Fires are also more complex in shape, and have edges that are more gradual than clearcuts. In conclusion, our review reveals two main challenges faced by forest managers in order to generate similar ecological effects as produced by fire. First, managers need to improve management practices in order to minimize the differences observed between young post-harvest stands and young post-fire stands, particularly with respect to coarse woody debris and soil conditions. Second, managers need to maintain some areas with the tree species composition and structural attributes characteristic of over-mature fire-origin stands. Such stands can occupy a significant portion of fire-mediated landscapes. This may necessitate lengthening the rotation period of a certain proportion of stands within managed landscapes or may require the application of alternative harvesting methods that can recreate the structure and tree composition characteristic of advanced serai stage stands. This review concludes by identifying future research needs that might help meet these challenges. © 2006 by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc.","Biodiversity; Clearcut; Coarse woody debris; Compound disturbance; Disturbance regime; Forest productivity; Harvesting landscape; Landscape composition; Landscape configuration; Salvage logging; Scientific literature review; Soil nutrients; Soil organic matter",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33751189836

At the time of the fire, studies of two subalpine faunal assemblages were being undertaken. The opportunity to resurvey the assemblages was taken in order to examine the immediate impact of fire in an environment where it is uncommon but predicted to occur increasingly with global warming. A study area in the Whites River Valley, where the number of bird species was counted monthly from 1996 to 2003, and weekly in late winter-spring from 2000 to 2003, was burnt in one fire. As well as the expected decrease in the number of individual birds, the fire resulted in an immediate decrease in the number of bird species, unlike in previously studied montane forest, with only the regularly wintering species plus the olive whistler and the ground-feeding flame robin remaining. During the post-winter avian immigration, few regular spring migrants appeared on burnt sites despite their nearby presence on the unburnt side of the valley. Five of six small mammal trapping grids were burnt. As with fires at lower altitudes, there was an immediate reduction in mammal numbers on burnt grids following the fire, but in addition, one species, Mastacomys fuscus, declined further in the ensuing 2 months both on burnt and unburnt sites. Numbers of Antechinus swainsonii and Rattus fuscipes stabilized until autumn/winter when there was a further decline due to the unavailability of subnivean space to allow winter foraging, allied with a concentration of fox predation on areas still carrying populations of small mammals. © 2006 Ecological Society of Australia.","Alpine; Bird migration; Fox; Small mammal; Snow",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33644887938

At the same time, saw palmetto often is considered a keystone species, serving as habitat or a food source for several hundred mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian and insect species. Due to harvesting pressure on this ecologically important, non-cultivated species, land management practices that produce environmentally sustainable harvests are needed. As part of research focusing on use of controlled burning as a management tool, we investigated effects of burning season and frequency on saw palmetto flowering and fruiting in 32 pine flatwoods sites in central and southwest Florida from 1997 to 1999. The study was conducted as two repeated measures experiments, each involving 16 sites. Each experiment included two among-subjects factors - burning season and past burning frequency - and one within-subjects factor - year - with four replications of each treatment combination. For both experiments, growing season (i.e., April-July) burns had high flowering levels the first year after burning (mean proportion of saw palmettos flowering = 0.49, n = 16 sites), but decreased the second year after burning (mean proportion flowering = 0.15, n = 16 sites), while winter (i.e., November-February) burns had intermediate levels of flowering during both the first and second years after burning (mean proportions flowering = 0.21 and 0.28 for first and second years after burning, n = 16 sites). Although most flowering occurred during April and May, flowering occurred 2-5 months after winter burns, but did not occur until 9-12 months after growing season burns. During the 1997-1998 experiment, fruit infection by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides caused a fruiting failure in all sites. During the 1998-1999 experiment, fruit yields were higher in growing season burns only in infrequently burned (i.e., burned less often than every 5 years) sites, and only in 1998 (mean fruit yields = 325 kg/ha and 0.25 kg/ha for growing season, infrequently burned sites and winter, infrequently burned sites; n = 4 sites in each group). Frequently burned (i.e., burned every 2-3 years) sites generally had low fruit yields (mean fruit yields = 163 kg/ha and 242 kg/ha for frequently burned sites in 1998 and 1999; n = 8 sites). Although controlled burning can be an effective management tool in producing economically sustainable saw palmetto fruit harvests, land managers also must consider ecological needs of other plant and animal species when planning environmentally sustainable burning regimes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Classically, EDs act genomically, with agonistic or antagonistic effects on steroid receptors and may alter reproductive function and/or cause feminisation by binding to oestrogen or androgen receptors; their binding to the thyroid receptor may dysregulate the neuroendocrine system. Recently, it has been shown that EDs can also act by non-genomic mechanisms, altering steroid synthesis (inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoforms) or steroid metabolism. The alkylphenol and phthalate plasticisers inhibit the inactivation of oestrogens by sulphation (via SULT 1A1 and 1E1 isoforms) and so cause a rise in levels of the free active endogenous oestrogens. A range of ED effects have been shown in mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibia and aquatic invertebrates but it is not yet clear whether these processes also occur in human beings. It is evident that EDs, as well as altering reproduction, can cause changes in neurosteroid levels and so have the potential to affect immune function, behaviour and memory. This may be of long-term concern since traces of EDs such as plasticisers, brominated fire retardants, sunscreen agents and cosmetic ingredients are widely distributed in the environment and in human biofluids. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In 2002 expeditions to habitat s of the Caucasian Black Grouse (T. m.) in the main range of the Greater Caucasus in Azerbaijan were conducted between May and August. The study comprised a vegetation ecological description of the habitat used by T. m. and an assessment of impacts caused by human activities. Shrubby structures are essential in T. m.'s habitat as they serve as hides and winter diet base. Open terrain mainly provides diet in summer time. However, habitat components such as exposition or inclination seem to be of minor importance. For the first time the bird's habitat was classified by means of vegetation ecological methods. In the study was shown that different human influences closely interfere with the occurrence of T. m. and with its habitat. Intensive grazing and accompanying measures like burning of the tussock vegetation cause direct disturbances and lasting degradation (alteration of the vegetation's composition and erosion) in T. m.'s habitat. In general, excessive grazing is the main threat for the species in Azerbaijan. On the other hand, the species copes quite well with other more sustainable kinds of land use like hay harvesting.","Azerbaijan; Caucasian Black Grouse; Greater Caucasus; Habitat; Mountain ecology; Subalpine vegetation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-29144531330

Many of our current advances in understanding sexual selection, signal evolution and species recognition, biomechanics, sensory and cognitive ecology, and neuro-ethology derive from studies that focus on male signaling activities. Communal sexual displays are a subset of these signaling phenomena, and they merit special attention on two grounds: First, communal displays of acoustically and visually signaling animals are acknowledged to include some of the ""great spectacles of the living world"" (Wilson, 1975). Anyone who has borne witness to the chorusing of periodical cicadas in central and eastern North America or the collective flashing of fireflies in the Indo-Malayan region cannot help but marvel at the sheer numbers of individuals involved and the intensity of their collective signaling output. But, communal sexual displays are noteworthy for more than just masses of participants and their volume of sound or brilliance of light. In many cases, the signals of individual participants are precisely choreographed in space and time, often giving rise to striking alternation or synchrony between neighbors (Alexander, 1975). Here, underlying aesthetic sensibilities may account for much of our interest: Perhaps related to a concern with orderliness and pattern in the natural world, we remain fascinated with synchronous phenomena of all forms (Pikovsky et al., 2002; Strogatz, 2003; see Neda et al., 2000 for an intriguing example from human behavior), particularly when these events defy obvious explanation. And it is this latter point that brings us to our second reason for focusing attention on communal sexual displays: The mechanisms and evolution of an individual's signaling are often concealed from casual view, and it is only when signaling is interactive that these features may be revealed. Moreover, neighbor-neighbor interaction is the natural setting in which male advertisement signaling normally occurs in many species (Bradbury and Vehrencamp, 1998; McGregor, 2005). Thus, we are compelled to examine the interactions in communal displays if we are to acquire a full understanding of the mechanisms regulating signaling and how natural and sexual selection have shaped signal evolution. In this chapter, I describe and analyze communal signaling phenomena found among invertebrate and vertebrate animals. I concentrate on those phenomena that exhibit some sort of fine-scale spatio-temporal structure and have been subjected to experimental analysis in the field or laboratory. By the first limitation, I omit the arena behaviors of lekking birds (see Höglund and Alatalo, 1995 on avian lekking; see also Staicer et al., 1996; Todt and Naguib, 2000; and Naguib, 2005 on the dawn chorus and other vocal interactions in birds) and restrict coverage largely to the chorusing displays of acoustic insects and anurans (Bailey, 1991; Gerhardt and Huber, 2002; Greenfield, 1994a) and the bioluminescent displays of fireflies (Buck and Buck, 1976). Because the latter share various features with choruses, they offer the opportunity to make comparisons across signaling modalities. I also discuss recent findings of chorusing-like displays in animals signaling with substrate vibration (Kotiaho et al., 2004) and reflected light (Backwell et al., 1998), and I entertain the possibility that further analogues are found among yet other modalities (i.e., olfactory and electrostatic signals). In every case, we find a rich source of material for advancing our understanding of animal communication. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645857379

We developed a graphical model based on isodar theory to distinguish between an ideal distribution and an ecological trap. We tested the model's predictions using data on breeding bird populations in managed tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. Between 1992 and 1996 we monitored success for 2600 nests of 26 breeding species in undisturbed, grazed, and burned and grazed plots. We also sampled arthropod biomass and nest predator abundance. Using the isodar model we determined that managed plots are ecological traps: compared with success on plots left undisturbed, nest success on plots that were only grazed was lower, and success on plots that were burned and grazed was substantially lower. Yet birds preferred to nest on managed plots, where arthropod abundance was measurably higher. Reptiles were the most abundant taxon of nest predators, and their abundance was highest in managed plots. Consequently, tree-nesting species had higher nest success than shrub- and ground-nesting birds. Nest success also increased with tree height. We concluded that isodar theory is a useful tool for detecting ecological traps if any component of fitness is measured in addition to animal densities. Our study also suggests that (1) human modification of the environment may alter simultaneously food and predator abundance, (2) the former affects nest site selection and the latter nest success, and (3) such ecosystems are likely to become traps for breeding birds.

In this paper, we use generalised linear models to investigate interrelationships among an index of decline in 1° by 1° cells and measures of grazing intensity and contemporary patterns of burning, together with the environmental variables of rainfall, vegetation and topographic patterning in the landscape. Grazing intensity was the single strongest human effect but strong correlations between grazing intensity and other human influences suggest that these may have been subsumed within the grazing intensity measure. Impacts of grazing may be worse where pastoral settlement occurred earlier. Topographic variation appeared to be a mitigating effect, suggesting a role for 'topographic refuges' from human activities. Relationships among granivore declines, grazing and rainfall are difficult to disentangle using inferential statistics, but a consistent effect is that declines are more severe in areas with greater year-to-year variation in rainfall. We do not suggest that our analyses are conclusive. However, they do support the proposition that better understanding of the causes of decline at finer spatial scales will emerge most strongly in studies that link habitat quality with granivore demography at inland sites of highly variable year-to-year rainfall and with strongly contrasting grazing histories. © CSIRO 2005.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-25144504909

The largest pools of C in the reference watershed (W6) reside in mineral soil organic matter (43% of total ecosystem C) and living biomass (40.5%), with the remainder in surface detritus (14.5%). Repeated sampling indicated that none of these pools was changing significantly in the late-1990s, although high spatial variability precluded the detection of small changes in the soil organic matter pools, which are large; hence, net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in this 2nd growth forest was near zero (± about 20 g C/m2-yr) and probably similar in magnitude to fluvial export of organic C. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of the forest declined by 24% between the late-1950s (462 g C/m2-yr) and the late-1990s (354 g C/m2-yr), illustrating age-related decline in forest NPP, effects of multiple stresses and unusual tree mortality, or both. Application of the simulation model PnET-II predicted 14% higher ANPP than was observed for 1996-1997, probably reflecting some unknown stresses. Fine litterfall flux (171 g C/m2-yr) has not changed much since the late-1960s. Because of high annual variation, C flux in woody litterfall (including tree mortality) was not tightly constrained but averaged about 90 g C/m2-yr. Carbon flux to soil organic matter in root turnover (128 g C/m2-yr) was only about half as large as aboveground detritus. Balancing the soil C budget requires that large amounts of C (80 g C/m2-yr) were transported from roots to rhizosphere carbon flux. Total soil respiration (TSR) ranged from 540 to 800 g C/m2-yr across eight stands and decreased with increasing elevation within the northern hardwood forest near W6. The watershed-wide TSR was estimated as 660 g C/m 2-yr. Empirical measurements indicated that 58% of TSR occurred in the surface organic horizons and that root respiration comprised about 40% of TSR, most of the rest being microbial. Carbon flux directly associated with other heterotrophs in the HBEF was minor; for example, we estimated respiration of soil microarthropods, rodents, birds and moose at about 3, 5, 1 and 0.8 g C/m2-yr, respectively, or in total less than 2% of NPP. Hence, the effects of other heterotrophs on C flux were primarily indirect, with the exception of occasional irruptions of folivorous insects. Hydrologic fluxes of C were significant in the watershed C budget, especially in comparison with NEP. Although atmospheric inputs (1.7 g C/m2-yr) and streamflow outputs (2.7 g C/m2-yr) were small, larger quantities of C were transported within the ecosystem and a more substantial fraction of dissolved C was transported from the soil as inorganic C and evaded from the stream as CO 2 (4.0 g C/m2-yr). Carbon pools and fluxes change rapidly in response to catastrophic disturbances such as forest harvest or major windthrow events. These changes are dominated by living vegetation and dead wood pools, including roots. If biomass removal does not accompany large-scale disturbance, the ecosystem is a large net source of C to the atmosphere (500-1200 g C/m2-yr) for about a decade following disturbance and becomes a net sink about 15-20 years after disturbance; it remains a net sink of about 200-300 g C/m2-yr for about 40 years before rapidly approaching steady state. Shifts in NPP and NEP associated with common small-scale or diffuse forest disturbances (e.g., forest declines, pathogen irruptions, ice storms) are brief and much less dramatic. Spatial and temporal patterns in C pools and fluxes in the mature forest at the HBEF reflect variation in environmental factors. Temperature and growing-season length undoubtedly constrain C fluxes at the HBEF; however, temperature effects on leaf respiration may largely offset the effects of growing season length on photosynthesis. Occasional severe droughts also affect C flux by reducing both photosynthesis and soil respiration. In younger stands nutrient availability strongly limits NPP, but the role of soil nutrient availability in limiting C flux in the mature forest is not known. A portion of the elevational variation of ANPP within the HBEF probably is associated with soil resource limitation; moreover, sites on more fertile soils exhibit 20-25% higher biomass and ANPP than the forest-wide average. Several prominent biotic influences on C pools and fluxes also are clear. Biomass and NPP of both the young and mature forest depend upon tree species composition as well as environment. Similarly, litter decay differs among tree species and forest types, and forest floor C accumulation is twice as great in the spruce-fir-birch forests at higher elevations than in the northern hardwood forests, partly because of inherently slow litter decay and partly because of cold temperatures. This contributes to spatial patterns in soil solution and streamwater dissolved organic carbon across the Hubbard Brook Valley. Wood decay varies markedly both among species and within species because of biochemical differences and probably differences in the decay fungi colonizing wood. Although C biogeochemistry at the HBEF is representative of mountainous terrain in the region, other sites will depart from the patterns described at the HBEF, due to differences in site history, especially agricultural use and fires during earlier logging periods. Our understanding of the C cycle in northern hardwood forests is most limited in the area of soil pool size changes, woody litter deposition and rhizosphere C flux processes. © Springer 2005.","Forest ecosystem; Heterotrophic respiration; Net ecosystem exchange; Primary productivity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-20044395320

The occurrence of fire in the region has been associated with the presence of humans for over 10,000 yr. While pre-European fire regimes are poorly understood, fire is widely thought to have promoted and maintained large expanses of oak forest, woodland, and savanna documented in original land surveys. Forest composition is gradually shifting from fire-tolerant oaks (Quercus spp.) to other species (e.g., maples [Acer spp.]) and suppression of fire has been implicated as a primary cause. Prescribed fire has been used successfully to restore and maintain oak savannas and has been advocated to improve the sustainability of oak forests. Fire ecology research has addressed short-term effects of prescribed fire on habitat structure, breeding bird populations, and nesting productivity. In the short term, prescribed fire reduces habitat suitability for forest-interior birds that nest on the ground and in low shrubs but provides more favorable conditions for disturbance-dependent birds associated with savannas, woodlands, and early-successional forest. The use of prescribed burning requires tradeoffs in terms of management and conservation because some bird species benefit while others are negatively affected, depending on the degree to which fire changes habitat features. There is a critical need for long-term studies to better understand the effects of different fire regimes on bird populations in the eastern deciduous forest region.","Eastern deciduous forest; Fire history; Fire suppression; Forest-interior birds; Maple; Oak; Prescribed fire; Savanna",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-24644457668

In lower elevation, xeric sagebrush communities, the role of fire has changed in recent decades from an infrequent disturbance maintaining a landscape mosaic and facilitating community processes to frequent events that alter sagebrush communities to exotic vegetation, from which restoration is unlikely. Because of cheatgrass invasion, fire-return intervals in these sagebrush ecosystems have decreased from an historical pattern (pre-European settlement) of 30 to >100 yr to 5-15 yr. In other sagebrush communities, primarily higher elevation ecosystems, the lack of fire has allowed transitions to greater dominance by sagebrush, loss of herbaceous understory, and expansion of juniper-pinyon woodlands. Response by birds living in sagebrush habitats to fire was related to the frequency, size, complexity (or patchiness), and severity of the burns. Small-scale fires that left patchy distributions of sagebrush did not influence bird populations. However, large-scale fires that resulted in large grassland expanses and isolated existing sagebrush patches reduced the probability of occupancy by sagebrush-obligate species. Populations of birds also declined in sagebrush ecosystems with increasing dominance by juniper (Juniperus spp.) and pinyon (Pinus spp.) woodlands. Our understanding of the effects of fire on sagebrush habitats and birds in these systems is limited. Almost all studies of fire effects on birds have been opportunistic, correlative, and lacking controls. We recommend using the large number of prescribed burns to develop strong inferences about cause-and-effect relationships. Prescribed burning is complicated and highly contentious, particularly in low-elevation, xeric sagebrush communities. Therefore, we need to use the unique opportunities provided by planned burns to understand the spatial and temporal influence of fire on sagebrush landscapes and birds. In particular, we need to develop larger-scale and longer-term research to identify the underlying mechanisms that produce the patterns of bird responses to fire in sagebrush ecosystems.","Amphispiza belli; Bromus tectorum; Centrocercus urophasianus; Disturbance; Exotic annual; Fire regime; Oreoscoptes montanus; Sagebrush ecosystems; Spizella breweri",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-24644473109

The Cerrado has the richest flora among the world's savannas (&gt;7000 species) and high levels of endemism. Species richness of birds, fishes, reptiles, amphibians, and insects is equally high, whereas mammal diversity is relatively low. Deforestation rates have been higher in the Cerrado than in the Amazon rainforest, and conservation efforts have been modest: only 2.2% of its area is under legal protection.

Soil erosion, the degradation of the diverse Cerrado vegetation formations, and the spread of exotic grasses are widespread and major threats. The use of fire for clearing land and to encourage new growth for pasture has also caused damage, even though the Cerrado is afire-adapted ecosystem. Ecosystem experiments and modeling show that change in land cover is altering the hydrology and affecting carbon stocks and fluxes. Cerrado agriculture is lucrative, and agricultural expansion is expected to continue, requiring improvements in and extension of the transportation infrastructure, which will affect not only the Cerrado but also the Amazon forest.

First, post-disturbance colonization is not limited by the dispersal ability of the species to reach the newly created open areas and, secondly, colonization is limited by dispersal. Under the first hypothesis, we expect, at a regional scale, to find similar post-disturbance communities to develop on recently burned sites. However, colonization limited by dispersal will lead to strong between-site variations in species composition. Location: To test these hypotheses, we studied the post-fire colonization patterns of nine open-habitat bird species in eight distantly located wildfires in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula. Methods: We censused post-fire bird composition by means of field transects and identified potential colonization sources from species-habitat suitability maps derived from atlas data. Results: Our results showed strong significant differences in post-fire species composition between burnt areas. Burnt areas located in areas with low probability of species presence before the fire event showed lower species occurrence and richness after the fire. Main conclusions: These results do not support the idea that early successional stages and open habitats have a homogeneous community structure at regional scales and suggest that dispersal is a key constraint determining bird colonization of post-fire habitats. Further attention should be paid to landscape heterogeneity as a key factor in determining population dynamics of open-habitat species in the light of current and future land-use changes in Mediterranean regions. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bird distribution; Dispersal; Disturbance; Heterogeneity; Iberian Peninsula; Landscape change; Wildfires",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-20044390557

The inventory of eggs in broad-leaved trees and shrubs close to Graz (Federal State of Styria, Austria) at the end of Winter 2003 revealed more 1000 records of seven species. Inter alia the occurrence of populations could be confirmed which had been recorded more than 70 years ago and were supposed to be extinct. Detailed analyses of plants and positions of egg-laying for some species led to a new picture of the utilisation of the feeding plants by caterpillars. It was found out that Bird Cherry (Prunus padus) is of particular importance as plant for egg-laying and to feed the caterpillars of the Black Hairstreak (Fixsenia pruni) and of the Brown Hairstreak (Thecla betulae). Both species can colonise dry as well as humid habitats. The Sloe Hairstreak (Satyrium acaciae), a thermophilic species, has proven to be the rarest and most endangered species of the Lycaenidae. The study underlines that Lycaenidae are stenoecious specie s with great ecological demands. Their decline is indicating an increasing impoverishment of Central European cultural landscapes with a high amount of woodlands. Similar to other butterfly species the occurrence of Lycaenidae in Styria has also decreased owing to systematic afforestation of forest meadows and meadow valleys. To improve the butterflies' habitat options it is necessary to reorientate forest utilisation towards near-natural forest communities. A lack of timber harvest causes a further large problem since it leads to very shady woodlands with few clearings. An increase of sustainable gathering of firewood, e.g. by coppicing, is desirable from the view of butterfly protection.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-14844366855

Growing scientific evidence has shown that because people generally spend the majority of their time indoors, indoor pollution plays a significant role in affecting health and is thus an important health issue. Indoor environments include dwellings, workplaces, schools and day care centres, bars, discotheques and vehicles. Common indoor pollutants are environmental tobacco smoke, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and biological allergens. In developing countries, relevant sources of indoor pollution include biomass and coal burning for cooking and heating. Concentrations of these pollutants can be many times higher indoors than outdoors. Indoor air pollution may increase the risk of irritation phenomena, allergic sensitisation, acute and chronic respiratory disorders and lung function impairment. Recent conservative estimates have shown that 1.5-2 million deaths per year worldwide could be attributed to indoor air pollution. Approximately 1 million of these deaths occur in children aged under 5 years due to acute respiratory infections, and significant proportions of deaths occur due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer in women. Today, indoor air pollution ranks tenth among preventable risk factors contributing to the global burden of disease. Further research is necessary to better evaluate the respiratory health effects of indoor pollution and to implement protective programmes for public health.","Asthma; Biomass; COPD; Epidemiology; ETS; Indoor pollution; Nitrogen oxides; Particles; Prevention; Respiratory health; VOC",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-11244288129

This anecdote reXects the lack of awareness many Americans had regarding the environment and the need for its conservation at the turn of the twentieth century. For the most part, people believed that environmental resources were inWnite. This attitude made nature fair game for various industries. For example, coal beds, once thought inexhaustible, were in danger of being depleted. The journalist C. H. Forbes-Lindsay reported that by the mid-1880s ""four billion tons were mined by methods so wasteful that more than an equal quantity was either destroyed or left in the ground in such state as to be inaccessible for ever."" According to the historian Frank Graham, Jr., the last half of the nineteenth century was dubbed the ""age of extermination."" ""The new technology and the relentless westward march of civilization,"" Graham observed, facilitated the ""hit-and-run raids on the continent's natural resources."" Such raids took their toll on many animal species. For instance, the American buValo once numbered in the hundred millions. Shot for sport by tourists riding past herds on trains and professionally hunted for their hides, the great beasts were nearly wiped out by the late 1800s.1 The lumber industry's practices with regard to the nation's forests, however, involved perhaps the most far-reaching consequences for the environment. ""With the invention of the circular saw and the steam sawmill in the early 1800s,"" noted the historian Jack Shepherd, ""wholesale deforestation began in earnest."" Because of public land giveaways and inadequate homestead laws, loggers moved quickly through the Great Lake states, the Rockies, and the PaciWc Northwest ""blasting the trees into manageable size with gunpowder, wasting half the timber and burning what was left."" Such practices by the timber industry had its costs. Thomas Will, secretary of the American Forestry Association in 1908, warned that unrestrained cutting of forested areas resulted in a host of related problems: by clearing vast areas of trees, trees that acted as natural dams for rainwater, millions of dollars of Xooding damage occurred each year. The resulting Xoods caused billions of tons of soil to be washed into rivers, constituting a loss of fertilizing topsoil estimated at one billion dollars; with the soil clogging the country's waterways, navigation became increasingly diYcult and costlier as well.2 With this assault on the environment in full force at the turn of the century, Theodore Roosevelt entered the White House in 1901. His background as a rancher, naturalist, and hunter gave him an appreciation for nature and its maintenance. While many advocates attempted to generate interest in conserving the environment, President Roosevelt was among the most successful. The biographer Paul Cutright observed that it was ""only after Roosevelt put the full force of his power as president"" behind conservation that ""it got oV the ground.""3 During his two terms, Roosevelt oversaw an array of conservation initiatives concerning the land, the animals, and the forests. Because of his inXuence the 1902 Newlands Reclamation Act, which authorized the building of dams to facilitate the irrigation of arid lands, moved through a resistant Congress. As a result of this legislation, thousands of acres of once unproductive land were transformed into agriculturally viable areas. To prevent speculators and corporations from acquiring and using land fraudulently, Roosevelt repealed the Forest Lieu Land Act of 1897; this gave actual settlers more access to public land. In 1906 the president withdrew 66 million acres of land from the public domain to safeguard their development as coal deposits. Concerning animals and their habitats, Roosevelt established the Wrst federal wildlife refuge in 1903 on Pelican Island oV the east coast of Florida. This refuge protected birds that were nearing extinction due to plume hunters. Over the next few years he created Wfty more wildlife sanctuaries across the United States and Puerto Rico. Perhaps the most signiWcant measure concerning natural habitats came in 1906 with the passage of the Antiquities Act. This bill gave Roosevelt the discretionary power to establish historic areas as national monuments, eighteen of which he created, including California's Muir Woods and Arizona's Grand Canyon. Regarding the forests, Roosevelt placed the management of the forest reserves under the control of the Forest Service headed by his trusted friend GiVord Pinchot. In addition, the Agriculture Appropriations Act that same year gave the Forest Service the means to create new reserves. Perhaps Roosevelt's most well known act regarding forest conservation involved his ""midnight proclamation"" of 1907. He signed several proclamations that placed 16 million acres of timberland under federal protection just two days before he signed a bill into law that would have prevented him from taking the former action. By the end of his presidency, 150 million acres of forested areas had been safeguarded.4 In some cases, the president took unilateral, often untouted action. For example, when Roosevelt created the Wrst federal wildlife sanctuary, there was no attending public fanfare. In determining how to protect the birds of Pelican Island, Roosevelt inquired whether there existed a law that would prevent him from turning that island into a federally protected reservation. According to Cutright, ""When assured there was none . . . [Roosevelt] replied, 'Very well, then I so declare it.'"" The passage of other initiatives, such as the Newlands Reclamation Act, was sometimes the result of private wrangling between the president and members of Congress.5 Stated another way, Roosevelt's public discourse did not have as its subject matter individual legislation. Rather, part of his rhetorical legacy as an advocate of the environment comes from his public messages that attempted to etch the broader notion of conservation-the prudent use of sacred natural resources as supervised by the federal government-in the national consciousness. As Donald Bryant might observe, Roosevelt's rhetoric worked to adjust the idea of conservation to the people and the people to the idea of conservation.6 In this regard the president faced several challenges. The public failed to recognize that the environment was in danger. Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography that the idea ""that our natural resources were inexhaustible"" was prominent in American culture. Second, some special interests publicly weighed in against conservation. According to Cutright, they ""took advantage of the misinterpretation"" many people had of the term ""forest reserve"" to argue that national forest reserves would indeed be sanctuaries ""where no timber could be cut and no game shot.""7 Third, Congress resisted the president on many conservation issues. Congress' reasons for its intractability ranged from being lobbied by private interests to protect their economic livelihood to anger at what it considered Rooseveltian arrogance concerning the federal government's role in safeguarding the environment.8 Given the apathy and outright resistance by the general public, special interests, and legislative leaders, how did Roosevelt publicly promote the protection of the environment to such a degree with these constituencies that he became what one historian called ""one of the great conservationist presidents in the nation's history?""9 Beyond cursory interpretations of his discourse in various biographies, rhetorical scholarship on Roosevelt's conservation rhetoric is limited.10 Elsewhere, I argue that the president's campaign for conservation succeeded because he contextualized the issue within a radically altered frontier myth: The traditional conqueror-heroes of the unlimited frontier who marked progress by subduing nature without regard for their successors was replaced by Roosevelt with the yeoman farmers who worked to conserve a Wnite environment, thus realizing their moral purpose in safeguarding nature's resource for others to use. This mythic storyline may have helped the president attain short-term gains, but given the lack of prominence in American culture of the farmer-as-hero icon and the misconception of the environment's inWnite nature, another explanation for Roosevelt's legacy as a conservation leader is warranted. © 2004 by Texas A&M University Press.

The intensive pumping of water from the oasis and wells for local farms caused decline in water level and salinization of soil in the reserve. The increased salinity changed the structure and function of ecological systems. Four main habitat types predominated until recently: (a) perennial marsh, (b) seasonal marsh, (c) silt dune, and (d) qa'a (or saline mudflat). Presently, about 90% of the former wetland area within the reserve is highly degraded and Tamarix scrub is quickly developing in these areas. The seasonal marshes have been dry since 1996, and presently are highly degraded. One endemic fresh water fish, Aphanius sirhani, is known to occur only in the Azraq Oasis. The Oasis is a refuge for some of the Palearctic species such as Camaeleo camaeleon, Malpolon monspessulanus insignitus and Natrix tessellata. The Oasis is considered the most important bird area (IBA) in Jordan. Over 300 species of birds are recorded in the area, which until recently was a significant area for breeding and non-breeding water birds. The traditional people of Azraq Basin are pastoral nomads, and the wetlands of Azraq were a key element in their livelihoods. Most of the Bedouin now have resident lifestyles. This study shows the nefarious impact of humans on Azraq and suggests conservation issues and management practices in the Oasis. Socio-economic aspects of the reserve and the involvement of local communities in conservation are highlighted and assessed in the context of the management plan produced for the Oasis. Results of species inventories and evaluation features for rehabilitation, long-term objectives for management and proposed action plan prescriptions have been synthesized. Environmental relationships that may have implications for management in terms of grazing, fire and hydrology are also indicated.","Aphanius sirhani; Marshes; Water birds; Wetland reserves",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-28844453000

On a global scale, the emissions of large volumes of greenhouse gases from burning coal beds may contribute to climate change that alters ecosystems and patterns of disease occurrence. On regional and local scales, the emissions from burning coal beds and waste banks of acidic gases, particulates, organic compounds, and trace elements can contribute to a range of respiratory and other human health problems. Although there are few published reports of health problems caused by these emissions, the potential for problems can be significant. In India, large numbers of people have been displaced from their homes because of health problems caused by emissions from burning coal beds. Volatile elements such as arsenic, fluorine, mercury, and selenium are commonly enriched in coal deposits. Burning coal beds can volatilize these elements, which then can be inhaled, or adsorbed on crops and foods, taken up by livestock or bioaccumulated in birds and fish. Some of these elements can condense on dust particles that can be inhaled or ingested. In addition, selenium, arsenic, lead, tin, bismuth, fluorine, and other elements condense where the hot gaseous emissions come in contact with ambient air, forming mats of concentrated efflorescent minerals on the surface of the ground. These mats can be leached by rainwater and washed into local water bodies providing other potential routes of exposure. Although there are little data linking burning coal beds and waste banks to known health problems, a possibly analogous situation exists in rural China where mineralized coal burned in a residential environment has caused widespread and severe health problems such as fluorosis and arseniasis. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A Norwegian population of the endangered ortolan bunting (Emberiza hortulana) occurs on a forest burn that has an area allocated to golf. Some forest-burn habitat (heather [Calluna vulgaris] heath with scattered, small Scots pines [Pinus sylvestris]) remains between fairways and on the periphery of the golf course. I compared pairing success, residence times, and emigration rates of male ortolan buntings in the interior and periphery of the golf course and in a neighboring part of undisturbed forest burn (control area). Males in the interior of the golf course (n = 4) never attracted females and less than half (43%, n = 7) in the golf periphery did so, whereas most males in the control area attracted females (77%, n = 13; all males on golf course vs. control: P = 0.038). Males in the golf interior had shorter residence times than males on the golf periphery, and both were present for a shorter time than males in the control area (golf vs. control: P = 0.030). All males that had territories in the golf interior emigrated to other areas (median = 13.3 km away). The emigration rate was lower for males on the golf periphery (43%) and even lower in the control area (15%; golf vs. control: P = 0.033). Males emigrating from the golf course attracted females at the same rate as control males in their new areas of residence. Compared to males in the rest of the forest burn (n = 76), males on the golf course had shorter residence times (P = 0.049) and higher emigration rate (P = 0.009), but pairing success was not different (P = 0.196). Overall, the golf course did not seem to be attractive to ortolan buntings, although the lack of other populations on golf courses precludes replicate studies. Whether the apparent avoidance was due to fragmentation of breeding habitat on the golf course, human disturbance, or some other reason remains to be tested. In the case of the ortolan bunting, the negative effects of the golf course probably would have been reduced if remaining natural habitat had been concentrated to the periphery of the golf course and adjacent to other bunting habitat.","Dispersal; Emberiza hortulana; Endangered species; Golf; Norway; Ortolan bunting; Population dynamics",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3843090488

We studied the nesting biology of Southeastern American Kestrels in 1999 and 2000 at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, in old-growth longleaf pine savanna, a habitat type historically widely occupied by the kestrels. Most of the nest cavities we observed were in old-growth trees, both living and dead, and were originally excavated by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and then enlarged by other woodpecker species. Nesting success was 70% in 1999 and 56% in 2000. In 1999, 67% of eggs survived to become fledglings in successful nests, as did 58% in 2000. Nests in live pines and snags were equally successful, and nest success was positively related to cavity height in 1999. Reduced nesting success in 2000 may have been related to severe drought conditions. High nesting concentrations of up to 4 pairs per km2 were observed. We suggest that stands of old-growth longleaf pine, with little or no hardwood midstory and a relatively high number of snags, inhabited by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, may constitute high quality habitat for Southeastern American Kestrels. Therefore, loss of longleaf pine habitat, degradation of remaining longleaf habitat due to fire suppression and removal of old-growth and snags, and the decline of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker, a species on which kestrels may have depended as a source of nest cavities historically, may have contributed to the decline of the Southeastern American Kestrel.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-24344474240

Aquatic Warblers breed successfully when the groundwater table coincides with the topsoil level; the optimal water table lies in the range from 12 cm above the soil to 5 cm below it.

Ants (family Formicidae) are an important, although often overlooked, component of many terrestrial ecosystems. Six species of ants are especially striking in their global ability to invade, and their impacts. This paper focuses on the impacts of the most destructive of those species, the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), and focuses on impacts on native vertebrates. Red imported fire ants often become the dominant ant species in infested areas outside of their native range due to their aggressive foraging behavior, high reproductive capability and lack of predators and/or other strong competitors. The evidence suggests that mammals, birds and herpetofauna are vulnerable to negative impacts from fire ants, and some species are more likely to experience negative population-level impacts than other species. Assessing the ecological impacts of fire ants on wild animal populations is logistically difficult, and very few studies have combined replicated experimental manipulation with adequate spatial (>10 ha) and temporal (>1 y) scale. Thus, most studies have been observational, opportunistic, small-scale or 'natural' experiments. However, significant research, including an increase in experimental and mechanistic investigations, has occurred during the past decade, and this has led to information that can lead to better management of potentially affected species.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3142740278

Although much is known about deer diet, and about takahē diet in the alpine areas they currently occupy, little is known about takahē diet in the forests and even less on what the forest understorey was like before deer invasion. Deer and takahē share the Murchison Mountains forest habitat, particularly in winter when snowfall forces the birds into the forest for food and shelter. This study uses high-resolution pollen analyses of short peaty cores from under the beech forest canopy in the Chester Burn catchment in the Murchison Mountains, to show how the forest understorey has changed significantly over at least the last 1000 years, but particularly over the last 50 years since deer invasion. In terms of preferred taxa in the takahē diet, over the last 50 years sedges, grasses, and Celmisia spp. have all become less common than they were in the past, and some species of ferns such as Polystichum vestitum and Hypolepis millefolium are strikingly more abundant. Present-day takahē diet in the Murchison Mountains may not be typical of their diet in the past; they may have fed in the forest habitat more often when there were more bush grasses available. Deer browsing is the most likely cause of these relatively recent changes in forest understorey composition. A depleted understorey and ground flora may limit takahē winter diet, and affect the condition of the birds at the end of winter, and their survival or reproductive capability.","Deer browsing; Fiordland; Forest disturbance; New Zealand; Pollen; Porphyrio bochstetteri; Soil cores; Takahē; Understorey",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344010152

Consistent with global trends, Australia has warmed ∼0.8°C over the last century with minimum temperatures warming faster than maxima. There have been significant regional trends in rainfall with the northern, eastern and southern parts of the continent receiving greater rainfall and the western region receiving less. Higher rainfall has been associated with an increase in the number of rain days and heavy rainfall events. Sea surface temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef have increased and are associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of coral bleaching and mortality. Sea level rises in Australia have been regionally variable, and considerably less than the global average. Snow cover and duration have declined significantly at some sites in the Snowy Mountains. CSIRO projections for future climatic changes indicate increases in annual average temperatures of 0.4-2.0°C by 2030 (relative to 1990) and 1.0-6.0°C by 2070. Considerable uncertainty remains as to future changes in rainfall, El Niño Southern Oscillation events and tropical cyclone activity. Overall increases in potential evaporation over much of the continent are predicted as well as continued reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover. Future changes in temperature and rainfall are predicted to have significant impacts on most vegetation types that have been modelled to date, although the interactive effect of continuing increases in atmospheric CO 2 has not been incorporated into most modelling studies. Elevated CO2 will most likely mitigate some of the impacts of climate change by reducing water stress. Future impacts on particular ecosystems include increased forest growth, alterations in competitive regimes between C3 and C4 grasses, increasing encroachment of woody shrubs into arid and semiarid rangelands, continued incursion of mangrove communities into freshwater wetlands, increasing frequency of coral bleaching, and establishment of woody species at increasingly higher elevations in the alpine zone. Modelling of potential impacts on specific Australian taxa using bioclimatic analysis programs such as BIOCLIM consistently predicts contraction and/or fragmentation of species' current ranges. The bioclimates of some species of plants and vertebrates are predicted to disappear entirely with as little as 0.5-1.0°C of warming. Australia lacks the long-term datasets and tradition of phenological monitoring that have allowed the detection of climate-change-related trends in the Northern Hemisphere. Long-term changes in Australian vegetation can be mostly attributed to alterations in fire regimes, clearing and grazing, but some trends, such as encroachment of rainforest into eucalypt woodlands, and establishment of trees in subalpine meadows probably have a climatic component. Shifts in species distributions toward the south (bats, birds), upward in elevation (alpine mammals) or along changing rainfall contours (birds, semiarid reptiles), have recently been documented and offer circumstantial evidence that temperature and rainfall trends are already affecting geographic ranges. Future research directions suggested include giving more emphasis to the study of climatic impacts and understanding the factors that control species distributions, incorporating the effects of elevated CO2 into climatic modelling for vegetation and selecting suitable species as indicators of climate-induced change.","Australia; Climate change; Climate projections; Rainfall; Species impacts; Temperature",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042740602

In order to design management plans to prevent large wildfires while preserving biodiversity, understanding of the ways in which birds respond to these fires is required. We investigated the spatial variability of both avifauna and habitat structure in three zones: unburnt, burnt in 1982, and burnt in 1994. The habitat structure of the unburnt zone was the most variable spatially. However, bird species composition between sampling points was very homogeneous in space. In contrast, the bird communities inhabiting burnt zones were more spatially heterogeneous. This pattern was caused by distinct specific responses to variations in habitat structure. Open-space species responded to small changes in habitat structure with large changes in local abundance, whereas the response of forest species to these structural variations was much less. We suggest that land managers should select specific zones with limited vegetation recovery within large burnt areas and maintain them as open space to keep combustibility low and provide an appropriate habitat for several open space species that are of conservation concern.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037388529

Those sites include dunes, lava tubes, limestone sinkholes, and former lakebeds, most dating to the Holocene. The fossil finds have more than doubled the endemic avifauna of the islands, increasing the number and diversity of species known from groups that are recorded historically and revealing an unsuspected diversity of extinct nonpasserine groups, including several raptors and flightless taxa. Also, the fossil record shows that some species historically, found on a single island were more widely distributed in the past (James 1987; Olson and James 1982b, 1991; James and Olson 1991, 2003; Burney et al. 2001). Those discoveries force a re-evaluation of the prehistoric ecology and biogeography of the islands and greatly increase the number of colonization events contributing to the endemic avifauna. Using osteological traits and DNA sequence data, Olson, James, and colleagues have studied the origins and relationships of several groups of endemic Hawaiian birds, and demonstrated striking examples of convergent evolution and rapid and drastic morphological change (James and Olson 1991; Olson and James 1991; James 1998; Sorenson et al. 1999; Fleischer and McIntosh 2001, Fleischer et al. 2000, 2001; Paxinos et al. 2002b; Slikas et al. 2002). Examples include loss of flight within and between flightless groups and the browsing adaptations of flightless Hawaiian geese and moa-nalos (Olson and James 1991, Sorenson et al. 1999, Paxinos et al. 2002b, Slikas et al. 2002). Using radiocarbon dating of the bones of extinct birds as well as other organic material from fossil sites, Olson and James have shown that the bulk of extinctions in the Hawaiian Islands occurred prehistorically (prior to 1778) but after the arrival of humans in the archipelago. That pattern of destruction has been repeated on oceanic islands throughout the world (Olson and James 1982a, 1984; James et al. 1987; Steadman 1995). Olson and James are continuing to collect bones in the Hawaiian Islands and to describe new taxa from their collections.

The Rocky Mountain region has one of the most heterogeneous landscapes in North America, combining high complexity in abiotic gradients with fire as a major disturbance factor. In recent decades fire suppression has limited this disturbance, resulting in altered stand structures and relatively homogeneous expanses of mid-successional forest where there were once mosaics of different-aged post-fire stands. Elsewhere, historically homogeneous landscapes that rarely burned have become more heterogeneous due to logging. Many forest types are less common than they were historically due to current management. Land conversion to agriculture and development has primarily occurred in low elevations. We speculate that the consequences of these changes include: (1) bird species adapted to historically homogeneous forest landscapes would be negatively affected by landscape heterogeneity created by timber harvest openings; (2) bird species specialized for forest types that were once prevalent but are now uncommon may be negatively affected by decreasing patch size and increasing isolation; and (3) birds that breed in close proximity to human-added landscape features may be negatively affected by brood parasites or nest predators. Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) and Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa) had the strongest trends of species sensitive to fragmentation indices. Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina) and Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis) were positively associated with fragmentation across most studies. Nesting success varied among landscape configurations, and some trends paralleled abundance patterns. Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism rates were extremely low (0-3%) where nest success has been studied in coniferous forests of the north-central Rockies. Across extensive and intensive studies, distance to agricultural lands was the strongest predictor of cowbird presence. Therefore, we found evidence for the ideas that birds adapted to homogeneous forest landscapes have been negatively affected by heterogeneity caused by timber harvesting, that patch size is important for some birds in one vanishing habitat (old-growth ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa), and that cowbirds are more abundant in conifer forests near human-added landscape features. The effects of changes in landscape patterns on birds in the north-central Rockies seem to be less dramatic than in eastern and midwestern North America, and different landscape measures are more relevant to western conifer forests. We need additional research on most aspects of breeding, nonbreeding, and dispersal ecology in relation to landscape patterns and within-stand changes. We offer our proposed consequences as hypotheses upon which to base future tests.","Birds; Fire; Fire regimes; Fire suppression; Forest fragmentation; Landscape; Landscape patterns; North-central Rockies; Wildfire",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036974659

We studied breeding Lewis's Woodpeckers in cottonwood (Populus fremontii) riparian forest patches of Colorado and crown-burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of Idaho to compare their reproductive success, productivity, and potential source-sink status in the two forest types. Daily nest survival rates were significantly lower in cottonwood compared to burned pine forests. Nesting success was 46% (n = 65) in cottonwood forests and 78% (n = 283) in burned pine forests. Proportion of nests destroyed by predators was significantly higher in cottonwood forests (34%) compared to burned pine forests (16%). We consistently found crown-burned forests to be potential source habitat, whereas cottonwood riparian sites were more often concluded to be potential sink habitat. Cottonwood riparian forests were surrounded primarily by an agricultural landscape where the composition and abundance of nest predators was likely very different than the predator assemblage occupying a large-scale burn in a relatively natural landscape. Conversion of riparian and adjacent grassland landscapes to agriculture and prevention of wildfire in ponderosa pine forests have likely reduced nesting habitat for this species. Prescribed understory fire is the prevailing management tool for restoring ponderosa pine ecosystems.

These birds originated from Minnesota, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and south-central British Columbia and included birds of the subspecies B. c. moffitti and hybrids of B. c. interior and B. c. maxima. Increased urbanization in the LFV brought local hunting closures to some areas, and harvest rates did not restrict the growth of the population, which increased to over 12 600 individuals in fall 1995. An overabundance of geese in the urban setting created problems with geese and humans competing for the same habitats. High densities of geese cause excessive noise, territorial threats, contamination of public areas, and damage to agricultural fields. Nesting and moulting flocks also present problems when they occur at inappropriate locations. Present management prescriptions include egg addling - to limit recruitment; flock relocation - to relieve pressures of too many geese in urban areas and to expose the geese to hunting pressure by moving them into huntable areas; and modification of hunting seasons and bag limits - to increase hunter harvest. In the LFV, over 8200 eggs have been addled within urban areas since 1988, over 12 000 geese have been relocated from urban settings to huntable areas, bag limits have been increased to five birds a day, and a triple-split hunting season was introduced in part of the valley. Bandreturn data indicated that the majority of geese harvested in the LFV originated there, and that relocated geese showed a strong fidelity to their original capture site. Present management practices are, for the most part, accepted by the public and allow monitoring of control activity through reporting requirements of the permit. Management objectives are to maintain appropriate numbers of geese for viewing and hunting, while minimizing nuisance complaints. To achieve these goals, other means may need to be applied, such as liberalization of local firearm restrictions, changes to traditional habitat management practices, and culling of flocks.

Richmond, VA). The voltage outputs were assessed using a factory calibrated oscilloscope (Fluke DigiMeter 123, Everett, WA). Results All nerve stimulators delivered the target current in a relatively wide range of impedance loads (0.5 kΩ to 15 kΩ). In the typical tissue impedance range (0.5 kΩ to 3 kΩ) and a common current output setting (< 1 mA1) the increasing impedance load was compensated by the nerve stimulator through a small increase in voltage output up to 3 Volts (Figure-1). However, the voltage output peaked at nearly 70 volts (Fig-2) with a current intensity of 5.0 mA and an increase in impedance load to 15 kΩ (Figs-1 and 2). The impedance of several tested grounding electrodes (ECG pads) with dried conducting gel varied widely from 10 kΩ to 50 kΩ. Discussion Modern peripheral nerve stimulators used in regional anesthesia are typically of a constant current generator type. While the current output range used for clinical purposes is relatively small (< 5.0 mA) the actual voltage output can reach levels sufficient to cause discomfort and burning. It depends on the impedance between the leads and increases with drying of the electrode gel. Thus, grounding electrodes should be carefully inspected before application.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33747788094

Many of these creations lie within habitat conservation plan (HCP) sites, and they could play a more prominent role by being repositories for plants taken from a single site having site-specific genetics.

A combination of placing patches of salvaged, mature canopy plants within larger matrices of imprinted or container plant plots appears to significantly enhance immediate use by CSS obligate bird species, accelerate 'spread' or expansion of CSS, and can also introduce many epiphytic taxa that otherwise would be slow or unable to occupy developing CSS creations. Reptile, amphibian, butterfly, and rodent diversity in a salvaged canopy restoration case study at the University of California, Irvine, showed CSS species foraging and inhabiting transplanted canopy patches. Using restoration techniques to expand existing CSS stands has more promise than creating isolated patches, and the creation of canopies resembling CSS mid-fire cycle stands is now common. Gnatcatchers and other birds use restorations for foraging and occasional nesting, and in some cases created stands along 'biological corridors' appear to be useful to bird movement. Patches of transplanted sage scrub shrubs along habitat edges appear to break up linear edge effects. There are no data on which long-term survival, succession, or postfire behavior can be predicted for CSS restoration sites and postfire community changes are not part of either mitigation or restoration planning at present. Long-term planning including burning is needed so that a fire-adapted habitat will develop. Restoration is important in retaining genetic resources, for ameliorating edge effects, as habitat extenders in buffer zones around HCP sites, and by providing areas into which natural stands can expand.Extensive acreage loss of coastal sage scrub (CSS), isolation of surviving stands, and the federal listing of several animal species with obligate relationships to this plant community, have led to attempts to create CSS to mitigate habitat lost to urban development and other causes.

A database was assembled from 272 published and unpublished bird lists, and this was supplemented with records extracted from a systematic search of the primary ornithological literature. In excess of 7 000 records were located. The original forest avifauna (just before the impact of European settlers became pronounced) consisted of 112 breeding species (81 land, 31 water). Salient characteristics of this avifauna include: only 1 species is confined (as a breeding species) to the primaeval forest ecosystem; 53 species occur throughout the forests; 32 and 13 species are restricted to its eastern or southern portions respectively; most species occur extensively outside of the forests (66 species to the west, north, east and south; 33 species to the west, north and east); 52 per cent of landbird species are insectivores; about 20 per cent of the landbird fauna migrates from the forest in varying degrees in winter; 67 per cent of landbird species nest in the overstorey or understorey; and landbirds in streamside forests occur at higher densities than in upland forests. The distribution of 5 species - Leipoa ocellata (Malleefowl), Cacatua pastinator (Western long-billed corella), Atrichornis clamosus (Noisy scrub-bird), Falcunculus frontatus (Crested shrike-tit) and Rallus pectoralis (Lewin's rail) - is discussed in detail, with new or neglected information being provided. The landbird fauna of the primaeval forest is impoverished relative to elsewhere in the South West Land Division, particularly the region now known as the wheatbelt. The forests of south-west Western Australia have only about half of the number of bird species present in a similar-sized, comparable area in south-east Australia. The south-west forest avifauna is more similar to that present in the Mount Lofty Ranges (South Australia) than to the forest avifaunas of New South Wales or Tasmania. At local scales (1-100 ha), however, the number of landbird species present is similar in all forests in southern mainland Australia (20-25 breeding species). Overall density of bird populations in jarrah and karri forests is about one half of that in comparable forests in south-east Australia. Disturbances caused by European settlement have resulted in 4 species present in the primal forests contracting in geographical range, 2 species becoming extinct, and more than 90 species benefiting from provision of new habitats. Forest management has had limited impact on biodiversity and total abundance of birds. Prescribed burning under moist soil conditions has no impact on bird species richness in jarrah forest, but increases bird species richness in karri forest for 3-6 years. Total abundance of birds increases in both types of forest after prescribed burning. Planned burning under dry soil conditions increases both bird species richness and total abundance of birds. Wildfire reduces bird species richness. All of these changes are temporary. Thinning of jarrah forest does not change bird species richness, whereas cutting to gaps increases bird species richness. Clearfelling of karri forest initially reduces bird species richness; 12 years later about 85 per cent of the avifauna in mature stands is present in regrowth karri forest. Those species dependent on large hollows for nesting are unlikely to nest in unthinned regrowth forest younger than about 120 years. Open-cut mining for bauxite has a severe initial impact on bird species richness, but following rehabilitation there is a rapid return of bird species, with 85 per cent of species present before mining being recorded after 5 years. Species requiring large hollows for nesting cannot, however, nest in rehabilitated sites for many decades. The most severe, long term reduction in local bird species richness and total abundance is caused by dieback disease and by permanent removal of forest as in agriculture, urbanization, damming of rivers, and plantations of pine. However, an additional 75 species (51 land, 24 water) have been recorded within the forests following clearing for farming and towns. Of these species, 23 (17 land, 6 water) now breed, but only two of them (Aquila morphnoides Little eagle, Dacelo novaeguineae Laughing kookaburra) breed in forest. The policies and procedures in place to mitigate the impact of humans on the forest bird fauna and to promote the conservation of bird species are summarized. These include an extensive mosaic of protected areas (national parks, nature reserves, forest along roads, rivers and streams), a structural goal of 40 per cent of the forest being maintained at the mature or senescent stage, the retention of habitat trees for species dependent on hollows for nesting, and spatially and temporally diversified use of fire.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033389944

Under proper land application conditions, the nutrients and organisms in poultry wastes pose little environmental threat. Environmental contamination occurs when land application of poultry wastes is in excess of crop utilization potential, or is done under poor management conditions causing nutrient loss from environmental factors such as soil erosion or surface runoff during rainfall. Environmental parameters of concern are N, P, and certain metals (Cu and Zn in particular), as well as pathogenic microorganisms that may be contained in poultry waste. The biochemical cycle of N is very dynamic, and N contained in poultry waste may either be removed by crop harvest, leave the animal production facility, waste treatment lagoon, or application field as a gas (NH3, NO, NO 2, N2O, or N2), or, due to its mobility in soil, be transported in organic or inorganic N forms in the liquid state via surface runoff or leaching into groundwater. Elevated concentrations of NO 3-N in groundwater used for human consumption is a health risk to infants that are susceptible to methemoglobinemia. An environmental impact resulting from elevated NO3-N is eutrophication of surface waters. Ammonia loss from poultry waste is an environmental concern because of volatilized wet and dry deposits of NH3 into nitrogen-sensitive ecosystems. Phosphorus in poultry wastes may contribute to environmental degradation by accelerating the process of eutrophication. Unlike N, P is very immobile in soil and must first be transported to a surface water environment to have an environmental impact. It is generally accepted, however, that this nutrient affects receiving waters via transport in eroding soil as sediment-bound P or in surface runoff as soluble inorganic or organic P. Numerous studies have reported that excess P contained in land-applied manures may contribute to eutrophication. Soils containing P concentrations that greatly exceed the agronomic potential of crops may require years or even decades to return to levels that are crop limiting for this nutrient. Environmental concerns include the capacity of such soils to adsorb new P and the amount of P loss from these soils from erosion, runoff, drainage, or leaching to groundwater. Although much information is available regarding the loss of P from agricultural fields from erosion and runoff, less information is available regarding P losses from fields receiving poultry wastes. However, studies have shown that there are many challenges to controlling P losses from fields receiving manures. In addition, subsurface transport of P resulting from repeated application of poultry manure onto soils that are artificially drained is an environmental concern where drainage waters enter or interact with water bodies sensitive to eutrophication. Trace elements such as As, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Se, and Zn are often added in excess to poultry feed to increase the animal's rate of weight gain, feed efficiency, and egg production and to prevent diseases. Because most of the excess trace elements are not absorbed by the bird, the concentration of elements excreted in the manure will reflect dietary overformulation. Because trace elements are generally required in very small quantities for crop growth and, like P, are immobile in most soil types, their concentrations will increase with repeated land application of poultry wastes. Of particular concern are accumulations of Cu and Zn in certain soil types utilized for certain crops. Copper and Zn toxicity for some crops have been documented in some areas receiving repeated land-applied poultry wastes. A potential environmental concern relative to poultry litter and trace elements in receiving soils involves the transport of harmful metals into groundwater. Soluble organic ligands contained in land-applied poultry litter may impact the mobility of potentially harmful trace elements in soils because the dissolved organic matter in poultry litter is available to form mobile complexes with certain heavy metals. Chemical residues in the form of antibiotics, coccidiostats, and larvicides may also be contained in poultry wastes. Although it is well documented that the concentration of these residues in the bird's excreta will correlate to the amount of the chemical used during production and management, there is little information available regarding environmental impacts of these compounds resulting from waste management practices. Poultry wastes may contain certain disease-causing pathogenic microorganisms; however, these organisms have been shown to be decreased or eliminated by management practices that include composting, drying, and sunlight exposure. The primary environmental concern involving land application of pathogen-containing poultry waste includes surface water contamination from runoff. Management practices that include riparian buffer strips adjacent to surface waters near land receiving manure have been documented to reduce pathogens in such runoff. An additional concern involving pathogenic microorganisms in poultry waste is the widespread use, worldwide, of antibiotics in subtherapeutic levels as feed additives to promote animal growth efficiency. This practice may result in the selection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are shed in the animal's excreta. Subsequently, it is possible for these pathogens to share antibiotic-resistant plasmids (r-plasmids) with other bacteria. Research has shown that microbial contamination of poultry litter should be reduced or eliminated before reutilization back into the production facility to minimize environmental health risks associated with the transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans or other animals. Recent studies have shown that nutritional strategies may reduce the amount of nutrients excreted in poultry waste without impacting animal productivity. Examples include providing diets with highly digestible amino acids to reduce fecal N excretion and the use of dietary enzymes to reduce P concentrations in excreta. Although more work is needed in this area, such results illustrate the potential for ""econutrition"" to be a significant component of poultry producer waste management strategy in the near future. Alternatives to land application of poultry wastes for agronomic purposes include methods of processing nutrients and energy in the waste for refeeding to livestock or poultry and utilization of the waste for fuel production. Information in the scientific literature shows that poultry waste, litter in particular, can be safely utilized for refeeding to ruminants when pathogens are neutralized and the waste substrate is combined in optimal concentrations with conventional feedstuffs. However, the use of poultry waste as a feed ingredient is not a common practice with the livestock industry. Public, as well as producer, perception of this concept contributes to its limited use as a mechanism for recycling poultry wastes. Biogas generated by the anaerobic digestion of poultry wastes may be used as an energy source for burning as heat or as a fuel for internal combustion engines to generate electricity. This technology has been the subject of much research for the past two decades, and successful systems have been reported for poultry manure digestion. Few producers, however, utilize anaerobic digestion as a method of poultry waste treatment and disposal because of unfavorable economics and technical operational difficulties. New and more efficient techniques for the production of biogas from manure are required to motivate the adoption of this practice as a component of widespread use as a method of managing poultry wastes. Trends in animal agriculture, including poultry production, have evolved away from widespread ""traditional"" small farms. For the past several decades, the population engaged in farming has steadily declined. In the U.S., less than 2% of the population is directly involved with the day-to-day on-farm production of agricultural products. As the number of farms have decreased, so have the total acres of cultivated cropland available for receiving manure nutrients. The combination of decreased available cropland and increased concentration of animal production has resulted in many environmental concerns regarding improper land application of the organic and inorganic nutrients contained in manures. Such changes in animal agricultural necessitate the need for a framework by which agricultural producers, their allied industries, and researchers, educators, and government officials may address these environmental concerns. There is little doubt that, in certain geographic areas, the continued productivity, profitability, and sustainability of animal production agriculture depends on cost-effective technologies and management practices to mitigate environmental consequences associated with air and water quality that are impacted by the excess of nutrients produced by concentrated livestock facilities. Poultry producers have much at stake in ensuring long-term production systems that are environmentally sound. The future sustainability and expansion of animal agriculture in the U.S., and in many other parts of the world, will depend on manure management practices that address environmental concerns related to soil, water, and air quality. The methods employed must also ensure that there is no risk for food chain contamination by pathogenic organisms that are indigenous to manure. © Springer-Verlag 1999.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032618370

The disease is caused by Coxiella burnetii, a strictly intracellular, gram-negative bacterium. Many species of mammals, birds, and ticks are reservoirs of C. burnetii in nature. C. burnetii infection is most often latent in animals, with persistent shedding of bacteria into the environment. However, in females intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. Humans are usually infected by contaminated aerosols from domestic animals, particularly after contact with parturient females and their birth products. Although often asymptomatic, Q fever may manifest in humans as an acute disease (mainly as a self-limited febrile illness, pneumonia, or hepatitis) or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis), especially in patients with previous valvulopathy and to a lesser extent in immunocompromised hosts and in pregnant women. Specific diagnosis of Q fever remains based upon serology. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antiphase II antibodies are detected 2 to 3 weeks after infection with C. burnetii, whereas the presence of IgG antiphase I C. burnetii antibodies at titers of ≥1:800 by microimmunofluorescence is indicative of chronic Q fever. The tetracyclines are still considered the mainstay of antibiotic therapy of acute Q fever, whereas antibiotic combinations administered over prolonged periods are necessary to prevent relapses in Q fever endocarditis patients. Although the protective role of Q fever vaccination with whole-cell extracts has been established, the population which should be primarily vaccinated remains to be clearly identified. Vaccination should probably be considered in the population at high risk for Q fever endocarditis.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032823634

The pollution effects upon the environment and the accumulation of highly bioavailable lead compounds in trophic webs have been demonstrated in many instances. It has been suggested that the lead accumulated in plants, fungi, and invertebrates is a potencial source for vertebrates. The direct toxic effects of lead shot and sinkers on wildlife have been described mainly in waterbirds, upland birds, and birds of prey. They have also been reported to occur in cattle, reptiles and marine mammals, and occur whenever these small lead objects are ingested. In Spain, lead shot ingestion causes the death of about 50,000 waterbirds every year, some in endangered or threatened species. Two of the three most important lead poisoning outbreaks in flamingos were recorded in Spain. The first case of a fatal lead poisoning of a Palearctic griffon vulture was also recorded in Spain.

There are several effective alternatives to the use of lead in these sporting activities, and there is no legitimate reason why they should not be urgently and globally implemented.

The Kirtland's warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii) provides a prime example. Present evidence suggests that major increases in the population of this species have resulted from the sudden availability of very large tracts of suitable habitat on the nesting grounds. Very large forest fires that have produced vast areas of young jack pine (Pinus banksiana) repeatedly have resulted in increases in the bird's population over more than a century. This is not to imply that major fires produce all the habitat used by the warbler. In most years, there are dozens of fires and clearcuttings of various extent. These events affect nearly 200,000 ha of forest on which jack pine is the dominant tree. However, only a small fraction is suitable for the warbler at any one time, less than 10,000 ha at present. Some tracts of marginal size that look acceptable to us are not occupied, and some that appear unsuitable attract nesting warblers. While it is clear that changes in the population of Kirtland's warbler are affected by availability of large tracts of nesting habitat, we cannot ignore the problems of survival on the wintering grounds (the Bahama Islands), where the bird spends more than half of each year. We know little of the bird's life in the Bahama Islands, but since the warbler population has been remarkably stable over the last 20 years, and the climate and vegetation there have changed little in centuries, the authors see no cause for alarm there at present.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032659717

Minor improvements in the ability to predict demographic performance occurred as sampling scale increased from the smallest patch (0.1 ha) to the territory scale (5.5 ha). Population sources (potential-breeder production exceeded breeder mortality) comprised 28% of the habitat within the study site and had inadequate demographic performance to sustain population sinks (breeder mortality exceeded potential-breeder production), which comprised 62% of the habitat.

During a 26 year period from 1972 to 1997, when three major and eight minor fires occurred, the density of Splendid Fairy-wrens Malurus splendens ranged from a high of 105 adults/100 ha in 1985 to 20 adults/100 ha in 1994. Both of these extremes followed periods of similar fire frequency (five fires in preceding 10 years). However, in the ten years before 1985, all fires were of limited extent, whereas the ten year period up to 1994 began with an extensive 100% hot summer burn, closely followed by two smaller reburns. The aftermath of the major fire in 1985 and subsequent minor fires had a major detrimental impact on populations of Splendid Fairy-wrens, Western Thornbills Acanthiza inornata, Scarlet Robins Petroica multicolor and Yellow-romped Thornbills A. chrysorrhoa, all of which declined during the following eight years, even though the vegetation had nearly recovered to 1985 conditions. This continued decline in bird densities was related to increased mortality of breeding birds and lowered productivity, due to temporary cessation of breeding by Western Thornbills and to increased nest predation and parasitism in Splendid Fairy-wrens. In addition, the broad extent of the 1985 fire reduced opportunities for immigration from elsewhere. Understanding this avifaunal response to fire would not have been possible without an extended period of study. Any fire management plans based on just two or three years data might have yielded recommendations quite detrimental to the fauna they were designed to protect. For the species and habitats studied here, small, patchy bums on a well-spaced rotational basis are to be preferred over regular 'fuel reduction' burning of entire habitats, particularly in isolated areas where immigration is unlikely to occur.

The majority (> 70%) occur in fire-prone vegetation on nutrient-poor, summer-dry soils of south-western Australia. These species are characterised by large, winged seeds contained within serotinous follicles. Seed release is mediated by desiccation of the follicle walls resulting from fruit death, although wet–dry cycles are required in some genera. After release, germination must take place by the next wet season, as the seeds are not long-lived. Seeds are particularly high in protein (40–60%), P (1–2%) and Fe (10–60‰) compared with other Proteaceae. Seeds are favoured food for pre- and post-dispersal granivores (insects, birds, rodents) and young seedlings are favoured by herbivores (insects, marsupials), with the more serotinous fruits providing extra protection for their seeds. Successful establishment is facilitated by the protective and water retentive role of the testa during germination, and the remobilisation of N and P from the cotyledons to the seedling within 10 weeks of emergence. Drought stress reduces seedling establishment in otherwise favourable postfire microsites and prevents it (assisted by herbivores) in mature vegetation. Typically, < 10% of seeds released after fire become seedlings, and < 50% of these survive the first summer. Among fire-killed species, species that produce few seeds are more likely to have drought-resistant seedlings, often associated with larger seeds and/or needle-shaped leaves. Species that resprout after fire produce a few large viable seeds per plant, whereas fire-killed species produce many smaller seeds. Of all the Proteaceae, the ecology of woody-fruited species is best known, providing great scope for comparative biology studies. © 1998, CSIRO.

However, lowland habitats have been impacted by clearing and fragmentation of native forest types within the past 170 years. This paper considers the implications of loss and fragmentation of lowland eucalypt forests for birds in winter, by comparing the proportionate density of twelve selected species across 49 different cases representing a variety of structural habitat differences. There was little fragmentation effect on forest-dependant winter immigrant species down to about 10 ha. The smallest remnants had reduced proportionate abundances of forest-dependent species together with elevated abundances of two other species: Noisy Miner and Australian Magpie. Similar shifts in species composition occurred in association with a variety of types of change in native eucalypt forest, all involving alteration to physical structure incorporating reduction of foliage cover (at forest edges, in areas without understorey, in regenerating forest, on slopes and ridges, and after fires). We consider the ecological processes that might underlie these patterns, and suggest that: (1) habitat selection, possibly mediated and/or reinforced by interference competition from Noisy Miners, is a key process in the study system in winter; (2) habitat loss, rather than fragmentation, is likely to be the main cause of regional declines in forest-dependent winter migrants; and (3) the management of habitat for winter migrant birds within lowland eucalypt forests of this region should focus on maintaining and improving: (a) the overall percentage of lowland area covered by native forest, and (b) factors associated with the structural integrity (canopy and understorey cover, fire frequency, retention of complete microtopographic gradients) of remnant forest areas irrespective of their size, at least down to about 10 ha.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031400382

Previous studies, however, have focused primarily on how nest predation can change when landscapes become fragmented by agriculture rather than by logging. To determine if predation on artificial nests in forest patches was influenced by the surrounding landscape, we placed ground and shrub nests along the edge and interior of forest patches located in agricultural, logged, and contiguous forest landscapes within a single region of the southern boreal mixedwood forest of central Canada. Nest predators were identified using remotely triggered cameras and by marks left in plasticine eggs, whereas the relative abundance of nest predators such as corvids and small mammals was estimated by surveys and live-trapping. The percentage of ground nests destroyed at the edge and interior of patches in the logged and contiguous forest landscapes was significantly lower than at the edge or interior of patches in the agricultural landscape. No differences in predation rate were observed for shrub nests among landscapes. We attributed higher rates of predation in the agricultural landscape to higher densities of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in the interior and a greater diversity of predators along edges. The similarity in predation rate between logged and contiguous forest landscapes suggests that fragmentation caused by logging may result in little change in predator communities and in this respect, might be similar to fragmentation caused by natural disturbance regimes such us fire. In contrast, fragmentation by agriculture seems to have more serious consequences for nesting birds. Policy changes that limit the growth of agriculture in the southern boreal mixedwood forest are required to conserve the diverse avifauna of this region.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031460728

The liberation of Prespa, a remote and rather socially isolated borderline area, from Ottoman occupation took place in 1912-13. Recent events in its environmental history have been forest clearings and human depopulation in the Civil War (1944-49), irrigation system construction in the 1960s, its 'discovery' by ornithologists in the late 1960s, the high emigration rates of 1960-1980, its designation as a National Park in 1974, the destructive development works of 1984-86 after Greece's entry to the EEC and the conversion to intensive bean cultivation in the mid 1980s. The human population of ca 7000 at the start of this century suffered an almost 80% decrease after the Civil War. A resettlement in the mid 1950s increased the population by 40% but in the 1970s emigration reduced it to its previous size of around 1500, still its present size. The extensive and diverse farming systems of previous centuries changed gradually after the construction of an irrigation network in the 1960s, which twenty years later and along with international changes in production and economy patterns, made possible the present day domination of a bean monoculture within irrigated croplands. This was accompanied by increased energy inputs, mechanisation and the use of chemicals. Intensification of agriculture brought increased incomes which attracted also livestock keepers, resulting in a 56% decrease in numbers of livestock in 1964-1993. Cattle are presently kept for meat production only. They graze on the mountains, and no longer in the meadows around the lakeshore. A local shorthorn breed accounting for 93% of all cattle in 1963 declined to less than 18% in 1993. Fishing aimed mainly at carp and Prespa bleak, continues today as in the past to be a source of supplementary income. Eighty-six per cent of the mainly oak and beech - forests are State owned and the rest belong to local municipalities. The forest area has not changed essentially in the last 40 years, but forest roads have expanded. Forests provide mainly fuelwood for local needs and small quantities of industrial timber. No specific management is conducted to safeguard the conservation values of the forest, the majority of which consists of even aged coppiced stands with limited value for wildlife. Manufacturing never played an important role for the economy of the area. Tourism has increased in the last 20 years, concentrated mainly in summer and spring. Accommodation in the villages is not yet satisfactory though it has improved enormously in recent years. The National Park's infrastructure for visitors remains poor. Tourist pressure generally is not yet that high to impact drastically the social and environmental fabric. In places, hunting, angling and poaching can negatively affect the target species. The construction of the irrigation network in the eastern part of Lake Mikri Prespa was the most important change to the landscape and the habitats of Prespa the last 30 years. It resulted in the embankment of free-flowing streams, drainage of wet meadows and dramatic reduction of trees and hedges. In the last 15 years, the reedbeds, no longer burnt or mowed and assisted by increased nutrient loadings from agricultural runoff, have expanded landward to occupy formerly open, periodically flooded, areas. The above changes in habitats and land use have brought an impoverishment of biodiversity which can be seen in the extermination or the decrease in the numbers of certain plant and bird species. The problems preventing a better management of the National Park and the perpetuation of its values are inappropriate legislation, the poor degree of coordination of the public services, the lack of both a specific National Park Service in Greece and a management authority for the Park and the hostile attitude of local people due to their limited information and involvement. The scenic beauty, the wetlands and a number of rare habitats, the diversity of habitats, flora and fauna, the endemic life forms, the rare mammals and the colonial waterbirds, the local architecture and the cultural expressions such as the Byzantine monuments, are the values of Prespa that must be preserved as a whole. The initial conservation efforts aimed at preserving biodiversity but later it became apparent that not only are humans an inseparable part of the whole, but additionally, several of their extensive activities have contributed substantially to the rich biodiversity of the area. Through the prerequisites of keeping a balance between primary and tertiary sector activities and of revitalizing the social fabric, the following are the key management and conservation issues of today: an unequivocal agreement on the values to be preserved and their limits; the formation of a management authority; a new realistic protection and land use zoning; the diversification and extensification of all farming activities; the restoration of the wet meadow habitats; the ensuring of a high water level and a good water quality for both lakes through tri-lateral cooperation between Greece, Albania and FYROM; and the establishment of a permanent environmental monitoring scheme. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Biodiversity conservation; Cultural landscapes; Ecological integrity; Ecosystem management; Greece; Human ecology; Integrated management approach; National park management; Prespa; Protected area management; Wetland conservation; Wetland management",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030817352

Selenium bioaccumulated in aquatic food chains and caused severe reproductive failure and teratogenic deformities in fish. Beginning in 1986, the electric utility company changed its ash disposal practices and selenium-laden wastewater no longer entered the lake. A survey of selenium present in the water, sediments, benthic invertebrates, fish, and aquatic birds was conducted in 1996. Concentrations were compared to pre-1986 levels to determine how much change occurred during the decade since selenium inputs stopped. The data were also examined using a hazard assessment protocol to determine if ecosystem-level hazards to fish and aquatic birds had changed as well. Results reveal that waterborne selenium fell from a peak of 20 μg/liter before 1986, to <1 μg/liter in 1996; concentrations in biota were 85-95% lower in 1996. Hazard ratings indicate that high hazard existed prior to 1986 and that moderate hazard is still present, primarily due to selenium in the sediment-detrital food pathway. Concentrations of selenium in sediments have fallen by about 65-75 %, but remain sufficiently elevated (1- 4 μg/g) to contaminate benthic food organisms of fish and aquatic birds. Field evidence confirmed the validity of the hazard ratings. Developmental abnormalities in young fish indicate that selenium-induced teratogenesis and reproductive impairment are occurring. Moreover, the concentrations of selenium in benthic food organisms are sufficient to cause mortality in young bluegill and other centrarchids because of Winter Stress Syndrome. At the ecosystem level, recovery has been slow. Toxic effects are still evident 10 years after selenium inputs were stopped. The sediment-associated selenium will likely continue to be a significant hazard to fish and aquatic birds for years.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107067

Previous checklists are reviewed, together with sightings accumulated over the 1992-1995 period during which approximately 70 new species have been added to the reserve inventory, bringing the total to 478. Occurrence across the 12 delineated habitats, relative abundance and sighting documentation are given for each species. The avifauna of the B.B.S. is mixed biogeographically; in addition to a substantial component of lowland birds widespread throughout South America, it is composed of Amazonian, cerrado and chaco elements also. Representation from the Bolivian Yungas is minimal. Significantly, no less than four threatened and 15 near-threatened species have occurred, including the little known Bolivian endemic Unicoloured Thrush Turdus haplochrous, and the enigmatic White-winged Nightjar Caprimulgus candicans, known until recently only from Emas National Park (Brazil). Short accounts are provided detailing records of all of these species. Birds of the reserve core, consisting largely of humid tropical forest formations inundated during the austral summer, appear not to be subjected currently to any serious environmental degradation, although some subsistence clearance by Chimane Indians in the northern reaches of the reserve gives some cause for concern. Of much greater import, however, are changes occurring outside the confines of the B.B.S. These include increasing urbanization immediately to the west (and associated road upgrading) and forest fragmentation to the south brought about by logging. The latter is especially worrying because linkage of the B.B.S. forest block to surrounding forest is already physically tenuous, and therefore it is imperative that future logging activities be geared to minimize isolation occurring and the damaging restriction of gene flow. Monitoring in rainforest immediately south of the reserve should become routine to warn of putative avifaunal impoverishments. Extensive surveying of the 2,500-ha El Porvenir éstancia (savanna and related forest islands) due to be assimilated shortly into the B.B.S., which constitutes less than 2% of the area under consideration, has shown that it is used by no less than three threatened and up to nine near-threatened species. In the absence of data relating to other savanna areas (c. 15%) at present, the exact status of each species at the B.B.S. remains imprecise and begs for further research to be undertaken. Unfortunately, present management of the El Porvenir savanna is not conducive to the long-term maximization of populations of these species, several of which have local strongholds in this part of Beni. We recommend that the current policy of cattle ranching adopted by this éstancia should cease or be reduced dramatically, to minimize grazing and trampling damage, and that measures should be taken to reduce incursions of fires started wilfully in neighbouring properties. The Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Bolivia, which administers the reserve, should be encouraged to safeguard and enhance the savanna complement further by ensuring that the impending ratification of El Porvenir proceeds as quickly as possible, and by purchasing additional tracts of land to the south of the present southern reserve boundary, where feasible. Such actions should not only secure the future of the biota of the savanna habitat within the B.B.S. but also should ameliorate the degree of isolation which has occurred already by preserving the ""curiches"" (former river beds) and forest islands which act as access corridors for forest-dwelling and other birds.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031461618

Stigmas are dry and ovules are anatropous, hemicampylotropous or anacampylotropous and have an outer 2-6-layered integument and an inner 2-layered integument or a single integument. The ovary usually contains more ovules than will form seeds. Flowering strategies vary from mass-flowering types, in which the flowering episode typically takes only a few days, to steadystate types of up to 90 days duration. Flowering at dry/wet season transition is common in seasonal climates, and fireinduced flowering is found occasionally. Outbreeding is probably widespread, although both self-compatible and self-incompatible species exist. The self-incompatible species have self pollen tubes penetrating the micropyles, so preferential outcrossing may be maintained by a late-acting mechanism. Cryptic dioecy, in which female flowers have 'mimic' sterile anthers occurs in several genera. Apomixis occurs in Syzygium and this has been reported to be linked to the polyembryony found in this genus. Myrtoid fruits are fleshy berries or drupes, dispersed by birds, bats, and other small mammals. Fruit size, color, texture, and number of seeds are all very variable. Seed coats may be absent to bony, but have a smooth surface. The endosperm is mainly digested by the developing embryo. Early embryology is relatively uniform but final embryo morphology varies widely across the genera. Germination times vary from 10 days to over 2 years and seed viability periods from 15 days to 1 year.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-13144295046

During the slide, 20 acres of the northwest slope of the landfill slipped into approximately 11 acres of an excavated area being prepared for future waste disposal. The majority of the landslide area came to rest at slopes in the range of 4 horizontal: 1 vertical or less, with very steep to vertical slopes present at the scarp (highwall) of the slide, and where vertical blocks of waste were present throughout the upper slide area. The scarp had a maximum height of about 200 feet. The landslide resulted in a number of emergency safety, health, environmental, and operating concerns, including more mass waste movements, air quality/odor, waste fires, leachate vectors, vermin, and birds. Rumpke and its consultants worked to develop response strategies to address those concerns on both a short-term (initial response) and long-term basis. The actions included waste buttressing, slope monitoring, use of spray-on covers and deodorizers, air quality monitoring, construction of surface water diversions and toe berms, and new monitoring well installation. The actions taken allowed partial operations at the facility to resume two days after the landslide, with the focus on long-term stabilization. The responses developed for the slide were based on preliminary evaluation of potential causes of the landslide. The slope reconstruction was designed to address the potential factors identified as potentially being responsible for the landslide. The primary material selected for slope reconstruction was solid waste because of its availability and its geotechnical characteristics.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030393374

I detected an average of 45 species per site and a total of 87 species in the sites combined. A comppilation of these data with bird‐count data from more than 200 additional studies conducted across 15 major vegetation cover types in the northern Rocky Mountain region showed that 15 bird species are generally more abundant in early post‐fire communities than in any other major cover type occurring in the northern Rockies. One bird species (Black‐backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing dead forests created by stand‐replacement fires. Bird communities in recently burned forests are different in composition from those that characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including early‐successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding guilds are especially abundant therein: woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters. Standing, fire‐killed trees provided nest sites for nearly two‐thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites. Broken‐top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for cavity‐nesting species significantly more often than expected on the basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the broken‐top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest conditions prior to a fire (especially the presence of snags) may be important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity‐nesting birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or relatively restricted to burned forests, stand‐replacement fires may be necessary for long‐term maintenance of their populations. Unfortunately, the current fire policy of public land‐management agencies does not encourage maintenance of stand‐replacement fire regimes, which may be necessary for the creation of conditions needed by the most fire‐dependent bird species. In addition, salvage cutting may reduce the suitability of burned‐forest habitat for birds by removing the most important element—standing, fire‐killed trees–needed for feeding, nesting, or both by the majority of bird species that used burned forests.

In each case there is, I believe, a stream of events that is random in certain aspects and in each case there is a nonrandom selective process which causes certain of the random selective components to “survive” longer than others. Without the random, there can be no new thing. (1980, p. 163) I begin from a discrimination I owe to Horst Mittelstaedt, who pointed out that there are two “sorts” of methods of perfecting an adaptive act. Let us suppose that the act is the shooting of a bird. In the first case this is to be done with a rifle. The marksman will look along the sights of his rifle and will note an error in its aim. He will correct the error, perhaps creating a new error which again he will correct, until he is satisfied. He will then press the trigger and shoot. What is significant is that the act of self‐correction occurs within the single act of shooting. Mittelstaedt uses the term Feedback to characterize this whole genus of methods of perfecting an adaptive act. In contrast, consider the man who is shooting a flying bird with a shotgun or who uses a revolver held under the table where he cannot correct its aim. In such cases, what must happen is that any aggregate of information is taken in through sense organs; that upon this information, computation is completed; and that upon the (approximate) result of that computation, the gun is fired…, The man who would acquire skill with a shotgun or in the art of shooting pistols under the table must practice his art again and again, shooting at skeet or some dummy target. By long practice, he must adjust the setting of his nerves and muscles so that in the critical event, he will “automatically” give an optimum performance. This genus of methods Mittelstaedt calls Calibration. (Ibid., pp. 215–216) There are subcycles of living and dying within the bigger, more enduring ecology. But what shall we say of the death of the larger system? Our biosphere? Perhaps under the eye of heaven, or Shiva, it doesn't matter. But it's the only one we know.

This period included 13 years of below.average rainfall, a number of minor wildfires and one that burnt 95% of the study area in January 1985. Annual survival of breeding males (mean = 70%) and females (mean = 59%) was higher during a period without fire. Survival of breeding females fell to less than 50% from 1987 to 1989, two years after the major fire. Survival of adults did not vary with age, but survival of juveniles was lower (mean = 31%) and variable (rànge 11.59%), particularly among those produced in the first breeding season after the fire in 1985. Splendid fairy.wrens bred during the Austral spring, with minor variation in length of the breeding season depending on rainfall at the start and temperature at the end of the breeding season. Clutch size varied little, but females laid more clutches in years when predation or brood parasitism were high, particularly in the two years after the major fire. Females produced a mean of 2.9 fledglings each season (4.7 in the best year), but productivity was low for several years after the 1985 fire. Helpers attended 60% of all nests but overall had little effect on annual fledgling production. Experienced females were more productive than novices, both with and without helpers. High reproductive effort, indexed by days nesting and caring for fledglings, did not reduce a female's chance of survival to the next breeding season, and annual reproductive effort was not correlated with female survival. Differential dispersal and mortality produced variation in the adult sex ratio. During the fire.free period 1978.84, the numbers of non.breeding males and females increased, because of a lack of available territories rather than a lack of available partners. Variation in natality and survival caused large variations in population density but the density of breeders was more constant (C.V. =24%) than than of helpers (C.V. = 57%). No decline in the population after the major fire of January 1985 was apparent until the 1988 breeding season; the number of groups declined from 1988 to 1990, some previously occupied territories became vacant and group size decreased. This delayed decline in population is attributed to decreased production of fledglings in the years after the fire and the gradual replacement of experienced breeding females by novices, which were less productive and suffered higher mortality. The major causes of demographic variation (brood parasites and fire) directly affected natality and juvenile survival; indirectly, population density, age structure, sex ratio and group composition were affected. Delayed dispersal, the proximate cause of cooperative breeding in splendid fairy.wrens, is favoured by this demographic environment. The widespread occurrence of similar demographic profiles may in part explain the high frequency of cooperative breeding in Australian birds. © 1993 CSIRO.

It is therefore still not clear whether Bongen had a long and successful career, nor whether his production was large. This article deals with the eighteenth-century activities of Matthijs Horrix (1735-1809), a furniture maker who in certain aspects may be regarded as Bongen’s Hague counterpart. He, too, hailed from Germany, set up independently in the Netherlands in the 1760s and worked in the French style from the outset of his career. There are however no doubts as to his success: he was The Hague’s best-known furniture maker in the late eighteenth century, with the largest workshop. In the course of the nineteenth century the firm he founded grew into the largest in the Netherlands (note 4). Whereas it cannot be ascertained whether ‘French’ cabinet-making was ever a dominant trend in Amsterdam, one gets the impression that such was to some extent the case in The Hague after 1760. In the city where the Stadholder’s court and foreign embassies were based, the French-oriented court style had been a significant factor since at least the late seventeenth century (notes 5, 6 and 8). Many patrons in The Hague were probably keen on furniture which actually came from France. In 1771 the guild of furniture makers complained to the city council about the influx of furniture imported from abroad; this probably meant imports from France (notes 9 and 10). Several furniture makers in The Hague began to imitate the French models. As early as 1761 Matthijs Franses (ca. 1726-1788), who came from Kempen near Krefeld, advertized that he made and sold a variety of veneered furniture in the French style. His descriptions are not very clear, but mention is made of commodes and tables inlaid with copper (in the Boulle technique?), commodes ‘à la Diligence’ with gilded bronze mouldings and marble tops, desks and ‘Ouvrages en ébène’. Franses says nothing about marquetry featuring different kinds of wood, the most popular decorative technique in Paris around 1760 and the kind of work with which Bongen made his debut in Amsterdam in 1766. It seems likely that Horrix arrived in The Hague around 1761. He was born in 1735, probably in Lobberich near Krefeld (note 25). In a petition submitted in 1764 he stated that he had been apprenticed to a cabinet-maker in The Hague ‘for some years’; the period in question was probably not longer than three years (notes 26 and 27). At the beginning of this period, then, Horrix was already 25 years of age or older. In view of the common practice throughout Europe for boys to be apprenticed to a craftsman at the age of fourteen or thereabouts for a period of some six years (note 28), Horrix may have worked in one or more shops elsewhere after his apprenticeship and before his arrival in The Hague. However, no information about this period is available. On May 15 1764, Horrix was enrolled in the Hague guild as a master cabinet-maker (note 33). On January 9th of that year he had acquired citizenship, and on May 5th he had married Elisabeth de la Fosse of The Hague. The wedding was witnessed by Willem Corbaz (ca. 1745-1818), who was to become Horrix’ closest associate and was probably already in his employ in 1764. In 1766 Horrix bought a house and adjacent workshop on Spuistraat, where he spent the rest of his life; the workshop continued to operate in the same building until 1853 (notes 36, 37 and 38). He probably employed one or more apprentices quite soon. We only know about apprentices from outside The Hague, as these were entered in the register of immigrants (note 40). Horrix’ first foreign apprentice was Louis Hiwert from Clermont-Ferrand, who entered his service in 1769 (note 41). In the ensuing years the register shows that Horrix’ soon became the leading workshop in The Hague; the 1770 register, for example, records no fewer than six new apprentices. Between 1764 and 1795 ninety cabinetmakers’ apprentices were registered in all. The place of employment of forty-four of them is noted: twenty-seven worked for Horrix, i.e. nearly two-thirds of the total number. Eighteen of the twenty-seven came from Germany, five from the Netherlands, three from France and one from Switzerland (note 43). In 1771 Horrix became a master-chairmaker and was henceforth entitled to make chairs as well as cabinetwork. Only two other furniture makers working in The Hague in the latter half of the eighteenth century were thus doubly qualified: Reynier van Venedien (ca. 1720-1765) and his son Johannes (1752-1810). The register of immigrants does not record a single chairmaking apprentice at Horrix’, but then virtually all the chairmakers were indigenous to The Hague (see note 48). Also in 1771 Horrix’ assistant Willem Corbaz entered the guild as an upholsterer (note 52) – Horrix now ran the city’s most all-round firm. In 1773 he engaged an apprentice upholsterer from Brussels (note 53); Corbaz’ activities seem to have been mostly confined to book-keeping. In 1772 Horrix placed an advertisement in the ‘s-Gravenhaegse Courant describing his range of chairs and veneered furniture. Using exclusively French terms, he stated that everything was ‘in the latest Paris fashion’. By 1774 his shop was called ‘In de commode van Parijs’ (note 59). Horrix’ wife died in 1786; the couple was childless. Perhaps this was why Horrix’ nephew Pieter Paulus Horrix (1747-1840) came to the Netherlands. Pieter worked for his uncle from 1791 on, with interruptions. He seems to have played an increasingly important role in the firm, which he ran on his own after Matthijs’ death in 1809 (note 63). Horrix evidently established quite a reputation in The Hague shortly after settling there in 1764, for by 1767 he was already receiving important commissions from the Stadholder’s court. The records of his deliveries to the court between 1767 and 1795 are the chief source of information about his work, although they are by no means complete. They include general accounts relating to the household and domains, and records of the private expenses of the Stadholder, Prince William V, his wife Wilhelmina, who was a Prussian princess by birth, their daughter Princess Louise and the hereditary prince, who later became King William I (notes 64-70). All records pertaining to Matthijs Horrix in these various archives are listed in Appendix I. In 1767, the year in which Horrix’ name occurs for the first time in the court accounts, Prince William v married Princess Wilhelmina. Various residences were modernized for the occasion, and furniture was purchased in quantity. Although Horrix was not the only cabinet-maker to supply the court others were Theodoras Borneman (1735-1798, who became a master in 1762), Johan Hendrik Nohr (ca. 1711-1790, master in 1753) and Antony Sardijn (1723-1809, master in 1754) he did supply the largest amount of furniture. This no doubt had to do with the fact that his work reflected the latest Paris fashion, for it was only Horrix who supplied the characteristically French commodes and secretaires. The refurbishing of the royal residences, supervised by the architect Pieter de Swart (ca. 1709-1773), was characterized by the French style in other ways as well. After 1767 Horrix continued to work for the household regularly (appendix 1, B). Payments to furniture makers are rarely noted in the prince’s private accounts (appendix I, D). William was less interested in the decoration of his apartments than his artistically minded wife, whose private accounts record the yearly acquisition of works of art in quantity (appendix I, E). Almost every year Princess Wilhelmina purchased expensive items of luxury furniture from Horrix, who also made a few pieces for the children when they were very young; later their parsimonious tutor and governess employed less expensive craftsmen. In 1772 Horrix delivered ‘a small inlaid table’ to the young Princess Louise (appendix I, F, 2) the only concrete evidence that he produced marquetry furniture during this period. In 1780 Princess Wilhelmina paid Horrix 557 guilders ‘vor Commodes wozu ihm Chinesisch L ackwerck gelieferf’ (appendix I, E, 10). This is the first reference to furniture inlaid with oriental lacquer (note 87). It was followed in 1781 by a large lacquer-decorated clock case (appendix I, F, 2). In the ensuing years Horrix continued to supply lacquer furniture. In 1790-’91 he made the wainscoting, inlaid with lacquer panels, for the new Audience Chamber at Huis ten Bosch (fig. 2). He also made the furniture for that room (figs. 3-6; appendices I, A, 15 and 1, B, 3). In 1791 he provided several items of furniture for the corps de logis at the ‘Old Court’ for the Stadholder’s heir, who married Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia, a niece of his mother’s, that year. These apartments were rather simply furnished (notes 93 and 94; appendices 1, B, 1, 6 and 7). In 1795 the Stadholder’s family fled from the French conquerors to England. This brought an abrupt end to almost 30 years of commissions for Horrix. Throughout this period the court had ordered furniture from other cabinet-makers too. The brothers Johan Hendrik I (ca. 1733-1790, master in 1768) and Johan Hendrik II Huyser (ca. 1740-1820, master in 1789) carried out sizeable assignments between 1770 and 1795, most of them however for plain, often oak, furniture and a large number of repairs (notes 98-102). Horrix was obviously the principal purveyor of costly, elaborate furniture; Princess Wilhelmina was particularly fond of his work. Cabinet-makers who worked less frequently for the court were Johannes Latour (1741-1801, master frame-maker in 1783, master cabinet-maker in 1790; notes 103-106), Daniel Vrijdag (ca. 1728-1780, master in 1759; note 107), George Philippus Beukers (1738-1810, master in 1764?; note 108) and Matthijs Franses, of the aforementioned advertisements of 1761 (note 109). Unfortunately no register of Horrix’ customers has survived. The only sources of information about his clients other than the court are more or less chance discoveries in notaries’, private and other archives. All bills and other items concerning Horrix in such archives are listed in Appendix 11. Many of Horrix’ principal customers undoubtedly came from court circles. These certainly included Assueer Jan Baron Torek (1753-1793) and his wife Eusebia Jacoba de Rode van Heeckeren (1739-1793), who owned Rosendacl and Duivenvoordc castles and a mansion on Lange Voorhout in The Hague. Bills and lists undoubtedly incomplete today – show that they bought practically all their furniture from Horrix. The earliest extant bill dates from 1769 but the couple, who married in 1758, probably started buying considerable amounts of furniture at least from 1765 (appendices 11, A, 1-6; note 113). It is highly likely that costly pieces were among these early acquisitions; the bill of 1769 is mainly for repairs, among others of a ‘French table’ and a ‘Comode’, modern items of furniture probably purchased not long before. Horrix’ bills to the Torcks illustrate his workshop’s enormous versatility; he supplied a great variety of types ranging from costly to simple. Horrix also worked for Torek’s mother and son (appendix II, A, 7; note 115). A cousin of Torek’s was Frederik Christiaan van Reede, fifth Earl of Athlone (1743-1808), owner of Amerongen and Middachten castles and of houses in The Hague and Utrecht. He ordered a few pieces from Horrix (appendices II, B, 1-5), but bought most of his furniture in Zeist or Utrecht; other Hague furniture makers also worked for him (note 119). His son Lord Agrim, later the sixth Earl, did order a quantity of important pieces from Horrix folio wing his marriage in 1788 (appendices II, B, 6-7). Horrix also worked for a daughter and son-in-law of the fifth Earl (appendices II, B, 8-10). Towards the end of his life William, Count Bcntinck (1704-1774), a prominent statesman with Orange sympathies and a patron of the arts, purchased a few pieces from the young Horrix, perhaps a set of 24 mahogany chairs (notes 121-123). His brother Charles Jan was also one of Horrix’ customers (note 124). Another art lover, Johan Frederik, Baron van Spaen van Biljoen (1746-1827), bought a bergère from Horrix (notes 125 and 126). Horrix may also have supplied furniture to the Spanish ambassador, Viscount de la Herreria (note 133). He carried out assignments for the city of Amsterdam’s Logement in The Hague (appendix II, D), he worked for ‘Pictura’, the Hague artists’ society (appendices 11, C, 1-3; note 127), for the noted collector of paintings Cornelis van Fleemskerck and for the sumptuous interior of Mrs. C. A. van Dam-Gerlings (appendix 11, F.; notes 129, 130 and 135), as well as for lesser known citizens of The Hague. Of all the furniture made by Horrix and mentioned in the various archives, only the Audience Chamber in Huis ten Bosch and its furnishings can be definitely identified (figs. 2-6). However, in Huis ten Bosch there are also three marquetry commodes in Louis xv style which almost certainly were among Horrix’ earliest work for the court (figs. 1, 7 and 8). Although made in the French style, the Dutch origin of these pieces is apparent in the solid oak construction, the somewhat sturdy forms, the relatively stiff character of the contours of the marquetry panels and of the marquetry itself, the greyish-blue marble tops and the English mounts. Moreover, the commode in fig. 8 is a characteristic Dutch type: it has two doors whose handles however give the appearance of drawers; the front of the single shelf inside is incurved. The three commodes, almost certainly the work of one and the same craftsman, have been in Huis ten Bosch at least since the early nineteenth century (note 141). Presumably, then, they were among the few items of the Stadholder’s family furniture which were not auctioned off between 1795 and 1798. On stylistic grounds they can be dated in the 1760s. In view of the fact that Horrix was the sole supplier of commodes to the court in 1767 and the years that followed, there are firm grounds for attributing these three to him. The large example with floral marquetry (fig. 1) belongs to a group of commodes of the same format but differing marquetry decoration. The marquetry panels on one of them (fig.9, note 144) are unusually bordered by tied ribbons. Similar surrounds occur on a pair of commodes with doors (fig. 10, note 145) and on an example with drawers known only from an old photograph (fig. 11, note 146); all three come from Rosendacl castle and probably belonged to Baron and Baroness Torek, who ordered practically all their furniture from Horrix. The Rosendael group, then, can also be attributed to Horrix, thus reinforcing the attribution of the Stadholder group. On the basis of comparison with these two groups, a number of other pieces can be attributed to Horrix. In the first place, a total of ten commodes of the same model as the large example in Huis ten Bosch are known (figs. 1, 9 and 12-19, notes 148-150). The marquetry on the front in each case follows the French example in being divided into three fields, but it varies on every individual commode. The intricate, intertwined borders are a striking feature, combining loops and angular forms. Variations occur in the mounts and the contours of the pieces. Although the commode in fig. 19 ostensibly belongs to this group, closer scrutiny reveals several discrepancies. It has a framework construction, whereas the other pieces are built entirely of boards. The shape, too, is slightly different. The keyholes in the doors at the sides are positioned horizontally (fig. 21), and the marquetry is rather clumsy in several places. The piece might have been made by other craftsmen in Horrix’ workshop than the other examples, but is seems more likely that it is the work of another cabinet-maker who endeavoured to imitate I Iorrix’ popular type – maybe even a former apprentice who had left the workshop. The commode in fig. 9 definitely comes from Horrix’ workshop, although numerous features indicate that the marquetry is the work of different specialist than the one who did the marquetry on the other pieces in this group. The musical trophy and the mount with the vase are harbingers of the neoclassical style. All the mounts on these commodes were probably made in England, presumably in Birmingham. Many of the mounts used in The Hague may have been imported via Rotterdam; several Rotterdam dealers in copper fittings advertized in the ‘s-Cravenhaegse Courant too, and the only Hague trader to advertize English mounts, Jan van Ruyden, came from Rotterdam (notes 159-163). Various mounts used by Horrix also occur on Bongen’s work, and many of the models are illustrated in the pattern books of Birmingham metalwork companies (figs. 23-26, notes 158, 164-167 and 170). A few extant corner cupboards were produced en suite with the first group of commodes (figs. 27 and 28, note 177). They are of the same height as the commodes and the marquetry is very similar; various flowers occur in identical form on both the commodes and the corner cupboards. The unwieldy base of the cupboard in fig. 28 is probably a later replacement. Evident correspondences with the marquetry on Horrix’ commodes suggest that a secrétaire en armoire is also his work (fig. 29, note 180). A second group of furniture that may be attributed to Horrix can be formed around the commodes from Rosendael castle (figs. 10 and 11) with the distinctive marquetry borders of tied ribbons and the individual flower marquetry, frequently on a background of strongly figured wood. This marquetry has less in common with French work than the marquetry in the first group. Various pieces, each of a different model, display similar marquetry: a commode in the collection of the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry (figs. 33 and 34), a commode in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (fig. 35), an example auctioned in New York (fig. 37, note 186) which already exhibits a few neo-classical elements, a corner cupboard (fig. 39) and a secrétaire en pente (fig. 40, note 189), on which the marquetry on the fall-front is however bordered by intertwined bands (fig. 41). Many of the mounts on these pieces occur in English pattern books (figs. 24, 26, 36 and 38, notes 185 and 187). Curiously, in Horrix’ workshop a form of mass production resulting in the first group of similar commodes seems to have coexisted with a much more individual working method; no two pieces in the second group are of the same model. This gives rise to a host of questions as to how the workshop was organized; due to the lack of factual information they are unanswerable. It is however clear that in order to be added to Horrix’ oeuvre a piece must exhibit a large number of convincing correspondences with furniture attributed to him on certain grounds. Many extant pieces have various features in common with Horrix’ work, but cannot be classified unequivocally enough in one of the groups which have been formed. Two of them are illustrated here (figs. 42 and 43, notes 196-198). Although it is quite likely that some furniture in this category was made in Horrix’ workshop, it is disregarded here in view of insufficient indications for a positive attribution. It is however possible to link the group of Louis xv furniture with the t icd-ribbon decoration with a number of pieces in Louis xvi style which were certainly made by the same person. On a commode at Schloss Benrath near Dusseldorf (figs. 44 and 45, note 200), the ribbons are now quite stiff; the neo-classical drapery on the front is still surrounded by a few loosely wound floral sprigs, however, with flowers actually identical to some appearing on pieces in the Louis xv group. The form and decoration of this commode are again inspired by French models, but various elements are clearly alien: the tall legs on copper feet, for instance, and the unusual height of the lower border of the body. Again, the mounts are English; many of them appear in pattern books (figs. 46 and 47; note 202). In the marquetry on the sides of this commode are flowers in an oval medallion suspended from a bow. Very similar marquetry occurs on a corner cupboard, a secretaire and a low cabinet (figs. 48-50, notes 203 and 204). The bases of these three pieces are still in Louis xv style. The fairly simple and sparing marquetry decoration gives them a less opulent look; perhaps they represent a less luxurious aspect of Horrix’ output of marquetry furniture. The cabinet in fig. 50 is the only known piece currently attributed to Horrix with a wooden top decorated with marquetry, instead of a marble slab. A pair of more ornate commodes at Het Huys ten Donck echo the decoration on the front of the one at Benrath (figs. 51 and 52, note 206). Again, the form of the legs and lower border differ markedly from French models. The middle door, which is higher than the two that flank it, hinges onto the right-hand door, as on the Benrath commode. The floral sprays on the sides of these commodes appear in a slightly modified form on the sides of a single-doorcd commode in the Rijksmuseum; the feet, too, are similarly shaped (fig. 5 3, note 209). The front of this latter piece is decorated with an extremely handsome and detailed marquetry panel which does not seem to be directly inspired by French or other examples. A similar panel graces a secretaire sold at Alton Towers in 1924 (fig. 55, note 211). In the late eighteenth century this simple form of Louis xvi secretaire was to become extremely popular in the Netherlands. Dutch furniture of this type often has a wooden top with a raised edge, instead of being topped by a marble slab. Gilt mounts are rare in this later stylistic phase, in which the English influence played a part. A direct English inspiration in Horrix’ work is exemplified by two vase-shaped cutlery cases – typically British objects – which were delivered to Mrs. van Dam in 1794 (appendix 11, E). A cutlery case of the same kind was illustrated in 1792 in Kabinet van Mode en Smaak (fig. 5 6, note 215). The many extant pieces of characteristically Dutch furniture with lacquer panels also belong to this late stylistic phase. The most important example of the genre is Horrix’ new Audience Chamber, or Chinese Room, in Huis ten Bosch (fig. 2). The room marks the end of a European tradition initiated before 1660, perhaps in the same building, where Amalia van Solms, Stadholder Frederick Henry’s consort, ordered panels of Japanese lacquer to be fitted on the walls of a small room. This kind of work became popular into the following century, particularly in German-speaking countries. Horrix’ room in Huis ten Bosch adheres to the specifically German interpretation of the European tradition in its combination of keeper panels with veneered wainscoting. As well as Chinese lacquer panels there are panels of wall-hangings with applique birds, probably made in Japan. The idea for this room may have come from Princess Wilhelmina, who had visited Berlin in 1789. At any rate she had been buying furniture decorated with lacquer panels from Horrix since 1780; together with her cabinet-maker she may have thought that the distinctive combination of light-coloured woods and lacquer panels would be suitable for the panelling of an entire room. Father the Stadholder’s architect, Pieter Willem Schonck (1735-ca. 1832), or his colleague, Friedrich Ludwig Gunckel (ca. 1743-1835), was probably involved in the actual design of the room (note 229). In 1806 it was partially modernized; a pair of double doors was added and a few Empire elements were introduced (see, for example, fig. 6). How the room looked before being modernized can be seen in a plan of 1800 or 1801 (fig. 57, note 231), in which the bracket clock is in its original position. This remarkable, ‘classicized’ version of the Louis xv bracket clock which was so popular in the Netherlands is veneered with handsome Japanese lacquer panels probably from the old collections of the Stadholders and the bottom of the clock is decorated with extremely original marquetry in the form of rock formations. The transition between the legs and the frieze on the round corner tables (fig. 4), made to fit the room’s rounded corners, is very elegant. The trumeaux were probably designed en suite with these little tables, but were altered in the Empire period (fig. 6). The two simple firescreens (fig. 5) together fill the fireplace. A set of cane-covered furniture from another room, possibly made in China in the Adam style, was placed in the room and modified by Horrix (appendix I, B, 3, note 235, fig. 57). He also made the curtains and their covers, blinds to keep the light off the wall-hangings, mattresses and covers for the furniture and cushions for the window seats, also with covers. A commode inlaid with Japanese lacquer dishes bearing the arms of Governor-General Joan van Hoom (1653-1711) was almost certainly made for Assueer Jan Torek, from whose family collection the dishes came (fig. 58, note 240). The piece can therefore be attributed to Horrix; the payment of a substantial sum to him in 1787-88 may relate to the delivery of the commode (note 242). The simple decorative elements occur on innumerable items of similar Dutch furniture and hence cannot serve as a basis for further attributions. It is however possible to attribute a table at Verwolde to Horrix (fig. 59, note 244), in view of the fact that the unusual tops of the legs bear a marked resemblance to those of the corner tables in the Audience Chamber in Huis ten Bosch (fig. 4). It is clear from the documents in appendices I and II that the furniture hitherto attributed to Horrix provides a very patchy picture of his output. Not one of the many simply decorated pieces and small items he supplied has been identified. Furthermore, very little information about his activities as an upholsterer and chairmaker is available. The impression obtained from all the documents is that Horrix was never a serious rival of the large upholsterer’s firms in The Hague with substantial financial resources at their disposal. The court did not give him major upholstery commissions with the exception of the Chinese Room in Huis ten Bosch – but continued to employ the big firms, as did other important customers like the Torcks and Athlones. Horrix did however deliver the occasional chair to the court and other clients. Whenever the wood is specified it is always mahogany, sometimes with inlaid borders (see appendices I, B, 1 and I, B, 5), i.e. typical ‘cabinet maker’s chairs’, made in the same kind of wood that was used for cabinet-making. There is no record of Horrix’ having made softwood, gilt or painted chairs. Horrix was not the only cabinet-maker in The Hague to produce furniture in the French style; such sparse sources as there are reveal that several others worked in this manner. As mentioned above, Matthijs Franses was already advertizing French-style furniture in 1761. At his death in 1788 his stock included inlaid furniture (note 259). At the Amsterdam fair of 1772, the Hague cabinet-makers Hendrik van Venedien (master between 1765 and 1770) and Pietcr Wynants (1740-1814, master in 1768) both had ‘French works’ on offer, probably marquetry furniture. In 1790 Van Vencdien supplied a few items of inlaid furniture to the fifth Earl of Athlone (note 265). A former apprentice in his shop, Lambcrtus Berten, set up in Voorburg near The Hague in 1772 or 1773 (notes 268 and 270). At the 1774 Amsterdam fair he offered furniture decorated with floral marquetry (note 272), and in 1778 he sold a small commode inlaid with lozenges to the Countess of Athlone (note 275). There are very few records of other Hague cabinet-makers who made furniture inlaid with lacquer. When Theodorus Borneman (1735-1798, master in 1762) died, his stock was found to contain furniture decorated with lacquerwork (note 278). Finally, Johannes Latour certainly repaired lacquer furniture (notes 279 and 280). © 1993, Brill. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953407388

Lab. of Ecological Science, Department of Zoology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, United States","This paper tests the proposition that a small set of plant, animal, and abiotic processes structure ecosystems across scales in time and space. Earlier studies have suggested that these key structuring processes establish a small number of dominant temporal frequencies that entrain other processes. These frequencies often differ from each other by at least an order of magnitude. If true, ecosystems therefore will have a few dominant frequencies that are endogenously driven and that are discontinuously distributed. This paper additionally tests the proposition that these structuring processes should also generate a discontinuous distribution of spatial structures coupled with the discontinuous frequencies. If that is the case, animals living in specific landscapes should demonstrate the existence of this lumpy architecture by showing gaps in the distribution of their sizes. This proved to be the case for birds and mammals of the boreal region forest and the short-grass prairie. Alternative hypotheses to explain the body mass clumps include architectural, developmental, historical, and trophic causes. These were all tested by comparing body-mass clump distributions (1) in ecosystems having different spatial structures (forest, grassland, and marine pelagic) and (2) in different animal groups having different body plans (birds and mammals) or feeding habits (carnivore, omnivore, and herbivore). The only hypothesis that could not be rejected is that the body-mass clumps are entrained by discontinuous hierarchical structures and textures of the landscape. There is evidence for at least eight distinct habitat ""quanta,"" each defined by a distinct texture at a specific range of scales. These eight quanta together cover tens of centimetres to hundreds of kilometres in space and at least months to millennia in time. There is a striking similarity, but not identity, between the clump structure of prairie and boreal animals. This indicates that many processes that form qualitative habitat structure are common to both landscapes or ecosystems, but a few are landscape specific, particularly over larger scales. That conclusion is extended to all terrestrial ecosystems by an analysis of the body-mass clump structure of all North American birds. In contrast, there are striking differences in clump structure between landscapes and ""waterscapes,"" indicating that fundamentally different processes shape structure in terrestrial and open ocean systems. The discontinuous body-mass structure provides a bioassay of discontinuous ecosystem structure. Mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores all show the same number of body-mass clumps, and the gaps in these distributions occur at the same body masses. Mammals and birds show the same number of bodymass clumps, but the mass gaps for mammals occur at larger sizes than those for birds in such a way that the log-transformed body-mass gaps for mammals are correlated linearly with those for birds. Hence there is a simple cross-calibration between the mammal and bird bioassays. I compiled and analyzed published data on home ranges in order to convert body masses into an absolute linear measure of geometric structures in the landscape. A new and general equation was developed relating home-range size to body mass, and was tested by reanalyzing published data for mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores and for birds. I conclude: (1) Birds and mammals of all trophic levels utilize resources in their foraging areas in the same way by measuring the spatial grain of habitat patches with a resolution defined as a function of their size (i.e., the animal's step length or minimum unit of measurement). The step length is a morphological function of the size of animals and is not significantly affected by trophic status or taxonomy of the groups considered. That explains why all trophic levels and both birds and mammals show the same qualitative body-mass clump structure. (2) Home-range data can convert the body-mass data to a quantitative estimate of texture, i.e., of fractal dimension of the landscape. The landscape forms a hierarchy that contains breaks in object sizes, object proximities, and textures at particular scales. Animals also demonstrate a hierarchy of decisions whose target suddenly shifts at specific scales in space and time. The interaction between these two hierarchies produces the discontinuous body-mass clump structure. The breaks in geometry in the landscape occur because structuring processes exert their influence over defined ranges of scale. The temporal and architectural structure of habitat quanta are in general determined by three classes of processes, each dominating over three different ranges of scale. Vegetative processes that determine plant growth, plant form, and soil structure dominate the formation of texture at fine microscales of centimetres to tens of metres in space and days to decades in time. At the other, macroscale extreme, slow geomorphological processes dominate the formation of a topographic and edaphic structure at large scales of hundreds to thousands of kilometres and centuries to millennia. At the mesoscales in between, contagious disturbance processes such as fire, insect outbreak, plant disease, and water flow dominate the formation of patterns over spatial scales of hundreds of metres to hundreds of kilometres. In addition, the direct impacts of grazing by large herbivores and of human activities, and the indirect effects of large predators and animal disease, further transform spatial patterns over these meso-scales. These processes operate on time scales of years to decades, making them critically important in determining whether present local, regional, and global human influences will trigger a transition in vegetation types, and, if so, how rapidly. The paper provides a direction for the development of programs to evaluate, monitor, and predict ecosystem and community changes across scales. The necessary research elements include (1) models that incorporate a few scale-dependent structuring processes to allow cross-scale analysis; (2) comparative studies of different disturbed and undisturbed landscapes using the animal body-mass bioassay technique to identify critical scales of ecosystem geometry; (3) analysis of remote imagery to identify spatial discontinuities and regions of scale invariance; and (4) behavioral studies of the hierarchy of animal decisions to identify species groups vulnerable to predicted (using models) or observed (using remote imagery) changes in vegetation geometry.","Community vs. ecosystem ecology; Contagious disturbance processes; Discontinuous community structure; Discontinuous ecosystem structure; Ecosystem dynamics; Ecosystem organization; Fractal; Global change; Spatial structure at different scales",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027101174

About 25% of the native vascular plant species are endemic and, with exceptions such as the relictual Degeneria, most have apparently diverged from overseas conspecifics. There are a few cases where speciation has occurred within Fiji but virtually none where reproductive isolation is established, permitting cohabitation. Until the arrival of humans, perhaps 4000 and certainly by 3000 yr BP, the vegetation was predominantly rainforests with stunted cloud forest at high altitude, though some more open communities might have occurred in drier areas. The forests have a mixed species composition, including most of the 1769 native species, and demographic observations indicate peak population fecundities after several hundred years for canopy trees and 70 yr for several subcanopy taxa. Flowering phenology of forest species is seasonal with predominately synchronous annual or, in a few species, biennial frequency, while fruit maturation is spread throughout the year. Cyclones cause frequent minor damage and infrequent major damage, especially to coastal and ridge vegetation, and cause landslides. Insect-induced dieback has been recorded but there are no extensive single-species rainforests, except swamp forests, so the effects are diffuse. The impact of humans has been to convert much of the drier forest to frequently burned sedge-fern-grasslands, to create garden-forest successional mosaics around settlement in wetter areas, and, more recently, to selectively log much of the remaining accessible forest. Many plants have been introduced and established in cultivated or disturbed areas, increasing the flora by c50% and largely excluding native taxa from those areas. Habitat conversion is thus the major threat to the conservation of Fijian native vegetation. -Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027060009

Fourteen of 19 new clans were occupying new colony sites <400-2440m from an adjacent colony. Pioneering or budding was suspected in formation of the new colonies, depending upon the distance the new colony was from another colony. Although only 1% of males were estimated to have colonized, colonization appears to be an important factor in the population biology of the species. The population increase was attributable to: a large inventory of pine sawtimber, availability of old trees for cavity excavation, control of hardwood midstory with prescribed fire, protection of cavity trees, and provision of adequate foraging habitat. The lack of any of these factors probably would have prevented a population increase. Despite a net increase in number of clans, colonies were being abandoned at a rate of 1.1% annually, a loss probably caused by encroachment of hardwood and pine midstories around cavity trees.

In the California chaparral there are two syndromes contrasted by the timing of seedling recruitment relative to wildfires. One syndrome, here called the fire-recruiter or refractory seed syndrome, includes species (both resprouting and non-resprouting) which share the feature that the timing of seedling establishment is specialized to the first rainy season after fire. Included are woody, suffrutescent and annual life forms but no geophytes have this syndrome. These species are linked by the characteristic that their seeds have a dormancy which is readily broken by environmental stimuli such as intense heat shock or chemicals leached from charred wood. Such seeds are referred to as “refractory” and dormancy, in some cases, is due to seed coat impermeability (such seeds are commonly called hardseeded), but in other cases the mechanism is unknown. Seeds of some may require cold stratification and/or light in addition to fire related stimuli. In the absence of fire related cues, a portion or all of a species’ seed pool remains dormant. Most have locally dispersed seeds that persist in the soil seed bank until the site burns. Dispersal of propagules is largely during spring and summer which facilitates the avoidance of flowering and fruiting during the summer and fall drought. Within a life form (e.g., shrub, suffrutescent, etc.), the seeds of these species have less mass than those of species with non-refractory seeds and this possibly reflects the environmental favorableness of the postfire environment for seedling establishment. Regardless of when fire occurs, germination is normally delayed until late winter or early spring. In the absence of fire, or other disturbance, opportunities for population expansion are largely lacking for species with this syndrome. The other syndrome, here called the fire-resister or non-refractory seed syndrome, includes species that are resilient to frequent fires (mostly by vegetative resprouting), but require fire-free periods for recruiting new seedlings. Included are shrubs, subshrubs, suffrutescents, lianas, geophytes and annuals. All are linked by the characteristic that their seeds germinate in the absence of cues related to wildfires. In many cases no form of seed dormancy is present and the seeds germinate soon after dispersal; consequently these species do not accumulate a persistent seed bank. Germination and seedling establishment is independent of fire and thus opportunities for population expansion are also independent of fire. The demographic pattern of seedling recruitment varies with the life form. For shrubs, seedling recruitment may be restricted to sites free of fire for periods of a hundred years or more. Recruitment appears to require relatively mesic conditions and this may account for the patchy distribution of these species within the matrix of relatively arid sites. Finding such sites has selected for propagules specialized for wind or animal dispersal; the majority are bird dispersed. These shrub species all disperse fruits in fall and winter and this may have been selected to take advantage of migratory birds as well as to time dispersal to the winter rains typical of the mediterranean-climate. Germination typically occurs within several weeks of the first fall or winter rains. Maturation of flowers and fruits during the summer and fall drought may account for the distribution of these species on more mesic sites.

Only at refuges has wildlife conservation been legislated to have higher priority than either recreational or commercial activities. Presently, private ranchers and farmers graze cattle on 981,954 ha and harvest hay on 12,021 ha at 123 National Wildlife Refuges. US Fish and Wildlife Service policy is to permit these uses primarily when needed to benefit refuge wildlife. To evaluate the success of this policy, I surveyed grassland management practices at the 123 refuges. The survey results indicate that in fiscal year 1980 there were 374,849 animal unit months (AUMs) of cattle grazing, or 41% more than was reported by the Fish and Wildlife Service. According to managers' opinions, 86 species of wildlife are positively affected and 82 are negatively affected by refuge cattle grazing or haying. However, quantitative field studies of the effect of cattle grazing and haying on wildlife coupled with the survey data on how refuge programs are implemented suggest that these activities are impeding the goal of wildlife conservation. Particular management problems uncovered by the survey include overgrazing of riparian habitats, wildlife mortality due to collisions with cattle fences, and mowing of migratory bird habitat during the breeding season. Managers reported that they spend $919,740 administering cattle grazing and haying; thus refuge grazing and haying programs are also expensive. At any single refuge these uses occupy up to 50% of refuge funds and 55% of staff time. In light of these results, prescribed burning may be a better wildlife management option than is either cattle grazing or haying. © 1987 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","federal; Grazing; Haying; Livestock; Rangeland; Refuges; Wildlife conservation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842301129

Some are associated with darkened mammoth and bird fossils, and these fossils have been considered as having been burned by early man. Reevaluation of these so-called ""fire areas"" indicates that the above phenomena are the result of low-temperature (≤100°C), nonheating processes occurring in groundwater. Evidence for this conclusion is derived from field observations on fossil carbonized vegetation, and the geology of the areas. Additional evidence derives from experiments on the red sediments and fossil wood, X-ray diffraction analyses, magnetic analyses, studies on the clay minerals smectite and illite, and the demonstration that fossil mammoth bone contains sufficient Fe and Mn to account for their discoloration. Much of the carbonization of vegetation probably occurred in water rather than in fire. Radiocarbon dates from the islands will probably need to be reevaluated.

Rates of seed removal by ants usually are measured by recording removal from artificial seed baits, but the reliability of this approach has not been tested, nor have there been many attempts to integrate the results with the activity of seed‐eating ants. This paper describes the rates of seed removal, estimated using a baiting technique that is tested for its reliability, by the seed‐eating ants in adjacent heath and woodland sites at Wilson's Promontory, Victoria. Ants removed up to 100% of seeds, but rates varied according to seed species, size of seed clumps, season, time of exposure, and other aspects of the baiting technique. Methodological guidelines are provided to make baiting conditions approximately those likely to occur in nature. Seed‐eating ants, particularly species of Rhytidoponera, Chelaner and Pheidole, were by far the most important post‐dispersal seed predators, and patterns of seed removal were directly related to their composition, abundance and foraging behaviour. Lygaeid bugs were also observed eating seeds, but there was no evidence of seed predation by rodents or birds. The results suggest that seed predation by ants can substantially deplete seed reserves: however, its actual effect on seedling recruitment is likely to depend on many factors including seed size, crop size, weather, timing and location of seed fall, availability of alternative food sources, patterns of seedling mortality, and fire, none of which have been adequately investigated.

Median lethal doses (LD50S) range from 0- 63 mg kg-1 for red-browed firetails, Emblema temporalis, to approxi­mately 278 mg kg-1 for the emu, Dromaius novaehollandiae. Significant differences occur between the sensitivity of different groups of birds and may be related to differences in their metabolic rates. A few species may also have developed a tolerance to 1080 from being exposed to indigenous plants that contain fluoroacetate, or to insects and other animals which have fed on such plants. The most common signs of 1080 poisoning among birds are depression, fluffed feathers, a reluctance to move, and convulsions. Signs of poisoning first appeared among the species tested at 1-60 h after dosing, and deaths follow between 1 h to almost 11 days after dosing. The susceptibility of 48 species of birds in Australia to 1080 poisoning is discussed in relation to typical baits and poison concentrations used against vertebrate pests. Theoretically, fewer types of birds are likely to be at risk from dingo-poisoning than pig-poisoning campaigns that also use meat baits but higher oncentrations of 1080. Individuals of 39 out of the 48 species could be at risk from rabbit and other pig-poisoning campaigns. The impact on bird populations will depend, among other factors, on the amount of bait individuals eat and on the poisoning methods employed. © 1984 CSIRO.

A highly significant inverse relationship existed between the nightly incidences of hares and medium‐sized predators but no such relationship was observed with large predators. The incidences of large predators apparently were unaffected by the habitat modification by fire, although two species disappeared in the post‐burn conditions.

This physical, exogenous dormancy is especially common in species of the Fabaceae. The ecological significance of hard seed includes the ability to rapidly recolonize burnt areas after fire and to withstand ingestion by animals and birds. Advantages and problems that hard seed cause in agriculture are discussed. Species from different families with impermeable seeds appear to have in common a layer of macrosclerid cells that form a palisade layer in the testa. The term strophiole and its contradictory use in botanical literature are discussed. Genetic factors and environmental conditions both affect the proportion of impermeable seeds produced. Methods of artificially softening impermeable seeds include acid and solvent, soaking, mechanical scarification, pressure, percussion, freezing, heating, and radiation treatments that can result in a change in germination from less than 20% in some untreated species up to 90% or more in treated species. Natural softening involves high temperatures and temperature fluctuations and the degree of desiccation of the seed. The mechanism of water impermeability is related to the testa and is thought to involve waterproofing substances including wax, lignin, tannin, suberin, pectin, and quinone derivatives. The hilum acts as a hygroscopic valve that prevents water uptake but allows water loss to occur at low relative humidities in some species. The strophiole is an area of weakness in the testa of some Papilionoideae while the chalaza region has been determined as an area of weakness in Pisum and Gossypium. The water impermeable status of some species is reversible at a seed moisture content greater than 10%. The hard seed of a species can be described both in terms of the amount and the degree of impermeability. © 1978, The New York Botanical Garden.

Minnesota, St. Paul, Minn. 55101, United States","Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) attracted little general concern until a series of incidents drew attention to their wide distribution and potential hazard. The most serious such incident was a case of large scale contamination of cooking oil in Japan in 1968, which affected more than 1000 persons, many of whom suffered severe and persistent skin lesions. The same accident led to contamination of chicken feed, causing large scale mortality of chickens, and a parallel case affecting chickens occurred in the United States in 1971. A report of large scale mortality of fish eating birds in Great Britain in 1969 was accompanied and followed by the discovery of toxicologically significant levels of PCBs in fish used for human consumption in many different countries. These incidents have led to a rapid increase in the number of studies on the distribution and effects of PCBs. Figures on U.S. production statistics and quantitative patterns of use released recently by Monsanto show a peaking of sales in 1970 at 33 x 106 kg. The major uses, in order of importance, prior to 1970 were for capacitors, plasticizer applications including use in carbonless duplicating paper, transformer fluids, hydraulic fluids and lubricants, and heat transfer fluids. Sales, subsequently restricted by Monsanto to mainly electrical applications, have fallen to 15 x 106 kg in 1971 and are projected at 13 x 106 kg in 1972. The cumulative sales in the U.S. since the introduction of the PCBs are estimated to be 5 x 105 tons. As in the case of most industrial chemicals, loss figures for PCBs are practically nonexistent. Rough estimates of losses to the environment, based on the nature of application and physical properties of the PCBs, suggest that approximately 20% of the cumulative PCB production is still in service in transformers, heat exchangers, and capacitors, 5% has been discharged into the atmosphere by vaporization of plasticizers and in burning dumps, 10 to 15% has been discharged into fresh or coastal waters by disposal of hydraulic fluid and lubricant plus small amounts of heat transfer and transformer oils, and 55% has been disposed of in dumps and incinerators. Of the latter it is estimated that 10 to 20% was destroyed by burning. As yet little is known of the distribution of PCBs in terrestrial environments. Toxicological studies of PCBs are complicated by the fact that they consist of mixtures of many isomers with potentially different toxicities. Studies have been further complicated by the recent discovery that two batches of commercial PCBs (manufactured in France and Germany) contained highly toxic contaminants, almost certainly chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDBFs). CDBFs have not been identified in environmental samples, but they might be toxicologically significant at levels too low (subnanogram) for detection by existing techniques. There are indications that different batches of PCBs vary in toxicity to chickens, and it is conceivable that CDBFs may be produced from PCBs in the environment. This problem should have high priority for future testing. PCBs are moderately toxic to fish, and are toxic to some aquatic invertebrates at levels as low as 1 part per billion (ppb) in ambient water. They inhibit growth and photosynthesis of phytoplankton at levels of 10 to 100 ppb. They are comparatively nontoxic to terrestrial insects, but act synergistically to increase the toxicity of several pesticides to insects. In the 'Yusho' incident, involving mass human poisoning in Japan, PCBs appear to have caused severe symptons at levels of the order of 200 μg/kg/day, lower than the lowest levels at which adverse effects have been reported in experimental mammals. However the symptoms, including chloracne and eye discharge suggest that CDBFs may have been a major causative agent. PCB levels in some of the more contaminated exosystems exceed those required to cause adverse effects on reproduction and survival of representative animal species in the laboratory. Adverse effects on wild populations of crustaceans, fish and birds appear likely, but are difficult to demonstrate in the presence of other pollutants.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015470375

Das Eigelege besitzt einen besonderen Schutzmantel, dem für die Abwehr letaler Sonnen‐Einstrahlung und gegen Austrocknung Bedeutung zukommt. Das Gesamt‐Verbreitungsgebiet wird an Hand von Literatur‐Angaben kartenmäßig dargestellt. Dazu gehört in der Hauptsache Mitteleuropa und Rußland. Massenvermehrungen sind im gesamten Verbreitungsgebiet bei entsprechender Disposition der Brutpflanze möglich. Ist diese durch natürliche Einwirkungen oder künstliche Eingriffe geschaffen, so tritt Agrilus viridis L. besonders nach Trocken‐ und Wärmeperioden unter Umständen in Massen und dann schädlich auf. Eine natürliche Begrenzung des Massenwechsels findet durch relativ hohe Durchschnitts‐Niederschläge statt. In Höhenlagen über 800–900 m ü.d.M., die für Bayern gewöhnlich über 900 mm Jahresniederschläge aufweisen, kann Viridis noch auftreten, ohne jedoch hier zu Massenvermehrungen gelangen zu können. Der bayerische Teil des Verbreitungsgebietes und seine Massen‐wechselgebiete werden an Hand von Klimatogrammen nach Klima und Witterung (Temperatur und Niederschlag) wie auch nach Standort‐Verhältnissen gekennzeichnet. Die anomale Witterung der letzten Jahre wird ‐ in Verbindung mit Bodenbeschaffenheit, Lage und teilweise auch menschlicher Einwirkung ‐ als entscheidende Ursache für die Disposition der Wirtspflanzen von Agrilus viridis L. erkannt und als Auslöser der letzten Gradationen verantwortlich gemacht. Die physiologische Trockenheit über durchlässigen Böden in an sich regenreichen Gebieten begünstigt auf dem Wege über den Brutbaum das Massenauftreten von Viridis. Die nach dem Schrifttum und eigenen Erfahrungen in Betracht kommenden Brutpflanzen sind zusammengestellt. Haupt‐Brutbaum ist die Rotbuche, deren ökologische Ansprüche kurz beschrieben werden. Das Bestehen einiger Rassen von Arilus viridis L., die auf verschiedenen Brutpflanzen leben, ist wahrscheinlich. Die an Rotbuche lebende „Form” ließ sich nicht auf andere Pflanzenarten übertragen. Der Einfluß der Temperaturen auf die Ei‐, „Vorpuppen”‐ und Puppen‐Entwicklung wurde im Freiland unter den natürlichen Verhältnissen und in Thermostatenzuchten verfolgt. Die zusammengestellten Entwicklungszeiten wurden nach der Blunckschen Temperatursummen‐Regel ausgewertet. Für das Freiland, mit den wechselnden Temperaturen, ‐ ergab sich für die „Vorpuppe” ein unterer Temperatur‐Schwellenwert der Entwicklung von + 7,8° C, ‐ für konstante Temperaturen in Thermostatenzuchten lag er bei + 14° C. Es wird nachzuweisen versucht, daß die wechselnden Freiland‐Temperaturen einen entwicklungsbeschleunigenden Einfluß ausüben. Die Larven werden nach Form und Verhalten dargestellt. Die Anlage der Puppenwiege durch sie wird beschrieben. Die Phänologie des Käfers und seiner Entwicklungsstufen wurde durch eingehende Freiland‐Beobachtungen geklärt. Hauptflugzeit ist Juli–August. Die Reifezeit des Käfers vom Schlüpfen bis zur Ei‐Ablage währte im Freiland durchschnittlich 14 Tage. Lebensablauf und Verhalten der Käfer werden analysiert und die Disposition der Brutpflanze für die Ei‐Ablage erörtert. Vom Käfer wird normalerweise ‐ wie experimentell nachgewiesen werden konnte ‐ nur „krankes”, das heißt: in seinem Wasserhaushalt bzw. Stoffwechsel gestörtes Rindengewebe zur Eiablage benutzt. Für die Gesamtentwicklung unter Freiland‐Bedingungen ergab sich in der Mehrzahl der überprüften Fälle ein einjähriger Generations‐Zyklus. Die Phänologie aller Entwicklungsstufen ‐ nebst Messungen über Larvenwachstum und Fraßganglängen im Ablauf einer Generation ‐ wird unter Berücksichtigung der wirkenden Freiland‐Temperaturen dargestellt. Zwischen den Agrilus‐Larven und ihrem Wirt besteht ein scharfer Existenzkampf. Massenbefall ist für schwache Pflanzen tötlich. Kräftige Pflanzen wehren ihn durch Saftfluß und Wundkallus‐Bildung erfolgreich ab. Für Altbuchen ist diese Abwehr unter normalen Witterungsverhältnissen fast stets erfolgreich. Bei ihnen können bis zu 100% der sich einbohrenden Viridis‐Larven abgetötet werden. Lediglich in sonnenbrandigen Rindenpartien bleibt der Baum bruttauglich und kann hier den Käfer‐Befall nicht verhindern. Die Larven können sich bis zu einem gewissen Grade durch die Anlage von Baumsaft‐Abflußkanälen („Nischenfraß”), „Zick‐Zack”‐ und Spiral‐(Riegel)‐Fraßgängen vor der Abwehrreaktion der Wirtspflanze schützen. Die optimalen Feuchtegehalte des Substrates wurden für die verschiedenen Entwicklungsstufen ermittelt. Unter den weiteren die Vermehrung von Agrilus viridis L. begrenzenden biotischen Faktoren spielen: Raub‐Insekten, Vögel, Schnecken und einige Ento‐Parasiten eine gewisse Rolle ‐ ohne jedoch den Gang des Massenwechsels von Viridis entscheidend beeinflussen zu können. Es wurden zwei neue Wespenarten (Chalcididae) als Ento‐Parasiten festgestellt. Im Klein‐Klima der Buchenrinde ‐ das als maßgebender Faktor bei der Viridis‐Entwicklung für einen vollen Jahreszyklus ermittelt wurde ‐ kommt die entwicklungsfördernde Bedeutung der Süd‐Lagen deutlich zum Ausdruck. Auf Grund über einjähriger Freiland‐Beobachtungen und Auszählungen wird die Gesamt‐Mortalität von Eiern, Larven und Puppen sowie der Käfer von Agrilus viridis L. dargestellt. Zur Prognose: Für den Massenwechsel von Viridis in den bayerischen Untersuchungsgebieten ergab die Zeit ab Herbst 1952 ‐ mit dem plötzlichen Einsetzen übernormaler Niederschläge (nach lang‐anhaltender Trockenheit), durch die die Abwehrkräfte der Brutpflanzen wieder erheblich zunahmen ‐ eine deutlich rückläufige Bewegung der Viridis‐Population. Zur Bekämpfung: Bei den durchgeführten Versuchen mit chemischen Pflanzenschutzmitteln hat sich ein Phosphorsäure‐Ester‐Präparat (der Bayer‐Werke) als wirksames Innertherapeutikum erwiesen. Die Abwehr der Ei‐Ablage bzw. des Einbohrens der Junglarven durch vorbeugende Rinden‐Begiftung mit DDT‐Brühen blieb erfolglos. Das für die Praxis der Viridis‐Bekämpfung in befallenen Heisterpflanzungen geeignetste (und auch wirtschaftlichste) Verfahren bleibt das schon im älteren Schrifttum erwähnte „Auf‐Stock‐Setzen” der Jungpflanzen. The characteristics of fresh and healed attacks by Agrilus viridis L. are discussed as regards external appearance and the galleries in the bark, the morphology of the beetle and its developmental stages is also dealt with. The eggs have a special protective case which is important as a defence against lethal solar radiation and against drying out. The whole area of distribution as recorded in the literature is shown on a map. This is mainly central Europe and Russia. Outbreaks are possible over the whole area of distribution if the condition of the host trees is suitable. Whether this condition is produced naturally or artificially, Agrilus viridis occasionally appears in large numbers, particularly after dry and warm periods, and is injurious. A natural limiting of outbreaks occurs with relatively high average rainfall. Viridis can still occur in upland areas over 800–900 m. above sea level which, in Bavaria, generally have an annual rainfall of more than 900 mm. without, however, being able to produce outbreaks. The Bavarian portion of the area of distribution and its outbreak area are defined on the basis of climatograms of temperature and rainfall and also by habitat conditions. The anomalous weather of recent years, together with the nature of the soil, situation and, in part, the effect of humans, is recognized as a decisive reason for the condition of the host trees of A. viridis and held responsible for the last outbreaks. The physiological dryness of permeable soil in intrinsically rainy areas favours outbreaks of virids by way of the host tree. The host trees are listed according to the literature and personal experience. The main host is the red beech, the ecological requirements of which are briefly described. The existence of several races of A. viridis living on different host trees, is probable. The ‘form’ living on red beech cannot be transferred to other trees. The influence of temperature on egg, ‘prepupal’ and pupal stages was followed up under natural conditions outdoors and by controlled temperature rearing. The development times given were evaluated according to Blunck's rule of temperature sums. Outdoors, with variable temperature, a lower temperature threshold value of + 7.8° C was obtained for the ‘prepupa’, with constant temperature in controlled rearing, this was + 14° C. It is attempted to show that the variable outdoor temperature exerts an accelerating effect on development. The form and behaviour of the larvae and the construction of the pupal cell are described. The phenology of the beetle and its developmental stages was found out by thorough outdoor observations. The main flight period is July–August. The maturing time of the adults from emergence to oviposition is, outdoors, on the average, 14 days. The duration of life and behaviour of the adults are analysed and the condition of the host tree for oviposition discussed. Normally, as could be proved experimentally, only ‘ailing’ ‐ i. e. with disturbed water economy or metabolism ‐ bark tissue is used by the beetle for egg laying. Under outdoor conditions, there was a one year generation cycle in the majority of cases studied. The phenology of all developmental stages, in addition to measurements of larval growth and the length of the feeding galleries in the course of a generation, is shown with regard to the prevailing outdoor temperatures. There is a rigorous struggle for existence between the Agrilus larvae and their host trees. A severe attack is fatal for weak trees. Strong trees overcome is successfully by sap flow and wound callus formation. With old beeches, this defence is nearly always successful under normal weather conditions. Up to 100% of the viridis larvae boring into them can be killed by these. The tree only remains fit for breeding in portions of bark burned by the sun and it cannot here upset the beetle attack. The larvae can, to a certain extent, protect themselves from the defensive reaction of the host tree by constructing sap discharge channels (“Nischenfraß”), ‘zig‐zag’ and spiral (annular) feeding galleries. The optimum moisture content of the substrate for the various developmental stages were ascertained. Among the biotic factors which restrict the increase of A. viridis, predatory insects, birds, snails and some endoparasites play a certain part without, however, being able to decisively influence the progress of outbreaks. Two new species of Hymenoptera (Chalcididae) were established as endoparasites. In the micro‐climate of beech bark, which was found to be the decisive factor in viridis development for a complete yearly cycle, the development‐favouring significance of the south position is of great importance. On the basis of one year outdoor observations and counting, the total mortality of eggs, larvae and pupae, as well as adults, of A. viridis is shown. For prognosis: In the viridis outbreak in the area studied in Bavaria, the period from autumn 1952, with the sudden onset of abnormally high rainfall, after a prolonged drought, because of which the defensive strength of the host trees was considerably increased again, showed a marked decrease in the viridis population. For control: In the tests carried out with chemical plant protection materials, a phosphoric acid ester preparation (from Bayer) proved to be an effective systemic. Protection from egg laying or penetration by young larvae by precautionary bark treatment with DDT was unsuccessful. In practice, the most suitable (and also the most economical) method for viridis control in attacked plantations of young trees is that mentioned in the older literature of ‘stock grafting’ of young trees. 1956 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-4243517593
