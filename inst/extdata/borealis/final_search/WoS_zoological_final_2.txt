Thompson, Frank R., III; Reidy, Jennifer L.; Kendrick, Sarah W.; Fitzgerald, Jane A.				U S Forest Service General Technical Report NRS	102			159-169	2013	2013				English	0	8	We know little about the response of birds to savanna and woodland restoration in the Ozarks or how important such habitats are to birds of conservation concern. Bird species such as red-headed woodpecker, prairie warbler, field sparrow, and blue-winged warbler are species of regional concern, and declines of these species may be due to historical declines in savannas and woodlands. Our objective was to compare abundance of focal bird species between sites managed to restore savanna or woodland conditions and forested sites with no restoration management in the Ozark Highlands of Missouri and Arkansas during the breeding season. We consulted with local resource managers to identify sites they considered good examples of savanna or woodland restoration (managed sites) and also selected nearby stands on similar landforms that had no recent management (non-managed sites) and had succeeded to closed-canopy forest. We conducted 9 to 15 point counts along randomly located transects within these sites in 2007 and 2008. For species with >50 detections, we estimated density using distance sampling surveys, and for species with fewer detections we report the mean number of detections/point as an index of abundance. We conducted 260 surveys at managed sites and 244 at non-managed sites. Blue-winged warbler, eastern towhee, eastern wood-pewee, field sparrow, prairie warbler, and summer tanager were more abundant in managed sites whereas Acadian flycatcher, and worm-eating warbler were more abundant in non-managed sites. Abundance of blue-winged warbler, field sparrow, and prairie warbler decreased with canopy cover while Eastern towhee and summer tanager reached their greatest abundance in intermediate canopy cover. Eastern wood-pewee and prairie warbler were the most abundant breeding birds with 0.22 and 0.15 singing males/ha, respectively. Savannas and woodlands provide habitat for an interesting mix of grassland-shrub and canopy nesting birds that are of high conservation concern.

Blaszkiewicz, Magdalena; Schwerk, Axel				Baltic Journal of Coleopterology	13	1		15-26	2013	2013				English	0	1	Carabid beetles were studied in eight study sites, representing differently treated agricultural and post-agricultural areas and their surrounding habitats. The study aimed to answer the questions (1) to what degree differently treated agricultural and post-agricultural areas differ with respect to stage of succession, species numbers and species composition, and (2) what is the impact of the different measures on the species diversity across a larger area (landscape). Altogether, 933 individuals from 61 species were collected. The study sites differed with respect to the successional stages. Species numbers ranged from 8 to 25 species. High [beta]-diversity values did not always correspond with low Jaccard indices for the respective pairs of study sites. Special attention has to be drawn particularly to species, which are rare in the studied landscape, and to the respective habitats. A correspondence Analysis (CA) indicated that human management impact seems to be of special importance with respect to differentiation of the carabid coenoses. The study indicates that the value of a single site with respect to biological diversity has to be assessed in the context of a larger area, in which it is embedded (landscape). It is necessary to identify those types of landscape elements, which are missing to exploit the full potential of the landscape. In this context not only the individual landscape elements but also the landscape structure is of importance.

Walentowski, H.; Schulze, E.D.; Teodosiu, M.; Bouriaud, O.; von Hessberg, A.; Bussler, H.; Baldauf, L.; Schulze, I.; Waeldchen, J.; Boecker, R.; Herzog, S.; Schulze, W.				Annals of Forest Research	56	1		217-245	2013	2013				English	0	34	Biodiversity and forest management are analyzed for a 500 ha privately owned forest within the Natura 2000 area "ROSCI0122 Muntii Fagaras". Habitat types and indicator species are identified to measure environmental quality. Working towards an integrated approach to conservation, a range of options that will result in sustainable forest management are then considered. For beech forests light heterogeneity emerges as a crucial management target to ensure tree species richness and structural diversity as a basis for saving indicator species such as Morimus funereus, Cucujus cinnaberinus, Bolitophagus reticulatus and Xestobium austriacum. For spruce forests thinning over a broad range of diameters and maintenance of veteran trees would provide habitats for indicator species such as Olisthaerus substriatus. The populations of a number of bird species would be increased by strip-harvesting slopes: species such as Tetrao urogallus, Bonasia bonasia and Ficedula parva prefer forest margins. Steep slopes, and the areas around springs and watercourses, as well as rock faces, should remain unmanaged. Future management should start with a grid-based inventory to create an objective database of forest structure and life. An example is presented for high-elevation spruce forest. The inventory should quantify the variations in diameter, height and volume of trees per unit area. Such data would allow the advanced planning of forest operations. We discuss a wide range of administrative and organizational changes; changes that are needed for the sustainable forest management of the vast close-to-natural forests of the Muntii Fagaras, the maintenance of the Nardus grasslands and the protection of wetland vegetation around springs and streams in this Natura 2000-area.

It is a permanent freshwater lake as well as a natural wetland, a former channel of the River Brahmaputra situated in the Southwest corner of Guwahati City. It is the only major stormwater storage basin for Guwahati City having an area of 4000 ha. Water birds were surveyed eight times between 2009 and 2011 in this wetland from both ground and air. Total aquatic species richness, including phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic fauna, fish and aquatic birds shows a continous decrease along with temperature increase from 92 species in 2009 to 64-76 species in 2010 and 53 species in 2011 in Deepor Beel. Changes in fish species between 2009-2011 were analyzed on the basis of data collection at different points of the wetland and showed 26% decline in species richness.

Kajtoch, Lukasz; Figarski, Tomasz; Pelka, Jakub				Ornis Fennica	90	1		23-40	2013	2013				English	0	33	The White-backed Woodpecker (WbW) and the Three-toed Woodpecker (TtW) are rare woodpecker species that inhabit natural old-growth forests with abundant dead wood in Eurasia. We studied stand-related environmental factors subject to forest management (stand structure, tree-species composition, accessibility by humans) in determining the distribution of these two species in mountainous forests of the Polish Carpathians. Data were collected during 2007-2009 at the Beskid Wyspowy Mountains. WbWs preferred multispecies deciduous over pure beech forests, whereas TtWs were most frequently found in spruce-dominated forests. The thresholds of dead and dying wood for WbW presence in managed forests were approximately 50 m3ha-1 and 35 m3ha-1, respectively, and for TtW were approximately 30 m3 ha-1 and 115 m3ha-1, respectively. These were 5-8 times higher than in randomly-selected control plots with no woodpeckers. In both cases, lower logging intensity on difficult-to-access slopes and higher amount of dead and dying wood correlated with increasing occupancy probability of the woodpeckers. These results help develop classification criteria for the monitoring of woodpecker habitats over the Natura 2000 network and improve the ecological soundness of forest management guidelines.

Peters, Valerie E.; Greenberg, Russell				Biotropica	45	1		102-110	Jan 2013	2013				English	2	58	As the global demand for the reliable provision of virtually all ecosystem services increases, it is imperative to conduct experimental research that tests specific mechanisms or drivers of the ecological processes that link to services, and whether these management actions can affect biodiversity and processes synergistically. Agroforestry systems are ideal for such experiments due to their increased uniformity and the relative ease with which factors can be manipulated and isolated. Manipulating the availability of food resources, we carried out an experimental test of this potential driver on bird diversity measures and the predatory services provided by birds in coffee agroforests. We constructed exclosures over coffee plants to measure arthropod removal intensity by birds comparing coffee agroforests with and without food resource (fruit) enrichment (the driver). Fruit enrichment agroforests had significantly greater bird species density (50%), overall abundance (55%), and abundance of understory insectivore specialists (89%) compared with control agroforests. Although 48 percent more arthropods were aspirated from coffee plants inside exclosures compared to coffee plants outside exclosures, fruit resource enrichment did not influence predatory activity by birds in the agroforests. The results of this study highlight the difficulties associated with managing lands for ecosystem services in complex ecosystems-management actions aimed at increasing numbers of the organisms involved in the interactions of ecological processes is not always equivalent to managing for an increase in the process itself.

Matthew; Lindenmayer, David B.; Knight, Emma; Fischer, Joern; Manning, Adrian D.				Landscape Ecology	28	1		45-56	Jan 2013	2013				English	7	198	The desire to improve urban sustainability is motivating many city planners to adopt growth strategies that increase residential density, leading to substantial changes to urban landscapes. What effect this change will have on biodiversity remains unclear, but it is expected that the role of public greenspace in providing wildlife habitat will become critical. We explored the role of urban "pocket parks" as habitat for birds, and how this role changed with increasing residential density in the surrounding neighbourhood. We found that parks in neighbourhoods with high levels of public greenspace (corresponding to less residential land) supported more bird species and individuals overall, and more woodland-dependent species, insectivores and hollow-nesters. Total greenspace area was more important (included in the best ranked models for all bird responses) than the configuration (number, average size and connectivity) of greenspace patches. The majority of species were common suburban birds, indicating that species we assume are tolerant to urban areas will be negatively affected by increasing residential density. Parks form part of an interconnected network of urban open space. For parks to continue to support a diverse native bird community, the network must be viewed, managed, and maintained in its entirety. We suggest three key management actions to improve the bird diversity values of urban greenspaces in compact cities: (1) Increase urban greenspace cover in residential neighbourhoods. (2) Increase vegetation structure in greenspace. (3) Encourage homeowners to plant trees and shrubs.

The bird's population in Slovenia is localised and small, thus making it very important to be surveyed every year. Using the point count method, we recorded 9-12 breeding pairs in 2011 and 9-10 pairs in 2012 at Ljubljansko barje. Most of them were distributed in the eastern part of the area between the village of Lipe and the river Iscica, whereas only two occupied territories were discovered in 2011 and one in 2012 in the western part of the area. In a ten-year period, the area underwent agricultural intensification, with lowland non-intensive meadows declining by 50%. As a minimal requirement, meadows within the extent of the Curlew's current distribution at Ljubljansko barje should be non-intensively managed (late first cut, no fertilizing or sowing of grass mixtures) and all other human activities prohibited from the beginning of March till the end of June (dog walking and training, ballooning, aircraft modelling). Based on the results of 2011 survey, Ljubljansko barje was designated an IBA for breeding Eurasian Curlews under the IBA criteria A1 and C1.

Esquisse de l'avifaune de la siberie occidentale: une revue bibliographique.	Van Impe, Jacques				Alauda	81	4		269-296	2013	2013				French	0	1	This sketch is based on more than 600 Russian publications and several handbooks. The ornithological knowledge of this vast area, extending from the Artic southwards to steppes and deserts has markedly increased in the last 40 years. Only a few parts especially in the Far North remained unexplored because of remoteness and access difficulty. For several species, it was not easy to identify whether a changing trend was an extension or a contraction of breeding area or if a real change in breeding numbers occurred. Tables I and II show the species (or subspecies) with a clear decreasing or increasing trend over the whole of West Siberia. Among at least 162 species, 105 (65 %) decreased and 57 (35 %) increased. The Anseriformes, Falconiformes and Galliformes constitute 37 % of all decreasing taxa. Local exceptions to the announced trend are mentioned under "remarks" on the Tables. This paper discusses supplementary data from Russian literature on the current status of 16 species (or subspecies): 15 decreased and only one increased. Special attention is focused on the dramatic concern by electrocution in raptors (especially the genus Aquila). The Marbled Duck Marmaronetta angustirostris, the White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala, the western population of Siberian Crane Grus leucogeranus, the Slender-billed Curlew Numenius tenuirostris and the southern subspecies of Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus alboaxillaris are on the verge of extinction. About half of the decreasing or increasing bird taxa in West Siberia showed a similar trend in Europe. According to Siberian sources, the avifauna is fairly influenced by three recent factors: oil and gas extraction, climate warming and dramatic changes in forest habitats owing to fire and fragmentation. Compared to their initial virgin status, taigas in which oil extraction resulted in a new vegetation cover attracted many species. However, oil industry has an overall negative influence on the environment by reducing the richness in species, diversity and biomass. Especially, the gas exploitation on the Yamal Peninsula has negatively impacted several waterfowl species. Further development of oil industry must be regarded as a threat to the survival of several populations. Therefore a doubling of the existing taiga nature sanctuaries is strongly recommended. Most of Russian climatologists are convinced that climate change did not play a major role in the shift towards the north of some avian breeding distributions. In that respect, landscape changes mostly induced by human activities have a much more severe impact. A northward expansion of the breeding area of several species occurs less commonly than it is observed in West Europe. Expansions to other geographical directions than to the north are suggested (Table III). Compared to Scandinavia, there are only a few investigations on the role of fire and fragmentation in the West Siberian taiga. In the present paper, the significance of the remaining undisturbed taiga areas and the importance of secondary forest development in the new increasing of some species are underlined. However, fire and fragmentation have most often an adverse influence on bird communities.

In January 2012 a large fire destroyed a part of Cayumanque Hill, considered a priority site for the conservation of biodiversity in Chile. In order to assess whether the fire produced changes in bird assemblages at this area, we compared the avifauna previous and after the fire. Bird counts were performed using fixed points along an altitudinal gradient in disturbed, moderately disturbed and undisturbed areas by the fire, comparing the avifauna present at the same points pre and post-fire. The specific richness increased after the fire for the three areas evaluated, however this difference was not significant (p> 0.05). Average abundances in altered zone, pre and post-fire, increased significantly post-fire (p= 0.003). In undisturbed and moderately altered areas abundance was similar to that observed in the same areas before the fire (p> 0.05). For all three study areas species diversity decreased before the fire (Altered H'= 0.91, Moderately altered H'= 0.75, No change H'= 0.73) compared to species diversity post-fire (Altered H'= 1.12, Moderately altered H'= 1.05, Unchanged H'= 0.84), although differences were not significant (p>0.05). The fire at the Cayumanque Hill resulted in an increased post-fire bird abundance mostly attributed to the effect of farming and agricultural plantations, where granivorous birds and generalist birds quickly colonized the affected area.

British Columbia Birds	23			16-26	2013	2013				English	0	2	The Okanagan Mountain Provincial Park bird count is held annually the last weekend of May or the first weekend of June when parties of observers record all birds detected. In 2003 the Okanagan Mountain fire burned 99% of the park at varying intensities, providing a unique opportunity to examine long-term changes in bird species abundance affected by fire. Relative abundance was compared from a period of 11 years before the fire (1993-2003) to a period up to eight years after the fire (five counts from 2006-2011). In total 165 species have been tallied in the 16 counts. The average number of species per count was significantly higher after the burn (104.6) than before (96.3). Of 90 species considered common enough for meaningful statistical analyses, 28 increased in relative abundance after the fire, 11 decreased, and there was no significant difference for 51 species. Increases were particularly noted among: woodpeckers including Hairy, Black-backed, American Three-toed and Northern Flicker; some cavity nesters including House Wren, White-breasted Nuthatch, and Mountain and Western Bluebirds; some insectivores including Olive-sided Flycatcher, Say's Phoebe and Western Wood-Pewee; and shrub-occupying birds including Warbling Vireo, Lazuli Bunting, MacGillivray's Warbler, Song Sparrow and Lincoln's Sparrow. Severe declines were noted for forest inhabiting birds including Red-breasted Nuthatch, Golden-crowned Kinglet and Townsend's Warbler. For most species the response to fire determined by other studies was confirmed.

We investigated the usefulness of two Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) habitat models to model avian abundance and species richness on the upper San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona. Although NDVI was positively correlated with our bird metrics, the amount of explained variation was low. We then investigated the addition of vegetation metrics and other remote-sensing metrics to improve our models. Although both vegetation metrics and remotely sensed metrics increased the power of our models, the overall explained variation was still low, suggesting that general avian community structure may be too complex for NDVI models.

Wells, K.; O'Hara, R.B.; Boehm, S.M.; Gockel, S.; Hemp, A.; Renner, S.C.; Pfeiffer, S.; Boehning-Gaese, K.; Kalko, E.K.V.				Animal Conservation	15	6		626-637	Dec 2012	2012				English	2	54	Silvicultural practices lead to changes in forest composition and structure and may impact species diversity from the overall regional species pool to stand-level species occurrence. We explored to what extent fine-scale occupancy patterns in differently managed forest stands are driven by environment and ecological traits in three regions in Germany using a multi-species hierarchical model. We tested for the possible impact of environmental variables and ecological traits on occupancy dynamics in a joint modelling exercise while taking possible variation in coefficient estimates over years and plots into account. Bird species richness differed across regions and years, and trends in species richness across years were different in the three regions. On the species level, forest management affected occupancy of species in all regions, but only 35% of the total assemblage-level variation in occurrence probability was explained by either forest type and successional stage and <?1% by forest edge. On the assemblage level, bird occurrence decreased with body mass in all regions. Species with smaller breeding ranges had lower occurrence probabilities in one region, while later spring arrival decreased occurrence probabilities in the two other regions. Spatial variation in the effect size of trait covariates such as species phylogeny and breeding strata showed that variation in patch occupancy due to fine-scale differences in forest management is, to some extent, predictable from ecological traits. Our results show that environmental factors and ecological traits jointly predict variation in bird occupancy patterns and their response to forest management. Observations at the fine scale of forest stands, at which conservation efforts can be arranged along with forest management practices in heterogeneous environments, have been shown to provide meaningful insights despite the difficulties involved in monitoring mobile organisms such as birds at the plot level.

Salek, Miroslav				Journal of Applied Ecology	49	6		1417-1425	Dec 2012	2012				English	2	87	Remediation of lands devastated by industry includes various forms of restoration, such as technical reclamation and spontaneous succession. These management approaches are debated regarding conservation strategies for postindustrial landscapes. Mining areas consisting of early- to late-developmental stages of both reclaimed and unreclaimed sites offer an opportunity to examine the roles of restoration strategies in a complete successional series for biodiversity and disentangle the contributions of particular biotopes available at postindustrial sites. Using linear models and multivariate analysis, I tested the effects of (a) developmental stages from early successional sites to mature forests, combined with (b) the initiation process at the sites, which was either technical reclamation or spontaneous succession, and (c) vegetation cover on (i) species richness, (ii) rarity and (iii) species composition of bird communities on 60 plots (100 x 100 m) within opencast mining areas in the lignite basin of north-western Czech Republic. Bird communities were consistently more species rich on spontaneously developed sites compared with reclaimed sites throughout all stages of the succession series. Species richness increased with site age due to increasing habitat heterogeneity. The conservation value of bird communities was generally lower on reclaimed sites than on spontaneously developed sites and decreased with site age. The most valuable communities developed on early successional sites and native shrublands, because these were inhabited by specialists that were scarce in the surrounding landscape. By contrast, technically reclaimed sites resulted in impoverished communities, usually with narrow spectra of common species. Synthesis and applications. The results highlight the importance of spontaneously established sites and complete succession series for developing valuable bird communities in postindustrial areas such as opencast mining sites. In particular, early successional sites and shrublands create refuges for early successional specialists disappearing from the common landscape and these should be promoted at the expense of reclaimed sites wherever possible. My results support an effort for systematic implementation of early successional sites into conservation practice.

Seavy, Nathaniel E.; Burnett, Ryan D.; Taille, Paul J.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	36	4		722-728	Dec 2012	2012				English	2	14	Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are well-known to occur at higher densities in recently burned forests than they do in nearby green forests. In the forests of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, there is relatively little information on the types of nest trees that these birds use in recently burned forests. From 2009 to 2011, we studied nest-tree preference by black-backed woodpeckers in 2 burned forests in the northern Sierra Nevada. For each of 31 nest trees and 389 randomly selected trees, we recorded decay class, diameter at breast height, top condition, and species. We also recorded the number of snags with >23 cm diameter at breast height within an 11.3-m radius of each nest tree and randomly selected tree. We evaluated nest-tree preference by comparing the characteristics of nest trees to randomly selected trees. Black-backed woodpeckers preferred dead but not heavily decayed trees and moderate (29-61 cm dbh) diameter trees. There was no evidence that black-backed woodpeckers had strong preferences for trees with broken tops or trees of particular species. Snag density around nest trees was higher than around randomly selected trees. Our results suggest that in conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada, the distribution of black-backed woodpeckers in post-fire environments is influenced more by surrounding snag densities than by particular characteristics of potential nest trees.

Linden, Daniel W.; Roloff, Gary J.; Kroll, Andrew J.				Forest Ecology and Management	284			174-184	Nov 15 2012	2012				English	1	66	Structure retention is a practice used in managed forests to assist the conservation of biological diversity, whereby green trees, dead trees (i.e. snags), and downed wood are retained during timber harvest. This activity is recognized as beneficial. However, there is little scientific support to guide the management prescriptions (e.g. patch sizes, distribution pattern). We quantified the short-term response of birds to structure retention in timber harvest areas located in the Pacific Northwest. We used a hierarchical community model to examine how attributes of retention sites (number of trees and snags, distance to forest edge) were associated with the species richness of birds using the sites. The modeling framework integrated multiple species-specific occupancy models that accounted for imperfect detection to produce estimates of species richness. We sampled a biogeoclimatic gradient by selecting harvest units within four separate regions (two in Washington, one each in Oregon and California) that support different forest types. Observations were conducted at a random selection of retention sites (e.g. patches, individual trees) within harvest units to record bird use during the breeding seasons of 2008 and 2009. Estimated occupancy and detection probabilities differed by species and region. Retained tree count was associated with an increased occupancy probability for all observed species. The community response to tree count was consistent across all study regions and years - species richness estimates increased with tree count and approximated a species-area curve. Snag count and edge distance did not significantly affect occupancy probability for any observed species, and therefore, had no relationship with species richness. These results suggest that the diversity of birds using structure retention in harvest units can be maximized at patches of >10-15 rotation-age trees. Forest managers are encouraged to group green-trees around high-quality snags and other unique wildlife trees where possible, and to vary prescriptions across stands to provide habitat heterogeneity at the landscape scale.

Mulwa, Ronald K.; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin; Schleuning, Matthias				Biotropica	44	6		801-809	Nov 2012	2012				English	1	65	Tropical ecosystems are globally important for bird diversity. In many tropical regions, land-use intensification has caused conversion of natural forests into human-modified habitats, such as secondary forests and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Despite previous research, the distribution of bird communities in these forest-farmland mosaics is not well understood. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of bird diversity and community turnover in a human-modified Kenyan landscape, we recorded bird communities at 20 sites covering the complete habitat gradient from forest (near natural forest, secondary forest) to farmland (subsistence farmland, sugarcane plantation) using point counts and distance sampling. Bird density and species richness were on average higher in farmland than in forest habitats. Within forest and farmland, bird density and species richness increased with vegetation structural diversity, i.e., were higher in near natural than in secondary forest and in subsistence farmland than in sugarcane plantations. Bird communities in forest and farmland habitats were very distinct and very few forest specialists occurred in farmland habitats. Moreover, insectivorous bird species declined in farmland habitats whereas carnivores and herbivores increased. Our study confirms that tropical farmlands can hardly accommodate forest specialist species. Contrary to most previous studies, our findings show that structurally rich tropical farmlands hold a surprisingly rich and distinct bird community that is threatened by conversion of subsistence farmland into sugarcane plantations. We conclude that conservation strategies in the tropics must go beyond rain forest protection and should integrate structurally heterogeneous agroecosystems into conservation plans that aim at maintaining the diverse bird communities of tropical forest-farmland mosaics.

Stranko, Scott A.; Hilderbrand, Robert H.; Palmer, Margaret A.				Restoration Ecology	20	6		747-755	Nov 2012	2012				English	4	142	Urbanization is associated with substantial losses to stream biological diversity throughout the United States' mid-Atlantic. Stream restoration has been used to improve stream conditions and, in part, to ameliorate these losses. However, the relationship between restoration and recovery of biological diversity is unclear. Our objective was to critically examine the efficacy of urban stream restorations with regard to biological diversity. We compared restored urban streams to urban nonrestored, nonurban, and reference (minimally degraded) streams using five measures each of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate diversity. Both multivariate and univariate statistical analyses show biological diversity of restored urban streams to be similar to nonrestored urban streams and lower than nonurban and reference streams. Restored urban sites showed no apparent increase in biological diversity through time, while diversity decreased at two of the reference streams coincident with increased urban development within their catchments. Our results indicate that restoration approaches commonly used regionally as in these urban streams are not leading to recovery of native stream biodiversity. Evidence from several sources indicates a need for dramatic changes in restoration approach, and we argue for a watershed-scale focus including protection of the least impacted streams and adopting other land-based actions within the watershed where possible.

Badenhausser, I.; Gouat, M.; Goarant, A.; Cornulier, T.; Bretagnolle, V.				Environmental Entomology	41	5		1050-1061	Oct 2012	2012				English	0	35	Agricultural intensification in western Europe has caused a dramatic loss of grassland surfaces in farmlands, which have resulted in strong declines in grassland invertebrates, leading to cascade effects at higher trophic levels among consumers of invertebrates. Grasshoppers are important components of grassland invertebrate assemblages in European agricultural ecosystems, particularly as prey for bird species. Understanding how grasshopper populations are distributed in fragmented landscapes with low grassland availability is critical for both studies in biodiversity conservation and insect management. We assessed the range and strength of spatial autocorrelation for two grasshopper taxa (Gomphocerinae subfamily and Calliptamus italicus L.) across an intensive farmland in western France. Data from surveys carried out over 8 yr in 1,715 grassland fields were analyzed using geostatistics. Weak spatial patterns were observed at small spatial scales, suggesting important local effects of management practices on grasshopper densities. Spatial autocorrelation patterns for both grasshopper taxa were only detected at intermediate scales. For Gomphocerinae, the range of spatial autocorrelation varied from 802 to 2,613 m according to the year, depending both on grasshopper density and on grassland surfaces in the study site, whereas spatial patterns for the Italian locust were more variable and not related to grasshopper density or grassland surfaces. Spatial patterns in the distribution of Gomphocerinae supported our hypothesis that habitat availability was a major driver of grasshopper distribution in the landscape, and suggested it was related to density-dependent processes such as dispersal.

Animal Conservation	15	5		499-507	Oct 2012	2012				English	2	70	Predicting the response of faunal communities to fire presents a challenge for land managers worldwide because the post-fire responses of species may vary between locations and fire events. Post-fire recovery can occur via nucleated recovery from in situ surviving populations or by colonization from ex situ populations. Fine-scale spatial patterns in the patchiness of fires and the proximity of burnt sites to source populations may contribute to both the variability in post-fire responses and the processes by which populations recover. We examined the avifauna at recently burnt sites within extensive semi-arid shrublands of south-eastern Australia, including 72 sites < 5 years since fire and 26 sites 10 years since fire. Study sites represented a gradient of increasing distance from unburnt vegetation (i.e. > 27 years since fire) and varied in the presence or absence of small (25900 m2) unburnt patches of vegetation. For sites < 5 years since fire, species richness was higher at sites closer to unburnt vegetation and at sites containing unburnt patches. These patterns were no longer evident at sites of 10 years since fire. The probability of occurrence of three of seven bird species modelled decreased with increasing distance to unburnt vegetation, but this pattern was evident only at sites burnt uniformly. One species was found almost exclusively at patchily burnt sites. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that proximity to unburnt vegetation enhances post-fire occupancy, and that colonization from ex situ populations is an important process for post-fire recovery of avifauna. Additionally, small unburnt patches enhance the rapid recovery of assemblages post-fire. These patterns are important for understanding the dynamics of post-fire population recovery. We recommend that management of fire for ecological purposes should explicitly consider the role that the spatial attributes of fires play in determining the post-fire community.

We have evaluated and compared bird species communities along two long-term chronosequences after fire (0 to >200 years post-fire) in the eastern Quebec boreal forest, which is known for its long fire-return intervals. By characterizing forest habitat in stands of different ages (time since fire), we were able to model species richness and bird community characteristics in three habitat types: mature forests, forest-edge, and open-forests. Although bird species richness did not vary greatly, our results show changes in species composition following successional stages and highlight the need to protect the forest at all stages, especially old-growth, which provides a heterogeneous environment suitable for several species. Keeping a mosaic composed of all-age, fire-disturbed forests should facilitate the conservation of bird diversity in the eastern boreal forest.

We evaluated the impacts of grassland alteration by mowing and fire on the abundance, diversity, and frequency of birds using 1 control and 2 experimental grass plots from 2009 to 2010 on a U.S. Army airfield in Colorado located in short-grass prairie. Density of breeding birds was highest in the mowed plot. Numbers of birds observed in 34 surveys conducted during the non-breeding season in the burned ((x) over bar = 41) and mowed ((x) over bar = 24) plots were greater than in an unmanaged control ((x) over bar = 7) plot. Bird species diversity in the nonbreeding season was greatest in the control plot. Horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) was the most frequently observed bird species and occurred in high numbers on the burned and mowed plots, possibly because of its preference for short vegetation and bare ground. This species is recognized as hazardous to aircraft in part because of its habit of forming large flocks in the nonbreeding season. All 3 study plots were dominated by grasses and forbs, with minimal shrub and cactus cover. Litter cover was greatest on the control plot, while the burned plot had the greatest coverage of bare ground. Results from this study are limited because the small size of the airfield precluded placement of multiple treatment plots. Additional study in larger airfields with multiple treatment plots would be required before management recommendations regarding the use of fire and mowing can be made for airfields in areas with short-grass prairie.

Italian Journal of Zoology (Modena)	79	3		329-336	September 2012	2012				English	0	19	The little bustard Tetrax tetrax (Aves, Gruiformes) is a threatened bird species, which is highly reliant on extensively grazed semi-natural grasslands. It is one of the more rapidly declining species in Europe due to the widespread intensification of agricultural practices and consequent abandonment of agro-pastoral activities. Therefore, understanding its habitat requirements in different seasons is crucial to implement adequate habitat management measures. Previous knowledge of habitat preference of the little bustard in Sardinia, which nowadays supports the only remnant isolated population present in Italy, is only available for the breeding season. We conducted surveys of displaying males in spring and of mixed flocks (of different age and sex classes) in summer and quantified habitat requirements in the two seasons using logistic regression analysis. Overall, we detected 85 displaying males in spring and seven mixed flocks (totalling 77 individuals) in summer within the study area. Interestingly, habitat preference models evidenced contrasting needs between the two different seasons: Males occurrence in spring was higher with greater fallow cover and further from water, whereas in summer flock occurrence was negatively related to fallow cover. This seasonal change in fallow preference is likely due to the effect of grazing livestock on this land-use. Extensive grazing is known to shape adequate habitat structure for displaying males in spring. On the other hand, grazing animals in summer may deplete the already limited food resources (i.e. green plants) available during this dry period of the year and when energy requirement for the little bustard is high due to feather moulting. This may explain the observed avoidance of fallow cover in summer. Conservation efforts in Sardinia should aim at maintaining a mosaic of diverse habitats that may provide complementary resources at any given time of the year that would benefit this and other grassland species of conservation concern.

French	0	1	Sixty-seven areas of fallow land (51 floral, 15 compensatory, 1 wasteland) of various ages and surface areas were studied between 2004 and 2011 in the foothills of the Jura Mountains in the Canton of Vaud. Thirteen species of breeding birds were controlled comprising a total of 553 territories: 8 species belong to the Red List and 12 other species of special interest or on the Environmental Objectives for Agriculture list. The Common Whitethroat Sylvia communis, Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, Stonechat Saxicola torquatus are by far the commonest (79% of the flowering meadows; 62% of the territories)?; the Skylark Alauda arvensis and the Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra are also present in significant numbers (17% of the territories). Flowering meadows attract species associated with open countryside as well those of hedgerows, the number of breeding species varied from 7 to 10. Specific abundance was only calculated for the 8 species present in more than 20 territories: the Melodious Warbler Hippolais polyglotta increased while Red-backed Shrike Lanius collurio decreased while the 6 remaining species showed no significant change and the density remained below 1 territory/ha. The average density of the overall breeding population varied between 1 and 3 territories/ha depending on the year and the sample. The plant mix and the type of vegetation influences the species richness and abundance, a special mention should be made of the Common Teasel Dipsacus fullonum which is associated with the highest densities of 5 of the 8 species. This plant should therefore be prioritised in seed mixtures. To be optimal flowering meadows should be located in the centre of large field systems on dry light soil, poor in nutritive elements and well exposed, and far from shaded forest edges and high wind breaks. Amongst the ecological compensation areas, flowering meadows lands are in a minority, (representing 4,5% of such areas in the Canton of Vaud in 2011) but play an important role by their quality, frequently very high, and their ability to protect such target species as the Common Whitethroat and Corn Bunting while supporting the expansion of the Stonechat. It is recommended that high quality flowering meadows should have their lives extended to at least 8 years and at the same time increasing the percentage of flowering meadows in ecological compensation schemes.

Fiedler, Anna K.; Landis, Douglas A.; Arduser, Michael				Restoration Ecology	20	5		593-602	Sep 2012	2012				English	9	162	Ecological restoration is increasingly used to reverse degradation of rare ecosystems and maintain biological diversity. Pollinator communities are critical to maintenance of plant diversity and, in light of recent pollinator loss, we tested whether removal of invasive glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus L.) from portions of a prairie fen wetland altered plant and pollinator communities. We compared herbaceous plant, bee, and butterfly abundance, diversity, and species composition in buckthorn invaded, buckthorn removal, and uninvaded reference plots. Following restoration, we found striking differences in plant and pollinator abundance and species composition between restored, unrestored, and reference plots. Within 2 years of F. alnus removal, plant species diversity and composition in restored plots were significantly different than invaded plots, but also remained significantly lower than reference plots. In contrast, in the first growing season following restoration, bee and butterfly abundance, diversity, and composition were similar in restored and reference plots and distinct from invaded plots. Our findings indicate that a diverse community of mobile generalist pollinators rapidly re-colonizes restored areas of prairie fen, while the plant community may take longer to fully recover. This work implies that, in areas with intact pollinator metapopulations, restoration efforts will likely prevent further loss of mobile generalist pollinators and maintain pollination services. On the other hand, targeted restoration efforts will likely be required to restore populations of rare plants and specialist pollinators for which local and regional species pools may be lacking.

The study includes the appreciation of the general ecologic condition, determination of the sources and the level of pollution of the environmental components, the vegetation's description and registration of the flora and fauna species. Based on the estimation of the emissions from the local and transboundary sources, evaluation of the air quality, biota and soil it was established the fact that the studied object is characterized, in general, as having a satisfactory ecological condition. Based on the obtained results, there was observed that the forest ecosystem Stanca contains a rich diversity of plants and animals species and serves as favorable habitat for 5 species that were not indicated before for this ecosystem. In order to create favorable living conditions for the rare plants and animals species, there is suggested that the forest ecosystem Stanca should be taken under the state's protection and considered a connecting corridor to the National and International Ecological Network.

Cagod, Beverly M.; Nuneza, Olga M.				AES Bioflux	4	2		85-105	August 30 2012	2012	http://www.aes.bioflux.com.ro/			English	0	6	Oil palm trees have become the most expanding equatorial crops in the world and their product, palm oil, is produced, traded and used more than any other vegetable oil worldwide. The expansion of oil palm cultivation, however, is frequently cited as a major factor causing deforestation that may result in biodiversity losses in tropical countries. In this study, an assessment of the avifauna in oil palm plantations in Agusan del Sur and Compostela Valley, Mindanao, Philippines was done from April 2010 to July 2010. Sampling sites were categorized based on the age/growth of palm trees. Line transect method, mist netting and birdwatching were used to gather data on avifauna. Eighty-eight species were recorded. Species richness, abundance, and number of endemic species were also recorded to be higher in mature plantations than in young plantations. A significant difference was noted in bird abundance found in the different age groups of oil palm plantations in Agusan del Sur. Thirty-one endemic species were recorded, one of which is Mindanao endemic. Three vulnerable species, Gallicolumba criniger (Mindanao bleeding-heart), Alcedo argentata (silvery kingfisher) and Ficedula basilanica (little slaty flycatcher) were recorded both in the young and mature plantations. The Aethopyga primigenius (grey-hooded sunbird), a near threatened species was recorded in mature plantations only. The presence of these vulnerable species in all study sites indicates the need to protect the degraded secondary residual forest and forest patches along the plantation. Key Words: birds, diversity, forest, oil palm, species.

Cross-sectional relationships between management, bird response and vegetation attributes in an Australian agri-environment scheme.		Lindenmayer, David; Wood, Jeff; Montague-Drake, Rebecca; Michael, Damian; Crane, Mason; Okada, Sachiko; MacGregor, Chris; Gibbons, Phil				Biological Conservation	152			62-73	Aug 2012	2012				English	2	49	Do sites managed under an agri-environment scheme support significantly more biodiversity than sites managed in accordance with traditional agricultural practices? This is a key question underpinning agri-environment schemes worldwide, including one that we report on here that has been established in south-eastern Australia. To address this question, we established a large-scale, blocked and replicated cross-sectional study comprising 104 sites in four key "management" classes: (1) Agricultural production sites characterized by traditional set-stocking grazing. (2) Short-term conversion sites in which investments to improve conservation had recently (<2 years ago) been made. (3) Long-term conversion sites where investments to improve conservation values were made >7 years ago. And (4) Traveling stock reserves (TSRs) which have traditionally been subject to limited vegetation clearing and grazing pressure over the past 150 years. Such TSRs are often considered 'benchmarks' of vegetation condition and biodiversity prior to European settlement. We identified significant (P < 0.001) differences between management classes and bird species richness (including the richness of bird species of conservation concern), with a gradient of increasing richness from production sites, short-term conversion sites, long-term conversion sites to TSRs. We also found significant (P < 0.001) differences in the composition of bird assemblages between management classes which followed a broadly similar gradient pattern to that identified for bird species richness. We also identified functional groups of birds associated with different management practices. In particular, small-bodied, non-seed eating and open-nesting bird species were significantly more likely to occur in TSRs than in production sites. We found that differences in bird species richness and assemblage composition could be explained by readily quantifiable relationships with vegetation structure and condition (i.e. native shrub cover, native ground ground cover, native plant species richness, percentage overstory regeneration, and the amount of bare ground). Our findings suggest that management intervention may shift some key characteristics of woodland vegetation typical of agricultural production sites toward those of "benchmark" TSRs and that these alterations in characteristics are, in turn, important for bird biota. Characteristics of particular importance include retention or improvement in the native shrub and sub-shrub layer and overstory regeneration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bakermans, Marja H.; Rodewald, Amanda D.; Vitz, Andrew C.				Journal of Wildlife Management	76	6		1225-1234	Aug 2012	2012				English	5	100	Managing for forest wildlife requires attention not only to quantity but quality of forests within the landscape. We examined the extent to which local structural attributes and landscape context of forest stands explained variation in density and reproductive success of mature forest birds across 12 sites in southeast Ohio, USA, 20042006. Results suggest that several structural characteristics influenced birdhabitat relationships in our study. Densities of 3 songbird species (i.e., ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea), and scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea)) were positively related to canopy openness, which is usually a function of canopy gaps. Habitat attributes described by ground litter, understory density, and canopy height were positively associated with densities of ground (i.e., worm-eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum)), or shrub nesting species (i.e., Kentucky and hooded warblers (Geothlypis formosa and Setophaga citrina), respectively). Furthermore, the number of small trees likely drove the positive relationship between density of wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), a subcanopy nester. After accounting for temporal variability in daily nest survival rates, the odds of nest survival for all species increased 10.5% for every 1% increase in canopy openness and decreased 1.4% for each 5% increase in understory vegetation density. Habitatnest survival relationships were not apparent at the level of the individual species. Our results suggest that structural attributes produced by increasing habitat heterogeneity may be necessary for conservation of forest bird communities. [copyright] 2012 The Wildlife Society.

Animal Conservation	15	4		407-415	Aug 2012	2012				English	0	84	Fire is becoming a common phenomenon in Amazonian forest, modifying the structure and composition of natural assemblages. In particular, fire is known to affect patterns of bird diversity in tropical forests, but we have little understanding of the consequences of this for the functional diversity of bird assemblages. For example, frequent fires could act as an environmental filter selecting species with similar traits and, thus, producing a functional clustering pattern. Here, we used body mass, and dietary and foraging traits to calculate the functional structure of understorey bird assemblages in Amazonian forests analysed 3 years after they had passed under three disturbance levels within the 19971998 El-Nino period: unburned, burned once and burned twice. First, we tested whether observed levels of functional diversity were different among these forests and also from what one would expect by chance. Then, we investigated if habitat structure was able to predict changes in the functional structure of the studied bird assemblages. In general, there was no evidence of fire reducing functional diversity nor selecting species functionally more similar than expected by chance. Therefore, bird functional diversity was not different from random in unburned and burned forests. This provides some evidence in favour of high functional redundancy of bird species in the tropics, but also indicates that neutral theories of biodiversity, where processes such as dispersal and survival are more important than biological traits to community assembly, may apply to the assemblages studied. Also, we showed that bird assemblages from forests disturbed by wildfires have the tendency to be functionally overdispersed whereas assemblages from pristine forests tend to be functionally clustered. Thus, environmental structure, in part driven by forest responses to fire, is more important than simple categorical definitions of burn frequency for explaining trait-based assembly rules of understorey birds in the Amazon forest.

Singh, Ajit; Laura, Jitender Singh				Bulletin of Environment Pharmacology and Life Sciences	1	9		65-68	Aug 2012	2012				English	0	2	Plant and bird diversity composition of Tilyar Lake (28(sic) 52' 52.77'' N and 76(sic) 38' 12.05'' E), Rohtak, Haryana (India) were investigated to ascertain the ecological status of the lake. The study identified 103 plants belonging to 46 families. The plant species composition was dominated by herbs constituting 48 plants, followed by major tree having 29 plants, shrub with 11 plants, Grasses & Sedges with 9 plants, hydrophytes with 5 plants and parasites having only one plant. In relation with diverse plant species, the lake was found to attract 34 bird species belonging to 22 families of native and migratory birds. Twenty nine bird species fall in native bird's category while 5 bird species in migratory bird's category. Spot-billed Duck, Cattle egret, Little egret and Little cormorant were observed dominant throughout the year. Migratory birds White wagtail and Long-billed Pipit visit the lake in winter season in search of feeding grounds and to escape northern winter while Asian Koel, Black-crowned Night Heron and Blue-tailed Bee-eater were found to visit the lake in summer season for breeding purpose. The lake is associated with a tourist resort and zoo thus attracting a large number of visitors throughout the year due to which the bird population is confined to the islands present in the lake providing a limited space and habitat for the birds. The excess anthropogenic disturbances are a threat to the very existence of the bird populations in this wetland.

Reis, Elivania; Lopez-Iborra, German Manuel; Pinheiro, Renato Torres				Landscape and Urban Planning	107	1		31-42	Jul 2012	2012				English	3	108	Urban processes lead to species loss. Palmas is a young city under construction; thus, it provides a rare opportunity to analyze changes in bird richness in a developing city. Eighty city blocks, which were classified into five different categories according to different levels of urbanization, were sampled. Bird counting took place during a dry season and a rainy season in four parallel transects in each block. In these blocks, we estimated 20 variables related to woody vegetation, land cover and type of urban use. The estimated bird species richness for the study area was very high (151 species); nevertheless, species reduction occurred as a function of the urbanization processes. Although representing only 11% of the city surface, the not-urbanized blocks showed the highest species richness, which corresponded to 96.3% of the richness estimated in the city. The average species richness for most trophic groups, families, open-field or forest species and resident or migratory species decreased significantly in urbanized blocks. According to a Hierarchical Partitioning analysis the environmental variables that made the greatest positive contribution to the variation in bird species richness in urbanized blocks were the percentage of block area planned for residential use, the density of native trees and the percentage area covered by unpaved roads, whereas the commercial block density, the density of exotic trees and the percentage of block area built had the greatest negative contribution. Based on our results, policies aimed to maintain Cerrado native species in urbanized blocks would contribute to reduce bird species loss. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Florenzano, Guido Tellini; Campedelli, Tommaso; Cutini, Simonetta; Londi, Guglielmo				Forest@	9			185-197	Jul 2012	2012				English	0	0	In the last decades, socio-economical changes occurred in Italy have deeply affected woodland, particularly coppices. Although most of them, above all in public land, are being converted to high forests, in the last years coppices have been experiencing an increase in their use. The claimed need to reconcile silviculture and biodiversity conservation calls for a better understanding of the effects of coppice management practices on the different components of biodiversity. Using birds as environmental indicators, we studied differences in species composition and diversity of bird communities in coppices and "transitory stands" (ex-coppices recently converted in high stands) in the Alpe della Luna forest (Arezzo), in Tuscan Apennines. Relative frequency of each species and the mean abundance and richness at point level were compared among forest typologies. To test the effects of different management types on bird communities, descriptive models (GLM) have been applied using stand age and the amount of non-forest habitats as predictors. Our results show that 34.4% of the species (57.1% considering only forest species) are affected by the forest management type: 9 species (7 considering only forest species) were more common in transitory stands, while only two (of which one considered forest species) in coppices. Overall, richness is higher in transitory stands, where species of mature forests have been found; on the contrary, coppices did not host any open habitat species, as stated in other studies. Richness in forest species is positively related to stand age for both coppice and transitory stands; the amount of open habitats is positively correlated with number of open-habitat species, but it did not negatively affect richness in forest species that apparently did not suffer for any boundary effect.

Surveys of grassland plant species at field level, parasitoid Hymenoptera at the field and farm scale, and bird populations and habitats at farm scale were carried out on 119 grass-based farms across three regions in the Republic of Ireland. In addition, habitat richness and aquatic macroinvertebrates were quantified at landscape scale. Agricultural intensity on the surveyed farms was quantified by mean farm stocking rate, calculated as livestock units per ha (LU/ha), and generalised linear mixed models used to evaluate relationships between stocking rate and the incidence of chosen bioindicator groups. Field scale bioindicators (plant species richness and parasitoid taxon richness and abundance) were negatively associated with mean farm stocking rate. Over much of its observed range, mean farm stocking rate was positively associated with total bird species richness and abundance, and the species richness and abundance of farmland bird indicator species recorded in the winter season. However, these relationships were quadratic, and above a relatively high upper limit of 2.5-3.5 LU/ha, further increase in farm stocking rate had a negative influence. Results demonstrate that different bioindicators measured at different spatial scales vary in their response to agricultural intensity. The lack of a consistent bioindicator response to farm stocking rate suggests that within predominantly farmed regions, maximising biodiversity requires a careful targeting and monitoring with bioindicator taxa that are informative of influences at relevant operational scales. The insights provided may then be much more informative for the design and implementation of agri-environment measures that maximise biodiversity within farmed landscapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We surveyed restored wetlands in the Aspen Parkland region of Saskatchewan 3-8 years post restoration to evaluate whether avian species richness and assemblages differed between natural and restored wetlands. We recorded the presence or absence of bird species and local habitat metrics including wetland depth, conductivity, upland vegetation height, and the proportions of the basin covered by vegetation zones (as indicated by characteristic plant species). We quantified the landscape setting of each wetland using GIS, determining the proportion of woodland and wetland within a 500-m radius. We used ordination techniques to evaluate patterns of wetland habitat characteristics and bird community composition. Richness and composition for wetland-dependent bird species were comparable for natural and restored wetlands, however, natural wetlands had higher total species richness and a distinctive overall bird assemblage because of the presence of more woodland species. Environmental differences among individual wetlands included wetland depth, shape, proximity to woodland and roads, but were not consistently related to drainage history. We conclude that restoring seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands in the Aspen Parkland creates avian habitat and should continue to play a role in management.	Begley, Allison J.

Laura Josens, Maria; Haydee Escalante, Alicia; Favero, Marco				Ardeola	59	1		93-109	Jun 2012	2012				English	0	1	Los Padres, La Brava and Nahuel Ruca lakes are typical wetlands of the Pampean region. These three shallow lakes share certain limnological features (size, mean depth, littoral macrophytes, among others) and the land usage in their basins (e.g. agriculture, cattle ranching and/or touristic activities). We surveyed the bird community at these three wetlands over three years (May 2006-May 2009), using transects and point counts to characterise their species richness, abundance, community composition and seasonality. We recorded a total of 135 species belonging to 41 families. The Relative Importance Index showed that the neotropic cormorant Phalacrocorax olivaceus, the cattle egret Bubulcus ibis, the white-tufted grebe Rollandia rolland and the white-faced ibis Plegadis chihi are the most representative species. Species richness, species composition and abundance differed between wetlands. Such differences could be attributed to particular factors such as proximity to urban centres or other wetlands, and to the impact of recreational activities. Considering that the Pampean region is currently under strong anthropogenic impacts, the present study contributes to the improvement of management plans that are currently in place or under development.

Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management	3	1		89-97	June 2012	2012	http://www.fwspubs.org/loi/fwma			English	1	46	The Big Woods of eastern Arkansas contain some of the highest densities of woodpeckers recorded within bottomland hardwood forests of the southeastern United States. A better understanding of habitat use patterns by these woodpeckers is a priority for conservationists seeking to maintain these high densities in the Big Woods and the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley as a whole. Hence, we used linear mixed-effects and linear models to estimate the importance of habitat characteristics to woodpecker density in the Big Woods during the breeding seasons of 2006 and 2007 and the winter of 2007. Northern flicker Colaptes auratus density was negatively related to tree density both for moderate (>25 cm diameter at breast height) and larger trees (>61 cm diameter at breast height). Red-headed woodpeckers Melanerpes erythrocephalus also had a negative relationship with density of large (>61 cm diameter at breast height) trees. Bark disfiguration (an index of tree health) was negatively related to red-bellied woodpecker Melanerpes carolinus and yellow-bellied sapsucker Sphyrapicus varius densities. No measured habitat variables explained pileated woodpecker Dryocopus pileatus density. Overall, the high densities of woodpeckers observed in our study suggest that the current forest management of the Big Woods of Arkansas is meeting the nesting, roosting, and foraging requirements for these birds.

Rochlin, Ilia; James-Pirri, Mary-Jane; Adamowicz, Susan C.; Wolfe, Roger J.; Capotosto, Paul; Dempsey, Mary E.; Iwanejko, Thomas; Ninivaggi, Dominick V.				Wetlands Ecology and Management	20	3		219-232	Jun 2012	2012				English	4	49	Salt marsh management often embraces diverse goals, ranging from the restoration of degraded marshes through re-introduction of tidal flow to the control of salt marsh mosquito production by altering marsh surface topography through Open Water Marsh Management (OMWM). However, rarely have these goals been incorporated in one project. Here we present the concept of Integrated Marsh Management (IMM), which combines the best management practices of salt marsh restoration and OMWM. Although IMM offers a comprehensive approach to ecological restoration and mosquito control, research evaluating this concept's practical implementations has been inadequate. A long-term IMM project at Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge located in a highly urbanized watershed on Long Island, New York, USA was designed to fill this knowledge gap. A combination of restoration and OMWM techniques was employed at two treatment marshes, the results monitored before and after alterations, and compared to two adjacent control marshes. The treatment marshes experienced decreased mosquito production, reduced cover of the invasive common reed (Phragmites australis), expansion of native marsh vegetation, increased killifish and estuarine nekton species abundance, as well as increased avian species diversity and waterbird abundance. This demonstration project validated the IMM conceptual approach and may serve as a case study for similar IMM projects in the future.

Evaluation of hunters' spring pair density estimates of the grey partridge Perdix perdix.		Tillmann, Joerg E.; Beyerbach, Martin; Strauss, Egbert				Wildlife Biology	18	2		113-120	Jun 2012	2012				English	2	22	Hunters' estimates of pair densities of the grey partridge Perdix perdix as derived from an annual questionnaire survey ('Game Survey Lower Saxony', WTE) were evaluated by comparison with detailed ground-truthing censuses in 123 randomly chosen hunting districts representing 63,847 ha potential grey partridge habitat. Estimates and evaluation-census-densities were highly significantly correlated. The median of the hunters' estimate errors, disregarding the direction of the relative discrepancy, was 24.2%. Hunters underestimated the density per 100 ha potential habitat by 0.16 breeding pairs on average. The discrepancy increased with higher grey partridge densities and increasing size of the hunting district. The satisfactory agreement between the estimates of the hunters, in most cases local farmers, and the evaluation survey is explained by their comprehensive year-round presence through their hunting, farming but also their leisure activities and their special interest in this charismatic bird combined with its site fidelity. We recommend the consultation of WTE data as a valuable source of basic information on distribution and abundance of grey partridges to identify spatial conservation priorities, to justify conservation initiatives and to adapt management practices.

Santana, Joana; Porto, Miguel; Gordinho, Luis; Reino, Luis; Beja, Pedro				Journal of Applied Ecology	49	3		632-643	Jun 2012	2012				English	0	40	1. Mechanical management of forest fuels is increasingly used in the Euro-Mediterranean region in response to the abandonment of traditional agroforestry and the concurrent increase in fire hazard. Although fuel management may have positive side effects for biodiversity, its long-term impacts remain largely unknown. 2. We used a 70-year post-management chronosequence to investigate the influence of time since fuel management and management frequency on bird assemblages in cork oak Quercus suber forests. 3. Fuel management strongly affected bird species richness, abundances and assemblage composition, with rapid changes often occurring during the first 1020 years, followed in the next decades by a slow convergence to pre-management levels. 4. In winter, overall species richness and abundance, and that of frugivores and shrub foragers, were negatively affected by recent and recurrent management, only recovering in stands unmanaged for >50 years. In spring, insectivore abundance and the richness and abundance of shrub foragers declined immediately following management, increased to a maximum about 20 years later, and declined thereafter. Breeding granivores and ground foragers were the only groups that benefitted from fuel management. There were no overall effects on species of conservation concern, although a few species with unfavourable status benefitted from fuel management. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study confirmed that mechanical fuel management has positive effects on some early-successional bird species of conservation concern, although its effects were limited. These benefits should be compared with the strong negative impacts on key bird species such as wintering frugivores, which play a pivotal role in ecosystems by promoting seed dispersal. To reconcile the positive and negative aspects, fuel management should be used to create heterogeneous mosaics of forest patches encompassing a range of sizes (10100 ha) and successional stages of understorey vegetation, including stands undisturbed for >50 years. This management strategy will likely maintain conditions for a wide range of species with contrasting ecological requirements while also reducing fire hazard.

Rost, Josep; Clavero, Miguel; Brotons, Lluis; Pons, Pere				Journal of Applied Ecology	49	3		644-651	Jun 2012	2012				English	4	59	1. Postfire salvage logging is the most commonly applied forestry practice in burned forests world-wide, mainly for economic reasons. However, it strongly affects bird communities and is generally considered to be detrimental for bird conservation. In Europe, many open-habitat species are currently declining owing to land use changes. Wildfires, which are common disturbances in the Mediterranean Basin, can create suitable habitat for these species but the effect of postfire salvage logging on bird communities is unknown. 2. We surveyed breeding birds in two burned secondary pine forests from the western Mediterranean Basin and analysed the effect of salvage logging and vegetation regeneration as determinants of individual species and community parameters. We used a pseudoexperimental before-after-control-impact approach to study the changes in the bird community during the first three springs after fire. 3. Most bird species were affected by salvage logging (measured by snag density), a relationship that was positive for forest birds and negative for open-habitat species. Species linked to shrub and edge habitats were positively affected by vegetation regrowth. Bird communities in logged areas held more species of conservation concern than those in unlogged areas. Species richness and overall density tended to decrease from the first to the second year after fire and to increase from the second to the third. 4. Salvage logging benefits a number of open-habitat species, although its effect on bird conservation depends strongly on the specific threats that birds face in each region or ecosystem. 5. Synthesis and applications. In the Mediterranean Basin, some postfire salvage logging of pine forests can be compatible with bird conservation. We recommend that managers retain some standing dead trees during logging operations and that logged forest is interspersed with unlogged stands. This will provide suitable habitat for the widest range of species.

MacLeod, Catriona J.; Blackwell, Grant; Benge, Jayson				Journal of Applied Ecology	49	3		652-660	Jun 2012	2012				English	1	65	1. Organic farming is often promoted as a solution for counteracting the adverse impacts of agricultural intensification on biodiversity. However, it is unclear whether the biodiversity benefits derived from organic farming require an adoption of organic farming in its entirety (i.e. a systems-level approach) or whether the benefits derived are because of just a small subset of the associated management practices. 2. Using bird survey data collected from kiwifruit orchards in New Zealand, we assessed whether orchards managed under an organic system support higher bird densities than those under integrated management systems. To determine whether biodiversity gains might also be achieved on non-organic orchards, we tested whether variation among kiwifruit orchards in the amount of (non-crop) woody vegetation cover, density of shelterbelts and toxicity of pesticide applications are better predictors of bird densities than management systems. 3. Composite measures of breeding season densities of all native species and the subset of native insectivores were higher on organic orchards than integrated management orchards. Densities of introduced bird species were comparable among management systems. 4. Pesticide use and habitat composition variables were better predictors of native bird densities than management system, with native bird densities negatively associated with pesticide toxicity ranking and/or positively associated with woody vegetation cover. 5. Synthesis and applications. A complete conversion to an organic system may not be required to improve biodiversity in agroecosystems. Instead, the transfer of specific land management practices known to benefit biodiversity in organic systems has the potential to enhance biodiversity in other more intensively managed systems (e.g. integrated management). This may be a path towards attaining biodiversity benefits at a larger scale, because such changes may be more straightforward than conversion to an organic system.

Grabas, Greg P.; Blukacz-Richards, E. Agnes; Pernanen, Satu				Journal of Great Lakes Research	38	2		243-250	Jun 2012	2012				English	4	60	Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) supports biodiversity in the Great Lakes basin by providing an important source of food and habitat for breeding marsh birds and fish and it is desirable to have indices enabling reporting on the condition of SAV, to complement already available indices for the condition of fish, aquatic macroinvertebrate, and bird communities and water quality. We developed a SAV index of biotic integrity (SAV IBI) with 6 years of quadrat-based vegetation species composition data (2003, 2005-2009) collected across 46 coastal wetlands on the Canadian side of Lake Ontario. We evaluated the suitability of thirteen potential metrics that described species richness, floristic quality, and cover. Metrics with a significant linear or non-linear response to disturbance (as assessed by a water quality index; WQI) were retained for use in the SAV IBI. Retained metrics included turbidity-intolerant species richness, native species richness, coefficient of conservatism, and total cumulative coverage. Lower SAV IBI scores indicated poorer coastal wetland conditions. Coastal wetlands in poor condition were located in more urbanized watersheds (e.g., Durham Region) relative to wetlands in more natural watersheds. Fish and breeding bird community condition showed strong significant relationships with the SAV IBI, suggesting that SAV was an important component of fish and bird biodiversity. Our SAV assessment index and its relationship to faunal diversity can be used to inform conservation decisions.

Matiku, Paul; Ogol, Callistus; Mireri, Caleb				African Journal of Ecology	50	2		184-192	Jun 2012	2012				English	0	13	Bird communities composed of habitat specialists suffer considerable loss of species following disturbance (Ecol. Monogr. 41, 1971, 207233). Participatory forest management (PFM) aims to ensure local ownership and support for forest conservation. This study determined if forest birds and forest quality in places under PFM is significantly higher than areas without PFM in Arabuko-Sokoke forest. Forest quality data were collected in the PFM and no PFM zones in the Mixed forest (MF) and Cynometra Woodland (CW). Plot-based approach was used to collect vegetation data along 1[approximately]km transects at intervals of 1[approximately]km sampling twenty transects and 200 plots in each of the study zones. Birds data were collected using 10-min point-counts along 88, 1[approximately]km long transects placed 1-km apart sampling in 30[approximately]m radius-plots at intervals of 100[approximately]m. Data were collected in 2008 and 2009. The results showed higher measures of forest quality in PFM zones than no PFM zones which showed higher measures of forest disturbance. The results did not show statistical differences in birds diversity indexes between PFM and no PFM zones indicating that the human-induced disturbance has not reached critical ecological thresholds to affect birds species diversity. It can be deduced that PFM investment is leading to improved forest management.

We compare species richness, abundance, and composition of birds in riparian environments with different characteristics in Cai River, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We carried out observations in woodland, grassland, and urban environments, between September 2007 and August 2008. We listed 130 bird species, 29 species unique to woodland environment, and an endangered species: Triclaria malachitacea. Bird abundance differed from woodland (n = 426 individuals) to urban environments (n = 939 individuals) (F2,6 = 7.315; P = 0.025). Species composition and feeding guilds differed significantly in the bird community structures among these three riparian environments. In the grassland and urban environments there were more generalist insectivorous species, while in the woodland environments we find more leaf and trunk insectivorous species and frugivorous species, sensitive to human impacts. Bird species can be biological quality indicators and they contribute to ecosystems performing relevant functions. With the knowledge on bird community structure and their needs, it is possible to implement management practices for restoration of degraded riparian environments.

When natural habitats get replaced by human dominant systems as a result of urbanization, it leads to species extinction and biotic homogenization. In urban areas native tree species harbour more birds than exotic tree species. Granivore species are less affected by urbanization followed by aerial insectivores and ground foraging insectivores. Corvids and raptors are well suited to urban environments but few birds are highly sensitive to urbanization and are slowly disappearing from our environments. Although numerous studies have been carried out to study the community-level responses of bird species to human-induced habitat alterations, lot more research needs to be done. Conservation measures should focus on protecting the habitats of urban birds by incorporating ecological perspective into urban landscape planning. This paper reviews the effect of urbanization on bird species and various factors that govern richness and abundance of bird species in the urban.

In riparian habitats where willow thickets had been lost, bird species richness was more than halved compared to habitats where some patches of thickets were still present. As could be expected species previously suggested to use erect woody vegetation as nesting places and/or foraging habitats were most consistently impacted. However, even some open ground habitat specialists appeared to be negatively impacted, possibly due to loss of spatial spill-over effects of insects from willow thickets. To preserve low-arctic avian biodiversity in a warming climate, management should strive to identify levels of ungulate browsing that strike the balance between shrub-encroached and shrub-denuded arctic tundra.

Dudley, Jonathan G.; Saab, Victoria A.; Hollenbeck, Jeffrey P.				Condor	114	2		348-357	May 2012	2012				English	2	57	We examined foraging-habitat selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in burned forests of southwestern Idaho during 2000 and 2002 (6 and 8 years following wildfire). This woodpecker responds positively to large-scale fire disturbances and may be at risk from logging and post-fire management. With 100 radio-locations of four adult males, we used resource-selection probability functions in logistic form in an information-theoretic framework to model the Black-backed Woodpecker's selection of foraging habitat at fine and coarse spatial scales. Fine-scale data included characteristics of the foraging tree (tree level) and local habitat surrounding foraging trees (plot level, 0.04 ha), whereas coarse-scale data (224-778 ha) included patch characteristics within home ranges. Model selection by Akaike's information criterion identified a multi-scale model containing tree- and plot-level covariates, and their interaction, as the best model to characterize foraging trees. The positive effect of interaction between foraging-tree diameter and plot-level tree density suggested that foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers select both patches with dense trees and larger-diameter trees. Fire severity was not important, possibly because of the time since fire and the birds' habit of foraging on recently dead trees in adjacent unburned forests. Salvage logging that retains large-diameter trees in clumped distributions is most likely to provide long-term foraging habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers in dry coniferous forests of the interior western U.S. Following wildfire, conservation of forest patches containing weakened trees may extend the suitability of habitat for foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers by up to 8 years.

Berton C.; Zahawi, Rakan A.				Biotropica	44	3		350-359	May 2012	2012				English	2	82	An important question for tropical forest restoration is whether degraded lands can be actively managed to attract birds. We censused birds and measured vegetation structure at 27 stations in young (69-yr old) actively and passively restored pasture and old growth forest at Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica. During 481 10-min point counts, we detected a high diversity186 speciesof birds using the restoration area. Surprisingly, species richness and detection frequency did not differ among habitats, and proportional similarity of bird assemblages to old growth forest did not differ between restoration treatments. Bird detection frequency was instead explained by exotic grass cover and understory stem densityvegetation structures that were not strongly impacted by active restoration. The similarity of bird assemblages in actively and passively restored forest may be attributed to differential habitat preferences within and among feeding guilds, low structural contrast between treatments, or the effect of nucleation from actively restored plots into passively restored areas. Rapid recovery of vegetation in this recently restored site is likely due to its proximity to old growth forest and the lack of barriers to effective seed dispersal. Previous restoration studies in highly binary environments (i.e., open pasture vs. tree plantation) have found strong differences in bird abundance and richness. Our data contradict this trend, and suggest that tropical restoration ecologists should carefully consider: (1) when the benefits of active restoration outweigh the cost of implementation; and (2) which avian guilds should be used to measure restoration success given differential responses to habitat structure.

Ellis, Tana M.; Kroll, Andrew J.; Betts, Matthew G.				Canadian Journal of Forest Research	42	5		918-933	May 2012	2012				English	2	24	Recent evidence suggests that population declines of bird species associated with early-successional forest conditions may be associated with reduced quality of breeding habitat. Increasing intensity of forest management on private lands and decreased harvest rates on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest, USA, have resulted in a loss of diverse young forest stands, typically called early seral forest. Previous studies suggest that the amount of early seral broadleaf cover within conifer forests is linked to the composition of foliage-gleaning bird communities. However, information regarding productivity and juvenile use of post-breeding habitat in highly modified plantation habitat is lacking. We examined the relationship between vegetation structure resulting from intensive forest management practices and the abundance of five species of leaf-gleaning, neotropical migrants: orange-crowned warbler (Oreothlypis celata (Say, 1823)), Wilson's warbler (Wilsonia pusilla (A. Wilson, 1811)), MacGillivray's warbler (Oporornis tolmiei (J.K. Townsend, 1839)), Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus (Nuttall, 1840)), and black-headed grosbeak (Pheucticus melanocephalus (Swainson, 1827)). All species, except MacGillivray's warbler, showed positive associations with the amount of early seral hardwood cover as fledglings, breeding adults, or both. However, the relative magnitude of these associations varied, suggesting that other factors may also have influenced avian responses. Abundances of breeding pairs and young are likely to show positive responses to management practices that increase early seral hardwood cover in regenerating stands. If adopted at landscape and regional scales, such practices may positively influence population trends of several declining bird species.

Estuaries and Coasts	35	3		727-742	May 2012	2012				English	2	46	An integrated marsh management (IMM) project in an urbanized watershed on Long Island, New York, USA, aimed to mitigate salt marsh degradation and to reduce mosquito production by an innovative combination of restoration and open marsh water management methods. The grid ditch network at two treatment marshes was replaced with naturalized tidal channels and ponds. Effects of the hydrologic alterations were monitored utilizing a before-after-control-impact approach. The treatment marshes experienced a number of beneficial outcomes including a fourfold reduction in the invasive Phragmites australis and increased native vegetation cover in the most degraded portions of the marsh, increased abundance and diversity of marsh killifish and estuarine nekton species, higher shorebird and waterfowl densities, and increased avian species diversity. The successful implementation of IMM concept led to improved marsh health and diminished mosquito production. Therefore, this study may serve as a template for similar large-scale integrated salt marsh restoration projects.

Nectar-feeding bird communities were censused during peak flowering, before and after fire in the Cape fynbos of South Africa. The abundance and species richness of nectar-feeding birds decreased at all sites. In a controlled experiment, two common bird-pollinated plants, which flower profusely after a fire, were presented in floral arrays in burnt and unburnt vegetation. Birds visited flowers only in the unburnt areas. The results are surprising given the large number of bird-pollinated plants that have fire-stimulated flowering.

MacDonald, Michael A.; Maniakowski, Michal; Cobbold, Gail; Grice, Philip V.; Anderson, Guy Q.A.				Biological Conservation	148	1		134-145	Apr 2012	2012				English	1	63	Two-hectare unsown, tilled fallow plots put in place under agri-environment schemes for stone curlews Burhinus oedicnemus in England were surveyed for other bird species, brown hares Lepus europaetts, carabid beetles, vascular plants, butterflies and bumblebees. The results were compared with those from surveys within the crop in the same field and in neighbouring fields. This was done to test whether agri-environment management targeted at a single species also provided benefits to wider biodiversity. All groups except carabid beetles were more abundant, more likely to be recorded, or more species rich on plots than within the crop. Carabid beetle activity-density and species richness did not differ between the plot and the crop; activity-density of one functional group (predators) was lower on plots than in the crop. Six rare arable plant species were recorded, predominantly from plots, and the plots are considered to perform comparably to other agri-environment options available in England designed specifically for arable plants. One red-listed bird species of conservation concern (skylark Alauda arvensis) was more abundant on plots than in the crop, and three other red-listed species (linnet Carduelis cannabina, yellow-hammer Emberiza citrinella, corn bunting E. calandra) were more likely to be recorded on plots than in the crop. A fifth (lapwing Vanellus vanellus) was almost exclusively recorded from plots, and was more likely to be recorded on plots categorised as in good condition for stone curlews. These results demonstrate that fallow plots that have been put in place for the recovery of stone curlews have considerable value for a range of other farmland biodiversity, although management for stone curlews may be detrimental to some taxa, such as carabid beetles, that are sensitive to the relatively frequent spring tillage that these plots receive.

Magrach, Ainhoa; Larrinaga, Asier R.; Santamaria, Luis				Conservation Biology	26	2		238-247	Apr 2012	2012				English	0	99	The connectivity of remnant patches of habitat may affect the persistence of species in fragmented landscapes. We evaluated the effects of the structural connectivity of forest patches (i.e., distance between patches) and matrix class (land-cover type) on the functional connectivity of 3 bird species (the White-crested Elaenia (Elaenia albiceps), the Green-backed Firecrown Hummingbird (Sephanoides sephaniodes), and the Austral Thrush (Turdus falklandii)). We measured functional connectivity as the rate at which each species crossed from one patch to another. We also evaluated whether greater functional connectivity translated into greater ecological connectivity (dispersal of fruit and pollen) by comparing among forest patches fruit set of a plant pollinated by hummingbirds and abundance of seedlings and adults of 2 plants with bird- and wind-dispersed seeds. Interpatch distance was strongly associated with functional connectivity, but its effect was not independent of matrix class. For one of the bird-dispersed plants, greater functional connectivity for White-crested Elaenias and Austral Thrushes (both frugivores) was associated with higher densities of this plant. The lack of a similar association for the wind-dispersed species suggests this effect is linked to the dispersal vector. The abundance of the hummingbird-pollinated species was not related to the presence of hummingbirds. Interpatch distance and matrix class affect animal movement in fragmented landscapes and may have a cascading effect on the distribution of some animal-dispersed species. On the basis of our results, we believe effort should be invested in optimizing patch configuration and modifying the matrix so as to mitigate the effects of patch isolation in fragmented landscapes.

However, it is quite difficult to quantify these disturbances due to their high frequency, low intensity, and interaction among themselves. In order to quantify and investigate the impact of such disturbances on the habitat of resident and migrant birds, we carried out a study in the dry forest of Rajaji National Park in the Shiwalik landscape. Grazing and firewood collection emerged as the major disturbance in the study area, which decreased linearly from the edge to the interior of the forest. Disturbance altered the structural components of the vegetation; however, we did not find major changes in the vegetation composition. Canopy opening due to lopping disturbance facilitated the growth of Lantana camara in the study area. Ninety percent of the migrant bird community wintering in the study area belonged to the insectivorous guild. Out of 18 migrant specieg observed during the entire study period, 44% belonged to understorey-insectivores guild and 33% to canopy-insectivores. However, in terms of abundance 67% of the migrants pertained to the canopy insectivores guild. Guild composition in resident birds was more varied with a total of 11 guilds, and trunk-bark feeder guild comprised the maximum number of species (20%). Species richness of both migrant and resident birds did not change much with any of the disturbance components. However, densities of resident birds increased with increased lopping and timber extraction in the study area during winter. Resident and migrant birds exhibited similar distribution patterns across different disturbance gradients indicating equivalent sensitivity to disturbances.

Baschuk, Mark S.; Koper, Nicola; Wrubleski, Dale A.; Goldsborough, Gordon				Waterbirds	35	1		44-55	Mar 2012	2012				English	2	110	To evaluate water-level manipulations as a management tool in boreal wetlands, marsh bird and waterfowl habitat use were studied in the Saskatchewan River Delta, Manitoba, Canada, during 2008 and 2009. Call-response and aerial surveys were used to estimate densities of marsh birds and waterfowl, respectively; within six wetland basins undergoing two different water-level treatments. Generalized linear models were used to determine relationships between presence and densities of birds to water depth, vegetation characteristics, and relative forage fish and invertebrate abundances at two spatial scales. American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus) and Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps) densities were positively influenced by water depth and relative fish abundance. American Coots (Fulica americana) and diver waterfowl (Aythya, Bucephala) also responded positively to increased water depth, whereas dabbler waterfowl (Anas, Aix) were negatively influenced by increasing water depth. Densities of Sora (Porzana carolina) and Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) were positively correlated with the relative abundances of invertebrates, but negatively correlated with relative fish abundance. Due to the high avian biodiversity in the region, managers should focus on providing a variety of wetland habitats. Using a combination of partial water-level drawdowns and high water, habitat for numerous avian species can be created simultaneously within wetland complexes.

Ranellucci, Cristina L.; Koper, Nicola; Henderson, Darcy C.				Rangeland Ecology & Management	65	2		109-118	Mar 2012	2012				English	0	78	The majority of native prairie has been lost throughout North America. Much of the remaining prairie is used for livestock grazing, so conservation of prairie species depends on sustainable grazing practices. Our objective was to evaluate the benefits of twice-over rotational grazing, in comparison with continuous season-long grazing and ungrazed "idle" fields, in conserving prairie songbirds. Northern mixed-grass prairie in southwest Manitoba, Canada is near the northern range limits for many endangered grassland birds, and thus is an important area for evaluating the contribution of twice-over grazing in the conservation of songbirds, including species at risk. In 2008 and 2009, we compared the relative abundances and diversity of grassland birds on 22 twice-over rotation, 15 season-long, and 8 ungrazed sites, using multiple 100-m fixed-radius point-count plots per site. Analyses were conducted using generalized linear mixed models. Although one obligate grassland bird, Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), had significantly higher relative abundances on twice-over than season-long sites in 2009, season-long pastures had higher species richness and diversity of obligate grassland birds in both years. Season-long grazing may actually benefit grassland bird communities by creating spatially heterogeneous but temporally stable areas of high and low livestock use within the pasture, thus increasing diversity of microhabitats. We found little evidence that twice-over grazing contributed to the conservation of grassland songbirds in subhumid northern mixed-grass prairies.

Watson, Simon J.; Taylor, Rick S.; Nimmo, Dale G.; Kelly, Luke T.; Haslem, Angie; Clarke, Michael F.; Bennett, Andrew F.				Ecological Applications	22	2		685-696	Mar 2012	2012				English	3	52	Fire is both a widespread natural disturbance that affects the distribution of species and a tool that can be used to manage habitats for species. Knowledge of temporal changes in the occurrence of species after fire is essential for conservation management in fire-prone environments. Two key issues are: whether postfire responses of species are idiosyncratic or if multiple species show a limited number of similar responses; and whether such responses to time since fire can predict the occurrence of species across broad spatial scales. We examined the response of bird species to time since fire in semiarid shrubland in southeastern Australia using data from surveys at 499 sites representing a 100-year chronosequence. We used nonlinear regression to model the probability of occurrence of 30 species with time since. fire in two vegetation types, and compared species' responses with generalized response shapes from the literature. The occurrence of 16 species was significantly influenced by time since fire: they displayed six main responses consistent with generalized response shapes. Of these 16 species, 15 occurred more frequently in mid- or later-successional vegetation (>20 years since fire), and only one species occurred more often in early succession (<5 years since fire). The models had reasonable predictive ability for eight species, some predictive ability for seven species, and were little better than random for one species. Bird species displayed a limited range of responses to time since fire; thus a small set of fire ages should allow the provision of habitat for most species. Postfire successional changes extend for decades and management of the age class distribution of vegetation will need to reflect this timescale. Response curves revealed important seral stages for species and highlighted the importance of mid- to late-successional vegetation (>20 years). Although time since fire clearly influences the distribution of numerous bird species, predictive models of the spatial distribution of species in fire-prone landscapes need to incorporate other factors in addition to time since fire.

Lindell, Catherine A.; Cole, Rebecca J.; Holl, Karen D.; Zahawi, Rakan A.				Bird Conservation International	22	1		94-105	Mar 2012	2012				English	1	35	Tropical land cover change has negatively affected numerous migratory bird populations. Forest restoration can augment migrant wintering habitat. However, almost no information exists about factors that influence migrant use of tropical restoration sites. We sampled migrant birds in young restoration sites in Costa Rica from February 2006 to April 2008 to determine how vegetation height, planting design, season, and landscape forest cover influenced capture rates of four declining species. We also documented total numbers of migratory species and individuals captured in each planting design treatment; each site had a control treatment where seedlings were not planted, an island treatment where seedlings were planted in patches, and a plantation treatment where seedlings were planted to cover the entire area. Sites varied in landscape forest cover within 500 m buffers. Three out of four focal species were captured significantly more often in plantation treatments than island or control treatments. Two of the four species showed seasonal patterns and one species was captured more often in high-vegetation sites. Greater numbers of species and individuals were captured in plantation treatments compared to island and control treatments. The plantation planting design increased migrant use more quickly than the island planting design. When resources are available, we recommend planting plantation-style to rapidly increase the value of restoration sites to a range of species, particularly those that use woody vegetation. When resources are more limited, planting islands may be a cost-effective, although not as ecologically effective, alternative that supports a diversity of migrant species compared to unplanted controls.

Gharehaghaji, Maryam; Shabani, Afshin Alizadeh; Feghhi, Jahangir; Danehkar, Afshin; Kaboli, Mohammad; Ashrafi, Sohrab				Forest Ecology and Management	267			182-189	Mar 1 2012	2012				English	0	30	Tree fall gaps caused by natural disturbances are a major source of heterogeneity in intact forests. Bird species are known as ecological indicators, reflecting landscape level changes. Yet, the role of landscape context in bird species abundance within small gaps is not fully addressed. We examined the difference between avian richness and abundance within tree fall gaps and closed canopy forest areas in Kheyrud forest, located on the east of Noshahr Township, Mazandaran province in Iran as a representation of Hyrcanian forest. Breeding bird census was taken in 20 selected gaps (0.1-0.4 ha) and 250 m from the center of each gap known as controls. Birds were surveyed during breeding season in spring 2010. We also determined whether landscape context affected the abundance, richness and particular species abundance within the gaps. For this, we assessed landscape metrics by the Landscape Context Tool for every gap. Abundance (P = 0.003) and richness (P = 0.014) of birds were significantly higher in the gaps than in closed canopy controls. Gaps were higher in herb cover, coarse woody debris density and volume as well as pit and mound micro topography than controls. Great Tit (Parus major), Coal Tit (Parus ater), Eurasian Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), Common Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) and European Goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) were more abundant in gaps than in controls. Among which, European Goldfinch was the only gap specialist species. Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos) was the only species more abundant in controls than gaps. Mean tree diameter had a significant positive relation with avian richness and abundance in gaps, rather than landscape context rate but forest specialist richness was negatively related to gap size. Abundance of Great Tit was related to landscape context rate. Our study highlights the role of gap quality for breeding birds; therefore improving the quality of gap habitats especially maintaining dead wood should be considered as an important conservation factor. Management practices for providing habitat of gap specialists by taking out the remaining trees and making the gaps larger would increase bird species richness in a landscape scale but the shape and size of the openings should be according to the species requirements. We suggest that maintenance of tree fall gaps as a heterogeneous habitat and dead wood resource is crucial for promoting species richness. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Klassen, Jessica A.; Morrison, Michael L.; Mathewson, Heather A.; Rosenthal, Gil G.; Wilkins, R. Neal				Wildlife Society Bulletin	36	1		54-60	Mar 2012	2012				English	0	7	The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia), listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as endangered in 1990 due primarily to habitat loss and fragmentation, is a Neotropical migrant songbird that breeds exclusively in mature juniper-oak (Juniperus-Quercus) woodlands in central Texas, USA. Previous studies suggested suitable breeding habitat consists of >35% canopy closure (with 50-70% cover optimal), and >= 10% oak composition. However, little is known about this species' habitat relationships at the southwestern edge of its breeding range. Therefore, within this portion of the species' breeding range, we investigated influences of canopy closure and tree species composition on pairing and reproductive success of golden-cheeked warblers during 2009 and 2010. We used remote sensing and ground sampling to acquire variables to describe habitat characteristics, and we estimated pairing for breeding and reproductive success by golden-cheeked warblers. We found successfully breeding pairs in areas with >20% canopy cover, 35% juniper composition, and only 3% oak composition. A logistic model for pairing success retained juniper, oak, and the interaction between these 2 variables, and the model for reproductive success retained juniper, canopy closure, study area, and the interaction between canopy closure and study area. Our results expand our knowledge of habitat conditions that warblers use for breeding, thus expanding the range of habitat management options available for this species during breeding season.

Catterall, Carla P.; Freeman, Amanda N.D.; Kanowski, John; Freebody, Kylie				Biological Conservation	146	1		53-61	Feb 2012	2012				English	1	147	There is vigorous debate about the potential for reforestation to offset losses in biodiversity associated with tropical deforestation, but a scarcity of good data. We quantified developmental trajectories following active restoration (replanting) of deforested pasture land to tropical Australian rainforest, using 20 different bird community indicators within chronosequences of multiple sites. Bird species composition in restored sites (1-24 years old) was intermediate between that of reference sites in pasture and primary rainforest. Total species richness was much less sensitive to land cover change than composition indicators, because of contrasting species-specific response patterns. For example, open-country (grassland/wetland) bird species declined in richness and abundance with increasing site age, while rainforest-dependent species increased. Results from two different landscapes (uplands and lowlands) were remarkably consistent, despite differing bird assemblages. After 10 years, restored sites averaged about half the number of rainforest-dependent bird species typical of rainforest. Mean values at around 20 years overlapped with the "poorest" rainforest reference sites, but projections suggest that >150 years are required to reach mean rainforest levels, and high variability among sites means that many were not on track towards ever achieving a rainforest-like bird community. Regional rainforest endemics were half as likely to occupy older revegetated sites as non-endemic rainforest-dependent species. Between-site variability and slow colonisation by regional endemics strongly constrain the potential of rainforest restoration to offset the biodiversity impacts of tropical deforestation. The results also mean that ongoing monitoring of biodiversity is an essential part of restoration management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Kilgo, John C.; Vukovich, Mark				Journal of Wildlife Management	76	2		328-335	February 2012	2012				English	1	34	Red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) populations have declined in the United States and Canada over the past 40?years. However, few demographic studies have been published on the species and none have addressed adult survival. During 2006[long dash]2007, we estimated survival probabilities of 80 radio-tagged red-headed woodpeckers during the breeding season in mature loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forests in South Carolina. We used known-fate models in Program MARK to estimate survival within and between years and to evaluate the effects of foliar cover (number of available cover patches), snag density treatment (high density vs. low density), and sex and age of woodpeckers. Weekly survival probabilities followed a quadratic time trend, being lowest during mid-summer, which coincided with the late nestling and fledgling period. Avian predation, particularly by Cooper's (Accipiter cooperii) and sharp-shinned hawks (A. striatus), accounted for 85% of all mortalities. Our best-supported model estimated an 18-week breeding season survival probability of 0.72 (95% CI=0.54[long dash]0.85) and indicated that the number of cover patches interacted with sex of woodpeckers to affect survival; females with few available cover patches had a lower probability of survival than either males or females with more cover patches. At the median number of cover patches available (n=6), breeding season survival of females was 0.82 (95% CI=0.54[long dash]0.94) and of males was 0.60 (95% CI=0.42[long dash]0.76). The number of cover patches available to woodpeckers appeared in all 3 of our top models predicting weekly survival, providing further evidence that woodpecker survival was positively associated with availability of cover. Woodpecker survival was not associated with snag density. Our results suggest that protection of =0.7 cover patches per ha during vegetation control activities in mature pine forests will benefit survival of this Partners In Flight Watch List species.

Valentine, Leonie E.; Schwarzkopf, Lin; Johnson, Christopher N.				Austral Ecology	37	1		23-34	February 2012	2012				English	2	39	Fire frequency is a key land management issue, particularly in tropical savannas where fire is widely used and fire recurrence times are often short. We used an extended Before-After-Control-Impact design to examine the impacts of repeated wet-season burning for weed control on bird assemblages in a tropical savanna in north Queensland, Australia. Experimentally replicated fire treatments (unburnt, singularly bunt, twice burnt), in two habitats (riparian and adjacent open woodland), were surveyed over 3 years (1 year before the second burn, 1 year post the second burn, 2 years post the second burn) to examine responses of birds to a rapid recurrence of fire. Following the second burn, species richness and overall bird abundance were lower in the twice-burnt sites than either the unburnt or singularly burnt sites. Feeding group composition varied across year of survey, but within each year, feeding guilds grouped according to fire treatment. In particular, abundance of frugivores and insectivores was lower in twice-burnt sites, probably because of the decline of a native shrub that produces fleshy fruits, Carissa ovata. Although broader climatic variability may ultimately determine overall bird assemblages, our results show that a short fire-return interval will substantially influence bird responses at a local scale. Considering that fire is frequently used as a land management tool, our results emphasize the importance of determining appropriate fire-free intervals.

Mcfarland, T.M.; Van Riper, C., III; Johnson, G.E.				Journal of Arid Environments	77			45-53	Feb 2012	2012				English	0	33	Remote-sensing models have become increasingly popular for identifying, characterizing, monitoring, and predicting avian habitat but have largely focused on single bird species. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been shown to positively correlate with avian abundance and richness and has been successfully applied to southwestern riparian systems which are uniquely composed of narrow bands of vegetation in an otherwise dry landscape. Desert riparian ecosystems are important breeding and stopover sites for many bird species but have been degraded due to altered hydrology and land management practices. Here we investigated the use of NDVI, coupled with vegetation, to model the avian community structure along the San Pedro River, Arizona. We also investigated how vegetation and physical features measured locally compared to those data that can be gathered through remote-sensing. We found that NDVI has statistically significant relationships with both avian abundance and species richness, although is better applied at the individual species level. However, the amount of variation explained by even our best models was quite low, suggesting that NDVI habitat models may not presently be an accurate tool for extensive modeling of avian communities. We suggest additional studies in other watersheds to increase our understanding of these bird/NDVI relationships. [copyright]2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PLoS ONE	7	2		e31520, 1-10	2012	2012	http://ukpmc.ac.uk/journals/1217/			English	0	66	Powerline rights-of-way (ROWs) often provide habitat for early successional bird species that have suffered long-term population declines in eastern North America. To determine how the abundance of shrubland birds varies with habitat within ROW corridors and with land use patterns surrounding corridors, we ran Poisson regression models on data from 93 plots on ROWs and compared regression coefficients. We also determined nest success rates on a 1-km stretch of ROW. Seven species of shrubland birds were common in powerline corridors. However, the nest success rates for prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor) and field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) were <21%, which is too low to compensate for estimated annual mortality. Some shrubland bird species were more abundant on narrower ROWs or at sites with lower vegetation or particular types of vegetation, indicating that vegetation management could be refined to favor species of high conservation priority. Also, several species were more abundant in ROWs traversing unfragmented forest than those near residential areas or farmland, indicating that corridors in heavily forested regions may provide better habitat for these species. In the area where we monitored nests, brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) occurred more frequently close to a residential area. Although ROWs support dense populations of shrubland birds, those in more heavily developed landscapes may constitute sink habitat. ROWs in extensive forests may contribute more to sustaining populations of early successional birds, and thus may be the best targets for habitat management.

D'Astous, Emilie; Villard, Marc-Andre				Ecoscience	19	2		106-112	2012	2012				English	1	17	The brown creeper (Certhia americana) is one of the forest bird species most sensitive to partial harvesting in North America. We examined the detailed response of this species and its food (bark-dwelling invertebrates) during the 3rd and 4th year after experimental selection harvesting (30-40% basal area removal) in northern hardwood forest. Relative to control plots, nest densities in treated plots were ca 50% lower. Because the density of nesting substrates was not significantly lower in treated plots than in controls, we investigated whether foraging substrates could be the limiting factor. Specifically, we tested for a treatment effect on 1) the abundance and species composition of bark invertebrate assemblages; 2) the biomass of bark invertebrates per unit area; and 3) the frequency of food provisioning. As predicted, treatment had a significant negative effect on food provisioning rate, though not on invertebrate biomass, when accounting for year effects. There was also no evidence for a treatment effect on the structure of bark invertebrate assemblages, which was mainly influenced by cumulative degree days. Selection harvesting thus appeared to reduce the amount of food delivered to brown creeper nestlings, unless greater amounts of food were delivered per feeding trip in treated plots. The lower density of foraging substrates in treated plots (77 versus 112 stems.ha-1 in controls) may require that adults perform longer foraging trips. Future studies should determine whether this extra effort has short-or long-term consequences for adults and nestlings.

Kirk, David Anthony; Welsh, Daniel A.; Baker, James A.; Thompson, Ian D.; Csizy, Myriam				Avian Conservation and Ecology	7	1		Unpaginated	2012	2012	http://www.ace-eco.org/vol7/iss1/			English	0	3	We predicted that bird diversity and abundance of some bird species would be higher in old-growth stands than in mature pine stands because of the greater structural diversity in old growth. We also predicted that patch size of stands should be influential. To test these predictions, we modeled counts of 79 bird species from 52 stands in 5 regions in the province of Ontario, Canada in relation to habitat at the local and landscape extents. Neither total species richness nor abundance differed between stand types. No significant difference was found in bird assemblages between stand types using ordination analysis. However, more Neotropical migrants were found in old-growth stands than in mature stands, while the reverse was true for short-distance migrants. Twenty-five species had higher counts in old-growth stands[long dash]three significantly so: Brown Creeper Certhia americana, Northern Parula Setophaga americana, and Scarlet Tanager Piranga olivacea. Supercanopy pine (> 60 cm dbh) was a significant (P < 0.05) positive predictor for Black-throated Green Warbler Setophaga virens, Northern Parula, and total species richness, while medium/large pine (> 40 cm/dbh) was a significant positive predictor for Brown Creeper, Pine Warbler Setophaga pinus, and total species richness. The density of supercanopy and medium/large pine explained a small but significant amount of variation in bird assemblages (1%), after considering age, other tree variables (9%), and landscape metrics. Patch size was significant for Evening Grosbeak Coccothraustes vespertinus and total abundance. According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) thresholds, Brown Creeper required a minimum of 62 stems/ha of medium/large pine. Pileated Woodpecker Dryocopus pileatus and Black-throated Green Warbler required a minimum of 14 and 23 stems/ha of supercanopy pine, respectively. Blackburnian Warbler Setophaga fusca required a minimum stand age of 66 years. Current targets in shelterwood seed cuts for pine appear to be just within range for Brown Creeper[long dash]at least for the first cut, but not for subsequent cuts. We recommend that forest management seek to emulate increased old-growth characteristics in a proportion of managed stands that fall within the range of variation expected under natural variation.

Woinarski, J.C.Z.; Fisher, A.; Armstrong, M.; Brennan, K.; Griffiths, A.D.; Hill, B.; Choy, J. Low; Milne, D.; Stewart, A.; Young, S.; Ward, S.; Winderlich, S.; Ziembicki, M.				Wildlife Research	39	5		397-407	2012	2012				English	0	42	Context. Aprevious study reported major declines for native mammal species from Kakadu National Park, over the period 2001-09. The extent to which this result may be symptomatic of more pervasive biodiversity decline was unknown. Aims. Our primary aim was to describe trends in the abundance of birds in Kakadu over the period 2001-09. We assessed whether any change in bird abundance was related to the arrival of invading cane toads (Rhinella marina), and to fire regimes. Methods. Birds were monitored at 136 1-ha plots in Kakadu, during the period 2001-04 and again in 2007-09. This program complemented sampling of the same plots over the same period for native mammals. Key results. In contrast to the decline reported for native mammals, the richness and total abundance of birds increased over this period, and far more individual bird species increased than decreased. Fire history in the between-sampling period had little influence on trends for individual species. Interpretation of the overall positive trends for bird species in Kakadu over this period should be tempered by recognition that most of the threatened bird species present in Kakadu were unrecorded in this monitoring program, and the two threatened species for which there were sufficient records to assess trends - partridge pigeon (Geophaps smithii) and white-throated grass-wren (Amytornis woodwardi) - both declined significantly. Conclusions. The current decline of the mammal fauna in this region is not reflected in trends for the region's bird fauna. Some of the observed changes (mostly increases) in the abundance of bird species may be due to the arrival of cane toads, and some may be due to local or regional-scale climatic variation or variation in the amount of flowering. The present study provides no assurance about threatened bird species, given that most were inadequately recorded in the study (perhaps because their decline pre-dated the present study). Implications. These contrasting trends between mammals and birds demonstrate the need for biodiversity monitoring programs to be broadly based. The declines of two threatened bird species over this period indicate the need for more management focus for these species.

Copland, Alex S.; Crowe, Olivia; Wilson, Mark W.; O'Halloran, John				Bird Study	59	2		155-165	2012	2012				English	0	21	Capsule Skylarks breeding in Ireland prefer extensive grassland habitats and almost completely avoid tillage habitats. Aims To describe the distribution and habitat use of breeding Skylarks in Ireland, particularly in lowland agricultural habitats, and to use this information to inform conservation measures for this species. Methods Countryside Bird Survey (CBS) and Farmland Bird Project (FBP) data were examined to determine large-scale (national) distribution and habitat selection, in addition to smaller-scale (farm-and field-level) habitat use. The CBS is a national breeding bird monitoring scheme involving 397 1-km squares. The FBP collected detailed bird and habitat data from 122 farms. Results CBS and FBP data both showed significant regional differences in breeding Skylark densities, with the highest relative abundances in the northwest and west. Dry grassland/grass moor habitats supported the highest densities of breeding Skylarks in the CBS, which were significantly higher than in improved grassland or tillage. At the farm-level, Skylark numbers were positively related to wetland habitats but negatively associated with trees in field boundaries, dense ground vegetation and overall density of farm boundaries. At the field-scale, larger fields and unimproved grasslands were preferred. Conclusion Agri-environment measures tailored to region-specific requirements and to the relatively local habitat preferences of target species are required if population declines of species of conservation concern, including Skylarks, are to be reversed.

Di Vittorio, Massimiliano; Sara, Maurizio; Lopez-Lopez, Pascual				Bird Study	59	2		207-217	2012	2012				English	1	13	Capsule For breeding, areas dominated by extensive agricultural and rugged Mediterranean landscapes are preferred; maintenance of habitat heterogeneity and extensive agriculture are key for the conservation of this eagle. Aims To model breeding habitat preferences of Bonelli's Eagles Aquila fasciata in Sicily, where the last viable population still remains in Italy, in order to identify the most important habitats for conservation. Methods Pairs were monitored between 1990 and 2010. A case-control design through GLMs was used at two spatial scales: landscape and home-range. Variables included topographic, climatic, land-use, road and descriptors of habitat heterogeneity. Information-based criteria were used to select the best subset of predictors. Results A total of 22 breeding pairs are still breeding, which represent about the 90% of the Italian population. The best models at both scales showed that Bonelli's Eagles were clearly associated with Mediterranean features, including rugged areas surrounded by extensive arable land, shrubland and herbaceous vegetation. Our results emphasize the negative effects of habitat fragmentation and agricultural intensification on the probability of occurrence of Bonelli's Eagles. Conclusion The distribution of Bonelli's Eagles in Sicily can be described by a relatively small number of topographical and land-use variables. The maintenance of habitat heterogeneity is key for the conservation of this endangered raptor.

En kvantitativ analyse af diversiteten af ynglefugle i potentielle danske nationalparker.	Andersen, Anne-Mette Hoeg; Ottesen, Nina; Ralund, Charlotte Rosenblad				Dansk Ornitologisk Forenings Tidsskrift	106	2		51-64	2012	2012				Danish	0	0	A quantitative analysis of the diversity of breeding birds in potential Danish national parks Denmark has committed itself to the international 2010 target to reduce the current loss of biodiversity and subsequently to the more ambitiously EU target to halt the loss of biodiversity (United Nations Environment Programme 2002, Europaparlamentet og Radet for den Europaeiske Union 2002). Currently, Denmark is in the process of designating larger nature areas as national parks, and seven areas (out of a possible 32 areas; Fig. 1) were initially selected for pilot projects to test the potential for establishing national parks. In 2008 the number of proposed national parks was reduced to five areas (Skov- og Naturstyrelsen 2010). Petersen et al. (2005) evaluated the effectiveness of the a priori network of the seven originally proposed national parks, compared with a network of seven reserves chosen specifically for biodiversity conservation in Denmark through quantitative analysis. The study was based on available data-sets, including all Danish mammals, breeding birds, reptiles, amphibians, a large number of insects (incl. all butterflies), a smaller number of plants (incl. all orchids), and information on habitat types and recreational values. They found that the seven pilot projects were not significantly more effective in representing species than would be expected by chance. It was thus concluded that it was possible to designate more effective networks of national parks. We here present similar analyses focusing on the diversity of Danish breeding birds. We used the actual distribution from 2005 (Grell 1998, Grell et al. 2004, Petersen et al. 2005) of 189 breeding bird species with the main emphasis on 18 endangered species and 29 species listed in Annex 1 of the EU Birds Directive (Radet for de Europaeske Faellesskaber 1979, Wind&Pihl 2004). We selected areas based on complementary species richness to identify the potential national park areas most important for bird diversity. Two types of analysis were carried out: Near-minimum and Near-maximum analyses using the program WORLDMAP (Williams 1999). An overview of the species richness within the 32 larger nature areas in Denmark is shown in Fig. 2. Eight bird species did not appear within these areas (Table 1). Species representation increased with the number of nature areas selected (Figs 3 and 4). The results showed that the diversity of all bird species and EU listed species were well represented in the seven pilot areas, but that this could have been further optimized. Threatened bird species were particularly poorly covered in the pilot area network, but it was possible to select optimized networks that would increase the representation significantly. The original seven pilot areas contained 93% of all species, 64% of threatened species and 86% of EU species, which was not significantly better than the effectiveness achieved by the random selection of seven out of the 32 original candidate areas (Fig. 5). Species that were missed from the original seven pilot areas were mainly endangered insectivore species (Table 5). The efficiency of the maximal covering sets was respectively 96% (for all species), 100% (for threatened species), and 96% (for EU listed species) (Table 2). The ranking of the larger nature areas prioritized in the maximal covering sets are shown in Table 3 and 4. For all categories of species, the pilot area Vadehavet (the Danish Wadden Sea) had the highest rank according to bird diversity. This study did not include analyses of the efficiency of the network of five areas designated in 2008. However, it seems from our results, that a network consisting of these five areas would be highly efficient in covering the bird diversity as it comprises four areas that in connection were highly ranked for birds of all categories (Tables 3 and 4). This needs to be further studied. Our main conclusions are that an appropriate designation of national parks in Denmark can contribute positively to the conservation of bird diversity. The original proposed network of seven pilot areas (and the 2008 proposed network of five pilot areas) contains nature areas that are highly important for Danish breeding birds. However, in order to increase the conservation of, in particular, the endangered bird species it is necessary to supplement the national park network with additional, and also smaller, protected nature areas and especially to retain the network of smaller bird protected areas that already exist. Through this data-driven analyses we aim to provide information to further guide the decision-making process of designating Danish national parks and hopefully, to help identify solutions to fulfil the goals in relation to conservation of birds in Denmark.

Serong, Merrilyn; Lill, Alan				Emu	112	2		117-128	2012	2012				English	4	31	After a successional forest is severely disturbed by wildfire and subsequent salvage logging or by clearfell timber harvesting and slash burning, if conditions are suitable, the forest will regenerate. It then passes through a series of stages of varying floristic composition and structure until further severe disturbance occurs. The characteristics of a forest-bird assemblage vary with both the successional stage of the forest (time period since the most recent severe disturbance event) and the long-term disturbance history of the forest. To determine how the bird assemblage changes during succession in a south-eastern Australian forest type that is fire-sensitive and also subject to regular timber harvesting, we surveyed birds in five age-classes of wet forest (from 2 to >100 years post-disturbance). Bird-assemblage composition altered sequentially; the pattern and rate of change reflected those of the vegetation. Bird abundance and species richness varied little during succession. No species of bird was abundant only in early successional forest. Some species, such as Brown Thornbill (Acanthiza pusilla), Golden Whistler (Pachycephala pectoralis) and Grey Fantail (Rhipidura albiscapa), were common in all successional stages. Other species, such as White-throated Treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaea) and Striated Pardalote (Pardalotus striatus), were consistently abundant in mid-to late successional stages only; this highlighted the importance of older forests for avian biodiversity. Any increase in the frequency of severe disturbance in these forests would tend to favour only those bird species that are already common. This has implications for management programs in forests that are habitat for wildlife, but are also used by humans for timber harvesting and other commercial or recreational purposes.

Brummelhaus, Jaqueline; Weber, Jessica; Petry, Maria Virginia				Neotropical Biology and Conservation	7	1		57-66	January-April 2012	2012				Portuguese	1	6	Riparian zones of watercourses contribute to the conservation of birds, since they are used as ecological corridors for moving between forests by many species. The disturbance of these areas impacts negatively the species diversity of the regions. This study reports on the richness, abundance and feeding guilds of birds in different widths of riparian forest along watercourses, in Ca River Hydrographic Basin, Rio Grande do Sul. Eighteen fixed points of observation were randomized, at least 200 meters apart from each other, classified into three treatments of riparian forest width. Four observations were conducted at each point between January and May in 2009. The richness of bird species did not vary significantly between treatments, but we noticed that the composition varied according to the characteristics of each area, and a total of 97 species were identified. We recorded the presence of Limnoctites rectirostris, which is listed as an endangered species. Abundance, with 785 individuals, varied between treatments, with greater abundance of generalist species, which easily find resources in most environments, such as insectivorous birds, in areas with smaller riparian forest. We note that the fragmentation of riparian forest affects the ability to suit the needs of bioindicator birds because they use these environments for feeding, breeding and resting, and as ecological corridors. Thus, the restoration and preservation of riparian forests with a minimum coverage of 30 meters of the original vegetation are essential for bird species that indicate good environmental quality.

Huang, Shou-Chung; Shih, Shang-Shu; Ho, Yi-Shen; Chen, Chang-Po; Hsieh, Hwey-Lian				Restoration Ecology	20	1		76-84	January 2012	2012				English	5	57	Expansion of the monospecific mangrove, Kandelia obovata, has converted intertidal mudflats and other habitats into mangrove forests, thus reducing estuarine biodiversity in the Danshuei River estuary, northern Taiwan. Dense mangrove vegetation was removed to create a small patchwork of mudflats and a tidal creek in February 2007. Subsequent changes in sediment properties and biodiversity of the macrobenthos and avian communities were examined. The results showed that the creation of different habitats led to changes in sediment properties and biodiversity. The water content and sorting degree of the sediments differed significantly among the restored mudflat, the tidal creek, and the mangrove control site. Silt/clay, organic carbon content, and chlorophyll a concentrations varied seasonally, but not among sites. The abundance of polychaetes in the creek was greater than that in the mudflat or the mangrove (12.5 vs. 5.3 and 2.2 individuals/m2, respectively), suggesting preferential colonization of infaunal polychaetes in habitats with prolonged submersion. Crabs showed seasonal changes in density, with higher densities in summer than in autumn and winter. The species richness of wintering shorebirds on the created mudflat increased dramatically from 2002 to 2007. The transformation of a vegetated area into an open mudflat appeared to benefit shorebirds by providing roosting habitat. Our study demonstrated that controlling the spread of estuarine mangrove forests could increase biodiversity, and could particularly benefit the migratory shorebird community.

Rodrigues, Pedro; da Cunha, Regina Tristao				American Journal of Environmental Sciences	8	1		5-10	2012	2012				English	0	0	Problem statement: The Azores is a archipelago of nine volcanic islands, situated in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean. Oceanic islands are known hotspots of biodiversity and the Azores, although relatively young (0.3-13 MA), conform to this general pattern. The local avifauna amount to 37 birding species, with two endemic species and 11 endemic subspecies. With an estimated population of 240,000 inhabitants, with increasing needs, most of the natural habitats that support bird populations are under a constant pressure. The use of bird distribution and species richness could be used as a suitable tool for management and would also be effective when applied in other archipelagos. Approach: In the course of the Bionatura project, the Atlantis Tierra 2.0 software provided the storage of biological data from all the islands, including the avifauna, in a 500x500 m grid. As an outcome, important items for bird conservation and habitat management were achieved for all the species occurring in the archipelago, including species richness. Results: A detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of the endemic species and sub-species, plus the protected species, is a powerful tool for conservation and management policies in small islands where biodiversity is usually restricted to narrow distributions. Conclusion: The results defined an area of 39, 273 h (16.8% of Azores total area); providing an ideal area for conservation of suitable habitats for bird's species in the Azores.

Rush, Scott; Klaus, Nathan; Keyes, Tim; Petrick, John; Cooper, Robert				Forest Ecology and Management	263			94-100	Jan 1 2012	2012				English	1	44	Fire is frequently applied as a management tool on both public and private lands. However, in some ecosystems there is little information about bird species' responses to these fire programs. In 2004 we measured habitat characteristics and conducted point counts in 12 burned sites and four unburned sites in the Chattahoochee National Forest of northern Georgia. Burns were categorized by severity (low, medium, or high) and time since fire (1-2 or 3-6 years). The basal area of snags, shrub stem density and percent canopy cover were similar among all treatments except high severity. Otherwise, fire severity had limited impacts on measured habitat characteristics. Following fires the densities of early-succession species such as eastern towhee (Pipilo erythropthalmus) and indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) were greatest in areas of higher fire severity. A ground-nesting species (ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla)) was less abundant in burned sites and the density of a shrub nesting species, the hooded warbler (Setophaga citrine) was greatest in areas that received low severity fires. Scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), black-throated green warbler (Setophaga virens), and black-and-white warbler (Mniotilta varia) had similar densities among all burn severities and showed no relationships with time since fire. Low and medium severity fires provided few benefits for most bird species. When conditions allow for their application, severe fires may be considered as a useful and historically appropriate management tool for some high-priority bird species in the southern Appalachian Mountains.

Znaczenie karpackich dolin rzecznych dla ptakow legowych: przyklad zlewni Stradomki i Lososiny.	Kajtoch, Lukasz				Chronmy Przyrode Ojczysta	68	1		3-12	styczen-luty 2012	2012				Polish	0	0	Chronmy Przyrode Ojczysta 68 (1): 3-12,2012 valleys for breeding birds: the example of the So far bird communities of sub-mountain and mountain river's valleys have been only rarely studied, which led to their unsatisfactory protection in Poland. This paper presents selected species of breeding birds, which inhabit two adjacent Carpathian drainage areas of the Stradomka River (sub-mountain) and the Lososina River (mountain). In 2005-2011,35 and 30 breeding bird species were recorded, respectively (10 species from the Bird Directive and 3 species from the Polish Red Data Book). Many species typical of natural riverbeds breed in both drainage areas (common sandpiper, little ringed plover, common tern, sand martin, kingfisher, white-throated dipper, grey and white wagtails) and in riverine forests (woodpeckers). Birds of open lands were less frequent with the exception of wed-backed shrikes, corncrakes and quails, and water birds were present only locally due to the lack of suitable environments. Species diversity was at a similar level in both drainage areas and decreased along with the increasing altitude. The most interesting were goosanders and white-backed woodpeckers, which were present quite frequently in both drainage areas, and rare in the Carpathians: European bee-eaters and bluethroats. The estimated size of the populations of 8 species (common sandpiper, grey-headed and white-backed woodpeckers, goosanders, European bee-eaters, kingfishers, dippers, grey wagtails) in both river basins exceed 1% of the size of their Polish populations. Sub-mountain and mountain river valleys are important refugia for some birds' assemblages typical of natural riverine habitats. The hitherto conservation forms focused on habitats (e.g. Natura 2000 network) but do not guarantee protection of natural diversity in these valleys due to increasing anthropogenic pressure (riverbeds control, deforestation, drainage and building development).

Erforschung Biologischer Ressourcen der Mongolei	12			27-38	2012	2012				English	0	2	Biodiversity is studied at ecosystem, community, and species level around Khonin Nuga, where the University Goettingen supports a research station since 15 years (established 1997 in cooperation with the National University of Mongolia). In that period 39 scientists have been involved and 67 students graduated with theses (7 PhD) about field work at that station. Inventories started at 1998 for several taxa and are now compiled in a book, which will be printed 2012 in Ulaanbaatar. It covers fungi, lichens, plants, several insect groups, spiders, crustaceans, and all vertebrate classes. For all taxa adequate experts proved the species lists. Because of both the high species richness in most taxa and the new threat by logging and frequent anthropogenic fires the area around Khonin Nuga has to be denoted a "hotspot of biodiversity" for Mongolia. The long-term ecological research led to an understanding of the dynamics of the different forest types: the old-growth forest with dominating Pinus sibirica shows a gap-dynamics in regeneration, whereas the Larix sibirica Betula platyphylla forests are driven by frequent fire disturbances. The anthropogenic fires are destructive for the biodiversity in forests. The tree species Betula platyphylla proved as a key resource for many saproxylic organisms and hole-breeding birds. The south-facing slopes are covered naturally by dry-mountain-steppes where trees are beyond their limits. In the river valleys meadows can form stable communities even though the floodplains allow tree growth physiologically. At the community level we studied for more than 10 years the dynamics of small mammal populations. At the southern edge of the taiga there is no pattern of cycles. The dynamics (fluctuation with population crash) is mainly caused by adverse winter conditions, but the dynamics can also shift to intrinsic factors at high population densities and favorable winter weather. At the species level we studied the reproduction strategy of a social corvid, the Azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyana). In years with favorable conditions it breeds without helpers. In years with high nest predation we observed 10% helpers, but in a year with a colony disaster by burning 64% helpers improved significantly the breeding success. The southern boreal forest is an area of special interest for conservation, containing the most diverse assemblages of species within the boreal forest. Intact, contiguous boreal forest will be best able to keep up with rapidly changing climate conditions because of high connectivity, providing diverse habitats for wildlife by its heterogeneity, high potential for regeneration, maintaining the soil system, and moderating local climate.

The study was carried out from May 2006 to June 2007 using point census method. Totally, 82 species were found (41 of them nidificants). The most abundant species were Sturnus vulgaris (48,3%), Passer montanus (12,0%), Carduelis carduelis (5,9%), Alauda arvensis (4,8%) and Hirundo rustica (3,0%). The most frequent were Passer montanus (100%), Pica pica, Carduelis carduelis, Buteo buteo (91,3%), Falco tinnunculus and Fringilla coelebs (78,3%). The higher species diversity was found at points with heterogenous habitats such as small field forest, greenery lines and alleys. The highest number of species was observed in May, the highest number of individual birds in July and August. There were found several bird species with higher conservation importance, such as Falco cherrug, Aquilla heliaca, Circus pygargus and Lanius minor. Occurence of these species is discussed in the paper.

Azhar, Badrul; Lindenmayer, David B.; Wood, Jeff; Fischer, Joern; Manning, Adrian; McElhinny, Chris; Zakaria, Mohamed				Forest Ecology and Management	262	12		2306-2315	Dec 15 2011	2011				English	2	83	The expansion of industrial oil palm cultivation threatens tropical biodiversity globally, especially in developing countries. Driven by plans to generate economic revenue, large-scale plantations are emerging in Southeast Asia, Africa and Brazilian Amazon. However, the ecological impacts of the sector are poorly studied with respect to oil palm management system, and recommended conservation measures are based on limited data. We studied avifauna in oil palm landscapes in Peninsular Malaysia under different management systems (large plantation estates versus smallholdings) and age classes (uniform age versus mixed-age stands). We sampled 41 large plantation estates and 14 smallholdings, as well as 20 sites in an extensively logged peat swamp forest, the type of natural forest prior to conversion to oil palms. Compared with logged peat swamp forest, our results showed that forest conversion to oil palm cultivation may have eliminated 48-60% of bird species. We also found: (i) plantation estates and smallholdings supported similar bird assemblages but the latter supported significantly more species (P = 0.007); and (ii) despite reduced species richness in oil palm landscapes, we found high abundance of some individual bird species in specific types of stands including some forest, migratory, and wetland species. Conversion of natural forest to oil palm landscapes should not occur in the future through clearing of primary or secondary native forests. To complement conventional conservation approaches (e.g. the establishment of protected areas) in palm oil-producing countries, existing plantation estates and smallholdings should be managed in ways to promote improved conservation outcomes, although oil palm landscapes maintained a fraction of the original forest biodiversity. Managing habitat heterogeneity at both a local and a landscape-level is highly recommended in oil palm landscapes to maintain and/or enhance avian biodiversity. [copyright] 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Lapiedra, Oriol; Ponjoan, Anna; Gamero, Anna; Bota, Gerard; Manosa, Santi				Biological Conservation	144	12		2882-2890	December 2011	2011				English	0	30	Cereal pseudo-steppes hold the largest proportion of declining bird species in Europe. Understanding how this process of decline is driven is essential for designing adequate management practices. The little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) is one of such threatened steppe-land bird species, which has suffered recent dramatic range constrictions and population declines. Although low breeding success has been claimed to be the main threat for the viability of future little bustard populations, the surprising lack of studies dealing with ecological requirements of broods hinders the implementation of efficient conservation practices. We studied the ranging behaviour and the reproductive success of a little bustard population by means of female radio-tracking conducted during 2006[long dash]2008 breeding seasons in the Ebro basin (NE Spain). We recorded an average breeding success of 0.27 chicks/hen, which is not enough to sustain a viable population according to the demographic models for the species. Early-laid clutches showed more probabilities to hatch and to fledge. This was associated to two different ranging patterns (i.e. sedentary versus wandering respectively) which depended on the ability of the hen and its chicks to settle in suitable areas harbouring enough arthropods and shelter for chicks. Such resources decrease drastically as the breeding season progresses. Overall, data suggest that agricultural practices associated to agricultural intensification, particularly early harvest, reduce breeding success both directly by nest destruction and indirectly through a decrease on resource availability for broods. Based on our findings on the characteristics and structure of the home range of little bustard broods, we propose the creation of a network of permanent vegetation plots interconnected by high-quality field margins as a management practice to raise the breeding success of little bustards and other ground-nesting birds on cereal farmland.

Caprio, Enrico; Chamberlain, Dan E.; Isaia, Marco; Rolando, Antonio				Biological Conservation	144	12		2958-2967	December 2011	2011				English	5	66	There is a paucity of research on the wider landscape-level effects of ski-piste construction on alpine fauna. In this study, the response of alpine bird communities to the landscape changes induced by the construction of ski-pistes was investigated in the western Italian Alps. The aims were: (i) to test the hypothesis that ski-pistes have a detrimental effect on alpine grassland bird communities at a landscape-scale; and, (ii) to model local probability distributions of bird species according to different scenarios of ski-piste restoration and ski-piste proliferation above the treeline. Species richness and presence/absence data from point counts were analyzed in relation to GIS-derived landscape variables based on a 16 ha hexagon grid. Predictive variables were selected through the LASSO model selection procedure, and logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of occurrence of each species in each hexagon. Grassland species richness, and probability of occurrence of water pipit, wheatear and black redstart, significantly decreased with increasing extent of ski-piste edge. Length of ski-piste edge was in the set of best models considering a large range of habitat and landscape predictors, and are therefore clearly features that exert a strong negative effect on high alpine grassland bird communities. Predictions of species occurrence were made by applying the models to different scenarios of habitat change. These showed predicted detrimental impacts of a relatively small 10% increase in ski-piste extent, but also that grassland restoration on existing ski-pistes could result in significantly increased occurrence rates of alpine grassland species. This study suggests that ski-pistes are perceived by birds as detrimental features of the alpine landscape. To minimize their impact, new, environmentally[long dash]friendly ways of constructing pistes should be developed, which could include habitat restoration and management to obtain a level of grass cover such that edges of ski-pistes are no longer perceived by birds.

Gyuracz, Jozsef; Banhidi, Peter; Csuka, Andras				Biologia (Bratislava)	66	6		1177-1182	Dec 2011	2011				English	1	29	Water level and water surface area fluctuations are important factors determining abundance of bird populations and bird assemblages structure in a wetland habitat. The water level and water surface area of the Marsh Tomord (West Hungary) changed drastically between 1998 and 2008, and the marsh dried out because of scarce rainfall in 2000 and 2001. A habitat restoration in winter 2001 repaired the waterholding capacity of the marsh. We analyzed changes in parameters of bird assemblages in investigated wetland area in relation of environmental factors. We used full redundancy analysis (RDA) on number of caugth migratory birds per year, species richness, diversity and evenness of bird assemblages to examine correlations among water level, water surface area and vegetation core. Species like water rail, common snipe, river warbler, Savi's warbler, great reed warbler, reed warbler, marsh warbler, sedge warbler, reed bunting showed high and positive linear correlations with the water level and water surface area in the postbreeding period. Some wetland species, sedge warbler, Savi's warbler and reed bunting as well as total number of caugth birds per year and total numbers of caugth species per year were clearly associated with thick marsh vegetation. According to our results the bird species composition of the wetland might have returned to the prerestoration levels and surface areas.

Shanahan, D.F.; Possingham, H.P.; Martin, T.G.				Austral Ecology	36	8		944-953	Dec 2011	2011				English	2	62	In Australian urban environments, revegetation and vegetation restoration are increasingly utilized conservation actions. Simple methods that help assess the utility of urban vegetation for bird species will help direct this effort for bird conservation purposes. We therefore examine whether ecological principles can be used to predict, a priori, the relative abundance of different bird species in urban vegetation. Our model proposes that a bird species will be in greater abundance where vegetation structure better reflects its foraging height requirements, and this relationship will be moderated by the landscape context of the patch. To quantify and test this model, we created an index to rank existing and revegetated urban vegetation sites in order of greatest expected abundance for each of 30 bird species. We tested this model, alongside two simpler models which consider landscape context and foraging height preferences alone, using bird abundance data from 20 woodland remnants and 20 revegetated sites in Brisbane, Australia. From these bird abundance data, we calculated the relative abundance of each species between the top-ranking sites and lowest-ranking sites. The model which incorporated both foraging height requirements and landscape context made predictions that were positively correlated with the data for 77% of species in remnant vegetation and 67% in revegetation. The results varied across species groups; for example, we achieved lower predictive success for canopy foraging species in the less mature revegetation sites. Overall, this model provided a reasonable level of predictive accuracy despite the diversity of factors which can influence species occurrence in urban landscapes. The model is generic and, subject to further testing, can be used to examine the effect of manipulating vegetation structure and landscape context on the abundance of different bird species in urban vegetation. This could provide a cost-effective tool for directing urban restoration and revegetation efforts.

Since 1985, revised silvicultural objectives have necessitated detailed monitoring of responses by bird species and assemblages to silvicultural treatments (timber harvesting and associated burning). Few marked changes in the avifauna were detected. Species accumulated (in terms of numbers of grids) at similar rates in gap release, shelterwood /selective cut, and reference (either never harvested or harvested more than 40 years previously) forests. In terms of individuals, species accumulated faster in the gap release forests. The number of species represented as singletons was greatest on the never harvested (8), coupe buffer (7) and gap release (6) grids. Dominance-diversity curves also showed only minor differences between silvicultural treatments. Neither nMDS nor CAP ordinations showed any clear separation between the treatments. There was little evidence of any substantial effect of silvicultural treatments on avian community structure or on individual bird species. Community structure was, however, significantly associated with forest ecosystem/year of sampling. The basal area of live trees was not correlated with bird species richness or abundance on each grid. These results are consistent with previous studies, which indicate that most bird species in jarrah forest have a high threshold level of tolerance to disturbance. It is likely that the rapid regeneration of dominant tree species after harvesting and associated fire, the patchiness of treatments at the landscape scale, the high degree of connectivity of harvested and burnt forests with forests not recently harvested or burnt, and the retention of habitat trees in the most heavily-harvested (gap release) forests all conduce to dampen local-scale impacts and conserve the avifauna in relation to the home range and normal movements of its constituent bird species.

Bestandsentwicklung der Wiesen-Limikolen in Schleswig-Holstein.	Hoetker, Hermann; Jeromin, Heike; Thomsen, Kai-Michael				Corax	22	1		51-70	Dezember 2011	2011				German	0	1	Waders breeding on meadows belong to the most threatened guilds of bird species in western Europe. After Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein holds the biggest share of meadow birds in Germany. In this paper we compile regular and casual counts of eight wader species from 318 monitoring sites. We modeled and analyzed trends with the program TRIM. We put special empha-sis on counts on the peninsula of Eiderstedt, where no regular monitoring had taken place since 2001. On Eiderstedt, numbers of breeding Oystercatchers, Lapwings, Black-tailed Godwits and Redshanks de-creased sharply in sites without habitat management. In sites where water management had been adapted to the requirements of meadow birds, the populations remained stable. The modeling of trends for the entire state of Schleswig-Holstein had following results: After several decades of increase, numbers of Oystercatchers breeding in Schleswig-Holstein reached a peak in 1996, and declined steeply afterwards. The decline started earlier inland than on the coast. Numbers of Lapwings breeding in Schleswig-Holstein fluctuated in the late 1980s and declined in the years after 1990. The population of Dunlins breeding in Schleswig-Holstein recovered in the 1980 after having been close to local extinction shortly before. After 1990 the population decreased again. Meanwhile Dunlins do not regularly breed in Schleswig-Holstein any more. Numbers of Ruffs and Common Snipes breeding in Schleswig-Holstein steadily decreased. Black-tailed Godwits went through a population depression in the 1980s, recovered until 1990 and decreased again in the decade thereafter. Since 2010 the numbers have fluctuated without a clear trend. The mean population size in the years 2006 to 2010 was 1292 pairs. Numbers of Curlews and Reds-hanks breeding in Schleswig-Holstein remained stable and increased slightly in recent years.The strongest declines occurred at the Baltic coast and inland, whereas populations on the Wadden Sea coast performed better in general.

Zusammenhange zwischen der Bestandsentwicklung der Brutvoegel 1988 - 2008 and der Quantitaet and Qualitaet der Oekoflachen im Landwirtschaftsgebiet im Kanton Zurich.	Weggler, Martin; Schwarzenbach, Yvonne				Ornithologische Beobachter	108	4		323-344	Dezember 2011	2011				German	0	2	Since 1993, farmers have to manage a minimum of 5 % (7 % since 1998) of their cropped farmland as so-called ecological compensation areas to enhance biodiversity. Additional governmental funding is provided since 2003 for improved connectivity (OQV-V programme) and quality (O.QV-Q programme) of these areas. Based on large-scale breeding bird census data from 1988 and 2008, we tested for 164 boroughs (each approx. 1000 ha) and 1027 landscape plots (40[long dash]60 ha each) whether population change of target species in agrienvironment schemes (UZL-species) was related to the extent and quality of ecological compensation areas within plots. Species richness and population size of UZL-species decreased by 20 % between 1998 and 2008. UZL-species bound to arable land showed an even stronger population decline of 50 %. The decline in a plot was proportional to the initial value in 1988. Revealed by analysis of variance, species richness and size of the breeding population in a plot were weakly correlated with the area of ecological compensation areas that fulfilled the standard of OQV-Q. However, total area of ecological compensation areas correlated only weakly with species richness and no effect was found for ecological compensation areas fulfilling the standard of OQV-V. The bottom line is that the OQV programme did mitigate the overall decline in breeding bird populations only slightly. The limited effects of the OQV programme on target species are attributed to methodological and biological causes. From a biological perspective, the OQV programme failed so far because most ecological compensation areas don't seem to constitute functional habitats for target birds. To generate a positive effect, the programme should focus on ecological compensation areas according to the standards of OQV-Q and new types in appropriate sizes and spatial position should be promoted that are relevant for birds (micro-structures with stunted growth of vegetation, stubble fields, short-term fallow land, grassland with incomplete vegetation cover). We propose a shift towards an effect-based payment system that rewards the actual effect on biodiversity rather than the current effort-based compensation.

Uezu, Alexandre; Metzger, Jean Paul				Biodiversity and Conservation	20	14		3627-3643	Dec 2011	2011				English	1	98	Patch size, isolation, and vegetation structure are expected to strongly affect species persistence in fragmented landscapes, particularly for those with <30% of native habitat remaining. Those influences should be modulated by species characteristics, resulting in complex relationships. In order to investigate how species, habitat structure and landscape factors are related and how they affected species persistence, we studied bird communities in a fragmented Atlantic Forest region. Patch size strongly affected species richness and population abundances. However, some functional groups were more affected than others, particularly endemic and understory insectivores, species that are near the limits of their geographical distribution, those using few forest types, and those with their center of abundance in high altitude tropical forests. The effect of vegetation structure was mainly at the species level, reflecting specific responses to habitat quality. The importance of landscape variables varies according to the species group. For the most affected ones, which usually have low dispersal capacity, patch size and quality were the most relevant factors, whereas patch isolation was associated with the richness of groups with more generalist species. This pattern is due to the limited structural connectivity in the study region, composed of low matrix permeability (e.g. pastures and sugar cane), which isolate the most affected species, making them more dependent on local factors. In such a fragmented landscape, the largest patches should be prioritized for conservation purposes, as they aggregate the most vulnerable species and present the highest alpha diversity. Landscape management, as such, should also reconnect large fragments through corridors or matrix improvements, promoting better conditions for long-term persistence of the most affected species.

Grant, Todd A.; Shaffer, Terry L.; Madden, Elizabeth M.; Berkey, Gordon B.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	35	4		368-376	Dec 2011	2011				English	0	11	Prescribed fire is an important, ecology-driven tool for restoration of grassland systems. However, prescribed fire remains controversial for some grassland managers because of reported reductions in bird use of recently burned grasslands. Few studies have evaluated effects of fire on grassland bird populations in the northern mixed-grass prairie region. Fewer studies yet have examined the influence of fire on nest density or survival. In our review, we found no studies that simultaneously examined effects of fire on duck and passerine nesting. During 1998-2003, we examined effects of prescribed fire on the density of upland-nesting ducks and passerines nesting in north-central North Dakota, USA. Apparent nest densities of gadwall (Anas strepera), mallard (A. platyrhynchos), and all duck species combined, were influenced by fire history of study units, although the degree of influence was not compelling. Fire history was not related to nest densities of blue-winged teal (A. discors), northern shoveler (A. clypeata), or northern pintail (A. acuta); however, apparent nest densities in relation to the number of postfire growing seasons exhibited a strikingly similar pattern among all duck species. When compared to ducks, fire history strongly influenced apparent nest densities of clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). For most species examined, apparent nest densities were lowest in recently burned units, increased during the second postfire growing season, and stabilized or, in some cases, decreased thereafter. Prescribed fire is critical for restoring the ecology of northernmixed-grass prairies and our findings indicate that reductions in nest densities are limited mostly to the first growing season after fire. Our results support the premise that upland-nesting ducks and several grassland passerine species are adapted to periodic fires occurring at a frequency similar to that of pre-Euro-American settlement of the region.

Lane, Vanessa R.; Miller, Karl V.; Castleberry, Steven B.; Cooper, Robert J.; Miller, Darren A.; Wigley, T. Bently; Marsh, Graham M.; Mihalco, Rebecca L.				Forest Ecology and Management	262	9		1668-1678	Nov 1 2011	2011				English	0	15	Although intensively managed pine forests are common in the southeastern US, few studies describe how combinations of mechanical (MSP) and chemical site preparation (CSP) and herbaceous weed control (HWC) techniques affect bird communities that use early successional habitats within young pine forests. Therefore, we examined effects of six treatments of increasing management intensity via combinations of MSP (strip-shear and wide spacing or roller chop and narrow spacing) and CSP (application or no application) treatments with banded or broadcast HWC on bird communities in six loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, for 8 years following site preparation. Wide pine spacing and strip-shear MSP increased bird abundance and species richness over narrow spacing and chopped MSP for 6 years after planting. Chemical SP reduced bird abundance in year 2, increased bird abundance in year 6, had no effect on abundance after year 7, and did not affect species richness in any year. Total bird abundance and species richness were similar between banded and broadcast HWC. Site preparation and HWC had no effect on bird diversity and bird communities were most similar in treatments of similar intensity. Site preparation and HWC had few or no effects on birds based upon migratory status, habitat association, or conservation value. The addition of chemical site preparation or HWC had little effect on birds beyond pine spacing, and bird abundance was not proportional to management intensity. Although we observed treatment effects, all treatments provided habitat used by a variety of bird species, and pine plantations may play an increasingly important role in bird conservation as forests become fragmented and converted to other land uses and as natural processes that create early successional habitat, such as fire, are suppressed.

Agricultural and Forest Entomology	13	4		373-381	November 2011	2011				English	0	20	1 Wood-boring larvae in the families Cerambycidae and Buprestidae are often found in high densities in burned trees after wildland fires. They play an important role in tree decomposition, often reducing the value of salvageable timber, and represent an important avian food source. 2 Three forest areas that experienced wildfires 1-3 years previously were surveyed during the summer of 2004. Ponderosa pine trees with green, scorched and consumed needles were examined for wood borer occurrence. Within each of the three needle damage categories, the mean wood borer incidence was similar between different age fires. Trees with scorched or consumed needles had significantly more wood borers than trees with green needles. 3 Larvae collected from under tree bark were identified to family; when possible, cerambycids were identified further to Acanthocinus spp., Monochamus sp., Rhagium inquisitor (L.) and Stictoleptura canadensis (LeConte), and buprestids were identified to Chalcophora spp. and Chrysobothris sp. 4 Classification tree models showed that the estimated probability of tree infestation by wood borers varied among needle damage categories. For trees with green needles, tree injury variables of high bole char height and phloem discolouration were important predictive variables. In trees where needles were consumed, tree size variables of diameter at breast height and tree height were important predictive variables. 5 More than half the dead trees examined were infested with wood borers, indicating that infestation of fire-killed ponderosa pine may represent an important food source for species such as woodpeckers and a potential problem for the utilization of infested trees.

Cerezo, Alexis; Conde, Maria Cecilia; Poggio, Santiago L.				Biodiversity and Conservation	20	12		2649-2667	Nov 2011	2011				English	3	98	Agriculture intensification has drastically altered farmland mosaics, while semi-natural grasslands have been considerably reduced and fragmented. Bird declines in northern temperate latitudes are attributed to habitat loss and degradation in farmed landscapes. Conversely, landscape-modification effects on grassland/farmland bird communities are less studied in the South American temperate grasslands. We investigated how bird communities were influenced by landscape characteristics in the Rolling Pampa (Argentina). We sampled bird communities in 356 landscapes of 1-km radius that varied in cover and configuration of pastureland, flooding grassland and cropland. Using generalized linear models, we explored the relationship between both bird species richness and abundance, and landscape structure. Analyses were carried out for all species, and open-habitat, grassland and aquatic species. Pasture area was far the most important factor, followed by landscape composition, in predicting species richness and abundance, irrespective of specific habitat preferences, followed by partially-flooded grassland cover and its mean shape index. Grassland fragmentation did not affect species richness or abundance. When comparing the effects of landscape variables on bird richness and abundance (using mean model coefficients), pasture and grassland area effects were on average more than four times greater than those of compositional heterogeneity, and about ten times greater than shape effects. To conserve species-rich bird communities persisting in Rolling Pampa farmland, we recommend the preservation of pasture and grassland habitats, irrespective of their fragmentation level, in intensively managed farmland mosaics.

Hahn, Ingo J.; Vergara, Pablo M.; Roemer, Uwe				Biodiversity and Conservation	20	12		2797-2813	Nov 2011	2011				English	0	33	Habitat loss and degradation on oceanic islands are key processes leading to population decline of endemic birds and facilitating the establishment of invasive bird species. In this study, carried out in the Robinson Crusoe Island, we assessed density and habitat selection of terrestrial bird species, including juan fernandez firecrown and juan fernandez tit-tyrant, two endemics, as well as green-backed firecrown and austral thrush, which apparently originate from the mainland. Results show that perturbed habitats contained a low density of the endemic species whereas the mainland species were significantly more abundant in perturbed scrub habitats. Bird species show different habitat selection patterns, with endemics selecting for native forest and mainland species selecting for perturbed habitats, or using them at random. Bird species experienced temporal trends in their overall population sizes, with the endemic tit-tyrant suffering a significant decline in its population size of about 63% between 1994 and 2009. Only mainland species exhibited temporal changes in habitat use, significantly reducing their densities in the preferred scrub habitats, possibly as a response to decreased habitat quality. Thrushes apparently were able to compensate the population decrease in one non native habitat type by using native forests, a habitat giving them the opportunity of preying on nests of endemic species. We conclude that endemic bird species behave as specialists whereas the mainland species must be treated as invasive generalists on Robinson Crusoe Island.

The importance for breeding birds was investigated by territory mapping in 2010 (490.8 ha). In a part of the area (349.2 ha), a similar investigation had been carried out in 1994. 90 species of breeding birds with 2,376 territories were mapped in 2010, the total abundance being 48.41 territories/10 ha. These figures represent a breeding-bird community very rich in species as well as in individuals. The highest abundance of 89.76 territories/10 ha was found in a stretch of 90 ha of forest which has never been under forestry management. In the parts of the study area which were mapped in 1994 and 2010, the number of species increased from 42 in 1994 to 66 in 2010, and the total abundance increased from 19.67 to 41.52 territories/10 ha. The species listed in the Red Data Book show a country-wide importance of the woodlands for breeding birds and a national importance of all other parts. Most of the species which are threatened with extinction or critically endangered breed in the restoration areas. Furthermore, the peat-mining areas are still of high importance for the Northern Wheatear, which is faced with extinction. When peat-mining comes to an end, large areas will be restored within the next decades. This means that in future the ornithological importance may even increase significantly, if the management is sufficient.

Pacific Conservation Biology	17	1-2		22-35	Fall 2011	2011				English	0	4	Shelterbelts are common features of farm landscapes that provide shelter for livestock and crops and timber but may also benefit wildlife. The importance of shelterbelt plant diversity for birds was investigated by a survey of 62 sites in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia. An area search technique was used to assess bird occurrence. An all subsets and exponential regression analysis approach explored the relationships between woody plant diversity and avifauna diversity (using Hill's diversity index), whilst seasonal variations were analysed using restricted maximum likelihood. Sixty-six bird species, including many that are woodland-dependent, representing eight foraging guilds, were observed in the shelterbelts. More species of birds occurred and at higher density in more floristically diverse shelterbelts. Other factors found to influence avifaunal use of shelterbelts were woody plant density, shelterbelt width, structural complexity, tree height, crown cover index and elevation. Seasonal analysis confirmed the importance of these independent variables but also revealed the significance of shelterbelt's proximity to water during summer for birds using this habitat. This study shows that floristic diversity, amongst other factors, is a significant predictor of avifauna diversity in shelterbelts and suggests that shelterbelts may be designed to optimize their wildlife habitat and biodiversity conservation values.

Sha, Jianbin; Li, Feng; Su, Liying; Pang, Shiliang; Gao, Zhongyan				Journal of Northeast Forestry University	39	8		77-84	Aug 25 2011	2011				Chinese	0	1	A survey was conducted on waterfowls (Anatidae), grebes (Podicipedidae) as well as coots and moorhens (Rallidae) from May to September during 2006-2009 in Zhalong wetland. The result was compared with that of the previous study in 1983. A total of 24 species were recorded, belonging to three orders and three families. The species composition and population size for swimming waterbirds fluctuated dramatically in Zhalong due to the low density of the breeding birds. The annual change in waterbird populations presented a slightly downward trend. Thirteen species previously recorded in Zhalong were not observed in the present survey. Compared with the previous study in 1983, populations for 13 species declined,among them seven species were not recorded in the present survey; those species that declined or were not recorded included especially breeding birds that have strong preferences for fresh water habitats. Populations of seven species increased, and those of 6 species remained stable. Ecological changes in Zhalong wetland in recent years, such as, drought, fragmentation of the wetlands, fires, hydrological disturbances associated with human activities, and habitat degradation, appear to be the causes of the population declines; therefore,effective measures on wetland restoration are needed.

Zhao, Hong; Zhang, Ke-Qin; Wang, Hai-Tao; Deng, Qiu-Xiang; Jiang, Yun-Lei; Liu, Justin; Gao, Wei				Chinese Journal of Zoology	46	4		25-31	Aug 20 2011	2011				Chinese	0	0	We studied the influence of providing nest boxes on the nature holes selection by secondary cavity-nest birds from March to July, 2005 to 2007 by comparing bird occupation rate between 3 experiment plots and 3 control plots. We marked all the nature holes in the 6 plots and provided 135 nest boxes the 3 experiment plots. By checking bird occupation rate in both nature holes and nest boxes, we found that 69. 33%, 58. 59% and 54. 00% nest boxes were occupied; 5.06%, 16. 52%, and 14. 62% of nature holes were occupied respectively in 2005, 2006 and 2007. No any difference were detected between the three years in bird occupancy rate in both next boxes and nature holes at the experiment plot, but the bird occupation rate between nest boxes was significantly different ( t = 0. 539, P > 0. 05). In addition, the occupation rate in nature holes during the year of 2005, 2006 and 2007 in 3 control plots was 8. 17%, 9. 60% and 12. 49%, no difference with experiment plots. Our results indicated that adding nest boxes can provide more nest sites for secondary cavity-nest birds (t =0.539,P >0. 05). Therefore, nest boxes provided in forest can increase of the breeding population size of the secondary cavity-nest birds.

Homyack, Jessica A.; Paxton, Barton J.; Wilson, Michael D.; Watts, Bryan D.; Miller, Darren A.				Southern Journal of Applied Forestry	35	3		148-154	August 2011	2011				English	0	14	Although snags are often considered to be a limiting factor for cavity-nesting birds within intensively managed pine (Pinus spp.) stands, there is little information regarding occurrences of snags and cavity-nesting birds for such stands in the southeastern United States. Therefore, during 2002-2003, we measured characteristics of individual snags (n = 1,218) and quantified the relative abundance of cavity-nesting birds (n = 204 observations; nine species) in 35 forest stands representing seven thinning classes (prior to thinning, three age classes following a first commercial thinning, and three age classes following a second commercial thinning entry) in intensively managed pine stands in eastern North Carolina. Snag populations were dynamic, with 649 snags falling and 75 new snags recruited between years. Stands in later thinning classes tended to have snags with larger diameters, less bark, and fewer limbs, and they were taller and more decayed (P < 0.05). Our data suggest that neither density of snags (P = 0.31) nor relative abundance of cavity-nesting birds (P = 0.25) differed strongly among thinning classes. Without active management, low recruitment coupled with the high loss rates that we observed could lead to low snag densities in older managed stands. Therefore, we suggest that forest managers consider retaining large-diameter dead or live trees as reserve trees through multiple rotations to increase or maintain snags in managed stands.

Arlettaz, Raphael; Ligon, Alain; Sierro, Antoine; Werner, Philippe; Kery, Marc; Oggier, Pierre-Alain				Biological Conservation	144	8		2126-2132	Aug 2011	2011				English	2	66	Many river revitalization projects are currently under development, but we still lack proper assessments of their effects on biodiversity, especially regarding non-aquatic vertebrates. We analysed the progressive changes in habitat mosaics, and the demographic response of two rare species of wading birds along a Swiss section of the Rhone river over a period of three decades. During the period preceding revitalization, the diversity of the habitat mosaic had been steadily declining. This impoverishment could however be reverted after 1994, when the revitalization was initiated: in 2006, the re-established habitat matrix was more diverse than at any time during the previous 27 years. The formerly channelized stream underwent radical transformation as it mutated into a heterogeneous braided river boosting pioneer riverine habitats. This has led the two wading bird species to establish significantly more territories than before the revitalization operations. Population size of Actitis hypoleucos and Charadrius dubius increased by 83% and 20%, respectively, between 1995 and 2007. During the same period, A. hypoleucos declined dramatically in Switzerland as a whole, whilst C. dubius showed no distinct population trend. The response of the two waders may have resulted from an increase in the number of lateral arms of the river, where the availability of productive temporary ponds provides excellent foraging opportunities. A significant proportion of these habitats was created by a targeted extraction of sediments with the objective to promote biodiversity while maintaining economic activity and improving security against floods. This suggests that gravel exploitation is not incompatible with efficient river restoration. [copyright] 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

McDermott, Molly E.; Wood, Petra Bohall				Forest Ecology and Management	262	3		547-554	Aug 1 2011	2011				English	1	12	Avian use of even-aged timber harvests is likely affected by stand attributes such as size, amount of edge, and retained basal area, all characteristics that can easily be manipulated in timber harvesting plans. However, few studies have examined their effects during the post-breeding period. We studied the impacts of clearcut, low-leave two-age, and high-leave two-age harvesting on post-breeding birds using transect sampling and mist-netting in north-central West Virginia. In our approach, we studied the effects of these harvest types as well as stand size and edge on species characteristic of both early-successional and mature forest habitats. In 2005-2006, 13 stands ranging from 4 to 10 years post-harvest and 4-21 ha in size were sampled from late June through mid-August. Capture rates and relative abundance were similar among treatments for generalist birds. Early-successional birds had the lowest capture rates and fewer species ([similar to]30% lower), and late-successional birds reached their highest abundance and species totals (double the other treatments) in high-leave two-age stands. Area sensitivity was evident for all breeding habitat groups. Both generalist and late-successional bird captures were negatively related to stand size, but these groups showed no clear edge effects. Mean relative abundance decreased to nearly zero for the latter group in the largest stands. In contrast, early-successional species tended to use stand interiors more often and responded positively to stand size. Capture rates for this group tripled as stand size increased from 4 to 21 ha. Few birds in the forest periphery responded to harvest edge types despite within-stand edge effects evident for several species. To create suitable habitat for early-successional birds, large, non-linear openings with a low retained basal area are ideal, while smaller harvests and increased residual tree retention would provide habitat for more late-successional birds post-breeding. Although our study has identified habitat use patterns for different species in timber harvests, understanding habitat-specific bird survival is needed to help determine the quality of silvicultural harvests for post-breeding birds.

Brutvogelbesiedlung einer ganzjaehrig extensiv beweideten Naturschutzflaeche mit Gewaesserneuanlagen.	Neumann, Helge				Corax	21	4		343-354	Juli 2011	2011				German	0	5	Breeding birds were recorded on an extensively managed, permanently cattle grazed nature conservation site in eastern Schleswig-Holstein during 2006 and 2007. As part of an "amphibian initiative" several ponds and retained waters (altogether 3.9 ha) had been established on the site in the two preceding years. The study site, which comprised 23 ha, was formerly used as intensively managed arable land and featured a hedgerow (440 m) as well as a small grove. Beside the hedge all areas of the study site were accessible for pasture livestock. Altogether 31 breeding bird species, including seven threatened species, were recorded on the study site. Composition of the breeding bird community was uniformly distributed in both years. Species showed quite similar abundances and dominances. Open water bodies including grazed banks were characterized by the highest numbers of species and territories in both years, where most of the species and territories were assigned to the retained waters and not to the small ponds. The group of threatened species showed a similar ranking between different habitats. Related to the entire breeding bird community, 44.2 % (2006) and 48.0 % (2007) of all territories were allotted to water bodies. Incorporating available literature, results indicate that year-round extensive grazing in combination with re-creation of shallow open water bodies can make a considerable contribution to preservation of bird species diversity and bird protection on formerly intensively managed farmland. Generalisability of results should be evaluated on the basis of a representative area sample.

Acta Zoologica Bulgarica			Supplementum 3	41-54	Jul 2011	2011				English	2	6	Since 2000, the systematic conservation activities have resulted in an improved status of the Bulgarian population of Eastern Imperial Eagle (Aquila heliaca SAVIGNY 1809). The population is estimated at 25-30 pairs. In the period 2001-2009, 13 newly occupied and 3 reoccupied territories were recorded. In 2009 the number of known occupied territories increased to 20. Occupied territories, breeding pairs, and population breeding parameters were recorded on annual basis. The recorded data included adult survival rate and age structure of the breeding population. The average values of the breeding parameters of the population for the period 2000-2009 were as follows: productivity 0.90[plus or minus]0.23; breeding success 1.01[plus or minus]0.26; fledglings success 1.56[plus or minus]0.25; and success rate 64.45% [plus or minus]11.52. Nest guarding, rehabilitation of injured birds and subsequent release, "moving of pairs", supplementary feeding, construction of artificial nests, increase of the awareness among local communities and authorities, nesting habitat management, ringing of nestlings, satellite and radio tracking, and purchase of land around the nests have been implemented for the conservation of the species. The main threats are: habitat loss, disturbance, shooting, poisoning, and natural disasters.

Ansell, Felicity A.; Edwards, David P.; Hamer, Keith C.				Biotropica	43	4		504-511	Jul 2011	2011				English	1	63	The inclusion of carbon stock enhancements under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) framework will likely drive a rapid increase in biosequestration projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere through rehabilitation of degraded primary rain forests. Such projects could also present an important opportunity to reverse losses of biodiversity from degraded rain forests, but concern has recently been expressed that management interventions to increase carbon stocks may conflict with biodiversity conservation. Focusing on a large-scale rain forest rehabilitation project in northern Borneo, we examine: (i) how intensive rehabilitation of selectively logged forests affected patterns of bird community composition and (ii) whether changes in vegetation structure explain observed shifts in avian guild structure and species composition. Bird composition differed between unlogged, naturally regenerating logged, and rehabilitated logged habitats, with the avifauna of rehabilitated forest more similar to that of naturally regenerating forest. Crucially, rehabilitation did not adversely affect either those species that declined after logging or those species that are IUCN Red Listed. Rehabilitation reduced the prevalence of vines and shrubs within regenerating forest, and across all habitats, the abundance and species richness of all birds and of obligate frugivores were positively related to vine prevalence. In contrast, the abundance and richness of frugivore-insectivore generalists and of salliers were negatively related to vines, suggesting that avifaunal responses to forest rehabilitation were attributable to liberation cutting of vines. Management intervention to increase carbon stocks had little adverse effect on avian biodiversity and we therefore argue that rain forest rehabilitation should play a strong role in future REDD+ agreements.

Hollenbeck, Jeff P.; Saab, Victoria A.; Frenzel, Richard W.				Journal of Wildlife Management	75	5		1061-1071	Jul 2011	2011				English	0	30	We evaluated habitat suitability and nest survival of breeding white-headed woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) in unburned forests of central Oregon, USA. Daily nest-survival rate was positively related to maximum daily temperature during the nest interval and to density of large-diameter trees surrounding the nest tree. We developed a niche-based habitat suitability model (partitioned Mahalanobis distance) for nesting white-headed woodpeckers using remotely sensed data. Along with low elevation, high density of large trees, and low slope, our habitat suitability model suggested that interspersion-juxtaposition of low-and high-canopy cover ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) patches was important for nest-site suitability. Cross-validation suggested the model performed adequately for management planning at a scale >1 ha. Evaluation of mapped habitat suitability index (HSI) suggested that the maximum predictive gain (HSI = 0.36), where the number of nest locations are maximized in the smallest proportion of the modeled landscape, provided an objective initial threshold for identification of suitable habitat. However, managers can choose the threshold HSI most appropriate for their purposes (e. g., locating regions of low-moderate suitability that have potential for habitat restoration). Consequently, our habitat suitability model may be useful for managing dry coniferous forests for white-headed woodpeckers in central Oregon; however, model validation is necessary before our model could be applied to other locations.

Delaney, David K.; Pater, Larry L.; Carlile, Lawrence D.; Spadgenske, Eric W.; Beaty, Timothy A.; Melton, Robert H.				Wildlife Monographs	177			1-38	Jul 2011	2011				English	4	67	Military lands are a valuable resource in recovery of threatened, endangered, and at-risk species worldwide and have the highest density of threatened and endangered species of all major land management agencies in the United States. Many red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) that reside on federal lands occur on 15 military installations in the southeastern United States. This close association has increased concern over potential conflicts between conservation requirements of endangered species and the military's mission of combat readiness. Our objectives were to 1) determine if military training operations affect behavior, reproductive success, and productivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers; 2) develop a frequency-weighting function to assess woodpecker hearing sensitivity; 3) identify factors that affect woodpecker responses to military training operations; 4) develop distance and dose-response thresholds for quantifying woodpecker responses to noise levels and stimulus distances; 5) characterize military training operations through quantification of sound levels, source identification, distance from active woodpecker nests, frequency spectra, duration, and frequency of occurrence; and 6) document baseline woodpecker nesting behavior. We conducted our study on the Fort Stewart Military Installation located in southeast Georgia, USA. Downy woodpeckers, as surrogates for red-cockaded woodpeckers, had their best hearing sensitivity within the peak range of the power spectrum of both downy and red-cockaded woodpecker vocalizations, which is at a higher frequency than that of a typical passerine. Overall, woodpeckers had a reduced auditory sensitivity relative to human hearing sensitivity and other species of small birds, especially in the frequency range >4 kHz. Woodpeckers were most sensitive in the 1.5- to 4.0-kHz range. Sensitivity appeared to drop off quickly at frequencies <1.0 kHz and >4.0 kHz. Overall, we did not find that the woodpecker-frequency-weighting function we developed provided a better predictor of woodpecker flush response compared with A-weighting. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between frequency-weighting functions and woodpecker response behavior. Potential breeding groups of woodpeckers across the population increased from 158 in 1997 to 181 in 2000, wheras nesting groups increased from 141 in 1998 to 170 in 2000, for overall increases of 14.6% and 20.6%, respectively, over the 3 years of this project. Fledging success rates for individual nests within the overall population remained consistent from 1998 to 2000, averaging 84.4%. Mean clutch sizes for woodpecker groups for 1998 to 2000 ranged from 2.75 to 3.01 eggs/nest, brood size ranged from 2.01 to 2.22 nestlings/nest, whereas the average number of young fledged ranged from 1.57 to 1.76 young/occupied nest. We observed no difference in reproductive success or productivity between experimental and control-tested red-cockaded woodpecker groups. Overall, experimental test groups produced an average of 2.98 eggs/nest, 1.89 nestlings/nest, and 1.54 young/occupied nest from 1999 to 2000, compared with 2.73 eggs/nest, 1.91 nestlings/nest, and 1.57 young/occupied nest at control groups. We measured behavioral responses (nest attendance and arrivals and departures from the nest) of red-cockaded woodpeckers to military training events through direct and indirect (i.e., video surveillance) observation of 464. 5 hours of woodpecker nesting behavior before and after controlled experimental events while recording and characterizing militry-generated sound events using sound-recording equipment. We presented woodpeckers with actual 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators from controlled distances to develop distance and sound thresholds. We used video surveillance to document potential behavioral responses of woodpeckers primarily during nonexperimental military training operations in areas that could not be safely monitored and to determine baseline woodpecker nesting behaviors. We recorded 2,846 nonexperimental military noise events in 157 data sessions at 50 red-cockaded woodpecker groups from 1998 to 2000. We also recorded 206 experimental tests at 58 woodpecker groups during 1999 and 2000. Life-table analyses of flush response time showed that at short ranges (15-30 m) the flush response was stronger for artillery simulator blasts than for blank fire in both the incubation and the nestling phases. In contrast, at medium distances (45-60 m) blank fire tended to produce more flush responses than artillery fire in both incubation and nestling phases. At longer distances (>60 m), blank fire and artillery produced similar flush responses in the incubation phase, whereas flush response was stronger for blank fire than for artillery in the nestling phase. In general, most animals that responded to military activity flushed within 5 seconds of the stimulus event. Woodpeckers returned to nests within an average of 4.4 minutes after being flushed by artillery simulators and 6.3 minutes after 0.50-caliber blank-fire tests. Woodpecker flush response rates increased as stimulus distance decreased and sound levels increased, regardless of stimulus type or year. Woodpeckers did not flush from nests when 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators were >152 m away and sound-exposure levels (decibels (dB)) were <68 dBW (woodpecker-based frequency-weighting curve) and <65 dBW, respectively. We found that blast treatments reduced arrival rates of adults at the nest, with the amount of reduction dependent on the type of blast stimulus and number of helpers at the nest. On the other hand, blast treatments had no detectable effects on nest attendance. The effect of blank fire on incubation-phase arrivals over a 30-minute interval (about 40% reduction) was nearly twice that of artillery simulator fire (about a 20% reduction). There was no evidence supporting any effect of stimulus type on arrivals during the nestling phase. Blast stimuli during incubation reduced arrivals by 40% when no helpers were present, but the strength of this effect decreased to 28% when one helper was present, and was only 6% for nests with >=2 helpers. Distance of the blast from the nest did not affect the response of arrival rates to blast treatments. Infrequent, short-duration military training exercises, as measured, did not appear to substantially impact red-cockaded woodpecker reproductive success and productivity on the Fort Stewart Military Installation. Our results may be applicable to other military installations where similar training activities and intensity levels occur. Additional research is needed to address possible habituation or sensitization of red-cockaded woodpeckers to human activities in proximity to active nest sites. Although we attempted to monitor woodpecker response to a number of military training activities, other types of military training operations or human-based activities with louder noise, longer duration, incrased human presence, and greater frequency of occurrence could more negatively influence woodpecker nesting behavior and need to be investigated. Our results do not support the hypothesis that military maneuver training operations are limiting factors in the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers on military installations, based on our level and type of testing. Natural resource management policies on military installations have had a positive influence on the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers and probably outweigh the negative effects of typical military training.

Gardali, Thomas; Holmes, Aaron L.				Environmental Management	48	1		28-37	Jul 2011	2011				English	1	44	With limited financial resources available for habitat restoration, information that ensures and/or accelerates success is needed to economize effort and maximize benefit. In the Central Valley of California USA, riparian habitat has been lost or degraded, contributing to the decline of riparian-associated birds and other wildlife. Active restoration of riparian plant communities in this region has been demonstrated to increase local population sizes and species diversity of landbirds. To evaluate factors related to variation in the rate at which bird abundance increased after restoration, we examined bird abundance as a function of local (restoration design elements) and landscape (proportion of riparian vegetation in the landscape and riparian patch density) metrics at 17 restoration projects within five project areas along the Sacramento River. We developed a priori model sets for seven species of birds and used an information theoretic approach to identify factors associated with the rate at which bird abundance increased after restoration. For six of seven species investigated, the model with the most support contained a variable for the amount of riparian forest in the surrounding landscape. Three of seven bird species were positively correlated with the number of tree species planted and three of seven were positively correlated with the planting densities of particular tree species. Our results indicate that restoration success can be enhanced by selecting sites near existing riparian habitat and planting multiple tree species. Hence, given limited resources, efforts to restore riparian habitat for birds should focus on landscape-scale site selection in areas with high proportions of existing riparian vegetation.

Frost, January S.; Powell, Larkin A.				Restoration Ecology	19	4		529-536	Jul 2011	2011				English	1	206	Habitat modification has the potential to cause changes in structure and composition of bird communities. Our goal was to determine the response of Songbird community composition to eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) removal in The Nature Conservancy's Niobrara Valley Preserve, Nebraska. We used point counts to survey birds in the riparian matrix of grassland and forest habitats. More than 60 species were recorded on surveys during 2004-2005. We also use the program PRESENCE to determine the response of five species to various habitat components, including cedar density: House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculates), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea). Species richness estimates were highest in open and mixed habitat patches. Local populations of Ovenbirds and Red-eyed Vireos responded positively to cedar density, whereas House Wren numbers declined as cedar density increased. Cedar abundance explained the most variation in bird community similarity between survey points; species richness increased as cedar density decreased. Habitat structure and composition drove variation in community composition and population abundance at fine, local scales within the Preserve. Fine-scale management to remove cedar from local areas should increase diversity of avian species by maintaining a matrix of habitat types. Cedar removal at any scale will affect the composition of bird communities, and we encourage a structured approach to management decisions.

Fontana, Simone; Sattler, Thomas; Bontadina, Fabio; Moretti, Marco				Landscape and Urban Planning	101	3		278-285	Jun 15 2011	2011				English	6	114	Urbanization is a fundamental environmental change, today happening at accelerated speed worldwide. Despite the strong and permanent human impact, urban biodiversity has generally proved to be surprisingly high. Quantitative information on the effect of management actions on biodiversity is often lacking but is an indispensable basis for decisions by urban planners and managers. We therefore quantified key urban variables to predict changes in avian biodiversity when their urban habitat is modified. We analysed species richness, diversity (Simpson index) and community composition of 63 bird species with reference to major urban environmental gradients at 96 sampling points in three Swiss cities. Best explanatory models were selected from candidate models following information theory, and their respective predictions were averaged based on AlCc-weights. Bird species richness and diversity are negatively affected by increasing fractions of sealed area or buildings, while increasing vegetation structures, in particular trees, show positive effects. Our models predict an increase from 13 species in the absence of trees to 20 species with 46% tree cover (+54%). Coniferous trees help to maximize bird species richness, with the models predicting an increase from 14 species at sites with only deciduous woody plants to 20 species (+43%) at places with equal representation of coniferous and deciduous plants. While the analysis of the Simpson index did not show any influence of the coniferous and broadleaf woody plants mixture, partial redundancy analysis revealed such an influence on bird community composition. highlighting the importance to consider several measures when analyzing biodiversity.

Forest Ecology and Management	261	11		1928-1935	Jun 1 2011	2011				English	4	44	Across the southeastern United States, changing disturbance regimes threaten the integrity of pine flatwoods, reducing their suitability as habitat for a variety of avian species, many of which are considered of conservation priority. Prescribed burning and roller chopping are management practices widely used in pine flatwoods to control shrubs and increase the growth of herbaceous vegetation. However, the impacts these treatments have on this system and its associated avian communities are largely unknown. We examined the effects of prescribed burning and roller chopping on pine flatwoods avian communities using a paired sample approach. Avian communities were compared between treated (e.g., burned) and untreated areas. We considered abundance and richness of all birds, but also groups of conservation concern, and those likely impacted by seasonal management practices (e.g., breeding and non-breeding categories, and woodland, successional-scrub, and grassland guilds). Dormant season burning resulted in decreases in avian species richness and abundance within the non-breeding, overwintering community. In situations where the maintenance or enhancement of this avian group is desired, growing season burning appears beneficial and should be used in preference to dormant season burning. Growing season burning benefited breeding avian communities, resulting in increases in species richness and abundance within this group. Dormant season roller chopping had no effect on species richness or abundance of any avian category or guild. Increases in abundance within breeding avian communities were observed following growing season roller chopping and a roller chopping/burning combination. Grazing, did not mediate the effects of prescribed burning or roller chopping on avian species richness or abundance. The use of dormant season burning is likely inappropriate in situations where conservation and management of non-breeding, overwintering species is a priority. The use of growing season roller chopping appears to provide a potential treatment alternative in situations where positive effects on breeding species are desired. Overall, maintenance of avian abundance and richness may be best achieved through the diverse application of prescribed burning and roller chopping based on season, frequency, and space.

Summers, Ron W.; Buckland, Stephen T.				Bird Conservation International	21	2		186-198	June 2011	2011				English	2	15	A survey of Scottish Crossbills Loxia scotica was carried out in 3,506 km2 of conifer woodland in northern Scotland during January to April 2008 to provide the first estimate of the global population size for this endemic bird. Population estimates were also made for Common Cross- bills L. curvirostra and Parrot Crossbills L. pytyopsittacus within this range. Crossbills were lured to systematically selected survey points for counting, sexing and recording their calls for later call-type (species) identification from sonograms. Crossbills were located at 451 of the 852 survey points, and adequate tape-recordings made at 387 of these. The Scottish Crossbill had a disjunct distribution, occurring largely within the eastern part of the study area, but also in the northwest. Common Crossbills had a mainly westerly distribution. The population size of post- juvenile Scottish Crossbills was estimated as 13,600 (95%C.I. 8,130[long dash]22,700), which will approxi- mate to 6,800 (4,065[long dash]11,350) pairs. Common Crossbills were more abundant within this range (27,100, 95% C.I. 14,700[long dash]38,400) and Parrot Crossbills rare (about 100). The sex ratio was not significantly different from parity for Scottish Crossbills. The modal number at survey points was two but numbers were larger in January than later in the survey. The numbers and distri- bution of all crossbill species are likely to vary between years, depending upon the size of the cone crops of the different conifers: all were coning in 2008. Common Crossbill and Parrot Cross- bill numbers will also be affected by irruptions from continental Europe. A monitoring scheme is required to detect any population trend, and further work on their habitat requirement (e.g. conifer selection at different seasons) is needed to inform habitat management of native and planted conifer forests to ensure a secure future for this endemic bird.

Grove, Greg				Pennsylvania Birds	25	3		146-150	Jun-Jul 2011	2011				English	0	0	The character of Rothrock State Forest has not significantly changed since 1992, when the forest was already fairly mature, albeit by post-logging era standards. Logging is ongoing but affects only a small fraction of the total acreage; it has been many decades since most of RSF has been cut. To protect against deer browsing, areas logged in recent years have been fenced, the effect of which is dramatic. Although an ugly process, logging nevertheless mimics in some degree the natural acts of fire, wind-throw and disease, and of course some species are dependant on the resetting of succession to earlier stages. Fortunately, the hemlock stands in RSF have seen limited effects of the woolly adelgid, which is present but seems to be progressing slowly, perhaps slowed by the winter cold at the latitude and elevation of RSF. As with the forest, the avian fauna undo of RSF has not changed substantially. BBS numbers for a given species may fluctuate substantially from year-to- year, as expected of a survey done just the once annually; obviously, no conclusions can be made from a single high or low count - only trends that continue for several years may be significant. Furthermore, we can have most confidence in validity of apparent trends for species that are relatively abundant and conversely much less for species low in average numbers. Thus, despite occasional deviations from average, the numbers of most common species have been stable, including Eastern Wood Pewee, Acadian Flycatcher, Scarlet Tanager, and Chipping Sparrow; or show only limited change of as yet uncertain significance, including Wood Thrush, flack-throated Green Warbler, and Common Yellowthroat. A few species appear to have undergone a substantial change in number, the most notable being the increase in Hooded Warblers, a trend seen statewide. Other common species that have clearly increased on the RSF routes include Mourning Dove, Red-eyed Vireo, Tufted Titmouse, Veery and American Robin. The most not, long-term decreases are of Ovenbird Great-crested Flycatcher. Eastern Towhee, the third most abundant species on these surveys, has gone ways, first decreasing, but recovering to the level of over a decade earlier. Population changes may be caused various factors in combinations that probably unique to each species. Some factors may be local, for example, forest maturation, logging, disease, caterpillar infestation, and browsing by deer. Other factors presumably affect a species on a larg scale, the two most obvious being the warming climate and habitat deterioration of the winter range. The importance of preservation of large, unbroken tracks of forest for the well being of dozens of species of birds in the heavily populated northeastern U.S. cannot be overstated. The State Forests are the most important avian conservation element of the Pennsylvania landscape. Their health and preservation must be a high priority as we deal with the uncertain effects of processes like natural gas extraction, wind turbine placement and climate change.

Kumar, Raman; Shahabuddin, Ghazala; Kumar, Ajith				Biological Conservation	144	6		1876-1884	Jun 2011	2011				English	2	34	We assessed the impact of forest management on woodpecker community structure sub-Himalayan dipterocarp sal (Shorea robusta) forests. We selected eight sites representing four management-based 'forest types' (natural unworked sal, old- and young managed sal, and teak plantations). At each site, bird surveys were conducted along 2-km-long transects, 20 times during breeding and non-breeding seasons. Habitat characteristics were enumerated using circular and belt plots. Species composition across forest types was compared using multi-response permutation procedures. Indicator analysis identified woodpecker species preferring particular forest types. Biomass, abundance, and mean species richness of woodpeckers were highest in natural sal, intermediate in managed sal, and lowest in teak. There were apparent differences in woodpecker densities between seasons. Densities were higher in breeding season than non-breeding season for natural sal, while the opposite was true for managed sal. Woodpecker species composition significantly differed across forest types. The four largest species, including grey-headed (Picus canus) and greater yellownape (Picus flavinucha) that were identified as indicators, predominated natural sal but were scarce in other types. At a broader level, mean species richness of woodpeckers strongly indicated mean richness of other avifauna during breeding season. Our study suggests that forest management has significantly altered the sub-Himalayan woodpecker community structure. Managed sal forests, particularly teak plantations, are largely unable to support the original woodpecker assemblage during breeding season, although they provide foraging grounds during non-breeding season.

Edgardo; Newhard, Kimberly				Revista de Biologia Tropical	59	2		969-980	Jun 2011	2011				English	6	107	The construction of roads near protected forest areas alters ecosystem function by creating habitat fragmentation and through several direct and indirect negative effects such as increased pollution, animal mortality through collisions, disturbance caused by excessive noise and wind turbulence. Noise in particular may have strong negative effects on animal groups such as frogs and birds, that rely on sound for communication as it can negatively interfere with vocalizations used for territorial defense or courtship. Thus, birds are expected to be less abundant close to the road where noise levels are high. In this study, we examined the effects of road traffic noise levels on forest bird species in a protected tropical forest in Costa Rica. Data collection was conducted in a forest segment of the Carara National Park adjacent to the Coastal Highway. We carried out 120 ten minute bird surveys and measured road noise levels 192 times from the 19th to the 23rd of April and from the 21st to the 28th of November, 2008. To maximize bird detection for the species richness estimates we operated six 12m standard mist nets simultaneously with the surveys. The overall mist-netting effort was 240net/h. In addition, we estimated traffic volumes by tallying the number of vehicles passing by the edge of the park using 24 one hour counts throughout the study. We found that the relative abundance of birds and bird species richness decreased significantly with the increasing traffic noise in the dry and wet season. Noise decreased significantly and in a logarithmic way with distance from the road in both seasons. However, noise levels at any given distance were significantly higher in the dry compared to the wet season. Our results suggest that noise might be an important factor influencing road bird avoidance as measured by species richness and relative abundance. Since the protected forest in question is located in a national park subjected to tourist visitation, these results have conservation as well as management implications. A decrease in bird species richness and bird abundance due to intrusive road noise could negatively affect the use of trails by visitors. Alternatives for noise attenuation in the affected forest area include the enforcement of speed limits and the planting of live barriers. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59(2): 969-980. Epub 2011 June 01.

Youngman, Joseph A.; Gayk, Zach G.				Wilson Journal of Ornithology	123	2		381-386	Jun 2011	2011				English	0	14	A stand-replacing fire in 404 ha of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and mixed pine forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in 2007 resulted in Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) nesting at high density in 2008, the second possible nesting season post-fire. Nests were found within a 93-ha study area and a 19-ha stand (a subset of the 93-ha study area) in 199.5 survey hours concentrated in March July. The 19-ha stand had six nests, a density of 0.31 nests/ha or 0.63 individuals/ha, while the 93-ha study area had 20 nests yielding 0.21 nests/ha or 0.42 individuals/ha. These nest densities are higher than previously reported in the literature for comparable stands, indicating a large influx of nesting woodpeckers post-fire. High nesting densities in this study may have resulted from: (1) optimal timing of the fire for wood-boring beetle exploitation of burned trees, (2) the discrete nature of burned habitat in the study due to impacts of salvage logging, or (3) our focus on regions of the burn where high nesting densities occurred, as the entire burned area (404 ha) was not included in nest density calculations.

Pryke, James S.; Samways, Michael J.; Hockey, Philip A.R.				African Journal of Ecology	49	2		199-208	Jun 2011	2011				English	0	15	Food resources can limit populations of insectivorous birds. Previous studies have shown strong correlations between bird population densities and their invertebrate food, with declining populations being attributed to loss of prey. This might also be the case for the threatened Knysna warbler (Bradypterus sylvaticus), which in the last 20 years has declined precipitously on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. The bird is abandoning natural, protected forests, retreating to narrow belts of suburban, riverine woodland with dense, tangled understoreys. The potential invertebrate food availability in natural forests and suburban woodland was assessed against what is known of the bird's preferred prey. The invertebrate food resource spectrum and abundance were determined using three sampling techniques in both natural forest and suburban woodland. Despite greater overall abundance of invertebrates in suburban woodland, the warbler's preferred prey items were equally abundant in both habitats. This suggests that reduced food supply does not explain abandonment of natural forests by the warbler. Rather, it is concluded that the availability of suitable nesting substrata, which are more abundant in suburban woodland, has driven the biotope shift. This is an unusual case of a localized and threatened bird species faring better under transformed conditions than in natural habitats.Resume Les ressources alimentaires peuvent limiter les populations d'oiseaux insectivores.

L'oiseau abandonne des forets naturelles protegees et se retire vers des ceintures de forets riveraines suburbaines, dont les etages inferieurs sont denses et touffus. La disponibilite potentielle des invertebres dont ces oiseaux se nourrissent fut evaluee dans des forets naturelles et dans des forets suburbaines en fonction de ce que l'on connait des preferences des oiseaux. On a determine le spectre et l'abondance des ressources en invertebres consommes en recourant a trois techniques d'echantillonnage dans les deux types de foret. Malgre une plus grande abondance generale d'invertebres dans la foret suburbaine, les proies preferees de la fauvette etaient aussi abondantes dans les deux habitats. Ceci laisse supposer que ce n'est pas un apport de nourriture reduit qui explique l'abandon de la foret naturelle par la fauvette. On en conclut plutot que c'est la disponibilite en substrats propices pour la nidification, qui sont plus abondants dans la foret suburbaine, qui a entraine le changement vers l'autre biotope. Ceci est un exemple inhabituel d'espece d'oiseau locale et menacee qui prospere mieux dans des conditions modifiees que dans des habitats naturels.

Nkwabi, A.K.; Sinclair, A.R.E.; Metzger, K.L.; Mduma, S.A.R.				Austral Ecology	36	4		403-412	Jun 2011	2011				English	0	57	An important question in biodiversity studies is whether disturbances in ecosystems will cause a net loss of species or whether such losses can be compensated by replacement of other species. We use two natural disturbances, fire and grazing, to examine the response of bird and arthropod communities in grasslands of Serengeti, Tanzania. Both burning and grazing by migrant ungulates take place at the end of the rains in June-July. We documented the communities before disturbance, then 1, 4 and 20 weeks after disturbance on three replicate plots and compared them with three undisturbed plots. Birds were recorded by observation, arthropods from pitfall, tray trap and sweepnet samples. We expected that as the grass biomass was reduced by either disturbance, bird communities would change with concomitant change in arthropod food abundance. Alternatively, bird communities would change not with the absolute amount of food but with the greater accessibility of food as the grass structure changed from long to short grass. Results showed first that both bird species richness and abundance increased after both types of disturbance, but burnt sites showed a greater increase than that for grazed sites. Second, there was a change in bird species composition with disturbance. The functionally equivalent athi short-toed lark (Calandrella athensis) was replaced by the red-capped lark (Calandrella cinerea). Third, the abundance of most groups of arthropods was lower on disturbed sites than those on undisturbed sites, and the reduction of arthropod numbers was greatest on burnt sites. These results imply that bird abundance did not occur through an increase in arthropod abundance but rather through a change in the grass structure making food more accessible; and the higher predation could have caused the lower arthropod abundance. In addition, some bird species replaced others thus functionally compensating for their loss.

Zhang, Qiang; Han, Richou; Zou, Fasheng				Forest Ecology and Management	261	11		1738-1749	Jun 1 2011	2011				English	4	31	To examine the relationship between forest succession after severe logging forestry practices and the composition of avian communities, we investigated how forest bird composition and guild structure change as a function of structural properties along a successional gradient, including a climax mature forest (>400 years), a rehabilitated mixed forest (50-70 years), and a disturbed Masson pine forest (70 years) of the Dinghushan Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, China. Of a total of 51 resident species recorded, mixed forests hosted the highest numbers of individuals and species, reflecting the high species richness of both forest and non-forest species. For forest-dependent species, however, mature stands had the highest observed and estimated species richness. Of 6 habitat-use guilds identified, vertical-profile generalists and understory-birds formed the two dominant guilds, accounting for 54.0% and 38.7% of all individuals respectively. The results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) clearly showed that most forest-dependent species were associated with high proportions of native canopy cover and the mean density of dead trees and large trees, which are characteristic of old-growth mature forests ( horizontal heterogeneity) at stand level. Accordingly, conservation efforts should focus on the specialized requirements of the most habitat-restricted species in the future, especially for understory insectivores (Babblers) and large-tree users in mature subtropical monsoon forests of southern China. Moreover, since regenerating mixed forests are very similar to mature forests in both vegetation structure and bird community composition, we recommend that logging cycles (>50 years) be increased to a minimum of 50 years in southern China, so that a balance between economic and ecological interest can be reestablished.

The RMZs had three treatments: (1) unharvested, (2) intermediate residual basal area (RBA) (targeted goal 11.5 m2/ha, realized 16.0 m2/ha), and (3) low RBA (targeted goal 5.7 m2/ha, realized 8.7 m2/ha). Surveys were conducted one year pre-harvest and three consecutive years post-harvest. There was no change in species richness, diversity, or total abundance associated with harvest but there were shifts in the types of birds within the community. In particular, White-throated Sparrows (Zonon-ichia albicollis) and Chestnut-sided Warblers (Dendroica pensylvanica) increased while Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) decreased. The decline of avian species associated with mature forest in the partially harvested treatments relative to controls indicates that maintaining an unharvested RMZ adjacent to an upland harvest may aid in maintaining avian species associated mature forest in Minnesota for at least three years post-harvest. However, our observations do not reflect reproductive success, which is an area for future research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We conducted repeated surveys for secretive marsh birds across 264 sites in the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Joint Venture region to estimate abundance, occupancy, and detection probabilities during the 2008 and 2009 breeding seasons. We identified species groups based on observed species co-occurrences. Two species, least bittern Ixobrychus exilis and American bittern Botaurus lentiginosus, co-occurred with other species less often than expected by chance, and two species groups, rails (Virginia rail Rallus limicola and sora Porzana carolina) and open-water birds (pied-billed grebe Podilymbus podiceps, common moorhen Gallinula chloropus, and American coot Fulica americana; coots were only surveyed in 2009), co-occurred more often than expected by chance. These groupings were consistent between years. We then estimated the relation of these species and groups to landscape and local site characteristics by using zero-inflated abundance models that accounted for incomplete detection. At the landscape level (5-km radius), the amount of emergent herbaceous wetland was positively associated with least bittern occupancy, whereas the amount of woody wetland was negatively associated with least bittern, rail, and open-water bird occupancy. At the local level, habitat variables that were associated with abundance were not consistent among groups or between years, with the exception that both least bitterns and open-water birds had a strong positive association between abundance and water[long dash]vegetation interspersion. Land managers interested in marsh bird management or conservation may want to consider focusing efforts on landscapes with high amounts of emergent herbaceous wetland and low amounts of woody wetland, and managing for high amounts of water[long dash]vegetation interspersion within the wetland.

Galvan, Ismael; Rey Benayas, Jose M.				Oecologia (Berlin)	166	2		305-316	Jun 2011	2011				English	0	36	Passive woodland regeneration following cropland abandonment and pine plantations are two major approaches for vegetation restoration in agricultural landscapes in the Mediterranean Basin. We compared the effects of these two contrasting approaches on local bird density in central Spain on the basis of species characteristics, including regional density, habitat breadth, life-history traits and plumage colouration. Local bird density increased with regional density and habitat breadth in both woodland and pine plantation plots following macroecological patterns of bird abundance and distribution. In woodlands, dichromatic species were more abundant than monochromatic species and bird density increased with the intensity of territory defense and as the proportion of plumage colour generated by pheomelanin decreased. Contrary to our prediction, this latter observation suggests that woodlands may induce higher levels of physiological stress in birds than pine plantations even though these represent a novel habitat change. In pine plantations, sedentary species were more abundant than migratory species and bird density was negatively related to body and egg mass. These traits of bird species in pine plantations are characteristic of successful invaders. The variation in bird density explained by phylogeny was twice as high in pine plantations as in woodlands, suggesting that pine plantations limit accessibility to some clades. Our results support, from an evolutionary perspective, the described inability of pine plantations on cropland to maintain or increase bird diversity in Mediterranean agricultural landscapes.

Schuphan, Ingolf				Vogelwarte	49	2		65-74	May 2011	2011				German	0	1	Results of a long-term study (10 years) on the population dynamics of the Rock Bunting Emberiza cia L. in a steep vineyard terrace habitat at the Middle Rhine, Germany (Schuphan 1972) were compared with results from studies (8 years) in steep spruce clearance habitats of the east hillside of the Palatine Forest (Pfalzerwald, Germany; Groh 1988) and natural steep rock steppes in the Wallis (Rhone area, Switzerland; Keusch 1991). The aim was to detect habitat differences and habitat dependent influence on population dynamic parameters of these geographically separated Rock Bunting populations. At the Rhine 618 mainly colour ringed Rock Buntings contributed to the results, in the Palatine Forest 157 and at the Rhone 993 Rock Buntings. Large differences between the habitats (vineyards, forest clearances, rock steppes) were obvious as well between the sizes of the territories. These were given at the Rhine and the Palatine Forest by topographical natural borders, in contrast to the Wallis where borders were much more flexible. The differences in size were predetermined in the case of the Palatine Forest by the sizes of the clearances, in the case of the Wallis territories obviously by limitation of initial lepidopteran food supply in spring. The small territories at the Rhine were directly affiliated with high food availability which caused a higher population density. Especially the age structure of the populations showed up considerable differences between Rhine and Wallis, for the Palatine forest no data were present. The optimal food supply, together with year round mild weather conditions affected positively the population at the Rhine. Following the first year 69% of the [male] ([female] 49 %) and than in the second year 42% ([female] 23%) of the primarily existing territory residents (100%) returned. Return quotes in the Wallis were 39% for the [male] ([female] 27%) and in the next following year for the [male] 16.7%. From the demographic distribution pattern resulted for the Rhine population over 10 years a mean age for the [male] of 2.6 years (n = 103) and for the [female] of 2.0 years (n = 101); in the Wallis the mean age was determined for 3 breeding periods each for the first period 1.3 years for the [male] (n = 16), second and third period each 1.7 years (n = 9 and n = 13). About one third of the breeding birds remained at the Rhine during winter in their mild breeding habitat. The rough Palatine hillsides were vacated completely. In the Wallis all breeding birds left the breeding territories. Five abroad recoveries of Rock Buntings from the Middle Rhine (autumn-winter) point all in the direction SW; leading lines could be the Nahe-Moselle valleys. The most faraway recovery was realized near Biarritz (1020 km, West-France). The extinction of the Palatine population after 1990 could obviously be attributed to reforestation and the restrictions for new forest clearances. Rock Buntings in populations adapted to mountain areas like in the Wallis, Black Forest and Palatine Forest, did not colonize their neighbor steep vineyard habitats e.g. in the Alsace and the Palatine Weinstrasse, even these habitats show the typical properties of the Rock Bunting habitats like at the Middle Rhine, Nahe, Moselle, and Ahr. These different preferences of habitat structures must be considered when a well directed advancement of the Rock Bunting in management plans is intended.

Nappi, Antoine; Drapeau, Pierre				Canadian Journal of Forest Research	41	5		994-1003	May 2011	2011				English	2	33	Burned forests represent high-quality habitats for many deadwood-dependent species. Yet, post-fire conditions may vary greatly within and among burns and thereby may affect habitat suitability for these species. We studied habitat selection of nesting black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus Swainson) in recently burned spruce-dominated boreal forests. Our objectives were to (i) identify factors involved in snag selection for both nesting and foraging and (ii) examine selection of nest sites within the burned landscape. A total of 92 nests and 1612 foraging observations were used to investigate snag selection. Our results show that both pre-fire forest conditions and fire severity are important in determining the quality of burned forests for black-backed woodpeckers. This species selected large snags for both nesting (>20 cm DBH) and foraging (>15 cm DBH). Woodpeckers selected deciduous and degraded "pre-fire" snags for nesting whereas black spruce snags that had been created by fire and that were moderately burned were preferred for foraging. Nest sites were concentrated in burned mature stands and supported higher densities of large snags (e. g., >15 cm DBH). Our results suggest that burned forest patches of at least 20 ha and composed mainly of burned mature and old-growth forests should be maintained during post-fire harvesting. The decrease in the amount of late seral stands in managed forest landscapes raises concerns about the future availability of high-quality burned forests for this species.

Canadian Journal of Forest Research	41	5		1004-1017	May 2011	2011				English	2	57	Cavity-nesting birds are dependent on large declining and dead trees that are frequently removed during partial harvesting. We compared breeding densities, nest survival, nest site characteristics, food abundance, and reproductive parameters of six species of cavity-nesting birds in partially harvested and reference woodlots in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Silvicultural practices significantly altered woodlot structure, with treatment-specific effects on bark arthropod biomass, fledging dates for the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus (Linnaeus, 1758)), and site suitability for the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius (Linnaeus, 1766)). Red-bellied Woodpecker, Downy Woodpecker (Picoides pubescens (Linnaeus, 1766)), and Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides villosus (Linnaeus, 1766)) experienced lower breeding densities in recently cut sites. Daily survival rates were generally greater for nests positioned higher up in large trees and for Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus (Linnaeus, 1758)) nests excavated in healthy and hard wood. Conversely, the Black-capped Chickadee (Poecile atricapillus (Linnaeus, 1766)) had higher daily survival rates in low, small trees (<10 cm diameter at breast height) and sites with lower arthropod abundance. We conclude that although partial harvesting has the potential to decrease cavity-nesting bird breeding densities, conscientious cavity tree retention during harvest may provide suitable nesting sites that maintain high rates of nest success, regardless of the silvicultural treatments that we examined. However, further research is required to monitor these trends beyond a single harvesting rotation.

Carbo-Ramirez, Pilar; Zuria, Iriana				Landscape and Urban Planning	100	3		213-222	Apr 15 2011	2011				English	5	85	We explore bird communities in different types of small urban greenspaces (<2 ha) in order to understand which birds occupy these structures, and the habitat and landscape features that affect them. In particular we analyzed how greenspace characteristics (size and vegetation structure), those of the adjacent landscape (area covered by urban structures and vegetation), and human disturbance variables (traffic of pedestrians, vehicles and noise levels) affected bird species richness, abundance and community composition (during summer and winter) in the city of Pachuca, Mexico. We selected 19 small greenspaces (ranging from 0.1 to 2 ha), including public parks, gardens and road strip corridors. We registered 39 species of birds of which 15 were migratory. In general bird species richness was higher in parks and gardens, and lower in road strip corridors, where more noise and traffic was registered. Greenspace area was the most important variable that positively influenced bird species richness, for both the summer and the winter communities. Summer bird species richness was lower in places that had a greater percentage of area covered by buildings in the adjacent landscape. Generalist and opportunistic species were favored by urbanization. Insectivorous species in winter were more abundant in larger greenspaces that had taller trees and more tree and shrub species, and in sites with more vegetative cover in the adjacent landscape. We suggest some management and urban planning actions that would benefit birds within many Latin American cities, where small greenspaces are often the only available refuges for birds.

Three types of margins were divided according to the volume of tall vegetation, i.e. herbaceous, shrubby, and tree lined. Fifty breeding bird species were recorded, with a mean density of 33.2 pairs/km. The dominant species were non-threatened and were characteristic of forests or of the field-forest mosaic. Tree lined margins showed the highest abundance and bird species richness. Shrubby margins supported the second highest, while open habitats ranked last. Abundances in ecological guilds were affected by the margin type, the presence of field roads, and especially the presence of ditches in the margin structure. Redundancy Analysis showed clear differences in bird communities between the discernable types of field margins. Species richness increased in the combinations of various margin types.

Benson, Thomas J.; Dinsmore, James J.; Hohman, William L.				American Midland Naturalist	165	2		257-273	Apr 2011	2011				English	2	19	Extensive conversion of Midwestern riparian areas for agricultural production has had many consequences including reduced habitat for nesting birds. However, more than 120,000 ha of riparian habitat have been restored in this region through USDA conservation programs. In 2001 and 2002, we assessed songbird responses to burning and disking for management of conservation easements in east-central Iowa. We randomly assigned herbaceous riparian fields to burning and disking treatments and collected data on density and species richness of songbirds in these habitats. Total density of grassland and wetland species and red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were reduced by burning in the first and second breeding seasons after burning; common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) density decreased with burning only in the first season. Disking led to increased density of grassland and wetland birds and greater overall avian conservation value on treated relative to untreated fields in the year after treatment. Changes associated with burning and disking treatments were likely related to changes in both vegetation structure and abundance of arthropod food resources. Despite decreased bird densities with burning, fire is a necessary management tool to control woody vegetation. Overall, both burning and disking appear to be effective management practices for maintaining herbaceous riparian habitats for grassland birds.

John, Jasson R.M.; Kabigumila, Jonathan D.L.				Ostrich	82	1		27-37	Apr 2011	2011				English	0	23	The East Usambaras are within the Eastern Afromontane hotspot, which is known for its exceptionally rich biodiversity. The original forest of the East Usambaras has been reduced by human activities, including establishment of Eucalyptus plantations, but little is known about the value of these plantations for biodiversity. Therefore, from July 2003 to June 2004, we studied avifauna in natural forests and plantations using the timed species count (TSC) method, based on which we provide an assessment of the conservation value of Eucalyptus plantations to the local avifauna. From 240 TSCs, 100 species in 79 genera, 32 families and seven orders were recorded. A total of 63 forest species were recorded in forest and 41 forest species in the Eucalyptus plantations with four forest species exclusively in the plantations. The two habitats shared a greater percent of non-forest bird species (85%) than forest bird species (64%). There was some degree of seasonal variation in species richness and relative abundance between habitats. The study shows that 'responsibly managed' plantations could benefit some local avifauna. We recommend proper management of the Eucalyptus plantations, including the retention of some undergrowth and of surviving isolated forest trees, in order to provide hospitable habitats for birds.

Hewson, Chris M.; Austin, Graham E.; Gough, Su J.; Fuller, Robert J.				Forest Ecology and Management	261	7		1224-1240	Apr 1 2011	2011				English	1	40	Several species of woodland birds have recently declined in Britain and there is a need to understand better how species are distributed across a wide spectrum of habitat types in order to develop appropriate conservation management strategies. To assess habitat associations of 28 woodland species, a large-scale study was carried out across Great Britain. A total of 2668 stands embedded in 825 woodland sites were surveyed. The number of species recorded in each stand and the occurrence of each species was examined in relation to the unique (or marginal) effects of gross structural characteristics of stands (growth stage and understorey structure), plant species composition (floristics) expressed in terms of dominant tree, shrub layer and field layer species and both sets of variables considered together whilst controlling for the spatial distribution of sites and site identity. The number of species recorded was independently related to growth stage, understorey structure, tree composition and field layer type. Eighteen species showed at least one significant relationship in models containing structure variables only. Thirteen species showed at least one significant relationship in models containing floristic variables only. In models containing both structure and floristic variables; 14 species showed at least one significant relationship with a structure variable, 9 species with at least one floristic variable and 8 species with both at least one structure and at least one floristic variable. Different bird species showed individualistic patterns of association with habitat variables. Results suggest that structure and floristics have complex and inter-related effects on bird distribution across woodland stands. Some of the apparent relationships with structure were a consequence of between-stand differences in floristics and vice versa whilst in two cases relationships with structure variables became apparent after controlling for the masking effects of floristic variables. Both vegetation structure and floristics appear to be important determinants of composition in bird assemblages in British woodland, though gross structural factors have previously received most emphasis. The existence of species-specific responses to habitat variation suggests that habitat heterogeneity, embracing structure and floristics, should be a key element in conservation planning within forests especially in the light of uncertainty about future regional species pools due to climate change. We discuss how responses of birds to habitat variation at the level of stands can form a basis for developing large-scale conservation strategies within managed forests.

Huth, Neil; Possingham, Hugh P.				Journal of Applied Ecology	48	2		293-300	Apr 2011	2011				English	0	26	1. Extensive clearing of native vegetation for agriculture has severely impacted upon Australia's biodiversity. Environmental tree planting, forestry and restoration of existing remnant patches provide ways for improving the matrix habitat value between larger conservation areas. However, improved guidelines are required to inform land managers on appropriate ways to design these areas when resources for habitat improvement are limited. 2. We developed a simple habitat suitability model for woodland birds from two basic observations of ecology: (i) the species-area relationship and (ii) the relationship between bird species richness and vegetation structural diversity. The model provides a suite of species-area relationships for habitats of different structural diversity. Data from across Australia were used in developing the model to ensure its generality. 3. A single species-area relationship for patches from 2 ha to 16 million ha was estimated for high-quality habitat patches using data from across mainland Australia. When this was combined with information on habitat complexity, the resultant species richness model was able to adequately describe the variation in woodland bird species richness within patches of various sizes (1-500 ha) in an independent data set from the Australian Capital Territory. 4. The results from the model suggest that for small patches of high quality, increases in patch size or quality reap benefits whereas the marginal return in species richness for increasing patch size is almost negligible for low quality patches above 10 ha or high quality patches of 20 ha. For small patches of low quality, there is little benefit in increasing patch area and so quality should be improved. These results agree with recommendations obtained using various other techniques. 5. Synthesis and applications. Investigation of the relationships embedded in the model provided similar recommendations for habitat restoration as determined by more detailed methods. The success of a simple combination of ecological principles linking area, structure and species richness supports the notion that existing basic theory can provide a sufficient basis for informing habitat restoration.

Kozma, Jeffrey M.				Western North American Naturalist	71	1		1-9	Apr 2011	2011				English	0	16	In this study I examined the composition of managed ponderosa pine (Pinta ponderosa) forests used by nesting White-headed Woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) along the eastern slope of the Cascade Range in Washington. I sampled trees and snags using the point-centered quarter method to assess species composition, tree and snag density, and stand basal area in 16 forest stands containing White-headed Woodpecker nests. All stands had a history of timber management and 2 had been burned and salvage-logged. Mean live-tree density (>= 10.16 cm dbh) was 182.3 trees [center dot] ha-1 (SE = 13.52), mean snag density (>= 10.16 cm dbh) was 11.5 snags [center dot] ha-1 (SE = 1.92), and mean stand basal area was 17.2 m2 [center dot] ha-1 (SE = 1..58). Ponderosa pine had the highest importance value ([overhead single bar]x = 220.9, SE = 17.25) of any tree species in all but 2 stands. Mean dbh of ponderosa pines was 33.0 cm (SE = 0.26) and ranged from 26.1 to 50.2 cm within stands. Mean density of ponderosa pine was greatest in the 20.3-30.5 cm dbh size class and lowest in the 50.8-61.0 cm and >61.0 CM dbh)11 size classes. Tree density was up to 5.3 times greater than densities believed to be typical of ponderosa pine forests prior to fire suppression. Snag densities were within the range estimated for historical dry forests of the eastern Cascades, yet only 50% of all snags sampled had a dbh >25.4 cm. Although White-headed Woodpeckers are considered strongly associated with old-growth ponderosa pine, my results suggest that they may be more adaptable to using forests dominated by smaller diameter trees.

McIntyre, Annie F.; Heath, Julie A.				Journal of Coastal Conservation	15	1		151-157	Mar 2011	2011				English	0	40	Coastal development and engineering projects preclude ecosystem processes that provide habitat for beach nesting birds. Management for coastal species may depend on actions that attempt to restore important habitat features and mitigate disturbance effects. However, species response to restoration or other management actions may be difficult to predict or measure. At Jones Beach State Park, on Long Island, New York, a 0.49 ha restoration project provided moist substrate foraging habitat for breeding Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) from 2002 to 2005. We examined whether foraging habitat restoration affected Piping Plover breeding population size, productivity, and fledgling production within 300 m of the restoration site. We found a positive relationship between habitat restoration and the number of fledglings produced per year. However, foraging habitat restoration did not significantly increase the number of Plover pairs breeding at Jones Beach. Our ability to evaluate restoration effects on Plovers depended on: 1) use of multiple performance criteria; 2) a design that allowed comparison of pre- and post-restoration data; and 3) a spatial control that allowed comparison of similar areas that were near and far from the restoration site. Despite the small size of the restoration project, there were measurable benefits to Plovers, indicating that foraging habitat restoration may be an effective tool for species recovery.

Barr, Rachel; Wright, Wendy; Rayment, Philip				Australian Forestry	74	1		43-53	Mar 2011	2011				English	0	11	Thinning is a silvicultural technique used extensively throughout Australia's production forests. The longer-term effects of thinning on forest biota are not well understood. This study provides an insight into the effects of thinning on avifauna and vegetation, 5-10 y after a thinning operation. A paired-site experimental design was used to compare bird density and species richness at thinned and unthinned sites in a mixed eucalypt production forest in Gippsland, Victoria. The 2006-2007 fires across Gippsland directly affected eight of twelve sites in this study, providing an opportunity to investigate the immediate effects of wildfire on birds. Significantly greater numbers of birds and bird species were found at thinned sites, compared with unthinned sites. Differences in vegetation structure and habitat quality were also apparent between thinned and unthinned sites. A reduction in both bird abundance and species richness occurred immediately after the wildfire. Research into the impact of silvicultural techniques, such as thinning, on forest biota is an important step towards achieving ecologically sustainable forestry. Improved understanding of the effect of forestry operations is imperative in order to maximise conservation in production environments.

Eggers, Sonke; Unell, Martin; Part, Tomas				Biological Conservation	144	3		1137-1144	Mar 2011	2011				English	1	54	The switch from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereals and the loss of habitat heterogeneity are often suggested to be key drivers of breeding bird decline on arable farmland. Yet, both factors are interlinked and it remains uncertain whether autumn-sown cereals reduce breeding bird numbers also in the structurally complex arable farmland of northern Europe. We tested whether autumn-sowing of cereals at both local and landscape scales affected the breeding bird community in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape of south-central Sweden. Rotation between sowing types was used as a semi-experiment based on 34 spring- vs. 41 autumn-sown cereal plots centred on infield non-crop islands of similar structure, size and surroundings. Species richness and territory abundance of ground-foraging species were significantly lower in autumn- than in spring-sown cereal plots both in the crop fields and the infield non-crop islands during the breeding season. No such effect was observed among foliage gleaning birds. Species richness in spring-sown cereal plots was less the more autumn-sown crops in the surrounding landscape within a 500 m radius. Average skylark densities did not differ between autumn- and spring-sown cereal plots because habitat preferences changed; densities declined in autumn-sown cereals during the growing season whereas they increased on spring-sown fields which had shorter swards throughout the breeding season. Our results indicate that negative effects of autumn-sown crops on breeding bird numbers spill over into both neighbouring non-crop and crop habitats. We conclude that agri-environmental schemes should place more emphasis on facilitating the value of the cropped area of fields as a foraging and nesting habitat. The retention of various non-crop habitats alone may not provide sufficient food close to nest sites for farmland birds that rely on crop fields for foraging. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Blank, Peter J.; Parks, Jared R.; Dively, Galen P.				Wilson Journal of Ornithology	123	1		59-64	Mar 2011	2011				English	2	16	Herbaceous buffers are strips of herbaceous vegetation planted between working agricultural land and streams or wetlands. Mowing is a common maintenance practice to control woody plants and noxious weeds in herbaceous buffers. Buffers enrolled in Maryland's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) cannot be mowed during the primary bird nesting season between 15 April and 15 August. Most mowing of buffers in Maryland occurs in late summer or fall, leaving the vegetation short until the following spring. We studied the response of wintering birds to fall mowing of buffers. We mowed one section to 10-15 cm in 13 buffers and kept another section unmowed. Ninety-two percent of birds detected in buffers were grassland or scrub-shrub species, and 98% of all birds detected were in unmowed buffers. Total bird abundance, species richness, and total avian conservation value were significantly greater in unmowed buffers, and Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichenvis), Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia), and White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) were significantly more abundant in unmowed buffers. Wintering bird use of mowed buffers was less than in unmowed buffers. Leaving herbaceous buffers unmowed through winter will likely provide better habitat for wintering birds.

Assessing Restoration Alternatives with Avian Foraging Behavior.		Morrison, Emily B.; Lindell, Catherine A.				Restoration Ecology	19		(Online Only Issue)	170-177	March 2011	2011				English	3	80	Active and passive restoration are two important strategies to aid the recovery of large areas of deforested and degraded tropical lands. Active restoration is where management techniques such as planting seeds or seedlings are implemented, and passive restoration is when no action is taken except to cease environmental stressors such as agriculture or grazing. We compared the habitat quality of active and passive restoration sites with similar land-use histories and times since abandonment for insectivorous birds by measuring vegetation structure, arthropod biomass, and the foraging behavior of three resident bird species in southern Costa Rica. Although vegetation measures such as amount of understory cover and tree species richness and density differed between the two restoration strategies, arthropod biomass and foraging behavioral measures were similar. Our results suggest that while active and passive restoration strategies may lead to different vegetation structures, they may support similar biomass of foliage-dwelling arthropods and be similarly used by foraging insectivorous birds. Passive restoration is generally less costlier than active restoration and, if local and landscape characteristics do not impede recovery, may be a viable alternative from the perspective of birds using the sites.

Munro, Nicola T.; Fischer, Joern; Barrett, Geoff; Wood, Jeff; Leavesley, Adam; Lindenmayer, David B.				Restoration Ecology	19		(Online Only Issue)	223-235	March 2011	2011				English	4	78	Revegetation plantings have been established throughout the world to mitigate the effects of clearing, including loss of faunal habitat. Revegetation plantings can differ substantially in structural complexity and plant diversity, with potentially differing habitat qualities for fauna. We studied bird occurrence in revegetation of different complexity and floristics in southern Australia. We assessed bird species richness and composition in remnant forest and cleared agricultural land as reference points, and in two types of plantings differing in structure and floristics-(1) "woodlot plantings" composed of native trees only and (2) "ecological plantings" composed of many species of local trees, shrubs and understorey. By approximately 20 years of age, both types of plantings had a similar bird species richness to that in remnants. Bird species richness was greater in ecological plantings than woodlot plantings. Species composition also differed. Ecological plantings contained a shrub-associated bird assemblage, whereas woodlot plantings were dominated by generalist bird species. Remnants contained a unique bird assemblage, which were not found in either of the two types of plantings, suggesting that plantings are not a viable replacement of remnant vegetation over this time period. Bird species richness responded positively to structural complexity, but not to floristic richness. Bird species richness was greater in plantings that were older, in riparian locations, and where weed cover was lower. We conclude that plantings in general can provide habitat for many species of birds, and that structurally complex ecological plantings in particular will provide unique and valuable additional habitat for birds.

Zozaya, Elena L.; Brotons, Lluis; Vallecillo, Sara				Ardea	99	1		73-84	Spr 2011	2011				English	2	18	Mediterranean forests are highly resilient to fires, showing a rapid recovery after disturbance. However, in some cases direct tree regeneration fails leading to radical changes in landscape composition. In this study, we evaluated the impact of landscape changes on the conservation value of bird species using the new landscape mosaic arising from non-direct regeneration after a fire. We used data from a large fire that occurred in central Catalonia (NE Spain) in 1998. The fire affected about 26,000 ha of a land mosaic mainly covered by Black Pine Pinus nigra forests and farmland dominated by cereal crops. We used line transects to estimate bird abundance and gathered information on dominant vegetation covers and landscape variables. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and generalized linear models were used to explore how the measured environmental variables explain bird species abundance and to analyze how post-fire heterogeneity in vegetation affected the conservation value of the bird community. Factors describing the main patterns in the post-fire landscape explained up to 31.2% of the total variability in bird community composition and described three main groups of bird species sharing similar ecological requirements. Additionally, 71% of the studied species significantly responded to one of the first three vegetation gradients distinguished in the study area. Finally, the conservation value of the bird community significantly decreased in areas dominated by Q. humilis resprouters and significantly increased in shrubland areas. Overall, our results suggest that large fires affecting non-direct regenerating forest types lead to a new and radically different mosaic landscape offering new opportunities to species with unfavourable European conservation status.

Only one species (Cettia cetti) occurred in marshland fragments within the 0-1 size area class while all species were present in larger size classes. Acrocephalus scirpaceus is the only species that showed a significant increase in frequency of occurrence moving from 0-1 to 1-10 ha size area classes. However, our study supports the hypothesis that the frequency of occurrence of several other area-sensitive species (e.g., Tachybaptus ruficollis, Ixobrychus minutus, Gallinula chloropus, Fulica atra) increases toward larger size area classes, although these trends here are not significant. Therefore, the frequency of occurrence of these species should be a focus of further research in a wider range of marshland fragments. These results will be useful in terms of wetland management implications (e.g., selection of suitable fragments for sensitive species).

Evidences from three Mediterranean forest patches.

In this study, we analyzed the diversity of three oak forest patches (one of them recently coppiced) in Mediterranean Central Italy. Vascular plants were censused on a raster of squares of 10,000 m2. Breeding birds were censused with the point-sampling method. In the three wood patches studied, we observed a clear pattern in diversity with similarities and differences between plants and birds. A mature wood patch (Foglino North) showed the highest total number of species (a measure of [gamma]-diversity at wood patch scale) both for birds and plants but, at level of mean species richness (an averaged measure of [alpha]-diversity at sampling point scale), birds showed values significantly different among wood patches with the lowest value in the recently coppiced wood patch (Armellino); on the contrary, the plants did not show differences among patches. In the coppiced wood patch, birds showed the highest value of species turnover among sampling points (a measure of [beta]-diversity at wood patch scale), while plants showed the lowest value. Data suggest that when comparing a coppiced wood patch to a mature wood patch, human-induced heterogeneity developed by coppice management may affect diversity in vascular plants and breeding birds differently at different hierarchical level (i.e., [alpha]-, [beta]-, [gamma]-level). This human-induced heterogeneity may decrease the [alpha]-diversity values in birds, while it may favor an increase in plants. Moreover, with coppice management, species turnover among sites (a measure of [beta]-diversity) may decrease in plants while may increase in birds. We hypothesize that this different pattern may be due to intrinsic characterization of these two taxa (different number of species, sessile vs. vagile strategies of dispersion, different scales of the assemblages) and to different methods of sampling them.

Heyman, Erik; Gunnarsson, Bengt				BMC Ecology	11		Article No 8	8pp.	1 March 2011	2011	http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1472-6785-11-8.pdf			English	0	17	Background: Experiments from a range of ecosystems have shown that insectivorous birds are important in controlling the populations of their invertebrate prey. Here, we report on a large field experiment testing the hypothesis that management for enhancing recreational values in suburban woodlands affects the intensity of bird predation on canopy-living arthropods. Bird exclosures were used in two types of management (understory clearance and dense understory) at two foraging heights in oak Quercus robur canopies and the experiment was replicated at two sites. Results: The biomass and abundance of arthropods were high on net-enclosed branches but strongly reduced on control branches in both types of management. In woods with dense understory, the effect of bird predation on arthropod abundance was about twice as high as in woods with understory clearance. The effect of bird predation on arthropod biomass was not significantly affected by management. Conclusions: Our data provide experimental evidence to support the idea that bird predation on arthropods can be affected by forest management. We suggest that the mechanism is twofold: reduction of bird abundance and shift of foraging behaviour. In urban woodlands, there may be a management trade-off between enhancing recreational values and promoting bird predation rates on arthropods.

Using fire and grazing to promote bird diversity in highly fragmented landscapes.		Pillsbury, Finn C.; Miller, James R.; Debinski, Diane M.; Engle, David M.				ECOSPHERE	2	3		28, 1-14	Mar 2011	2011				English	0	38	The grasslands of central North America have experienced drastic reductions in extent, removal of historic disturbance patterns, and homogenization of remaining fragments. This has resulted in steep declines for a broad swath of grassland biodiversity. Recent work in relatively extensive grasslands has demonstrated that mimicking historic disturbance patterns using a fire-grazing interaction can increase the abundance and diversity of grassland birds through increased habitat heterogeneity. We examined the efficacy of this management strategy for promoting avian diversity in highly fragmented landscapes, which represent the bulk of remaining grassland bird habitats in the tallgrass prairie region. We quantified the population density of obligate and facultative grassland bird species along transects in 13 experimental research pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of Iowa and Missouri (USA), divided among three treatments: 1) spatially discrete fires and free access by cattle ("patch-burn grazed''), 2) free access by cattle and a single complete burn ("grazed-and-burned''), and 3) a single complete burn with no cattle ("burned-only''). We expected that patch-burn grazing would produce a bird community that overlapped that of the grazed-and-burned and burned-only treatments, because it would provide habitat for species associated with both. However, an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that community structure on pastures managed using patch-burn grazing instead diverged significantly from both of the other treatments. Differences in community structure were most highly correlated with visual obstruction and wooded edge density in the landscape, suggesting bird communities are differentiated not only by their structural habitat requirements, but also by the varying degrees of sensitivity to landscape fragmentation of their component species. The future success of this management scheme for fragmented grasslands hinges on if, after an optimal stocking rate is identified, adequate habitat can be maintained for a diverse bird community, or whether fragmentation will perpetually limit the efficacy of this method in these landscapes.

Pietrek, Alejandro G.; Branch, Lyn C.				Austral Ecology	36	1		109-116	February 2011	2011				English	0	20	Although forest loss is still a problem worldwide, estimated rates of deforestation have declined in the last decade, primarily because of an increase in the area of tree plantations. This leads to the central question of how suitable plantations are for indigenous species. Native plantations are thought to have higher value for biodiversity than plantations of non-native trees; however, not all studies support this view. We assessed occupancy and density of the araucaria tit spinetail (Leptasthenura setaria, Furnariidae), a near threatened species, in the highly endangered araucaria forests of north-eastern Argentina and in araucaria plantations, which comprise 90% of the remaining habitat for this species. All natural forest remnants were occupied by araucaria tit spinetails. Only 85% of the plantations were occupied; however, density was almost threefold higher in plantations compared with natural forests. Our models indicated that stand age was the most important factor in determining occupancy and density of this bird species in plantations. Plantations <10 years old exhibited lower densities than older plantations. This species does not occur in plantations of non-native trees, but our results indicate that native plantations may provide important habitat for the araucaria tit spinetail, particularly given that most native forest has been removed. Restoration of natural remnants and conservation of old, connected plantations may assure the protection of significant populations of spinetails. The role of native araucaria plantations as habitat for other species merits further examination.

Shanahan, Danielle F.; Miller, Craig; Possingham, Hugh P.; Fuller, Richard A.				Biological Conservation	144	2		722-729	February 2011	2011				English	5	100	Landscape restoration through revegetation is being increasingly used in the conservation management of degraded landscapes. To effectively plan restoration programs information is required on how the landscape context of revegetation influences biodiversity gains. Here, we investigate the relative influence of patch area and connectivity on bird species richness and abundance within urban revegetation patches in Brisbane, Australia. We carried out bird surveys at 20 revegetation sites, and used hierarchical partitioning and model selection to test the relative importance of patch area (the area of revegetation including all directly connected remnant vegetation) and landscape connectivity (the vegetated area connected by less than 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m cleared gaps). We controlled for a number of possible confounding variables within the hierarchical partitioning procedure. Both the hierarchical partitioning and model selection procedures indicated that connectivity had an important influence on bird species richness. Patch area in combination with connectivity were important influencing factors on overall bird abundance. We also carried out the hierarchical partitioning procedure for bird abundance data within a range of feeding guilds, yielding results specific to species groups. Overall our data suggest that greater connectivity enhances the habitat area that colonists can arrive from (resulting in greater species richness), whereas increased patch area allows for increased abundance by expanding the habitat available to species already present in a patch. A combined approach where connectivity and overall habitat area is enhanced across the landscape is likely to be necessary to meet long-term conservation objectives.

At the local scale, we assessed each wetland with habitat suitability indices (HSI) for eight wetland-dependent bird species as indicators for four guilds: wading, diving, dabbling, and emergent dependent. We characterized landscapes within 2.5 km of each wetland by measuring the buffer width, road density, connectedness, and anthropogenic land development. The changes in landscape variables over time were determined by comparison of aerial photos taken near the time of wetland construction and near the time of this study. Bird abundance data were poorly correlated with HSI scores but were well described with logistic model sofbuffer width, wetland area, and road density. Our results suggest that landscape variables are better predictors of bird abundance than HSI scores for these guilds in these wetlands.

Stighall, Kristoffer; Roberge, Jean-Michel; Andersson, Kjell; Angelstam, Per				Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research	26	6		576-585	2011	2011				English	2	35	Efficient conservation planning in managed forest landscapes requires knowledge about the location of functional habitat for specialised species. We explored the importance of different variables to predict habitat suitability for the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos Bechstein), a proposed umbrella species in deciduous forest. Specifically, we tested whether biophysical proxy variables indicating management intensity and the occurrence of natural processes constituted a useful complement to traditional remotely sensed data on tree species composition and forest stand age for modelling the woodpecker's habitat. Presence[long dash]absence of the woodpecker during the study period (1986[long dash]2006) in southwestern Sweden was explained by the area of edge habitats (forest bordering water or farmland) and wetland forest, and location relative to the historical marine limit. The number of years with occurrence of the woodpecker in a territory was explained by the area of forest bordering water and wetland forest. Among traditional forest variables, the area of deciduous forest had a strong positive effect on both woodpecker presence[long dash]absence and the number of years with occurrence. The results support the hypothesis that edge habitats and forest types subject to natural processes favouring deciduous trees and dead wood creation are valuable to the woodpecker and should be prioritised in conservation planning.

The combined mapping method with playback was used. During the three years of the study respectively 20, 25 and 29 breeding pairs were discovered in 37 territories of the study area. As a result, the Upper Huczwa River Watershed is the most Important Birds Area for the Syrian Woodpecker population in Poland. The habitat selection of this species was also analysed. It turns out that the Syrian Woodpeckers avoid forests but prefer anthropogenic afforestation. The usefulness of several scattered tree growths during the following seasons and within a year was statistically significant ([chi] 2 = 26.63; df = 12; p < 0.01 and [chi]2 = 26.40; df = 8; p < 0.001, respectively). Woodpeckers particularly preferred orchards and tree alleys (Table 2). In each year of the study, birds were most often found in orchards (on average 51.7-65.0%) but rarely in tree lines, tree alleys and tree groups (on average 18.5%; 14.9%; 8.1%, respectively Fig. 2). In parks and single trees woodpeckers were observed only occasionally (on average 0.3% and 2.6%, respectively, Fig. 2), which were definitely avoided by birds. The Syrian Woodpeckers' habitat preference shows that appropriate protection of this species should focus on conservation of woodlots near human settlements - the most important are orchards and tree alleys as potential feeding and breeding sites.

Emu	111	2		120-131	2011	2011				English	1	28	An essential component of conservation science is repeated surveys over time to monitor species that might be responding to local factors, such as land management, or more broadly to global change. A systematic survey of the avifauna of Cape York Peninsula was conducted in the late 1990s and early 2000s providing an ideal basal dataset for measuring change in the avifauna. A subset (n > 600) of these sites, primarily within savanna landscapes, was selected for re-survey in 2008 to investigate changes in bird communities on Cape York Peninsula. Changes in mean species richness varied across the study area (decreases in 59 grid cells and increases in 43) with no apparent pattern. Significant change in reporting rates was recorded in 30 species. Four sedentary and highly detectable species declined (Bar-shouldered Dove, Brown Treecreeper, Sulphur-crested Cockatoo and Pale-headed Rosella) and five increased (Peaceful Dove, Pheasant Coucal, Weebill, White-throated Honeyeater and Yellow Oriole). Habitat preference for the species that showed change remained relatively stable between the two survey periods. Some species that were recorded in very low numbers in the original survey and are considered to be threatened (Brown Treecreeper, Black-faced Woodswallow) remained in very low numbers or decreased in our survey suggesting that there has been no regional recovery of these species. Long-term monitoring can describe important patterns of species change over time, though in the case of large, highly seasonal environments like the tropical savannas, signals of change may manifest over decades rather than annually.

Nikolov, S.C.; Demerdzhiev, D.A.; Popgeorgiev, G.S.; Plachiyski, D.G.				Animal Biodiversity and Conservation	34	1		11-21	2011	2011				English	3	27	Bird community patterns in sub-Mediterranean pastures: the effects of shrub cover and grazing intensity Shrubs are widely considered a threat to grassland biodiversity. We investigated the effects of shrub cover and grazing intensity on bird communities in sub-Mediterranean pastures in Bulgaria. The point-count method was used on 80 plots in open (< 10% shrub cover) and shrubby (approx. 20% cover) pastures under either intensive or extensive management (grazing intensity) from 2008 to 2009. We recorded a total of 1,956 observations of birds from 53 species. Main environmental gradients accounting for the bird community pattern were related to vegetation succession and land productivity. Bird species richness was higher in shrubby pastures than in open sites, while no effect was found in respect to total bird abundance. Bird species diversity (i.e. H' index) was highest in extensive shrubby pastures. Shrub land specialists were positively affected by shrub cover and extensive management of pastures while grassland and woodland specialists showed no significant response to these factors. We conclude that a small proportion of shrubs within pastures may be beneficial for farmland birds and sustainable management of pastures could be achieved by greater flexibility of national agri-environmental schemes.

MacGregor-Fors, Ian; Schondube, Jorge E.				Basic and Applied Ecology	12	4		372-381	2011	2011				English	3	120	Habitat structure and complexity are two main components determining bird community diversity. Although a wide array of components contribute to the physiognomy of urban habitats, our knowledge of the habitat features that affect bird communities within urban areas is biased to vegetation. In this study, we measured 33 habitat characteristics that describe the spatial distribution of urban components, habitat structure, biological heterogeneity, potential hazards for birds, housing density, and socioeconomic level of three neotropical cities to define the relative role that vegetation and non-vegetation habitat features have on abundant, moderately abundant, and rare bird species. Our results show that bird species richness and abundances are positively related to vegetation cover and human prosperity, and negatively related to highly developed urban areas with intense human activities and high abundance of cats and dogs. We found six urban infrastructure variables related to bird species richness and abundances: (a) number of electric and telephone cables, lighting rods, and building height were positively related to abundant species, (b) electric and telephone poles and building cover were negatively related to moderately abundant species, and (c) lamp poles were negatively related to rare species, while electric and telephone poles were positively related. Our results revealed that abundant bird species were only related to urban infrastructure features (i.e., cables, lightning rods, building height), while moderately abundant and rare species were related to habitat structure and urban-related hazards, showing that life-history traits affect how species respond to urbanization. Based on our study, we suggest some urban management and planning policies, including: the increase of tree and shrub cover throughout cities, allowing shrubs and herbs to grow in areas restricted to pedestrians, controlling homeless dogs and restricting off-leash dogs, and considering the need of homogenizing the ecological quality throughout cities, regardless of socioeconomic boundaries.

Machar, Ivo				Ekologia (Bratislava)	30	1		36-50	2011	2011				English	0	1	The presented article describes the changes in the structure of nesting bird populations in the floodplain forest locality in the model area of the Bird Area Litovelske Pomoravi in the Czech Republic during a period of about 20 years. Possible causes for changes in the structures of nesting bird populations within these floodplain forests and the development of forest geobiocenoses are discussed. These possible causes are based on the comparison of our research data results with older data from these locations. The long-term protection of the mature floodplain forest geobiocenosis in this nature reserve has had impacts which are dearly recognizable in the significant increase in the nesting bird population. This applies especially to those bird communities nesting in tree hollows and in the shrub layer.

Journal of Wildlife Management	75	1		116-125	Jan 2011	2011				English	1	27	Filter strips are strips of herbaceous vegetation planted along agricultural field margins adjacent to streams or wetlands and are designed to intercept sediment, nutrients, and agrichemicals. Roughly 16,000 ha of filter strips have been established in Maryland through the United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. Filter strips often represent the only uncultivated herbaceous areas on farmland in Maryland and therefore may be important habitat for early-successional bird species. Most filter strips in Maryland are planted to either native warm-season grasses or cool-season grasses and range in width from 10.7 m to 91.4 m. From 2004 to 2007 we studied the breeding and wintering bird communities in filter strips adjacent to wooded edges and non-buffered field edges and the effect that grass type and width of filter strips had on bird community composition. We used 5 bird community metrics (total bird density, species richness, scrub-shrub bird density, grassland bird density, and total avian conservation value), species-specific densities, nest densities, and nest survival estimates to assess the habitat value of filter strips for birds. Breeding and wintering bird community metrics were greater in filter strips than in non-buffered field edges but did not differ between cool-season and warm-season grass filter strips. Most breeding bird community metrics were negatively related to the percent cover of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) in >=1 yr. Breeding bird density was greater in narrow (<30 m) compared to wide (>60 m) filter strips. Our results suggest that narrow filter strips adjacent to wooded edges can provide habitat for many bird species but that wide filter strips provide better habitat for grassland birds, particularly obligate grassland species. If bird conservation is an objective, avoid planting orchardgrass in filter strips and reduce or eliminate orchardgrass from filter strips through management practices.

Comer, Christopher E.; Bell, Andrea L.; Oswald, Brian P.; Conway, Warren C.; Burt, D. Brent				American Midland Naturalist	165	1		91-104	Jan 2011	2011				English	2	29	Due to fire suppression and land use changes, Missouri glade habitats have undergone long-term declines in area and function leading to consequent declines in many bird species that rely on these habitats. We examined breeding bird species composition and vegetation community composition on three glade sites undergoing restoration with prescribed tire and compared them to three unburned glade sites and three unburned forest sites. Although we documented subtle changes in vegetation characteristics in response to prescribed fire, important structural characteristics, such as canopy cover (>55% at all study sites) and grass cover (<10% at all study sites) remain outside ranges used to characterize glades. Despite this, bird community structure shifted towards grass-shrubland (glade) birds (e.g., prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), blue-winged warbler (Vermivora pinus), yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens)) in glades that had been managed with prescribed tire. Using canonical correspondence analyses and stepwise forward logistic regression, we found that grass-shrubland (glade) birds were associated with habitat characteristics such as high stem density of small (0-6.3 cm diameter at breast height) trees, greater herbaceous cover, greater rock cover and a more open canopy. However, we did not detect any bird species historically associated with glades, such as Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) or field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) on any study sites but did frequently detect red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceous) on all sites. Short term application of prescribed fire has not yet produced functionally restored glades. Long term applications of prescribed fire, used in conjunction with mechanical and/or chemical removal of woody overstory, are necessary to achieve restoration at these sites.

Lee, Eun-Jae; Lee, Woo-Shin; Son, Seung Hun; Rhim, Shin-Jae				Landscape and Ecological Engineering	7	1		137-143	Jan 2011	2011				English	0	10	We examined differences in bird communities in relation to characteristics of habitat structure in a pine forest, Samcheok, South Korea. An unburned stand, a stand burned 7 years earlier and then naturally restored, and a stand where Japanese red pine Pinus densiflora seedlings were planted after the fire were used for the survey. Habitat structure was dramatically changed by postfire silvicultural practices. Number of stand trees, shrubs, seedlings, snags, and vegetation coverage were significantly different among study stands. We made 1,421 detections of 46 bird species during 23 separate line transect surveys per stand between February 2007 and December 2008. The mean number of observed bird species and individuals, bird species diversity index (H'), and Simpson's diversity index (Ds) were highest in the unburned stand and lowest in the pine seedling stand. There were more species and individuals of forest-dwelling birds in the unburned stand than both burned stands. Canopy and cavity nesters, foliage searchers, bark gleaners, and timber drillers were significantly higher in the unburned stand. In the pine seedling stand, densities of birds that prefer open field and shrub cover were higher. Stand structure was simplified in the pine seedling stand by postfire practices. Because of differences in habitat structure and bird communities, postfire practices in the burned stand should be re-evaluated. Also, management strategies for pine forest after forest fires are needed based on results of long-term experiments.

Stephens, Jaime L.; Alexander, John D.				Forest Ecology and Management	261	1		43-49	Jan 1 2011	2011				English	2	33	Studies in southwest Oregon suggest that riparian areas within mixed-conifer forests historically burned with frequencies and intensities similar to upland areas and that fire played an important role in maintaining both of these ecosystems. Currently, most fuel reduction projects do not include riparian, due to the perception that these riparian areas are negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbance. However, there is very little information on the ecological consequences of including riparian areas in fuel reduction projects. We compared the effects of non-commercial thin and handpile treatments followed by prescribed burns in riparian areas of intermittent and perennial streams that were treated to the streamside (unbuffered), to the typical prescription in which sites were treated only in the adjacent upland (buffered). Unbuffered fuel reduction treatments have the potential to affect bird density and reproductive success differently than buffered treatments by altering (1) available nest habitat, (2) predator and nest parasite abundance, and (3) food availability in riparian areas. This study assessed whether unbuffered fuel reduction treatments yielded similar bird response as buffered treatments by quantifying differences in density and reproductive success of five bird species, vegetation structure, the frequency of occurrence of predators and a nest parasite, and arthropod biomass. Density was greater for the shrub and tree-nesting Pacific-slope Flycatcher in buffered streams post treatment. Reproductive success showed a minimal, near-term effect for the shrub-nesting Black-headed Grosbeak. For potential causal factors, we found differences between buffered and unbuffered streams only for available nest habitat in the upper-ground strata and frequency of occurrence of raptors. Overall, results suggest that fuel reduction in riparian areas as compared with typical upland treatments with buffers had a small effect on bird density and a near-term effect on reproductive success. Additional study of fuel reduction in riparian areas is warranted because of its effectiveness in reducing the risk of unnaturally severe wildfire and, correspondingly, the potential benefit to bird communities over the long-term.

Hoffman, Joerg				Acta Ornithoecologica	7	1-2		3-14	2011	2011				German	0	0	Both the suspension of the requirement to set aside 10% of arable land from 2007 and the extended targets for the production of bio-energy led to sharp decline in fallow land and an increase in maize production in the agricultural areas of Germany. Against this background, in 2008 field studies on the role of self greened fallows and maize fields for birds that are considered indicators species for biodiversity in agricultural areas was conducted. In seven regions dominated by maize fields and four regions dominated by fallows breeding birds and feeding guests were monitored in 2008 according to the territory mapping method. Each region was 100 ha large. The species diversity and the mean number of species, the mean abundance sum of all species and the abundance of indicator species were identified per 100 ha area. Furthermore, the habitat functions of guest birds on the example of prey searching raptors were analysed The investigations showed that self greened fallows show a particularly high habitat value based on the criteria species diversity and territory density of the indicator bird species. The abundances of most open land bird species, especially the Skylark, Corn bunting and Whinchat showed significantly higher values. Fallows have a significantly higher habitat function for prey searching raptors particularly in March, May and June. Population assessment of the farmland birds for Whinchat and Corn bunting showed a clear decline of the population as the result of the loss of fellows from 2007 to 2008 in landscapes which were dominated by arable land use. A moderate decrease was observed for the Skylark and slight increase for the Yellow wagtail. To avoid a decline of bird populations in agricultural regions land management and conservation measures were suggested.

ECOLOGIE DU PHRAGMITE AQUATIQUE ACROCEPHALUS PALUDICOLA SUR DEUX SITES DE HALTE MAJEURS PENDANT LE PASSAGE POSTNUPTIAL DANS L'OUEST DE LA FRANCE.	Provost, Pascal; Bargain, Bruno; Cheveau, Pierre				Alauda	79	1		53-63	2011	2011				French	0	1	Ecological observations on Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola at two major staging areas on postnuptial in western France. The Aquatic warbler breeds in fen mires and similarly structured habitats. It was formerly an abundant breeding bird throughout Central and Eastern Europe. Since 1990 the species lost most of its breeding range west of the Polish-German border due to large-scale habitat destruction and became the only globally threatened songbird of the European mainland with a world population of only 10,20014,200 singing males. On postnuptial migration the northern and Atlantic coasts of France host the largest numbers of Aquatic Warblers in West Europe. In several years many birds have been mist-netted, mainly in August. A few radio-tracked birds at two sites (Seine Estuary and Baie d'Audierne in Brittany) provided data on home range and habitats. The availability of wet grassland habitats (less than 1 m high) close to reedbeds near open waters appears to be a key habitat to ensure the rapid and efficient refuelling of Aquatic Warblers during their postnuptial migration on the western coast of France. This study allowed to define some recommendations to maintain or restore suitable habitats for the species during its postnuptial stopovers.

Wells, Konstans; Boehm, Stefan M.; Boch, Steffen; Fischer, Markus; Kalko, Elisabeth K. V.				Basic and Applied Ecology	12	2		97-106	2011	2011				English	3	34	Forest management practices and forest fragmentation are commonly recognised as factors influencing species distribution and diversity, but it remains largely unknown how species turnover and fluctuations across years might affect generalisations from short-term predictions. There is also much uncertainty about how compositional heterogeneity within forests, through their partitioning into differently managed stands, influences species occurrence and diversity. We aimed to investigate bird species richness in different forest stands in a heterogeneous landscape and asked whether short-term studies commonly used are sufficient to describe diversity-habitat relationships. Breeding birds were monitored in 50 stands of differing forest types and management regimes in 2008 and 2009 in the heterogeneous forest production landscape of the Schwabische Alb in SW Germany. Based on a database of 25 and 21 species observed in 2008 and 2009, respectively, we estimated local species richness and species turnover with Bayesian hierarchical multi-species occupancy models to account for imperfect detection. A suite of forest attributes at stand level (from local field inventories) and landscape level, between 100 and 2000 m in extent, which were derived from forest management maps, were screened for their explanatory power regarding bird species richness. The most meaningful variables were included in a final set of models to account for effects of forest attributes on species occurrence and resulting gradients in species richness and turnover. Bird species richness in 2008 was mostly explained by stand composition heterogeneity over a distance of 800 m around sample locations, whereas in 2009 local stand features like stand succession type and stand age mostly explained species richness. Species turnover was significantly higher in young forest stands of thicket and pole-wood stages compared with old forest stands of timber stages. Variable multi-scale impacts of forest attributes on local species richness and turnover, together with year-to-year fluctuations in the regional species pool, emphasise that the relative importance of local versus landscape-scale factors in determining bird species richness may vary across years. Long-term and multiple-scale investigations that take structural and compositional forest heterogeneity into account are necessary for improved prediction of species[long dash]habitat relationships.

Research expeditions in the municipality of Cambara do Sul were undertaken in August 2005 and August 2006 to evaluate richness, abundance and discuss the variations in the composition of the avifauna of the effects of fire in areas of the grasslands with and without fire controlled management. Two treatments were determined, fire and control, with four replicas of four hectares in size each. At each replica two parallel transects of 100 meters of extension were established. All birds in the transections and within a lateral distance of 50 meters were identified and quantified. We recorded 790 individuals from 32 bird species. Higher richness and abundance were registered in the fire treatment, in sampling periods after burning. The results showed that the use of fire could assist in the conservation of a fraction of bird community. The use of management practices such as cattle raising and burning of grasslands could help reducing the conversion of grassland into silviculture areas. Thus, controlled management practices, as proposed here, can contribute to the conservation of grassland areas not included in no take protected areas.

Saxicolous and arboreal species were less abundant in grassy woodland regrowth, whereas Bassian and fossorial species responded positively to forest regrowth (and tree plantings). Regrowth with rock habitat had higher reptile richness, and more old growth-associated taxa, than regrowth without rock habitat. Thus, the presence of saxicolous habitat can reduce the time required for regrowth to attain a climax community structure and elements of old growth fauna. However, in the absence of vegetation management, secondary vegetation can reduce habitat suitability for a broad range of reptiles. In agricultural landscapes historically supporting savannah-like vegetation, habitat manipulation may be necessary to maintain reptile diversity. Furthermore, tree plantings in temperate agricultural landscapes should aim to restore historical vegetation composition and structure, thereby reflecting the habitat requirements of extant species and facilitating evolutionary processes. In grassy woodland ecosystems, this may involve heterogeneous plantings which emulate natural levels of canopy cover and solar penetration. Maintaining biodiversity in agricultural landscapes will therefore involve managing trade-offs to preserve areas of dense regeneration for regrowth-dependant fauna, while at the same time, creating open-canopy environments to enhance habitat for ectothermic organisms.

Orzel przedni Aquila chrysaetos w polskiej czesci Karpat w latach 2008-2011.	Stoj, Marian; Kozik, Boguslaw; Kwarciany, Bartosz				Chronmy Przyrode Ojczysta	67	6		483-493	listopad-grudzien 2011	2011				Polish	0	1	The paper summarizes the results of monitoring of the golden eagle carried out in the Polish part of the Carpathians (ca. 8860 km2) in 2008-2011. Many small populations of the golden eagle in Europe are threatened with extinction. Also in Poland, it is included among high risk species, highly threatened with extinction. In 1993-1996 the occurrence of 21-24 pairs was confirmed and in the subsequent years (1997-2007), the number of breeding pairs was assessed at 29-32. In 2008-2011, the presence of 27 territorial pairs was confirmed in the studied area, including 25 pairs with a known nest. Seven pairs were nesting in the Sanocko-Turczanskie Mts, six pairs in the Western Bieszczady Mts and six pairs in Beskid Niski (Mts), two pairs in Gorce (Mts), and one pair in Beskid S4decki (Mts), the Spisko-Gubalowski Foothills, Pieniny (Mts) and the Tatras. Single pairs without a known nest were also observed in Beskid Zywiecki (Mts) and Beskid Wyspowy (Mts). The report on the monitoring results includes also four pairs from the borderland home ranges, which also made nests on the other side of the border - 2 pairs in Ukraine (Bieszczady Mts, Sanocko-Turczanskie Mts) and 2 pairs in Slovakia (Beskid Sadecki Mts, Pieniny Mts). Nearly half of the golden eagle population occurs in the Eastern Carpathians, with the density of 0.52 pair/100 km2. Golden eagles in the Polish Carpathians prefer fir and fir-beech forest stands located in the vicinity of extensive deforested and semi-open lands. They nest in areas located near the summit, between 400 and 1450 m asl., in small ground depressions sheltered from wind, but usually with a good view over the surroundings. Altogether, 45 nests were inspected in 25 home ranges, including 41 nests (91.1%) on a fir tree Abies alba, and one nest (2.2%) on the European black pine Pinus nigra, one nest (2.2%) on larch Larix decidua, one nest (2.2%) on beech Fagus sylvatica, and one nest (2.2%) on the rock. The average height of a nesting tree was 35 m (range 21-41 m, N= 38), and its average perimeter (measured at 1.3 m) - 258 cm (range 147-380 cm, N = 38). On average a nest was placed 25 m (range 11-35 m, N = 38) above the ground. The outer diameter of nests was ca. 132 cm (range 110-200 cm, N = 35), the inner diameter was 53 cm (range 45-80 cm, N = 35), the height of a nest 80 cm (range 30-200 cm, N = 35), a the depth of a nesting basin 10 cm (range 8-15 cm, N = 16). Individual pairs had from 1 to 5 nests in their home ranges. During four monitored seasons (2008-2011), 63% (N = 54 clutches) of incubations were successful, altogether 37 young birds left their nests during that time. The average number of nestlings per breeding pair was 0.68, and 1.08 per pair with a successful incubation. High nesting success (78.6 and 76.5%) was recorded in 2008 and 2011, and low nesting success in 2010 - when only 3 nestlings per 11 breeding pairs left a nest (27.3%). Twenty cases of complete clutch losses were recorded. Among those with a known cause, the following were confirmed: water soaking and hypothermia of nestlings (2 cases), abandonment of nests during incubation of eggs as a result of forest works (2 cases), predation (1 case), sliding down of a nest during incubation of eggs (1 case), suspected theft of eggs by man (1 case), poisoning of a breeding pair (1 case). The nesting success in 2008-2011 (on average 63%) was lower than the result in 1993-1996 (on average 68%), and slightly higher than the nesting success (62.3%) in 1997-2007. After accession of Poland to the EU, owing to direct subsidies for farmers and agri-environmental programmes, actions aiming at the reduction of succession have been undertaken, and extensive farming has been resumed, which gives hope for the long-term preservation of areas that are hunting grounds of the golden eagle.

Szabo, Judit K.; Vesk, Peter A.; Baxter, Peter W.J.; Possingham, Hugh P.				Emu	111	1		59-70	2011	2011				English	3	32	Approximately 90% of the original woodlands of the Mount Lofty Ranges of South Australia has been cleared, modified or fragmented, most severely in the last 60 years, and affecting the avifauna dependent on native vegetation. This study identifies which woodland-dependent species are still declining in two different habitats, Pink Gum-Blue Gum woodland and Stringybark woodland. Weanalyse the Mount Lofty Ranges Woodland Bird Long-Term Monitoring Dataset for 1999-2007, to look for changes in abundance of 59 species. Weuse logistic regression of prevalence on lists in a Bayesian framework, and List Length Analysis to control for variation in detectability. Compared with Reporting Rate Analysis, a more traditional approach, List Length Analysis provides tighter confidence intervals by accounting for changing detectability. Several common species were declining significantly. Increasers were generally large-bodied generalists. Many birds have already disappeared from this modified and naturally isolated woodland island, and our results suggest that more specialist insectivores are likely to follow. The Mount Lofty Ranges can be regarded as a 'canary landscape' for temperate woodlands elsewhere in Australia-without immediate action their bird communities are likely to follow the trajectory of the Mount Lofty Ranges avifauna. Alternatively, with extensive habitat restoration and management, we could avoid paying the extinction debt.

Brazill-Boast, James; Dessmann, Josephine K.; Davies, Gareth T.O.; Pryke, Sarah R.; Griffith, Simon C.				Emu	111	4		304-311	2011	2011				English	1	23	The Gouldian Finch (Erythrura gouldiae) has experienced significant decline in population and the extent of its range over the past 40 years, which has generally been attributed to the availability of suitable foraging habitat. Less research, however, has investigated the suitability or availability of breeding habitat of the species. Gouldian Finches are obligate cavity nesters, and a recent study has shown that they select nest-sites non-randomly based on structural characteristics of the cavity. Here we investigated the relative effects of different environmental factors on the spatial distribution of Gouldian Finch nests at two different scales. At the broader, landscape scale (over [approximately]60 km2), the strongest predictor of nesting density at a site was the abundance of suitable nest-sites. At the finer scale ([approximately]1 km2), no single factor explained the variation in location of nest-sites. Gouldian Finches require areas of habitat characterised by high densities of suitable nest-sites (tree-cavities). Within these patches, individuals are potentially selecting nest-sites based on the morphometry of cavities rather than landscape features such as topography, vegetation or proximity to water. Our findings should be integrated with studies of feeding and habitat requirements in the non-breeding season, with the aim of constructing holistic and predictive habitat-suitability models for this endangered species.

Clavero, Miguel; Brotons, Lluis; Herrando, Sergi				Journal of Animal Ecology	80	1		128-136	Jan 2011	2011				English	4	37	1. Although niche theory predicts that disturbance should favour generalist species, the community-level implications of this pattern have been sparsely analysed. Here, we test the hypothesis that disturbance favours generalist species within communities, analysing effects of wildfires in bird communities in a Mediterranean climate area as a case study. 2. We use bird occurrence data in more than 500 1 x 1 km squares forming a gradient running from forest to completely burnt areas. The level of specialization of bird communities was estimated by means of three complementary species specialization indices, calculated for different landscape gradients and averaged at the community level (i.e. 1 x 1 km squares), and mean species rarity. 3. We also calculated mean habitat preferences along landscape gradients, as well as an index of conservation value and total species richness. 4. Different estimators of bird community specialization varied in contrasting fashion along the wildfire disturbance gradient, and thus we conclude that it is not justified to expect unique community responses to the sharp variations in habitat characteristics brought by wildfire disturbances. 5. Burnt areas tended to have rarer and urban-avoider bird species, whereas unburnt forests tended to have larger proportions of forest specialist species. 6. The mean conservation value of communities clearly increased towards the burnt extreme of the wildfire disturbance gradient, while this had a negligible effect on species richness. 7. Wildfires seem to play an important role for the maintenance of open-habitat, urban-avoider bird populations in Mediterranean landscapes and also to benefit a set of bird species of unfavourable European conservation status. 8. In this context, it cannot be unambiguously concluded that fire disturbance, even in a context in which fires are greatly favoured by human-related activities, leads to more functionally simplified communities dominated by generalist species.

The results of a five-year (2003[long dash]2007) study of bird species, numbers of birds, and their diversities in the naturally occurring (unburned) oak savannas of the region are reported in this paper. Effects of cool-season and warm-season prescribed burning treatments and a wildfire on bird species and numbers of birds sighted on the same study area after these burning events are also presented. These effects were difficult to isolate, however, because of the large variability in the tallies of bird species and numbers of birds obtained throughout the study.

Jokimaki, Jukka; Solonen, Tapio				Ornis Fennica	88	2		57-70	2011	2011				English	1	22	Conservation areas are important for many species associated with old forests, but most individuals still occur in commercially-used forest landscapes. We conducted three-visit breeding bird surveys in a total of 37 study squares of 1 km2, and used National Forest Inventory data to evaluate habitat associations of birds linked with old forests in three geographical regions: southern, eastern and northern Finland. All study squares were located within managed forests. Out of the total of 23 pre-selected old-forest species, 12 were recorded in the study squares of all three study regions; the number of species varied between 16 and 21 among the regions. The total abundance did not significantly vary among the regions, but the abundances of many single species varied significantly among the regions. Forest-patch size was the single most important factor, positively affecting the abundance of most of the species considered. Development class affected most species in the south and east, and species associated with mature and old forest stands in general. Tree height and stand age were included into the models more often than tree species and diameter. In general, forest patch size, developmental class, age and tree height were among the most important factors in explaining the abundance of old-forest bird species in commercially-used forests. These stand characteristics appeared particularly important for resident species and cavity nesters. Our results indicate that the responses of old-forest bird species to environmental variation in managed, forested landscapes are individualistic, and different factors may affect them in different regions. Variables included in the patch-level forest-inventory data well explained abundance variation of species associated with old forests. Our results underscore the importance of integrating national forest-inventory and bird-survey data to obtain information about species habitat requirements and forest-sector related information about the effects of forestry on birds.

Pons, Pere				Revista Catalana d'Ornitologia	27			1-9	2011	2011				English	0	1	High mountain rangelands host important populations of threatened bird species, but can be affected by extensive changes in land use. I studied the breeding bird community of two shrubland plots at 1,850[long dash]2,100 m a.s.l. in the Pyrenees. Breeding territories were mapped for four years, before and after the prescribed burning, the aim of which was to increase the grazing value of the study area. The most abundant species (reaching >[long dash]3 breeding pairs/10 ha in at least one plot and one year) were Dunnock Prunella modularis, Dartford Warbler Sylvia undata, Stonechat Saxicola torquatus, Rock Bunting Emberiza cia and Ortolan Bunting E. hortulana. The open-shrubland plot contained a similar number of breeding species (10 vs. 9), but a lower overall density (23 vs. 28 breeding pairs/10 ha) than the dense-shrubland plot. Most breeding species also occurred in winter. After fire, the number of bird species, overall density and conservation value (an index that takes into account all species' densities and their categories of conservation concern in Europe) decreased, but tended to recover afterwards. These results may help understand the composition and dynamics of bird assemblages in managed mountain areas.

The structure understood in such a way is dynamic and changes with the age of a forest stand and reaches its height far after the age of cutting. Changes in the structure seem to be the key element responsible for occurrence of specialized bird species. In respect of structure development one can divide Pine stands into four groups: young (10-80 years old), maturing (81-120 years old), mature (121-160 years old) and aging (above 161 years old). Promotion of a complex structure characteristic for old forests can be the basis for actions of forest practice for birds' protection.

Since it is able to occupy various types of habitats we examined its habitat preference, home range size and survival rate in succession stages of forest growths. In the Krusne hory Mts. (western Bohemia, Czech Republic), 12 Black Grouse males were trapped and monitored by radio telemetry. Open young forest with ericaceous vegetation was the most preferred habitat. However, the survival rate of Black Grouse was lower than that found in other studies. Mammalian predators were responsible for most of the losses of the monitored birds. The progressive succession of young forests seems to be the main factor causing the significant Black Grouse population decline in our study area, since rich ground vegetation and young trees with branches hanging down to the ground which provide suitable food resources and hiding places for the birds, disappear with forest maturation. Protection and creation of suitable habitats with slow succession rates, such as moorlands and peat bogs, should thus be a significant point of the Black Grouse action plan.

Neumann, Helge; Ruf, Martin				Vogelwelt	132	1		35-44	2011	2011				German	0	5	Year-round grazing systems characterised by low stocking rates and abandonment of fertilisation and mechanical operations have been established as a cost-effective and practicable tool for conservation and development of open landscapes in Germany. In the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein several of these nature conservation areas feature man-made open water bodies, which were created to especially support amphibian populations. As the effects of this special type of nature conservation areas ("wild pastures") on breeding bird communities have not been systematically analysed so far, territory mapping of breeding birds was carried out on ten year-round grazing areas in 2009. In order to analyse the success of nature conservation measures, every "wild pasture" was compared with a related area, which was managed similar to the former land use of the conservation sites (conventionally used arable land and grassland). Total abundance of breeding pairs and species diversity (species density, Shannon index) was significantly higher on "wild pastures" compared to the reference areas. Species density as well as total abundance of threatened bird species also achieved higher values in the year-round grazing areas. Both species and breeding bird density of ground nesting bird species as well as of species on the farmland bird index were significantly higher on "wild pastures". Significant effects on the abundance of single bird species could be detected for Tree Pipit Anthus trivialis and Skylark Alauda arvensis, which both reached higher abundances in the nature conservation areas. As expected, open water bodies, which existed in 70% of the "wild pastures" (ponds, shallow waters), enhanced species diversity dependent on the extent of waters, whereas mainly common bird species were registered at the waterbodies. Results indicate that the establishment of "wild pastures" is well suited for realisation of bird protection and biodiversity targets in agricultural landscapes.

However, bird damage is unpredictable and pest-bird movements and abundance patterns are poorly understood. Aims. To assess whether habitat management is likely to be an effective approach for controlling two pest-bird species (house sparrow, Passer domesticus, and greenfinch, Carduelis chloris) in New Zealand's arable landscape. Methods. Breeding-and winter-bird and habitat surveys were carried out over a 3-year period (2003-05) on 19 1-km x 1-km squares with arable crops on the Canterbury Plains, New Zealand. Bird abundance and/or distribution were analysed with respect to both temporal and spatial (crop-and boundary-habitat composition) variables. Results. Estimated breeding-season densities for house sparrow were higher but more stable than those for greenfinch (which increased by 70% over a 3-year period), and for individual farms were more predictable across years than were winter densities. Boundary habitat was the best predictor of bird densities and distribution in the breeding season; features associated with enhanced seed abundance or access were important in the winter. However, habitat composition alone could not account for temporal and spatial variation in bird densities on farms. Conclusions. Either habitat management or the reduction of key seed resources could potentially control pest-bird numbers. However, habitat management is likely to have adverse consequences for other important functions (such as the shelter and biodiversity benefits of shelterbelts), and any form of bird control applied at the farm scale is unlikely to be effective. Implications. To make control actions both effective and economically viable, a coordinated program involving multiple farms is likely to be needed. We recommend investigating the effectiveness of an experimental manipulation of key food resources at the landscape scale.

A case study from the monsoonal tropics of northern Australia.		Gould, Susan F.				Wildlife Research	38	6		482-490	2011	2011				English	0	64	Context. Rehabilitation is increasingly being promoted as a strategy for minimising and even reversing biodiversity loss. Many rehabilitation strategies that aim to provide habitat focus entirely on establishing vegetation. Successful vegetation establishment, however, does not necessarily provide habitat that is ecologically equivalent to that removed by vegetation clearing. Quantitative understanding of faunal responses to rehabilitation is required if rehabilitation techniques are to be refined and deliver desired biodiversity outcomes. Aims. I aimed to assess the extent to which post-mining rehabilitation restores bird habitat equivalent to that removed in the mining process on the Weipa bauxite plateau. Methods. The composition, abundance and richness of bird assemblages were compared between native forest sites and a 23-year chronosequence of post-mining rehabilitation sites. Native forest sites were made up of three Weipa bauxite plateau land units, including the land unit that represents pre-mining native forest, and two land units that are considered to be potential analogues for the post-mining landscape. Key results. Bird abundance and bird species richness increased with rehabilitation age. Bird species richness in the two oldest age classes of mine rehabilitation was similar to values obtained from pre-mining native forest and post-mining landscape analogue sites. The composition of bird assemblages, however, was significantly different. Of all the bird species observed, 25% occurred exclusively in native forest sites, 19% occurred exclusively in mine-rehabilitation sites, and the remaining 56% were recorded in both native forest and mine-rehabilitation sites. Site bird-detection rates were significantly related to site vegetation structure, with inter-specific differences in bird response. Conclusions. Post-mining rehabilitation at Weipa has partially made up for the loss of habitat caused by clearing for mining. Twenty-three years after rehabilitation commenced, however, a clear residual impact on biodiversity remains, with a third of native forest birds absent from mine rehabilitation, including several native forest specialists. Implications. Rehabilitation can partially make up for biodiversity losses caused by the initial loss of habitat. There is no evidence, however, that rehabilitation can achieve 'no net loss'. Reliance on rehabilitation to achieve conservation outcomes does not address the fact that many fauna species require resources that are found only in mature forest.

Robertson, Bruce A.; Hutto, Richard L.; Fontaine, Joseph J.				Journal of Field Ornithology	81	4		420-429	Dec 2010	2010				English	0	14	The use of aural surveys to estimate population parameters is widespread in avian studies. Despite efforts to increase the efficacy of this method, the potential for ecological context to bias population estimates remains largely unexplored. For example, food availability and nest predation risk can influence singing activity independent of density and, therefore, may bias aural estimates where these ecological factors vary systematically among habitats or other categories of ecological interest. We used a natural fire event in a mixed-conifer forest that experienced variation in fire severity (low, intermediate, and high) to determine if aural surveys produce accurate density estimates of Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) independent of ecological context. During the first 2-yr postfire, we censused junco populations in each burn type with intensive spot-mapping and nest searching, locating 168 nests. Simultaneously, we conducted fixed-radius point-count surveys and estimated food availability and nest predation risk in each burn type to test whether ecological context may influence aural detection probability independent of actual density. We found no difference in nesting densities among patches burned at different severity. Arthropod food availability was inversely related to fire severity during the first postfire breeding season, but increased to higher levels across all severities during the second. In both years, aural detections were significantly greater in intermediate severity patches that consistently represented the habitat with the lowest nest predation risk. These results suggest that nest predation risk may significantly bias aural estimates of avian populations. Although traditional aural survey methods such as the Breeding Bird Survey measure habitat attributes, our findings highlight the difficulty in assessing relevant covariates in estimates of avian population. Future research must consider the potential for nest predation and other ecological factors to drive interannual or interhabitat variation in avian population estimates independent of true changes in population size.

Die Bedeutung der Traubenkirschen-Hafer-Blattlaus Rhopalosiphurn padi (L., 1758) and der Traubenkirsche Prunus padus L., 1753 fuer Vogel.	von Blotzheim, Glutz				Anzeiger des Vereins Thueringer Ornithologen	7	1		29-48	Dezember 2010	2010				German	0	1	The fundatrices (first generation of the host alternating bird cherry-oat aphids) hatch from the beginning up to the middle of March on its primary host Prunus padus and start to reproduce by the middle of April. In this generation there are only few alatae. These may leave bird cherry and fly to cereals in the beginning of May. At that time, the remaining aphids produce the last spring generation of Rhopalosiphum padi on the primary host. The majority of the then present aphids is alate and migrates to various grasses in June. By the end of August and in September alate gynoparae arrive on bird cherry and produce oviparae. The males arrival coincides with the maturation of the first oviparae. Mating takes place and the oviparae lay their eggs mainly on the current year's twigs around the bases of the buds. The last winter eggs are laid in the first half of November, and the remaining aphids die as soon as night temperature falls to the freezing point. During some 25 autumns we noted 36 species of birds feeding on these aphids (no disturbance by mist-netting). The avian predator species are summarized in table 1. Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla and Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita are the most numerous and most intensively feeding predators followed by Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, Great Tit Parus major and Blue Tit Parus caeruleus. The attractiveness of R. padi as bird food is underlined by the mass consumption by these morphologically very different species, as well as by two- respectively four-day-stopovers of in our region extremely rare vagrants as Subalpine Warbler Sylvia cantillans and Yellow-browed Warbler Phylloscopus inornatus. The Sylvia species feed alternatively on aphids and fruits. For the Leaf warblers Phylloscopus and the Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus aphids and some other insects can be the main food during autumn migration. Feeding on aphids begins at a very low level during the second half of August, intensifies in mid September, reaches in Sempach and Schwyz its peak from 23 September to 7 October in Garden Warbler Sylvia borin, Blackcap and Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, from 3 to 22 October in Chiffchaff, tits Parus sp. and Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs and declines rapidly as soon as night temperature falls under 2 [degrees]C in late October or at the beginning of November. During the peak of harvesting up to 13 individual birds of 7 to 8 different species may gather simultaneously in one bird cherry bush, or at least 11 to 20 Chiffchaffs may be present in bird cherry and nearby other bushes and trees (these figures may show the carrying capacity of one bush or one small clump of nearby planted bird cherry bushes). In 2003 a Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus stayed for at least 23 days in our garden just to feed on this aphid. In this autumn we estimated at least 99 540 presumed prey captures (pecks) by the one Reed Warbler, at least 50240 pecks by Blackcaps and more than 1000000 pecks by Chiffchaffs. On 4th October 2009 during 9 hours and 16 minutes a single Lesser Whitethroat Sylvia curruca eat probably some 68'000 Rhopalosiphum padi. In autumn 2003 the total harvest on only two bird cherry bushes may be estimated at 1.5 to 3 million aphids during this autumn, representing 373-747 g or 2 512-5 024 Id (attempt to give a very rough idea of the amount of aphids eaten by birds and to correct a calculation mistake by GLUTZ von BLOTZHEUM 2004). Feeding superabundant aphids is easy (joining behaviour, short search), efficient (no handling time, high digestibility) and of high reward in carbohydrates - an important complement to berries and fruits and probably a remunerative method to assess the daily food requirements. In April and May bird cherry-oat aphids are eaten by the same bird species but at a lesser amount. Bird cherry is an attractive, flowering wild bush or tree. It offers a variety of insects early in spring, fruits or seeds in advance of most other bushes and trees in early summer, and a high amount of aphids favourable for refuelling autumn migrants. In addition the honeydew, excreted by aphids, attracts a number of insects. The striking resource-use strategies of many bird species (high density, long-lasting residency-time and high switching rate of definite in- terpatch movements) should be reason enough to plant bird cherry more often in parks and gardens and to encourage these bushes during the maintenance of hedges and woodland edges.	von Blotzheim, Glutz; Herrengasse 56, CH-6430 Schwyz, Switzerland, Switzerland.	ugvb@bluewin.ch					Zoology; Developmental Biology; Parasitology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Nutrition & Dietetics; Entomology; Behavioral Sciences	0940-4708		Conservation; Conservation measures; Nutrition; Diet; Prey; Energy budget; Life cycle and development; Behaviour; Parasites diseases and disorders; Hosts; Ecology; Predators; Habitat; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe	Aphidoidea [Life cycle and development /  / avian predator relationships] [Plant hosts / Prunus padus / ] [Population dynamics / Population phenology / ] [Germany / Sempach & Schwyz / ].

Little is known about the status of the African White-backed Vulture Gyps africanus in Kenya, but ongoing studies indicate that its population has declined over the last two decades. A total of 32 African White-backed Vulture nests were monitored in the Masai Mara National Reserve over a five-year period between 2003 and 2007. Mean nesting success was 59%, which is comparable to that of populations from southern Africa. Nearest neighbour distances were significantly closer in wooded habitats ('trees and shrubs savanna') than in more open grassland habitats ('open low shrubs'). Based on nearest neighbour distances, the estimated total breeding population within the Masai Mara National Reserve is 1 106 pairs, a figure that may be an overestimate and requires ground-truthing. Collecting baseline data on numbers of breeding pairs and regular nest monitoring are essential in order to assess the impact of various threats to vultures in Kenya, which include growing threats (elephant-mediated habitat disturbance and fire) as well as emerging threats (such as poisoning with the carbamate-based pesticide FuradanTM).

Cockle, Kristina L.; Martin, Kathy; Drever, Mark C.				Biological Conservation	143	11		2851-2857	Nov 2010	2010				English	9	57	Tree cavities are proposed to limit populations and structure communities of cavity-nesting birds. Although the greatest diversity of cavity-nesting birds is found in tropical and subtropical moist forests, little is known about how tropical logging affects the abundance of cavities or cavity-nesting birds. We compared the abundance of cavities and cavity nests between primary and selectively-logged subtropical moist Atlantic forest in Argentina, and conducted the first before-after controlled nest-box addition experiment to determine whether nest sites limit the breeding density of cavity-nesting birds in tropical or subtropical moist forest. Visual inspection of 86 cavities identified through ground-surveys revealed that only 19% were suitable for nesting birds, suggesting that cavity abundance may be overestimated in the literature on tropical forests. Suitable cavities were found in fewer than 1% of 1156 trees <60 cm dbh but 20% of 20 trees >100 cm dbh. Logged forest had half the basal area of primary forest, one third the density of large trees, nine times fewer cavities suitable for nesting birds, and 17 times fewer active nests. When we added nest boxes, nesting density increased on treatment plots but not on control plots in both logged and primary forest, suggesting that cavity supply can limit nest density even in relatively undisturbed forest. This is the first experiment to show how reduced cavity supply in logged tropical forest can limit breeding density of cavity-nesting birds. International initiatives such as forest certification should promote tropical timber management strategies that conserve large live cavity-bearing trees. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Grant, Todd A.; Madden, Elizabeth M.; Shaffer, Terry L.; Dockens, Johnida S.				Journal of Wildlife Management	74	8		1841-1851	Nov 2010	2010				English	1	54	Prescribed fire is used widely to manage grasslands on National Wildlife Refuges and other public lands in the northern Great Plains, but its effects on habitat use or production of wildlife in the region are poorly understood. During 1998-2003, we used point counts to examine effects of prescribed fire on vegetation and passerines in a mixed-grass prairie complex in north-central North Dakota, USA (n 5 7 units, each 40-70 ha). Vegetation structure and, to a lesser extent, plant community composition varied with year of study (likely related to changes in annual precipitation) and with number of growing seasons since fire. Fire altered plant structure, especially the amount of residual vegetation, which in turn influenced bird species richness and abundance. The number of indicated pairs for sedge wren (Cistothorus platensis), clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), Le Conte's sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) were lowest during the first postfire growing season but generally increased and stabilized within 2-3 postfire growing seasons. Our results support the premise that grassland passerines are well-adapted to frequent, periodic fires, generally corresponding to those occurring prior to Euro-American settlement of the region. Prescribed fire is important for reducing tree and shrub invasion, restoring biological integrity of plant communities, and maintaining or enhancing populations of grassland-dependent bird species. Managers in the northern mixed-grass prairie region should not be overly concerned about reductions in bird abundances that are limited mostly to the first growing season after fire.

Garbach, Kelly; Martinez-Salinas, Alejandra; DeClerck, Fabrice				Mesoamericana	14	3		53-66	Noviembre 2010	2010				English	0	4	Adept management may help assure the capacity of agricultural lands to contribute to biodiversity conservation. However, we have limited understanding of how management of different elements within designated corridor areas influences resource use among wildlife and contributes to overall conservation value. This study explores how management of live fences within the Volcanica Central-Talamanca Biological Corridor influences bird diversity and resource use. Bird species visiting live fences were recorded for three management treatments: multistrata live fences (dominated by mature, un-pruned trees); simple live fences (dominated by immature trees, pruned regularly), and control (post-and-wire fences). Seventy-four resident and migratory bird species were observed across treatments. Species richness was highest in multistrata fences (28.67 [plus or minus] 3.98, mean [plus or minus] 1 SD) intermediate in simple fences (16.20 [plus or minus] 2.59), and lowest in post-wirefences (9.00 [plus or minus] 2.94). However>=90% of migratory species and species that frequent forest patches and agroforestry plantations at the study site were observed in multistrata fences. In-fence behavior (perching, foraging, reproductive activity) was recorded for individuals actively using fences. Correspondence analysis showed that both foraging and reproductive behavior were more frequently associated with multistrata fences than simple or control fences. Live fences appear to provide important resources within a biological corridor. However, management that favors height and structural complexity, which characterize multistrata fences, enhance corridor use among a diverse range of bird species and may provide greater support for foraging and reproductive activities. Structurally complex live fences are expected to be particularly important for migrants and species that frequent forest and agroforestry patches.

Brady, Christopher J.; Noske, Richard A.				Restoration Ecology	18	6		855-864	November 2010	2010				English	1	42	We compared the bird and woody plant communities of 2 to 24-year-old rehabilitation areas at Gove bauxite mine (20 km2) in the seasonal tropics of northern Australia, where Alcan has maintained a consistent rehabilitation program since it began operation in 1974. Birds were censused every second month over 2 years in 30 widely separated 0.25-ha plots, representing five chronosequence stages. These were also compared with six ("off-mine") plots adjacent to the mine, which represented the annually burnt open forest typical of the region. Short-lived Acacias dominated the early chronosequence stages, whereas eucalypts dominated in later stages. Mean avian species richness and abundance increased significantly along the chronosequence, with values for the oldest rehabilitation plots being very similar to those for the off-mine plots. However, analyses of similarity revealed that the bird communities of the oldest rehabilitation plots were distinct from those of the off-mine plots, indicating that succession in rehabilitation areas is not following a direct trajectory toward the native open forest surrounding the mine. Several hollow-nesting bird species were scarce or absent in the rehabilitation areas, probably reflecting the absence of older hollow-bearing trees. Many differences between the rehabilitation and the off-mine areas in vegetation structure, woody flora, and avifauna appear to be related to the exclusion of fire from the minesite. We recommend the initiation of experiments designed to assess the effects of fire on the biota but caution against the use of fires for the majority of rehabilitation areas.

MacGregor-Fors, Ian; Blanco-Garcia, Arnulfo; Lindig-Cisneros, Roberto				Ecological Engineering	36	10		1492-1496	October 2010	2010				English	1	27	Although increased attention is being paid to animals when studying restoration processes, little is known on the effects that different restoration efforts have on birds. In this study we evaluated the variation of bird communities in a managed landscape that includes cropfields and two different restoration strategies. To evaluate possible differential effects of both restoration strategies (plus former-state and natural-state comparisons as controls), we compared their bird communities. After five growing seasons, bird species richness was highest in native forest remnants and lowest in cropfields. Although species richness values from the restoration treatment did not show differences in relation to those from the forest treatment, values for the reforestation treatment did. Bird densities were highest in the forests and alike in cropfield, reforestation, and restoration treatments. However, bird communities recorded in the restoration treatment were fairly even when compared to the reforestation treatment, and highest bird species composition similarity was recorded between the restoration and forest treatments. These results suggest that the studied restoration treatment attracts a higher number of bird species in relation to former states and thus enhance bird richness. Also, we demonstrate that restoration efforts that include more actions can affect more ecosystem components. In this study, nurse plants not only offered a quick growing structural vegetation component that enhanced habitat structure, but also provided abundant food resources for birds. Given the scarcity of comparable habitat matrices to replicate our study, our results should be taken with caution as they are not generalizable to all Mexican temperate forest conditions. Although further studies need to address whether restoration practices using Lupinus elegans positively affect bird primary population parameters (e.g., survival, reproduction), our results show that restoration practices that include nurse plants can promote rich bird communities after only 5 years from the implementation of restoration measures.

Negus, Lucas P.; Davis, Craig A.; Wessel, Scott E.				American Midland Naturalist	164	2		296-310	Oct 2010	2010				English	0	26	Throughout the Midwestern U.S., grassland birds have been declining faster than any other group of birds, with the main cause for these declines being the extensive loss of native prairies. During the last 25 y, surrogate grasslands, such as Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands, have become increasingly important as an alternative habitat for grassland birds. However, many CRP grasslands that once provided excellent habitat are now dominated by monculture stands of grass, resulting in a less diverse habitat that has reduced wildlife benefits. In summer 2002, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and Pheasants Forever partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency and Natural Resource Conservation Service to initiate a program that promotes disking and interseeding legumes as a mid-contract management practice in CRP fields. The objectives of this study were to determine grassland bird abundance and nest-productivity in disked and interseeded CRP fields and evaluate vegetative responses to disking and interseeding. We conducted our study on 16 CRP fields in Stanton County, Nebraska where we used fixed transects to determine avian species richness and abundance and nest-searched twelve 4-ha plots to determine nest productivity in treatment (managed by disking and interseeding) and reference (unmanaged) CRP fields. We also recorded vegetation characteristics along each transect and at each nest. Overall abundance in treatment fields was 4.49 [plus or minus] 0.25 (SE) birds/transect compared to 2.93 [plus or minus] 0.21 birds/transect in reference fields. Species richness and diversity were also higher in treatment fields. There was no difference in nest density or nest success between treatment and reference fields. Treatment field vegetation had higher percentages of forbs and bare ground than reference sites. Maximum vegetation height and horizontal visual obstruction were also higher in treatment sites. To accommodate the most grassland bird species in CRP fields, management of CRP fields should include establishing an annual rotation of disking/interseeding, while leaving portions of fields in mature grass stands. Future research should focus On methods that will increase the longevity of the vegetation effects of disking/interseeding legumes.

Newmark, W.D.; Mkongewa, V.J.; Sobek, A.D.

Here we report on the ranging behavior and habitat selection of three terrestrial insectivorous bird species, the spot-throat Modulatrix stictigula, Usambara thrush Turdus roehli and orange ground thrush Zoothera gurneyi, in the East (EUM) and West (WUM) Usambara Mountains in north-east Tanzania. Based on 5945 locations and 3676 bird radio-tracking hours conducted between 2001 and 2008 at four study sites in the EUM and WUM, we determined that the 95% kernel home range and 50% kernel core range for the spot-throat, Usambara thrush, and orange ground thrush are similar yet large (aggregate mean home range=10.3[plus or minus]1.1 ha; aggregate mean core range 1.5[plus or minus]0.4 ha); that these species are adverse to crossing non-forested openings [long dash] no bird was recorded over the course of the study to cross a non-forested opening >15 m; and that the most extinction-prone species in our study system, the spot-throat and Usambara thrush, preferentially used slightly disturbed and primary forest, respectively. These results indicate that maintaining continuous forest cover and minimizing forest disturbance in corridors in the Eastern Arc Mountains is important for enhancing their habitat suitability for these species.

Mitrovich, Milan J.; Matsuda, Tritia; Pease, Krista H.; Fisher, Robert N.				Conservation Biology	24	5		1239-1248	October 2010	2010				English	2	25	In the United States multispecies habitat conservation plans were meant to be the solution to conflicts between economic development and protection of biological diversity. Although now widely applied, questions exist concerning the scientific credibility of the conservation planning process and effectiveness of the plans. We used ants to assess performance of one of the first regional conservation plans developed in the United States, the Orange County Central-Coastal Natural Community Conservation Plan (NCCP), in meeting its broader conservation objectives of biodiversity and ecosystem-level protection. We collected pitfall data on ants for over 3 years on 172 sites established across a network of conservation lands in coastal southern California. Although recovered native ant diversity for the study area was high, site-occupancy models indicated the invasive and ecologically disruptive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) was present at 29% of sites, and sites located within 200 m of urban and agricultural areas were more likely to have been invaded. Within invaded sites, native ants were largely displaced, and their median species richness declined by more than 60% compared with uninvaded sites. At the time of planning, 24% of the 15,133-ha reserve system established by Orange County NCCP fell within 200 m of an urban or agricultural edge. With complete build out of lands surrounding the reserve, the proportion of the reserve system vulnerable to invasion will grow to 44%. Our data indicate that simply protecting designated areas from development is not enough. If habitat conservation plans are to fulfill their conservation promise of ecosystem-level protection, a more-integrated and systematic approach to the process of habitat conservation planning is needed.

Iwata, Tomoya; Urabe, Jotaro; Mitsuhashi, Hiromune				Conservation Biology	24	5		1278-1289	October 2010	2010				English	2	23	Interfaces between terrestrial and stream ecosystems often enhance species diversity and population abundance of ecological communities beyond levels that would be expected separately from both the ecosystems. Nevertheless, no study has examined how stream configuration within a watershed influences the population of terrestrial predators at the drainage-basin scale. We examined the habitat and abundance relationships of forest insectivorous birds in eight drainage basins in a cool temperate forest of Japan during spring and summer. Each basin has different drainage-basin geomorphology, such as the density and frequency of stream channels. In spring, when terrestrial arthropod prey biomass is limited, insectivorous birds aggregated in habitats closer to streams, where emerging aquatic prey was abundant. Nevertheless, birds ceased to aggregate around streams in summer because terrestrial prey became plentiful. Watershed-scale analyses showed that drainage basins with longer stream channels per unit area sustained higher densities of insectivorous birds. Moreover, such effects of streams on birds continued from spring through summer, even though birds dispersed out of riparian areas in the summer. Although our data are from only a single year, our findings imply that physical modifications of stream channels may reduce populations of forest birds; thus, they emphasize the importance of landscape-based management approaches that consider both stream and forest ecosystems for watershed biodiversity conservation.

Bowers Phillips, Linda; Hansen, Andrew J.; Flather, Curtis H.; Robison-Cox, Jim				Ecological Applications	20	7		2007-2023	October 2010	2010				English	1	44	Ecosystem energy is now recognized as a primary correlate and potential driver of global patterns of species richness. The increasingly well-tested species[long dash]energy relationship is now ripe for application to conservation, and recent advances in satellite technology make this more feasible. While the correlates for the species[long dash]energy relationship have been addressed many times previously, this study is among the first to apply species[long dash]energy theory to conservation. Our objectives were to: (1) determine the strongest model of bird richness across North America; (2) determine whether the slope of the best species[long dash]energy model varied with varying energy levels; and (3) identify the spatial patterns with similar or dissimilar slopes to draw inference for conservation. Model selection techniques were used to evaluate relationships between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measures of ecosystem energy and species richness of native land birds using the USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. Linear, polynomial, and break point regression techniques were used to evaluate the shape of the relationships with correction for spatial autocorrelation. Spatial analyses were used to determine regions where slopes of the relationship differed. We found that annual gross primary production (GPP) was the strongest correlate of richness (adjusted R2 = 0.55), with a quadratic model being the strongest model. The negative slope of the model was confirmed significantly negative at the highest energy levels. This finding demonstrates that there are three different slopes to the species[long dash]energy relationship across the energy gradient of North America: positive, flat, and negative. If energy has a causal relationship with richness, then species[long dash]energy theory implies that energy causes richness to increase in low-energy areas, energy has little effect in intermediate-energy areas, and energy depresses richness in the highest-energy areas. This information provides a basis for potential applications for more effective conservation. For example, in low-energy areas, increased nutrients could improve vegetation productivity and increase species richness. In high-energy areas where competitive dominance of vegetation might reduce species richness, vegetation manipulation could increase species richness. These strategies will likely be most effective if tailored to the local energy gradient.

Duan, Jian J.; Ulyshen, Michael D.; Bauer, Leah S.; Gould, Juli; Van Driesche, Roy				Environmental Entomology	39	5		1513-1522	Oct 2010	2010				English	2	51	Cohorts of emerald ash borer larvae, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, were experimentally established in July of 2008 on healthy green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) trees in two wooded plots at each of three sites near Lansing, MI, by caging gravid emerald ash borer females or placing laboratory-reared eggs on trunks (0.5-2 m above the ground) of selected trees. One plot at each site was randomly chosen for release of two introduced larval parasitoids, Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and Spathius agrili Yang (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), whereas the other served as the control. Stage-specific mortality factors and rates were measured for all experimentally established cohorts and for associated wild (i.e., naturally occurring) emerald ash borer immature stages via destructive sampling of 2.5 m (above the ground) trunk sections of cohort-bearing trees in the spring and fall of 2009. Host tree defense was the most important mortality factor, causing 32.0 to 41.1% mortality in the experimental cohorts and 17.5 to 21.5% in wild emerald ash borer stages by spring 2009, and 16.1 to 29% for the remaining experimental cohorts, and 9.9 to 11.8% for wild immature emerald ash borer stages by fall 2009. Woodpecker predation was the second most important factor, inflicting no mortality in the experimental cohorts but causing 5.0 to 5.6% mortality to associated wild emerald ash borer stages by spring 2009 and 9.2 to 12.8% and 3.2 to 17.7%, respectively, for experimental cohorts and wild emerald ash borer stages by fall 2009. Mortality from disease in both the experimental and wild cohorts was low (<3%) in both the spring and fall sample periods. In the fall 2009 samples, of experimental cohorts and 0.8% of the wild emerald ash borer stages were parasitized by T planipennisi. While there were no significant differences in mortality rates because of parasitism between parasitoid-release and control plots, T planipennisi was detected in each of the three release sites by the end of the study but was not detected in the experimental cohorts or associated wild larvae in any of the three control plots.

Appel, David N.; Camilli, Kim S.				U S Forest Service General Technical Report PNW	802 1			61-71	Sep 2010	2010				English	0	2	A major epidemic of oak wilt, caused by Ceratocystis fagacearum (Bretz) Hunt, has been killing trees in Central Texas for at least 40 years. This has created large and expanding canopy gaps in the vast, homogenous live oak woodlands (Quercus fusiformis Small) in the Edwards Plateau region of Texas. The changes in stand structure may have detrimental consequences for an endangered migratory songbird, the golden-cheeked warbler (GCW, Dendroica chrysoparia Sclater & Salvin). More information is needed to assess the direct impact of oak wilt on the GCW and how oak wilt control measures might affect bird populations. In our study, two surveys with different objectives were conducted at the Fort Hood Military Installation in Central Texas. In 2001, IKONOS I-meter pan-sharpened satellite imagery was used to assess the incidence and severity of oak wilt. The disease was found to be the cause of mortality in 69 percent of the sampled plots. Only a small proportion of the oak wilt centers (12 percent) were located in designated GCW habitat. A second survey was conducted in 2003-04 to determine the key characteristics of GCW nesting sites and how they compare to those of oak wilt centers. This systematic survey was based on randomly selected cluster sample plots stratified in five resource categories based on the presence or absence of oak wilt, GCW habitat, or GCW nesting sites, or both. Stand densities ranged from 90 trees/ha (GCW habitat, no oak wilt) to 1,298 trees/ha (GCW habitat, nesting site). Juniper (Juniperus ashei Buchh.) to oak ratios ranged from 0.24:1 (GCW habitat, no oak wilt) to 6.57:1 (GCW habitat, no oak wilt). Classification tree analysis was conducted to identify independent variables associated with the presence of nesting sites in GCW habitat. Key variables in the resulting model included road density, selected Landsat and SPOT 10 satellite imagery bands, elevation, and distance to roads. In terms of tree mortality, the impact of oak wilt on GCW home ranges may be minimal. Further analyses are needed to evaluate the impacts of other site disturbances caused by oak wilt, such as fragmentation and alterations in stand composition. The results of this project will be used to aid natural resource managers when conflicts occur between endangered species management and oak wilt control.

Manu, Shiiwua; Imong, Inaoyom Sunday; Cresswell, Will				Bird Conservation International	20	3		231-239	Sep 2010	2010				English	0	27	The mountains of south-eastern Nigeria are a western extension of the Cameroon mountain range, which is classified as an endemic bird area (EBA). Unlike its eastern extension in Cameroon, most of the ornithological surveys in the western extension of the Cameroon highlands in Nigeria have produced only limited checklists and inventories. There is a clear need for quantitative baseline data so that conservation problems can be identified. Twenty line transects covering a total transect length of 28.8 km were used to survey five sites (Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary, Oban Division and Okwangwo Division of Cross River National Park, Sankwala Mountains and Mbe Mountains) in the westernmost extension of the Cameroon Mountains EBA in south-eastern Nigeria. Vegetation measurements were taken to control for the potential confounding effect of variation in vegetation density and structure on detectability of birds between sites. The 193 bird species recorded in Afi, 158 in Sankwala, 124 in Oban, 100 in Mbe and 73 in Okwangwo Division included most of the Cameroon highlands restricted range species. The results show that the mountains of south-eastern Nigeria are important parts of the Cameroon EBA, particularly Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary. However these sites are threatened by fire and livestock grazing on the hilltops, shifting agriculture on the hillsides and lowlands, and logging for timber in some parts, as well as wildlife hunting for bushmeat.

These woodpeckers were classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List following a population survey in 1994. To reassess the Guadeloupe Woodpecker population, we conducted a new survey in 2007, with 21 transects distributed across eight habitats known to be used by the woodpeckers. Habitats with the highest estimated population densities were seasonal evergreen secondary growth forest, followed by swamp forest and rainforest. Surveys revealed an estimated population of 8469 pairs in 2007 compared to 7368 pairs in 1994, a difference that was not significant. However, our 2007 survey revealed that Guadeloupe Woodpeckers had recolonized the last large patch of available forest on Basse-Terre, one of the two main islands in the Guadeloupe archipelago. Although our results suggest that the Guadeloupe Woodpecker population has remained relatively stable since 1994, deforestation remains a serious threat and we recommend that the IUCN Red List status of Near Threatened be retained. Management measures that would benefit Guadeloupe Woodpeckers include halting deforestation and providing financial support to people on private land to plant trees and leave dead trees standing. Regular monitoring will be important for determining the possible effects of such measures on the Guadeloupe Woodpecker population.

Journal of Wildlife Management	74	7		1523-1532	Sep 2010	2010				English	0	21	Northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) are secondary cavity-nesters and their dependence on snags has potential repercussions on forest management practices. Descriptive studies exist regarding habitat characteristics around saw-whet nest and roost areas, yet few studies have examined associations within larger areas or relative to snag characteristics (e. g., density). We conducted owl broadcast surveys and snag sampling during the spring and summer of 2006 and 2007 in the Lake Tahoe Basin of the central Sierra Nevada; we measured additional habitat variables from Geographic Information System layers. We modeled detection and occupancy probabilities for saw-whets using sampling and site covariates at survey sites. In addition, we used stepwise logistic regression to compare habitat characteristics at owl use sites and nonuse sites at 2 spatial scales. Detection probability was low in 2006 and decreased throughout the survey period; detection probability was slightly higher in 2007 and unaffected by day of survey. Probability of occupancy was affected by elevation and dominant tree species in 2007. Similarly, stepwise logistic regression indicated saw-whet occurrence was negatively correlated with the percentage of area dominated by white fir (Abies concolor) at both the macrohabitat (approx. 260 ha) and microhabitat (approx. 20 ha) scales and was positively correlated with the percentage of area containing open canopy at the microhabitat scale. We did not find correlations between saw-whet occurrence and snag characteristics. Current restoration projects in areas of the Sierra Nevada aim to decrease relative abundance of white fir and the number of snags in forest stands. We recommend continued monitoring of saw-whets to understand potential effects of these restoration activities. Our estimates of saw-whet occupancy and detection probabilities can be used by forest managers to determine necessary survey effort for reliable results when developing monitoring protocols.

Journal of Wildlife Management	74	7		1559-1567	Sep 2010	2010				English	4	63	Common reed (Phragmites australis) forms dense stands with deep layers of residual organic matter that negatively affects plant diversity and possibly habitat use by wetland birds. We sought to determine whether seasonal relative abundance and species richness of birds varied among 3 habitat types in Great Lakes coastal wetland complexes recently invaded by common reed. We used fixed-distance point counts to determine species relative abundances and species richness in edge and interior locales within common reed, cattail (Typha spp.), and meadow marsh habitats of various sizes during 2 summers (2001 and 2002) and 1 autumn (2001) at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada. We found that total relative abundance and species richness of birds were greater in common reed habitat compared to cattail or meadow marsh habitats. However, we also found that relative abundance of marsh-nesting birds was greater in meadow marsh habitat than in cattail and common reed during summer. Lastly, we found that, irrespective of habitat type, habitat edges had higher total relative abundance and species richness of birds than did habitat interiors. Our results show that common reed provides suitable habitat for a diversity of landbirds during summer and autumn but only limited habitat for many marsh-nesting birds during summer. Based on these results, we recommend restoration of meadow marsh habitat through reduction of common reed in Great Lakes wetlands where providing habitat for breeding marsh-nesting birds is an objective.

Nutzung von Windwurfflaechen durch Voegel -Strukturelle Untersuchungen im Nationalpark Kellerwald-Edersee.	Seitz, Daniel				Naturschutz und Landschaftsplanung	42	9		267-274	Sep 2010	2010				German	0	0	As an important effect of natural disturbances windthrows increase structural diversity and enhance biodiversity. Area size, vegetation structure, proportion of deadwood and environmental characteristics are decisive variables influencing the suitability of windthrows for birds. In January 2007 the storm 'Kyrill' caused several windthrows in the national park Kellerwald-Edersee in Northern Hesse. During the breeding season 2008 the bird communities of nine windthrows were investigated. The aim of the study was to reveal how differences in structure, environment and forestal treatment of the windthrows affect their use by birds. Areas of big stacked logs with large root plates sheltered the majority of bird territories on windthrows whereas cleared areas showed lower species richness and individual abundances. Furthermore a lot of territories were found in the transition of windthrow and forest. Windthrows near open areas had higher numbers of species. This study provides further evidence that the structural diversity of windthrows and their environment is one of the most significant reasons for the use of these areas by birds.

Wilson Journal of Ornithology	122	3		518-531	Sep 2010	2010				English	1	16	We investigated how variation in fire severity (control or no fire; low, medium, and high severity fires) and interval (1-2 years vs. 3-6 years after fires) affected habitat and avian abundance, species diversity, richness, and evenness in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Fire severity and interval had significant implications for both habitat and avian communities. Species richness within 2 years of fires was on average 26% higher in areas receiving medium and high severity treatments than in unburned control units. Species diversity and species richness were markedly greater 3-6 years after fires within high severity treatments (12 and 44%, respectively), compared to unburned controls. Relative abundance and species evenness did not vary with fire severity or time since tire. The short-term effects of low severity fires, or high severity fires with short rotation periods (<=2 years) may have limited positive effects on avian communities. Facilitation of disturbance regimes including mid to high severity fires, which foster uneven-aged forests, can be an effective conservation tool for restoring avian communities.

Felton, Adam; Lindbladh, Matts; Brunet, Jorg; Fritz, Orjan				Forest Ecology and Management	260	6		939-947	Aug 15 2010	2010				English	5	141	Conifer dominated plantations in central and northern Europe are associated with relatively low ecological values, and in some cases, may be vulnerable to disturbances caused by anthropogenic climate change. This has prompted the consideration of alternative tree species compositions for use in production forestry in this region. Here we evaluate the likely biodiversity costs and benefits of supplanting Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures with polycultures of spruce and birch (Betula spp.) in southern Sweden. This polyculture alternative has previously been evaluated in terms of economic, recreational, and silvicultural benefits. By also assessing the ecological implications we fill a gap in our understanding of the range of socio-ecological benefits that can be achieved from a single polyculture alternative. We project likely broad scale changes to species richness and abundance within production stands for five taxonomic groups including ground vegetation, tree-living bryophytes, lichens, saproxylic beetles, and birds. Our research leads us to three key findings. First, the replacement of spruce monocultures with spruce-birch polycultures in the managed forest landscapes of southern Sweden can be expected to result in an increase in biological diversity for most but not all taxa assessed, but it is unlikely to improve conditions for many red-listed forest species. Second, modification of other aspects of forest management (i.e. rotation length, dead wood and green tree retention, thinning regimes) is likely to contribute to further biodiversity gains using spruce-birch polycultures than spruce monocultures. Third, the paucity of empirical research which directly compares the biodiversity of different types of managed production stands, limits the extent to which policy relevant conclusions can be extracted from the scientific literature. We discuss the wider implications of our findings, which indicate that some climate change adaptation strategies, such as risk-spreading, can be readily integrated with the economic, environmental and social goals of multi-use forestry.

Seymour, Colleen L.; Dean, W.R.J.				Austral Ecology	35	5		581-592	Aug 2010	2010				English	0	43	Land use management practices often change habitat structure, which in turn influence diversity and the composition of floral and faunal assemblages. In the southern Kalahari, southern Africa, heavy grazing after above-average rainfall has lead to bush thickening, and widespread use of arboricides and/or removal of large trees for firewood has also impacted habitat structure. At sites near Kimberley, in South Africa, we investigated the effects of these changes on bird species richness and which aspects of habitat structure most influenced bird assemblage diversity and composition. We also investigated correlations between bird life history traits and habitat characteristics using RLQ analysis. Bird species richness and abundance were both explained by vertical habitat heterogeneity and density of woody species between the heights of 0-2 m, with bird species richness also explained by the density of woody species at heights above 6 m. Large trees within bush-thickened areas dampened the effects of bush thickening on bird assemblages by enabling certain species to persist, consistent with the idea that large trees are keystone structures. Smaller insectivorous gleaners, ball-and cup-nesters, birds with parts of their range extending into arid areas and birds with long-wavelength plumage (i.e. red, orange or yellow plumage) dominated bush-thickened habitats. Seed-eaters, burrow-and ground-nesters, bark-foragers, birds that perch and sally, or perch and swoop to the ground, were all negatively associated with bush thickening. Cavity-nesters, bark-foragers, hawkers, frugivores, birds that perch and sally and species with iridescent plumage were negatively affected by the loss of large trees. Of the common species analysed, nearly 40% of species had life history traits tied to large trees; and 68% had traits negatively associated with bush thickening and removal of large trees together, suggesting that where these changes in habitat occur simultaneously, bird diversity will be strongly affected.

Such "wildlife-friendly" practices contrast with the alternative "land sparing" strategy, which promotes separation of agricultural and conservation areas. Focusing on the wildlife-friendly strategy of retaining fragments of forest within the agricultural matrix, here we report the abundance and diversity of birds within oil palm plantations, fragments, and contiguous forest. Abundances of imperiled bird species were 60 times lower in fragments and 200 times lower in oil palm than in contiguous forest. Forest fragments also did not increase bird abundances in adjacent oil palm, had lower species richness than contiguous forest, and had an avifaunal composition that was more similar to oil palm than to contiguous forest. Therefore, from a conservation perspective, any investment in the retention of fragments would be better directed toward the protection of contiguous forest.

(Coots) in the el Otun Lake (Colombian Central Andes), the trends of population size of these species were described. It was determined that the populations of O. jamaicensis and Coots were reduced between 1998 and 2007 in a 63 and 54% respectively, and that the variations in the Lake level during 2000 were correlated with the changes in the abundance of A. flavirostris. The results suggest that these species change in abundance both intra and inter annually and that they could be related with environmental variations. On the other hand, some disturbances (the fire occurred in 2006) could have affected the state of these populations reducing them even more. It is a priority to continue with the population moni- toring of these species because of their reduced population size which makes them more vulnerable to stochastic environmental and demographic factors.

Ibis	152	3		500-514	Jul 2010	2010				English	1	23	The Hillesden experiment, established in 2005/2006 to test the delivery of biodiversity benefits under Environmental Stewardship, covers c. 1000 ha of arable farmland in central lowland England. It is a randomized block experiment with five replicates of three treatments: (1) CC: cross compliance, the control; (2) ELS: 1% of land removed from production for wildlife habitat provision; and (3) ELS-X: 5% of land used for wildlife habitat, each treatment being applied to contiguous areas of 70-80 ha. Bird usage of winter food patches, comprising three different seed mixes, was monitored through the winter and was also related to seed yield. Winter and breeding season bird/territory abundance was recorded before and after the provision of the winter food patches. Bird use of the patches differed between seed mixes. There was large variation between individual patches in both seed yield and bird numbers and between individual bird species in their use of different seed mixes, suggesting that the availability of a range of patch types would be beneficial. Use of all patch types declined sharply in late January to February, indicating depletion and/or inability of birds to access shed seed. Winter bird abundance at a farm scale for all species combined, granivorous species and nine individual species increased for all monitored species when seed patches were available. At a treatment level, the increases tended to be greater in ELS-X, where most of the patches were located. In the breeding season at a farm scale, the numbers of territories for all species combined and granivorous species increased significantly when seed patches had been available in the previous winter. There was little evidence of a treatment-scale response. The provision of winter food appeared to increase winter bird abundance and to follow on into an overall increase in the breeding population, but if the latter effect is to be reflected elsewhere, this requires that sufficient breeding habitat is available to accommodate an increase.

Mabry, Catherine M.; Brudvig, Lars A.; Atwell, Ryan C.				Forest Ecology and Management	260	1		42-51	Jun 15 2010	2010				English	1	22	Species distributions are determined by complex interplays between multi-scale factors. Conservation management, however, often occurs at a single scale of the site level. This is true for bird communities of restored savannas and mixed woodlands in the central U.S. In this region, many historic open-canopy oak savanna habitats have become closed canopy mixed woodlands due to loss of landscape-scale disturbance from fire and grazing. Site-level management efforts return some mixed woodland habitats back to savanna through fire and mechanical thinning. Savanna and woodland historically formed complex mosaic landscapes at the ecotone between prairies and Eastern deciduous forests and now exist within landscapes that vary in amount of open (e.g., perennial grassland and row crop agriculture) and woodland habitat. To understand the interplay between site and landscape level factors in savanna restoration, we sampled the breeding bird community in four combinations of site and landscape: restored savanna in open landscapes, restored savanna in woodland landscapes, and closed canopy woodland in both landscapes. We found that the outcome of site-level savanna restoration depended on the surrounding landscape. Compared to other treatment types, restored savannas in open landscapes supported a distinctive bird community characterized by high species richness, bird abundance, and percent of ground feeders, shrub nesters. and edge species. Both savanna and woodland sites in the open landscape had a higher percent of species of conservation concern, while at both site and landscape levels, woodland was associated with a higher percent of area sensitive species and habitat specialists. Our results suggest savanna restoration efforts should focus on sites that exist either in open country or on edges where closed canopy forest meets open country. This strategy would combine site and landscape level benefits of savanna restoration for avian diversity, while also preserving the conservation benefits of large tracts of intact forest.

Rost, J.; Clavero, M.; Bas, J.M.; Pons, P.				Forest Ecology and Management	260	1		79-86	Jun 15 2010	2010				English	2	13	Salvage logging is a common practice carried out in burned forests worldwide, and intended to mitigate the economic losses caused by wildfires. Logging implies an additional disturbance occurring shortly after fire, although its ecological effects can be somewhat mitigated by leaving wood debris on site. The composition of the bird community and its capacity to provide ecosystem services such as seed dispersal of fleshy-fruited plants have been shown to be affected by postfire logging. We assessed the effects of the habitat structure resulting from different postfire management practices on the bird community, in three burned pine forests in Catalonia (western Mediterranean). For this purpose, we focused on the group of species that is responsible for seed dispersal, a process which takes place primarily during the winter in the Mediterranean basin. In addition, we assessed microhabitat selection by seed disperser birds in such environments in relation to management practices. Our results showed a significant, positive relationship between the density of wood debris piles and the abundance of seed disperser birds. Furthermore, such piles were the preferred microhabitat of these species. This reveals an important effect of forest management on seed disperser birds, which is likely to affect the dynamics of bird-dependent seed dispersal. Thus, building wood debris piles can be a useful practice for the conservation of both the species and their ecosystem services, while also being compatible with timber harvesting.

Rey-Benayas, Jose M.; Galvan, Ismael; Carrascal, Luis M.				Forest Ecology and Management	260	1		87-95	Jun 15 2010	2010				English	1	32	Two contrasting trajectories for vegetation restoration in agricultural landscapes are secondary succession following cropland abandonment that can regenerate woodlands (passive restoration) and conversion of cropland to tree plantations (active restoration), which have mostly focused on pine species in the Mediterranean Basin. We compared the effects of these two contrasting trajectories of vegetation restoration on bird assemblages in central Spain. Vegetation structure differed in the two restoration trajectories, pine plantations attaining higher tree cover and height (31% and 4.1 m, respectively) but lower strata complexity than secondary shrubland and holm oak woodland (which attained 10% and 1.4m of tree cover and height, respectively). Bird species richness differed in stands under active or passive restoration trajectories, the former collecting a higher total number of species (4.2 species per 0.78 ha plot) than the latter (3.5 species per plot). The number of forest species increased with vegetation maturity in both restoration trajectories, but especially in stands under active restoration. The occurrence of woodland generalist species increased and of species inhabiting open habitats decreased in actively restored stands, being some of these latter species of high conservation priority in the European context but relatively common at the regional level. Bird species inhabiting pine plantations had broader habitat breadth at the regional level than those inhabiting secondary shrublands and woodlands. Maximum regional density did not differ between both restoration trajectories, but it increased with development of the herbaceous layer only at the secondary succession trajectory. The relative importance of species of European biogeographic origin was higher in mature pine plantations (58.9% of total bird abundance) than in mature holm oak woodlands (34.4%), whereas that of Mediterranean species was considerably higher in the latter (40.1%) than in the former (20%). Bird assemblages of relatively small patches of pine plantations are unable to reflect the regional avifauna, in contrast with the relationships between local and regional assemblage characteristics that can be found in isolated natural forests. We conclude that programs of vegetation restoration should base upon a range of approaches that include passive restoration, active restoration with a variety of tree and shrub species, and mixed models to conciliate agricultural production, vegetation restoration and conservation of target species.

Imai, Haruka; Nakashizuka, Tohru				Landscape and Urban Planning	96	3		183-194	15 June 2010	2010				English	4	62	The importance of biodiversity in urban parks and green spaces has been increasingly emphasized. In this study, we focused on the avian community in urban parks and green spaces and aimed to elucidate its characteristics and affecting factors. Specific questions addressed are, (1) What ecological traits feature the avian communities in urban parks and green spaces? (2) What environmental factors are important in changing the structure or avian communities in urban area, such as species diversity and guild structure. The study sites were 20 urban parks or green spaces located in central urban area in Sendai, northern Japan. Bird surveys were conducted from middle to late breeding season. We measured environmental factors of stand and landscape level, including water related environment. The overall species number decreased in highly urbanized area, while diversity index (H') increased, probably because the species with low frequency did not occur in urban environment and increased equitability of the community. The result of CCA revealed that the characteristics of avian communities in Sendai City were determined by the prevalence of water-related environments and the predominance level of urban environment. Insectivores and foliage foraging species contributed to increasing overall species number, while ground foraging species negatively affected to the overall avian diversity of a community. These findings suggested that increased shrub in stand level was effective to increase the overall species number, and to be considered future design of the city parks.

Animal Conservation	13	3		294-305	Jun 2010	2010				English	1	37	Broom matorrals are subjected to extensive burning in the Pyrenees to improve grazing value, despite being a habitat of conservation interest in Europe. Our aim here is to evaluate the impact of such management practices over the long term, and of fire severity over the short term, on avifauna. Bird-habitat stations were distributed in broom shrublands from a few months to 51 years after fire, at 1400-2100 m a.s.l. Overall, shrub cover was the main habitat variable affecting the bird community composition. The abundance trends of bird species for half a century after fire were varied, but population recovery seemed slower (especially in the Dartford warbler Sylvia undata) than it had been reported at a lower altitude. Three species of European conservation concern (Alauda arvensis, Lullula arborea and Lanius collurio) showed abundance peaks at 10-19 years after fire. This time interval showed the highest species richness, abundance and conservation value, whereas shrub cover continued to increase afterwards. The bird assemblage tended to impoverish with increasing fire severity in the first year after a fire. Our results emphasize: (1) the slow recovery of bird community of burnt mountain shrublands; (2) the need for long-term biodiversity assessments to help improve planning of fire intervals at different altitudes; (3) the relevance of reducing fire severity due to its impact on fauna.

Zmihorski, Michal				Biodiversity and Conservation	19	7		1871-1882	Jun 2010	2010				English	3	27	This study aimed to evaluate the impact of windthrow and two types of its management on the bird community of a managed, pine-dominated forest (NE Poland), where a windstorm event occurred in 2002. In 2007, the bird species composition was assessed using the point count method in three types of habitat: windthrow left undisturbed for natural regeneration, managed windthrow (all fallen trees removed), and intact forest (undisturbed by the windstorm, used as the control). In total, 2,365 individual birds of 70 species were recorded in the three analyzed habitats. The mean number of individuals per point and species per point was significantly higher in the natural windthrow than in the two other habitats. The diversity of the bird community was higher in the natural and managed windthrow, as compared to the control. The bird community of the control was significantly more similar to that of the natural windthrow than to the one in the managed windthrow. These results lead to a conclusion that the bird community was affected more by the clearing and artificial replanting following the windthrow than by the windthrow itself.

DeMars, Craig A.; Rosenberg, Daniel K.; Fontaine, Joseph B.				Biological Conservation	143	6		1485-1492	Jun 2010	2010				English	1	34	With recent emphasis on sustainable agriculture, conservation of native biota within agricultural systems has become a priority. Remnant trees have been hypothesized to increase biological diversity in agro-ecosystems. We investigated how remnant Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) trees contribute to conserving bird diversity in the agro-ecosystem of the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. We compared bird use of isolated oak trees in three landscape contexts - croplands, pastures, and oak savanna reserves - and ranked the relative importance of four factors thought to influence bird use of individual trees: (i) tree architecture; (ii) tree isolation; (iii) tree cover in the surrounding landscape; and (iv) landscape context, defined as the surrounding land use. We evaluated species-specific responses and four community-level responses: (i) total species richness; (ii) richness of oak savanna-associates; (iii) tree forager richness; and (iv) aerial and ground forager richness. We documented 47 species using remnant oaks, including 16 species typically occurring in oak savanna. Surprisingly, landscape context was unimportant in predicting frequency of use of individual trees. Tree architecture, in particular tree size, and tree cover in the surrounding landscape were the best predictors of bird use of remnant trees. Our findings demonstrate that individual remnant trees contribute to landscape-level conservation of bird diversity, acting as keystone habitat structures by providing critical resources for species that could not persist in otherwise treeless agricultural fields. Because remnant trees are rarely retained in contemporary agricultural landscapes in the United States, retention of existing trees and recruitment of replacement trees will contribute to regional conservation goals.

In terms of geographical distribution type, there were 21 Palaearctic species, 2 Oriental species and 11 cosmopolitan species. Platalea leucorodia, listed on both Rank II National Protected Wildlife and China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals,was recorded. And there were 10 species protected provincially. According to the feeding habits of water birds, there were more spedes living on fish and shrimp, but more biomass of the species living on hydrophytes. The water quality of Lake Jinyinhu turned out to be even poorer than the 5th level, were analyzed, The bird diversity index in different seasons and different habitats were analyzed. It indicated that the reconstruction of hydrophytes and the change of wate-land area by water level control would increase the biodiversity of Lake Jinyinhu. Furthermore, the species diversity of water birds and environmetn condition were compared between urban and suburban lakes of Wuhan. The result showed that the water bird diversity correlated negatively with the pollution degree, positively with the area of lakes. Thus the over development and encroachnent of wetlands should be prohibited,and it is urgent to improve the water quality.

Castro, Jorge; Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio; Hodar, Jose A.				Conservation Biology	24	3		810-819	Jun 2010	2010				English	0	45	There is an intense debate about the effects of postfire salvage logging versus nonintervention policies on regeneration of forest communities, but scant information from experimental studies is available. We manipulated a burned forest area on a Mediterranean mountain to experimentally analyze the effect of salvage logging on bird-species abundance, diversity, and assemblage composition. We used a randomized block design with three plots of approximately 25 ha each, established along an elevational gradient in a recently burned area in Sierra Nevada Natural and National Park (southeastern Spain). Three replicates of three treatments differing in postfire burned wood management were established per plot: salvage logging, nonintervention, and an intermediate degree of intervention (felling and lopping most of the trees but leaving all the biomass). Starting 1 year after the fire, we used point sampling to monitor bird abundance in each treatment for 2 consecutive years during the breeding and winter seasons (720 censuses total). Postfire burned-wood management altered species assemblages. Salvage logged areas had species typical of open-and early-successional habitats. Bird species that inhabit forests were still present in the unsalvaged treatments even though trees were burned, but were almost absent in salvage-logged areas. Indeed, the main dispersers of mid-and late-successional shrubs and trees, such as thrushes (Turdus spp.) and the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius) were almost restricted to unsalvaged treatments. Salvage logging might thus hamper the natural regeneration of the forest through its impact on assemblages of bird species. Moreover, salvage logging reduced species abundance by 50% and richness by 40%, approximately. The highest diversity at the landscape level (gamma diversity) resulted from a combination of all treatments. Salvage logging may be positive for bird conservation if combined in a mosaic with other, less-aggressive postfire management, but stand-wide management with harvest operations has undesirable conservation effects.

Smith, Rebecca K.; Pullin, Andrew S.; Stewart, Gavin B.; Sutherland, William J.				Conservation Biology	24	3		820-829	Jun 2010	2010				English	3	109	Predation pressure on vulnerable bird species has made predator control an important issue for international nature conservation. Predator removal by culling or translocation is controversial, expensive, and time-consuming, and results are often temporary. Thus, it is important to assess its effectiveness from all available evidence. We used explicit systematic review methodology to determine the impact of predator removal on four measurable responses in birds: breeding performance (hatching success and fledging success) and population size (breeding and postbreeding). We used meta-analysis to summarize results from 83 predator removal studies from six continents. We also investigated whether characteristics of the prey, predator species, location, and study methodology explained heterogeneity in effect sizes. Removing predators increased hatching success, fledging success, and breeding populations. Removing all predator species achieved a significantly larger increase in breeding population than removing only a subset. Postbreeding population size was not improved on islands, or overall, but did increase on mainlands. Heterogeneity in effect sizes for the four population parameters was not explained by whether predators were native or introduced; prey were declining, migratory, or game species; or by the study methodology. Effect sizes for fledging success were smaller for ground-nesting birds than those that nest elsewhere, but the difference was not significant. We conclude that current evidence indicates that predator removal is an effective strategy for the conservation of vulnerable bird populations. Nevertheless, the ethical and practical problems associated with predator removal may lead managers to favor alternative, nonlethal solutions. Research is needed to provide and synthesize data to determine whether these are effective management practices for future policies on bird conservation.

Bestandsentwicklung von Brutvoegeln im oekologisch aufgewerteten St. Galler Rheintal.	Rudin, Markus; Horch, Petra; Hugentobler, Ignaz; Weber, Urs; Birrer, Simon				Ornithologische Beobachter	107	2		81-100	Juni 2010	2010				German	0	1	Since 1993 numerous areas in the intensively farmed plains of the Rhine valley near Altstatten (canton of St. Gallen) have been ecologically upgraded. We studied the impact of this upgrading on species richness and population density of breeding birds on cultivated land. For this we recorded the population densities of selected farmland birds in a study area of 12.6 km2 in 1988/89, 1999 and 2006 (table 2). In 1988 this area presented itself mainly as an intensively farmed plain. In the centre there were still 68.7 ha of wetlands, remnants of previous reed beds, which were protected as nature reserves by 1995. There were linear structures (channels and tree hedges) spread over the whole study area, with a total length of about 39 km. As from 1993 about 97 ha of new ecological compensation areas were created. These are concentrated round the nature reserves. 22 breeding farmland bird species were recorded. More species were observed in the nature reserves than in the other land-use types (high-quality ecological compensation areas, compensation areas of no special quality created according to the regulation of direct payments, linear structures and remaining cultivated land). The number of species remained stable in the entire study area, it increased in the ecological compensation areas (high-quality and those of no special quality) and declined in the remaining land-use types: only slightly in the nature reserves, considerably in the linear structures and in the remaining cultivated land. We were able to calculate population trends for 12 of the more common species: In the entire study area the increase and decline of populations balanced each other. The populations of Eurasian Stonechat, Eurasian Reed Warbler, Willow Warbler, Red-backed Shrike and Common Reed Bunting increased. During our study period, the Eurasian Stonechat was first detected in 1990. Northern Lapwing and Tree Pipit disappeared from the study area as breeding birds, the population density of Eurasian Skylark declined, likewise that of Icterine Warbler and Marsh Warbler. The population of Common Grasshopper Warbler fluctuated without a clear trend, the density of Yellowhammer remained stable. Population increases prevailed in the nature reserves as well as in the high-quality ecological compensation areas, however, in cultivated land, in ecological compensation areas of no special quality and in linear structures negative population trends prevailed. The project in the Rhine valley is one of the few examples of a large-scale project for the enhancement of habitat where an evaluation of success was made. It shows that ecological compensation areas of a high-quality and nature reserves can have a positive effect on the diversity and density of farmland birds. In intensive farmland, however, both the number of species and their population densities continued to decline.

Observations were conducted for 32 hours over five days. Forty-four species of birds and three mammal species were recorded. Of these, 28 birds and 2 mammals fed on the figs. In addition, nine species of insectivorous or omnivorous birds that did not feed on the figs were observed foraging in the tree, presumably on the large quantities of fig wasps produced. Inter- and intra-specific aggression was also observed among the species foraging in the tree. Overall the assemblage of large birds, such as hornbills, and mammals was poor, which seems to be due to the small size of the figs (<6 mm diameter) rather than a scarcity of these animals in the area. In contrast, the diversity of smaller bird species, especially the Pycnonotidae (Bulbuls) which comprised 13 species and 68% of visits, was high. Our results suggest fig-frugivore interactions may be more finely structured than reports from other, less pristine sites in Asia have indicated. Moreover, 34% of the birds observed are threatened or more severely endangered. We suggest that planting of hemi-epiphytic fig seedlings could be used to enhance the conservation value of small reserves and degraded forests, and that observations at fruiting figs could be used as an efficient method for assessing how well reserves are protected.

A total of 17 species of birds were found in the burned forest in the fifth, sixth, eighth, and ninth years after the fire. Bird species of the order of Passeriformes are the most, accounting for 70.59% of the total. Anthus hodgsoni is a dominant bird species in the burned forest areas. Bird community compositions for different years are various, but the difference is unremarkable (P>0.05). Alauda arvensis, a species of grassland bird, was found in the burned area. The densities of A. arvensis and Carduelis sinica in the burned area decreased with time, and the density of A. arvensis reduced remarkably ( P<0.05). The bird diversity and bird density gradually increased with time prolonging after the fire. Positive correlations were observed in both bird species diversity and bird density between different years.

Fattorini, Simone				Biodiversity and Conservation	19	5		1237-1250	May 2010	2010				English	0	14	Fire is a frequent event in Mediterranean ecosystems, yet the effects on animal diversity are poorly understood. In this paper, the short-term effects of a severe fire on the tenebrionid beetles in a planted pinewood in Central Italy are investigated in comparison with those recorded in other animal communities, namely collembolans, isopods and birds. The use of statistical tests to compare values of dominance, diversity and equitability (measured with various indexes), between burned and unburned habitats, as well as the use of two major niche-based species abundance models (the geometric series and the MacArthur broken stick model), revealed a strong decrease in diversity and evenness in all investigated animal groups, including birds, for which previous research suggested minor effects. In particular, tenebrionids are proved to be particularly indicative of habitat transformations determined by fire, showing important changes in community structure, from that characteristic of woodlands to that of open habitats. Because most of the original vegetation of Mediterranean woodlands has been removed by the continued influence of man, mature pinewoods, even if artificial, represent an important surrogate habitat for most species of tenebrionids (and likely other animals of conservation concern, such as bird species), and their preservation from catastrophic fires is of paramount importance.

Kalinowski, Ryan S.; Johnson, Matthew D.				Condor	112	2		274-282	May 2010	2010				English	4	52	To evaluate factors influencing a suburban bird community in coastal northern California, we examined the abundance, richness, and diversity of wintering birds at 75 locations within the city of Arcata. For each location we used aerial imagery to determine the proportions of vegetation and impervious surfaces within 75 m and the distances to various landscape features. Human activity was measured and used as a covariate in model selection. Total bird abundance, species richness, and diversity declined with the proportion of road surface at a site, while the abundance of non-native species increased with the cover of roads and structures. The proportions of shrub and tree cover at a site predicted total abundance and richness positively. The effect of trees on species diversity was increasingly positive in more urban areas. Several species, such as Steller's Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri), Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula), Wrentit (Chamaea fasciata), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), Yellow-rumped Warbler (Dendroica coronata), and Red-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), were positively associated with tall vegetation and negatively associated with road and structure cover. The White-tailed Kite (Elanus leucurus) was positively correlated with grass and trees and negatively correlated with road and structure cover. These species may be the most vulnerable to the habitat changes associated with urbanization in this study area. We recommend maintaining/restoring native shrubs and or trees to enhance bird communities in developed areas or to improve planning where development is inevitable. Increasing shrub and tree cover may be especially valuable in newer neighborhoods and far from forest edges.

Journal of Wildlife Management	74	4		739-754	May 2010	2010				English	1	32	Lowland riparian vegetation in the southwestern United States is critically important for maintaining a high richness and density of breeding birds. Further investigation is needed within riparian corridors, however, to evaluate the relative importance of vegetation type and hydrologic regime for avian density and nest survival as targets for regional conservation or restoration efforts. We estimated the densities of 40 bird species and for species grouped on the basis of nest height and dependence on surface water in gallery cottonwood-willow (Populus spp.-Salix spp.) forests, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) shrub lands, and terrace vegetation types along a gradient in the hydrologic regime of the San Pedro River, Arizona, USA. We also assessed nest survival for shrub-nesting insectivores and herbivores. Canopy-nesting birds as a group and 14 individual bird species reached their greatest densities in cottonwood forests regardless of the hydrologic regime. Water-dependent birds as a group reached their highest density in both intermittent-and perennial-flow cottonwood stands, but certain species occurred almost exclusively in perennial-flow sites. Two shrub-nesting species and the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were most abundant in saltcedar shrub lands, and the brown-headed cowbird was most abundant in saltcedar stands with intermittent flows. Mesquite (Prosopis spp.) and big sacaton (Sporobolus wrightii) grassland each maintained the highest densities of certain species within >=1 hydrologic regime. Shrub-nesting insectivores had the greatest nest survival in cottonwood, including Arizona Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii arizonae), and also had lower proportions of nests parasitized and preyed upon, although 95% confidence intervals among vegetation types overlapped. Nest survival for both shrub-nesting insectivores and herbivores was lowest in intermittent-flow saltcedar, although, again, confidence intervals overlapped. Nest survival was lower in parasitized than nonparasitized nests in mesquite and across vegetation types for Arizona Bell's vireo and in cottonwood for Abert's towhee (Pipilo aberti). Riparian management that maintains heterogeneous riparian vegetation types, including floodplain vegetation comprising cottonwood-willow gallery riparian forests with some stretches of perennial flow, are important for maintaining the high diversity and abundance of breeding birds on the San Pedro River and probably across the region. Cottonwood stands also appear to maintain highest nest survival for some shrub-nesting birds.	Brand, L.

A case study of a pine plantation in KwaZulu-Natal.		Lipsey, Marisa K.; Hockey, Philip A.R.				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	137	1-2		133-142	Apr 15 2010	2010				English	1	16	Grasslands in South Africa have been extensively transformed and fragmented, but are poorly protected. Commercial afforestation poses a particular threat to grassland biodiversity because areas suitable for forestry coincide with those supporting the greatest richness of endemic and threatened biota. To comply with international forestry standards, commercial timber growers leave "ecological networks" of interconnected open corridors within plantations: however, the value of these networks for conservation is unclear. This study investigated how bird community composition, richness and density were influenced by habitat extent, connectivity and quality in a grassland ecological network in a forestry plantation in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We surveyed birds and measured local vegetation characteristics throughout the network. There were at least five open habitat types within the network and bird communities responded clearly to differences between these habitats: all network communities showed a distinct shift away from those typical of control grasslands. There were three distinct groups of species in the network: (1) grassland specialists, (2) habitat generalists and (3) non-grassland species. Grassland specialists were restricted to areas that are burned regularly and to large, contiguous open areas or wide grassland corridors. We found no evidence for the importance of physical connectivity among open habitats for birds in the study area. Instead, it appears that the establishment of so-called ecological networks at this scale has created much unsuitable habitat for grassland specialist species. We suggest consolidation of open areas and a rotational, biennial burning regime as a more appropriate management strategy for commercial plantations in these Critically Endangered montane grasslands.

Skorka, Piotr; Lenda, Magdalena; Tryjanowski, Piotr				Biological Conservation	143	4		856-861	Apr 2010	2010				English	0	47	Invasive alien plants constitute a major threat to local biodiversity. Moreover, their appearance often coincides with land use change. Many endangered groups of organisms suffer from habitat loss, which is often a consequence of the invasion of alien plants This paper examines how invasive alien goldenrods Solidago spp affect the richness of endangered grassland bird species and numbers of breeding pairs in abandoned meadows in southern Poland. Meadows invaded by goldenrods (n = 15) had lower bird spedes richness and a lower number of breeding pairs than meadows in which goldenrods were absent (n = 15) Two important factors positively influencing bird species richness were meadow area and shrub density (the latter only in meadows without goldenrods). Moreover, both the index of potential food density (number of butterflies) and plant species richness were much lower in meadows invaded by goldenrods than in meadows without these plants Urgent action aimed at preventing the invasion of alien goldenrods in abandoned meadows is needed and such measures should involve regular mowing Our results also highlight the fact that land abandonment in Central and Eastern Europe is not necessarily as beneficial for biodiversity as it is commonly believed and it may even lead to a decrease in the populations of several bird species in the agricultural landscape.

Twedt, Daniel J.; Somershoe, Scott G.; Hazler, Kirsten R.; Cooper, Robert J.				Journal of Wildlife Management	74	3		423-436	Apr 2010	2010				English	1	33	Forest restoration has been undertaken on >200,000 ha of agricultural land in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, USA, during the past few decades. Decisions on where and how to restore bottomland forests are complex and dependent upon landowner objectives, but for conservation of silvicolous (forest-dwelling) birds, ecologists have espoused restoration through planting a diverse mix of densely spaced seedlings that includes fast-growing species. Application of this planting strategy on agricultural tracts that are adjacent to extant forest or within landscapes that are predominately forested has been advocated to increase forest area and enhance forested landscapes, thereby benefiting area-sensitive, silvicolous birds. We measured support for these hypothesized benefits through assessments of densities of breeding birds and reproductive success of 9 species on 36 bottomland forest restoration sites. Densities of thamnic (shrub-scrub dwelling) and silvicolous birds, such as yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens), indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea), and white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) were positively associated with 1) taller trees, 2) greater stem densities, and 3) a greater proportion of forest within the landscape, whereas densities of birds associated with grasslands, such as dickcissel (Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), were negatively associated with these variables. Vegetation structure, habitat edge, and temporal effects had greater influence on nest success than did landscape effects. Taller trees, increased density of woody stems, greater vegetation density, and more forest within the landscape were often associated with greater nest success. Nest success of grassland birds was positively related to distance from forest edge but, for thamnic birds, success was greater near edges. Moreover, nest success and estimated fecundity of thamnic species suggested their populations are self-sustaining on forest restoration sites, whereas these sites are likely population sinks for grassland and open-woodland species. We recommend restoration strategies that promote rapid development of dense forest stands within largely forested landscapes to recruit breeding populations of thamnic and silvicolous birds that have reproductive success sufficient to sustain their populations.

Maguire, Timothy J.; Hadley, Keith S.				Natural Areas Journal	30	2		124-137	Apr 2010	2010				English	2	20	We employed a multi-scale approach to examine the evolving spatial patterns of avian diversity following rewatering (1991-1999) of the Owens River Gorge in eastern California. We based our analysis on three independent data sets representing 18 canyon locations (4 reference and 14 rewatered) consisting of bird counts, measures of landscape variation (canyon dimensions), and vegetation structure and composition (foliage height diversity, total vegetation volume, and plant species diversity). We analyzed our data by grouping sites according to bird diversity and environmental factors using Sorenson's similarity index and cluster analysis and by employing correlation (Spearman rank) and regression (multiple and backward stepwise) procedures to determine the relative importance of environmental factors on avian diversity at different spatial scales. Our results revealed: (1) that valley bottom width determines the extent of riparian vegetation (rs = .73, P < 0.01) and, indirectly, bird species diversity (rs = .52, P < 0.05) at the landscape scale; and (2) that avian diversity at the habitat scale is most strongly correlated with plant species diversity (rs = .57, P < 0.05). These results indicate avian diversity is responding to habitat restoration resulting from the rewatering of the Owens River Gorge but is spatially constrained by canyon dimensions that limit the area of riparian habitat and, indirectly, plant species diversity. We suggest future evaluations of stream restoration and its role on animal communities consider the merits of a multi-scale analysis.

Crow, Claire; van Riper, Charles, III				Natural Areas Journal	30	2		191-201	Apr 2010	2010				English	2	35	Natural area managers in regions of the semi-arid west, particularly on the Colorado Plateau. are presently dealing with expanding pinyon (Pious spp. Engelm.) - juniper (Juniperus spp. Engelm.) woodlands on rangelands. Increased equipment costs associated with 'chaining'. and dangers associated with prescribed fires, have resulted in more instances where mechanical thinning of woodlands is being used. Our 2005 to 2006 study within Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. Utah. examined responses of breeding birds to the mechanical reduction of pinyon-juniper woodlands within a randomized 4-block design that incorporated 11 control and nine treatment bird count stations. We surveyed birds within 3.1-ha bird-count stations (n = 20) prior to, and following. pinyon-juniper mechanical reduction treatments. Thinning in April 2006 removed a mean of 92% (+ 6.4% SE) of live trees from treatment blocks. The avian guild most greatly influenced by mechanical thinning included pinyon-juniper obligate species. Species eliminated following mechanical thinning were Gray Vireo (Vireo vicinior) and Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater). while Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerine) numbers were significantly reduced. Birds in the shrub-nesting guild, including the sagebrush specialist Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri), and habitat generalists such as the Bushtit (Psaltriparius minimus). increased in relative abundance following treatment. We conclude that mechanical thinning within the Intermountain West has the potential for natural area managers to design treatments that can influence numbers of both pinyon-juniper and sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) steppe avian species.	van Riper, Charles, III; Univ Arizona, US Geol Survey, 325 Biol Sci E, Tucson, AZ, USA, USA.	charles_van_riper@usgs.gov					Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Zoology; Forestry	0885-8608		Conservation; Conservation measures; Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA	Aves [Habitat management / Mechanical tree thinning / ] [Community structure /  / ] [Forest and woodland / Pinyon-juniper woodland / ] [Utah / South / ].

Smith, Henrik G.; Danhardt, Juliana; Lindstrom, Ake; Rundlof, Maj				Oecologia (Berlin)	162	4		1071-1079	Apr 2010	2010				English	2	93	It has been suggested that organic farming may benefit farmland biodiversity more in landscapes that have lost a significant part of its former landscape heterogeneity. We tested this hypothesis by comparing bird species richness and abundance during the breeding season in organic and conventional farms, matched to eliminate all differences not directly linked to the farming practice, situated in either homogeneous plains with only a little semi-natural habitat or in heterogeneous farmland landscapes with abundant field borders and semi-natural grasslands. The effect of farm management on species richness interacted with landscape structure, such that there was a positive relationship between organic farming and diversity only in homogeneous landscapes. This pattern was mainly dependent on the species richness of passerine birds, in particular those that were invertebrate feeders. Species richness of non-passerines was positively related to organic farming independent of the landscape context. Bird abundance was positively related to landscape heterogeneity but not to farm management. This was mainly because the abundance of passerines, particularly invertebrate feeders, was positively related to landscape heterogeneity. We suggest that invertebrate feeders particularly benefit from organic farming because of improved foraging conditions through increased invertebrate abundances in otherwise depauperate homogeneous landscapes. Although many seed-eaters also benefit from increased insect abundance, they may also utilize crop seed resources in homogeneous landscapes and conventional farms. The occurrence of an interactive effect of organic farming and landscape heterogeneity on bird diversity will have consequences for the optimal allocation of resources to restore the diversity of farmland birds.

Western North American Naturalist	70	1		19-25	April 2010	2010				English	0	11	During winter 1996-1997 and summer 1997, we surveyed birds at 26 study sites in desert grasslands of Arizona and New Mexico to determine tolerance of birds to variability in plant composition and structure. The relationship between bird abundance and vegetative characteristics might be an important consideration in the development of management and restoration plans. Of the 49 bird species we observed, we examined and 16 species in detail for winter and summer seasons, respectively. A noticeable shift in species composition occurred between 3% and 10% woody plant cover. During winter Chestnut-collared Longspurs (Calcarins ornatus) and Horned Link's (Ercmophila alpestris) showed significant positive relationships with grass cover and negative relationships with woody plant cover, occurring in greatest numbers where woody cover was <1%. The richness of sparrow species during winter was highest among sites with 6% to 15% woody plant cover. In addition to showing significant positive relationships with woody cover, Vesper Sparrows (Pooecetes gramineas), Black-throated Sparrows (Amphispiza bilineata), Brewer's Sparrows (Spirella breweri), and Chipping Sparrows (S. passerina) showed significant positive relationships with shrub species richness. Our results showed that reductions of woody plant cover below 3% in combination with the presence of native grasses could substantially enhance the presence of several bird species. Maintenance of woody cover between 6% rind 15% could increase use by a suite of other species, especially wintering sparrows.

The reserve is situated in the northern part of the Lower Silesia, about 50 km from Wroclaw. The area of ponds located within the complex "Ruda Sulowska" amounts to 750,27 ha. The very beginning of fish pond management dates from between XIII-XIV century. In the ponds are bred mainly common carp. The fish ponds in the surroundings of Milicz are of particular importance for Polish populations of several bird species. They also meet the criteria of bird refuges of European significance, both with respect to breeding and migratory birds. Mussels were collected in 1994-1997. In the complex "Ruda Sulowska" (Fig. 1) four species of family Unionidae were found, Anodonta cygnea (strictly protected in Poland) (Fig. 3), A. anatina, Unio pictorum and U tumidus (Tab. 1).

Smythe, Lindsay A.; Haukos, David A.				Restoration Ecology	18	2		215-223	March 2010	2010				English	0	10	Sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) communities are a unique component of grassland bird habitat in eastern New Mexico and have been impacted by human activities for decades. These communities are frequently managed with livestock grazing and herbicide application for shrub control, strategies that potentially can be used to restore the historical shrub-grass composition of this plant community. During spring migration and the breeding seasons of 2004 and 2005, we compared density and community structure of grassland bird species among four combinations of tebuthiuron application and grazing treatments that were being evaluated for restoration of shinnery oak communities. We performed biweekly point transects on sixteen 65-ha study plots in these communities. Density of all avian species combined did not differ between grazed and ungrazed plots. Tebuthiuron-treated plots had a 40% higher average density for combined species than untreated plots. There was a 41% higher average density of all species during spring 2005 than 2004, but density was similar during the breeding season of both years. These trends were predominantly influenced by densities of migratory Cassin's Sparrow (Aimophila cassinii), which were greater in tebuthiuron-treated plots in both years. Densities of resident Meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) exhibited little response to tebuthiuron or grazing treatments. Avian species richness, evenness, and diversity were only minimally affected by the tebuthiuron and grazing treatments. This study occurred over a period of highly variable precipitation, so future assessments, spanning longer wet-dry cycles and maturing plant communities, may be necessary to completely determine avian response to these restoration efforts.

Miller, Karl E.				Wilson Journal of Ornithology	122	1		126-134	Mar 2010	2010				English	2	17	I used a randomized, replicated, controlled study design to test the hypothesis that nest-site availability limits breeding densities of secondary cavity nesting species in even-age southern pine (Pinus spp.) forests. Breeding densities of secondary cavity nesters increased significantly on treated plots after nest boxes were introduced. Total number of nesting attempts also increased several fold post-treatment. These data indicate nest-site availability was a limiting factor for breeding densities of secondary cavity nesting species. The response of individual species to nest boxes ranged from moderately high (Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus)), to low (Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), Eastern Bluebird (Sialia sialis)) to no response (Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus)). At least three factors accounted for interspecific differences in this study: different levels of reliance on cavities excavated in snags, different body sizes, and differences in local population densities. The large number of unoccupied nest boxes (only 9% were used for nesting) suggests secondary cavity nesters were not limited solely by cavity availability but also by habitat quality. Prescribed burning appeared to facilitate discovery and use of nest boxes by birds in this study, consistent with the hypothesis that nest-site limitation is mitigated by habitat structure.

Drever, Mark C.; Martin, Kathy				Forest Ecology and Management	259	5		958-966	Feb 20 2010	2010				English	2	64	Woodpeckers (family Picidae) merit specific monitoring and management efforts, both as keystone/facilitator species and as indicators of forest condition. Recent studies indicated that species richness of woodpeckers was correlated with richness of all forest birds, thus suggesting potential exists for management practices that can address needs of woodpeckers in particular and other forest birds in general. We used data from a long-term study (1995-2008) from forest sites in the interior of British Columbia to evaluate how abundances of seven woodpecker species varied with habitat variables previously identified as associated with forest bird richness. We found that tree species richness had either a neutral or positive effect on the abundance of all woodpecker species, whereas abundances of most woodpecker species tended to be lower in stands with high densities of lodgepole pine. Abundances of most woodpecker species were positively correlated with density of beetle-killed pines. Relative to control sites, higher densities of most woodpecker species were found at harvested sites where most trembling aspen and large Douglas-fir trees had been retained. Therefore, management strategies that favour a mixture of tree species, with particular attention to retention of aspen, should safeguard populations of most woodpecker species. Abundances of individual woodpecker species were weakly but positively inter-correlated before the beetle outbreak, and less so during and post-outbreak. It thus appears that no strong trade-offs exist among woodpecker species. These results, combined with previously identified positive correlations between woodpecker and forest bird richness, indicate woodpeckers can be managed as a suite for the purpose of managing avian biodiversity as a whole.

Lindenmayer, D.B.; Knight, E.J.; Crane, M.J.; Montague-Drake, R.; Michael, D.R.; MacGregor, C.I.				Biological Conservation	143	2		289-301	Feb 2010	2010				English	2	52	Large-scale vegetation clearing accompanying agricultural development has been a major driver of biodiversity loss. Efforts to reverse this problem have often included revegetation, but the Value of revegetated areas for biodiversity is poorly known. We addressed aspects of this knowledge gap using a case study in south-eastern Australia. We quantified relationships between bird species richness and the probability of detection for eight individual bird species and: (i) the context of a planting, i.e. the types of the vegetation cover in the neighborhood of a planting, (ii) the configuration of a planting, i.e. the location and geometry of a planting, and, (iii) the content of planting, i.e. the vegetation features of a planting. The presence and nature of the effects of these explanatory variables varied with each of our response variables. A combination of context, configuration and content variables were needed to explain the variability in species richness and the presence of individual species. Context effects were highly significant, particularly the amount of planted and remnant native vegetation surrounding plantings. We speculate that when the area surrounding a planting was potentially suitable, recognition of planting "patch" boundaries disappeared and, correspondingly, configuration effects such as planting size were limited. Our results suggest that maximizing the value of planted areas for bird biota requires consideration not only of the features of the vegetation within a planting, but also where a planting is placed.

Najera, Andrea; Simonetti, Javier A.				Conservation Biology	24	1		319-324	February 2010	2010				English	1	48	The occurrence of fauna in commercial plantations is often associated with structural complexity. Through a meta-analysis, we tested whether the structural complexity of plantations could enhance bird species assemblages and whether bird assemblages respond differently depending on taxonomic affiliation, body size, and diet. Our analyses included 167 case studies in 31 countries in which bird assemblages in forests and plantations were compared and 42 case studies in 14 countries in which bird assemblages in plantations of different structural complexity were compared. Species richness, but not abundance, was higher in forests than in plantations. Both species richness and abundance were significantly higher in complex than in structurally simple plantations. Taxonomic representation and body size did not differ between forest and plantations, except that there were fewer insectivorous birds in plantations than in forests. In the comparison of simple versus complex plantations, abundance of all taxonomic and dietary groups was higher in complex plantations. Body size did not affect bird species richness or abundance. Independent of the type of plantation, bird richness and abundance were greater in structurally complex plantations. Enhancing the structural complexity of plantations may mitigate their impact and offer habitat for some native species.

Alcaide, Miguel; Negro, Juan J.; Serrano, David; Antolin, Jose L.; Casado, Sara; Pomarol, Manel				Conservation Genetics	11	1		331-338	Feb 2010	2010				English	3	49	We used microsatellites to assess ongoing captive breeding and reintroduction programs of the lesser kestrel. The extent of genetic variation within the captive populations analysed did not differ significantly from that reported in wild populations. Thus, the application of widely recommended management practices, such as the registration of crosses between individuals in proper stud books and the introduction of new individuals into the genetic pools, has proven satisfactory to maintain high levels of genetic variation. The high rates of hatching failure occasionally documented in captivity can therefore not be attributed to depressed genetic variation. Even though genetic diversity in reintroduced populations did not differ significantly when compared to wild populations either, average observed heterozygosities and inbreeding coefficients were significantly lower and higher, respectively, when compared to the captive demes where released birds came. Monitoring of reproductive parameters during single-pairing breeding and paternity inference within colonial facilities revealed large variations in breeding success between reproductive adults. The relative number of breeding pairs that contributed to a large part of captive-born birds (50-56%) was similar in both cases (28.6 and 26.9%, respectively). Thus, the chances for polygyny (rarely in this study), extra- pair paternity (not found in this study) and/or social stimulation of breeding parameters do not seem to greatly affect the genetically effective population size. Independently of breeding strategies, the release of unrelated fledglings into the same area and the promotion of immigration should be mandatory to counteract founder effects and avoid inbreeding in reintroduced populations of lesser kestrels.

Gaines, William; Haggard, Maryellen; Begley, James; Lehmkuhl, John; Lyons, Andrea				Forest Science	56	1		88-99	Feb 2010	2010				English	0	31	We monitored the short-term (<3 years) response of land birds to restoration treatments (thin, burn, and thin-burn) in dry forests located on the eastern slope of the Cascade Range in Washington. Overall avian community composition did not change among the treatments. However, individual species responses varied with the chipping sparrow showing lower density in treatments, whereas hermit thrush, mountain chickadee, white-headed woodpecker, western bluebird, American crow, and common raven increased in treatment units. Daily survival rates of nesting guilds were similar in treated versus control stands; however, burn-only showed lower daily survival rates compared with other treatments. Additional research is needed to validate this result. Cavity-nesters (mountain chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, and house wren) and foliage-nesters (chipping sparrow) used trees that were larger in diameter than available regardless of the treatment. Our results, in combination with other results from this study area, provide important implications for managers: (1) thin-burn treatments were effective at restoring habitat for several avian focal species; (2) spring burn treatments should be carefully designed to achieve desired restoration objectives; (3) large trees provide important habitat functions and are a key component for maintaining or restoring the viability of focal avian species; and (4) additional research is needed to better understand the effects of spring burning and the long-term effects of dry forest restoration treatments.

Morrison, Emily B.; Lindell, Catherine A.; Holl, Karen D.; Zahawi, Rakan A.				Journal of Applied Ecology	47	1		130-138	Feb 2010	2010				English	1	69	1. Active restoration to rehabilitate degraded tropical lands often involves planting tree seedlings, an effective but expensive approach if large areas are planted. Planting small patches of vegetation (tens to a few hundred square metres) has recently been suggested as a more economical restoration technique that mimics natural regeneration processes. However, few studies have examined the consequences of restoration patch size on animals, whose presence and activities are often key to successful ecosystem recovery. 2. We examined the effects of patch size on the foraging behaviour of four resident tropical bird species in a replicated forest restoration experiment in southern Costa Rica. We also measured arthropod abundance and anti-predator vigilance behaviour to assess whether variation in food availability or predation risk could explain patch size effects on foraging behaviour. 3. Prey attack rates were highest, and the effort required to find prey was lowest, in larger patches for three of the four bird species. Arthropod density was approximately twice as great in larger patches (> 3500 m2) compared with smaller patches (< 350 m2). Evidence for patch size differences in predation risk was more limited but risk may be higher in smaller patches. The results indicate that food availability is the primary mechanism driving patch size effects on foraging behaviour, with predation risk being an additional influence for some species in some years. 4. Synthesis and applications. As demonstrated in this study, patches of tens to a few hundreds of metres squared are likely to provide fewer food resources and potentially less cover from predators for vertebrates that use woody habitat, compared with patches of a few thousand square metres. The more limited resources in smaller patches are likely to have short-term and, potentially, long-term consequences for the fitness of organisms. When considering restoration project design, the potential economic and other benefits of planting in smaller patches must be weighed with the potentially negative ecological effects on some taxonomic groups. To increase the probability that patches provide adequate habitat for the largest number of species, we recommend that when financial resources are available, patches of at least a few thousand square metres be planted.

Kalies, E.L.; Chambers, C.L.; Covington, W.W.				Forest Ecology and Management	259	3		333-342	January 25 2010	2010				English	4	85	After a century of fire suppression, conifer forests in the western United States have dramatically departed from conditions that existed prior to Euro-American settlement, with heavy fuel loads and an increased incidence of wildfire. To reduce this threat and improve overall forest health, land managers are designing landscape-scale treatments that strategically locate thinning and burning treatments to disrupt fuel continuity, allowing managed wildfires to burn the remaining area. A necessary step in designing and evaluating these treatments is understanding their ecological effects on wildlife. We used meta-analysis to compare effects of small-diameter removal (thinnings and shelterwoods) and burning treatments, selective harvesting, overstory removal (including clearcutting), and wildfire on wildlife species in southwestern conifer forests. We hypothesized that small-diameter removal and burning treatments would have minimal effects on wildlife compared to other treatments. We found 33 studies that met our criteria by (1) comparing density or reproductive output for wildlife species, (2) using forest management or wildfire treatments, (3) implementing control-impact or before-after control-impact design using unmanaged stands as controls, and (4) occurring in Arizona or New Mexico ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or mixed conifer (Abies/Picea/Pinus) forest. The 22 studies suitable for meta-analysis occurred <=20 years post-treatment on sites <400 ha. Small-diameter harvest and burning treatments had positive effects but thin/burn and selective harvest treatments had no detectable effect on most small mammals and passerine bird species reported in studies; overstory removal and wildfire resulted in an overall negative response. We examined foraging guild responses to treatments; ground-foraging birds and rodents had no strong response. Aerial-, tree-, and bole-foraging birds had positive or neutral responses to the small-diameter removal and burning treatments, but negative responses to overstory removal and wildfire. Small-diameter removal and burning treatments as currently being implemented in the Southwest do not negatively impact most of the wildlife species in the studies we examined in the short-term (<=10 years). We believe a combination of treatments in a patchy arrangement across the landscape will result in the highest diversity and density. We recommend that managers implement thinning and burning treatments, but that future research efforts focus on long-term responses of species at larger spatial scales, use reproductive output as a more informative response variable, and target species for which there is a paucity of data.

Hingston, Andrew B.; Grove, Simon				Forest Ecology and Management	259	3		459-468	January 25 2010	2010				English	0	21	As forests undergo succession after major disturbance events their assemblages of birds also change. Thus the frequency and extent of wildfire or clearfelling in the landscape can potentially affect the species-richness and abundance of forest birds. We used a chronosequence approach to investigate succession of bird communities in Tasmanian lowland wet eucalypt forest, from shortly after disturbance through to old-growth forest aged approximately 200-250 years. The number of native bird species recorded per survey per site increased as a linear function of stand-age. However, succession did not involve a unidirectional transition in assemblage-composition because of differences in successional responses among individual species and also among guilds of birds that mostly inhabited different strata of the forest. This was exemplified by the crescent honeyeater, which was observed most frequently in the youngest (6-8 years) and oldest (200-250 years) forests that we surveyed, and by the superb lyrebird (introduced to Tasmania from mainland south-eastern Australia) which favoured mid-aged regrowth (42-43 years) after clearfelling. Forests aged 200-250 years had the greatest richness-per-survey of those native species that were observed mostly in the lower layer or mid-layer. However, the greatest richness-per-survey of canopy-dwelling species and the highest native species-richness across the survey period were found in forests aged around 150 years. Younger regrowth was generally less rich in birds, although regrowth in the first decade after clearfelling was the only seral stage inhabited by superb fairy-wrens. These results suggest that, in the Tasmanian lowland wet eucalypt forest landscape, species-richness of birds may be greatest when old-growth forest is interspersed with young regrowth forests. Hence for bird conservation, a challenge is to ensure that old-growth forest continues to prevail in the production forest landscape. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The estimation of rare woodpecker species population size has been changed during the last decade significantly: from 4 times (the Medium spotted woodpecker) to 100 times (the White backed woodpecker). The aim of this study is to analyze the species composition and density of woodpecker guilds in the forest of central Lithuania. The census were provided in central part of Lithuania, mainly in mixed deciduous-spruce forests. Totally, census was fulfilled in 35 study plots. The average density of the Great spotted woodpecker was highest (14.66 pair / 100 ha). Other woodpecker species was much rarer: the Black woodpecker (1.80 pair / 100 ha), the Medium spotted woodpecker (1.34 pair / 100 ha), the White-backed woodpecker (1.20 pair /100 ha) and the Lesser spotted woodpecker (1.17 pair / 100 ha) was more than one pair in 100 ha. Mostly rare woodpeckers were the Three-toed woodpecker (0.46 pair / 100 ha), the Grey woodpecker (0.37 pair / 100 ha) and the Green woodpecker (0.06 pair / 100 ha). The analysis showed that abundance of rare woodpecker species is significantly higher in Natura 2000 sites selected for the Three-toed woodpecker protection, but not for the White-backed woodpecker and the Medium spotted woodpecker. The protected areas (Natura 2000 territory selected for any bird species) significantly favour the populations of the White-backed woodpecker and significant on the Medium spotted woodpecker. The abundance of the White-backed woodpeckers were significantly higher in optimum habitats. The density of woodpeckers are varying from country to country but in general is similar and could be explained by methodological and regional (south-north) reasons.

Avian Conservation and Ecology	5	2		5(2)3, 1-14	2010	2010	http://www.ace-eco.org/vol5/iss2/			English	0	2	Declining grassland breeding bird populations have led to increased efforts to assess habitat quality, typically by estimating density or relative abundance. Because some grassland habitats may function as ecological traps, a more appropriate metric for determining quality may be breeding success. Between 1994 and 2003 we gathered data on the nest fates of Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorous), and Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) in a series of fallow fields and pastures/hayfields in western New York State. We calculated daily survival probabilities using the Mayfield method, and used the logistic-exposure method to model effects of predictor variables on nest success. Nest survival probabilities were 0.464 for Eastern Meadowlarks (n = 26), 0.483 for Bobolinks (n = 91), and 0.585 for Savannah Sparrows (n = 152). Fledge dates for first clutches ranged between 14 June and 23 July. Only one obligate grassland bird nest was parasitized by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), for an overall brood parasitism rate of 0.004. Logistic-exposure models indicated that daily nest survival probabilities were higher in pastures/hayfields than in fallow fields. Our results, and those from other studies in the Northeast, suggest that properly managed cool season grassland habitats in the region may not act as ecological traps, and that obligate grassland birds in the region may have greater nest survival probabilities, and lower rates of Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism, than in many parts of the Midwest.

Correlation analysis showed that the densities of 14 bird species were related to particular landscape variables. Several strictly field bird species preferred fragmented fields, cereal cropland and grasslands. Several bird species preferred hedges and abandoned fields with high (>0.5 m) herbaceous vegetation consisting, of perennial plants.

Jaksic, Fabian M.; Farina, Jose M.				Anales del Instituto de la Patagonia	38	1		121-140	2010	2010				English	0	8	Through a review, we attempt to identify what aspects of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) determine the availability of resources that affect avian ecology in the southeastern Pacific. We recognized three functional bird types: seabirds, waterbirds, and landbirds (the latter separately treated as granivorous, insectivorous, carnivorous). The evidence shows that El Nino affects seabirds by reducing their food base. Seabirds feeding on fish, or fish plus squid, generally decrease their population abundance, as a combined result of adult mortality and reproductive failure. Omnivorous seabirds negotiate El Nino periods with modest declines, while those including fishery wastes in their diets show minimal changes during such periods. Waterbirds in the southeastern Pacific benefit from precipitation that accompanies El Nino, which enlarges their wetland habitats. Finally. landbirds are favored by El Nino-driven precipitation, which fires up primary productivity fuelling arthropod and mammal increases. Granivorous birds react promptly to peaks in seed output, while insectivores respond similarly to arthropod abundance. Carnivorous birds take somewhat longer to react to increases in mammal populations. We conclude that (a) Food shortage may be an important key factor for bird populations in the southeastern Pacific, but its effects depend on diet breadth, prey switching, and life history parameters. (b) Seasonal patterns of productivity determine distribution and abundance of resident birds, but variations imposed by occurrences of El Nino and La Nina phases determine the presence and abundance of migratory birds. (c) The dichotomy El Nino versus La Nina or versus 'normal' years is artificial and non conducive. (d) Long-term monitoring is needed to understand the connection between climate and birds.

Oliveira, L.C.; Hankerson, S.J.; Dietz, J.M.; Raboy, B.E.				Animal Conservation	13	1		60-70	January 2010	2010				English	3	50	The golden-headed lion tamarin Leontopithecus chrysomelas occurs in the Atlantic forest of southern Bahia, Brazil, where shade-cocoa agroforestry (known as cabruca) predominates. The economic decline of the cocoa industry has caused many landowners to convert cabruca into cattle pasture or diversify their plantations with other crops. These and prior anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat fragmentation are threatening lion tamarin persistence. For some lion tamarin groups, cabruca comprises a large part of their home range. Considering these factors, the maintenance of the biological diversity in cabruca favorable to golden-headed lion tamarins is of considerable interest to their long-term survival. Here we identify plant species that provide food and sleeping sites for the lion tamarins and examine their occurrence in cabruca plantations, in order to investigate alternatives for conservation management practices that benefit both lion tamarins and cabruca. We determined the total number of trees and the frequency of individuals and species used for food and sleeping sites by lion tamarins in Una Biological Reserve, Bahia, from 1998 to 2006. We used this information to compare the richness and frequency of use across habitats (cabruca, mature and secondary) and to create a ranking index considering various components of a tree species' utility to the lion tamarins. Lion tamarins used 155 tree species, 93 for food and 93 for sleeping sites. Fifty-five species were ranked as 'Extremely Valuable,' eight as 'Valuable' and 92 as 'Of Interest.' Of 48 families, Myrtaceae and Sapotaceae were used the most. Cabruca contained fewer individual trees used by lion tamarins, but the highest frequency of use per tree compared with other habitats, indicating the large influence of single trees in these plantations. Using the key tree species identified in our study in the management of cabruca would be of considerable benefit to the long-term survival of lion tamarins.

Lohmus, Asko; Kinks, Riho; Soon, Mihkel				Baltic Forestry	16	1		76-86	2010	2010				English	2	33	We explored which species of woodpeckers depend on the supply of standing dead trees (snags) in Estonia and how that dependence relates to their invertebrate prey base. In a 900-km2 area in east-central Estonia, we described the snag supply within a radius of 600 m around 73 nests of six woodpecker species and in 30 random transects representing the available forest landscape. We modelled woodpecker habitat preferences as differences between the snag supply around their nests and in random transects, analysed the incidence of woodpecker foraging signs in terms of dead-wood characteristics, and estimated the abundance of arthropods in bark samples collected from snags in late winter. The results confirmed the division of woodpeckers into 'snag specialist' and generalist species. Characteristically, the abundant snag supply in the nesting territories of the three specialised species - White-backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos), Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (D. minor) and Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) - included many alders and Norway spruces and few Scots pines, which generally followed the frequency of use and arthropod abundance in these trees. The scarcity of arthropods in the bark samples from birch coincided with a low frequency of foraging signs on its trunks; however, birch was not avoided around the nests and may host important prey base in its abundant fungal fruit-bodies. Larger snags tended to have more arthropods per unit of bark area but their importance for woodpeckers was not clear. We concur with previous suggestions that the requirements of specialised woodpeckers can be used for deriving tentative targets of snag-retention. In this study, their nesting probability increased from 25% to 75% when snag densities >=5 cm diameter, >=0.5 m height; pine snags excluded) increased from 100 to 200 trunks per hectare. However, snag management should be spatially explicit, because such levels can hardly be sustained all over the landscape, and also consider at least epixylic fungi and specific insects, which require different types of snags than woodpeckers.

Orlowski, Grzegorz				Bird Study	57	2		175-182	2010	2010				English	0	29	Capsule The number of territories of birds nesting in abandoned crop fields was most strongly positively affected by field size and the presence of a railway embankment. Aims To assess the influence of different habitat features on the number of birds nesting in abandoned crop fields. Methods A breeding bird survey was conducted in spring 2002 using the mapping method on 67 abandoned fields located in southwest Poland. The associations between eight habitat features of the abandoned fields and the numbers of particular species and groups of birds, as well as the whole bird community, were tested with a GLM. Results The models for eight individual species revealed the following ranking, in terms of number of species affected by each predictor: area of fields (5), railway embankments and adjacent crop fields (4), roads and power lines (2), and number of trees (1). The number of the most numerous group of birds (species nesting on the ground, 79% of all breeding pairs) was affected by four predictors: field area, railway embankments, power lines and roads. The number of all birds was affected by six predictors: field area, railway embankments, power lines, roads, ditches and trees. Conclusion Limited effects of trees, hedgerows and ditches on the number of territories suggest that abandoned fields without woody vegetation are attractive breeding habitats for many farmland birds. One of the effective ways of protecting farmland bird species in central Europe may be the preservation of abandoned fields in their present form, especially those <5 ha in area.

Bird Study	57	4		415-420	2010	2010				English	4	22	Capsule Hedgerows and margins managed under agri-environment schemes appear to attract greater numbers of some farmland bird species. Aims To examine fine-scale habitat associations of farmland birds to determine whether Entry Level Stewardship, the wider countryside agri-environment scheme for England, provides a mechanism for affecting population changes. Methods Ninety-seven 1-km squares in East Anglia were surveyed to create two-dimensional habitat maps showing the location of all habitat patches and associated stewardship management. Modified territory-mapping techniques were used to produce relative estimates of bird numbers within each discrete habitat patch within each square. The effect of Entry Level Stewardship on species density was then analysed using glms. Results Boundaries managed under Entry Level Stewardship appeared to attract higher densities of Blue Tits, Dunnocks, Common Whitethroats and Yellowhammers. Margins managed under the scheme also had higher densities of Yellowhammers. Conclusions Existing boundary habitat management under Entry Level Stewardship may provide a mechanism for increasing the populations of some farmland bird species. Boundary management options should continue to be promoted, although rebalancing the scheme more towards in-field options is likely to be more widely beneficial.

Santoro, Simone; Manez, Manuel; Green, Andy J.; Figuerola, Jordi				Bird Study	57	4		515-524	2010	2010				English	0	8	Capsule A newly created wetland has been beneficial for the breeding of five heron species and for the settlement and expansion of Glossy Ibises in the region. Aim To determine whether created wetland would lead to the establishment of a heron and ibis breeding colony, and if so, to determine its effects on the distribution of these species in the wider region. Methods Number of pairs breeding at the new wetland and in the region were estimated annually from 1996 to 2008. We investigated whether the growth of the new colony was explained by redistribution of breeding pairs within the region. Results Purple Herons, Squacco Herons and Glossy Ibises colonised the new wetland in 1996. Black-crowned Night Herons settled in 1998, while Cattle and Little Egrets were the last species to establish in the mixed colony in 2001. The population increase was particularly marked for Glossy Ibises (which had bred in Doana only sporadically through the 20th century). Our findings suggest that simple redistribution of pairs does not explain the formation and growth of the new colony. Since the first year of establishment numbers of Glossy Ibises and Purple Herons have shown a significant growth trend at both the new colony and in Doana. Conclusion The creation and management of a new wetland has been successful for the conservation of heron and egret species and promoted the expansion of the Glossy Ibis population across the western Mediterranean region.

Jensen, Niels Odder				Dansk Ornitologisk Forenings Tidsskrift	104	1		12-21	2010	2010				Danish	0	0	The Danish Population of Nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus is estimated to hold 500-600 pairs, of which 80-90% are found on state property, primarily conifer dune plantations in Mid. North and West Jutland. Here. the population was censused in an area of 9200 ha in NW Jutland in the summer of 2007, and the breeding habitats were described to define vegetation characters. Most counts were performed in May-June, when the weather was very suitable with warm evenings and little wind. Nightjar were located primarily as churring males, but also other signs of territorial behaviour were used to estimate breeding attempts. Compared 10 earlier counts. the population had increased by more than 50% since 1995, going from 75 to 117 Churring males. The population increase can be associated with colonization of clear-felled and restocked forest in the 1990s and probably some favourable effects of climate amelioration during the past 20 years. The amount of nocturnal moths, the most important food Source. seems to have increased with warmer weather. National censuses of the Danish Nightjar population in 1996 show that it has "moved westwards" since 1974. a result of vegetation changes in the plantations in the direction of dryer and more open conifer forest increasing population in West Denmark in combination with closer forests in Eastern Denmark. where the population had declined. It is suggested that this trend is still true and that some of the progress may be due to (his trend. In the study area, the population density varied front 0.9 to 2.1 males/km2 with an average of 1.3 males/km2. The 2.1 males/km2 in Vester Torup Plantation is one of the highest densities found in Denmark. and conditions here seem to be optimal at the moment. The habitat composition shows that most territories were found in forests with new clear-fells or young conifer restocks (68%). Clearings of less than 2-3 ha may not be suitable as breeding habitats. The Population in each forest wits compared to the future forest design and management plans. and a population prognosis is given. Future management is described as "natural forest management." Danish forests will he allowed to grow more wild with fewer or no clear-fells. and this will favour many bird species and lead to greater species diversity overall. On the other hand, this forest type misses areas with young forest and clear-fells, which are the main breeding ground of Nightjars and a range of other species. Hence, the analysis indicates a decrease in Nightjar breeding Populations along with implementing the new forest management schemes. unless specific compensatory measures are taken. It is proposed that the loss of clear-fells should be compensated by natural mechanisms like forest fires, free sand drift and heather management with a range of regrowth stages.

Brunet, Jorg; Fritz, Orjan; Richnau, Gustav				Ecological Bulletins	53			77-94	2010	2010				English	3	12	In this review we compare stand-scale patterns of biodiversity in managed and unmanaged European beech Fagus sylvatica forests and discuss the implications for sustainable forest management. Beech forests managed with single stem or group harvest systems retain the multi-layered and multi-aged stand structure of old-growth beech forest, but old and senescent trees are removed and the amount of dead wood is signiicantly reduced. Shelterwood or clearcut management involves an additional change to large single-layered, even-aged stands. Beech forests managed with traditional shelterwood systems possess a relatively low value for the conservation of most species groups reviewed. The general sensitivity of different species groups to shelterwood forestry roughly increased in the following order: herbaceous plants < soil macrofungi < ground dwelling arthropods < land snails < saproxylic fungi < hole nesting birds and saproxylic insects < epiphytic lichens and bryophytes < epixylic bryophytes. The retention of substantial numbers of trees in shelterwood systems will improve the situation considerably for saproxylic species and for species which use dead wood for shelter and foraging, e.g. ground arthropods and snails. Measures to promote biodiversity in man- aged stands should also include the maintenance of a natural hydrology. Selectively harvested beech forests provide generally more suitable habitat than shelterwood managed forests for epiphytic and epixylic species by maintaining a stable micro-climate. The most demanding epiphytes need a substantial number of slow-growing trees which are retained. A continuous availability of habitat trees older than 180 yr and >20 m3 ha-1 dead wood are probably required to maintain a rich biodiversity in managed beech forests. The results suggest that only selectively harvested stands retaining many trees may approach the overall biodiversity of old-growth beech forests. Due to the patchy distribu- tion of such forests, more knowledge on how rare beech forest species disperse between suitable habitats is necessary to design reliable concepts for biodiversity management at a landscape scale.

Using line transects we surveyed the bird community of a natural Pinus canariensis forest burned in the summer of 2007 on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Our goal was to identify important environmental variables and the thresholds that influenced the pattern of bird abundance at the community, foraging guild, and species-specific level. Models were constructed by means of regression trees and cross validation applying the 1-SE rule. Mixed results were observed and only 2 species were clearly affected by fire severity. Overall, total bird abundance, total species richness, and total bird diversity were positively influenced by low, very low, and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively, and the presence of either Erica or Myrica shrubs. Consequently, high canopy fire severity had an overall negative effect on bird community characteristics. Abundance of Myrica shrubs affected positively general ground foragers such as common blackbird (Turdus merula cabrerae) and Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis), a canopy forager. The number of thin trees was important for canopy foragers such as goldcrest (Regulus regulus teneriffae) and African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae teneriffae), but also for a bark forager, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major canariensis). European robin (Erithacus rubecula superbus) and the ubiquitous endemic blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea teydea) were influenced by low and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively. We recommend that land managers incorporate these results into future post-fire management plans. Priority post-fire actions should be directed toward the protection and conservation of the endemic blue chaffinch, a species of conservation concern on the nearby island of Gran Canaria.

The results show the strong sensitivity of birds to environmental changes and their large selectivity in the choice of habitats. In particular uneven- aged forests remain particularly suited to maintain over time a bird community richer and more stable than the even-aged forests.

Suddaby, D.; Nelson, T.; Veldman, J.				Irish Wildlife Manuals	44			1-199	2010	2010				English	0	4	The populations of breeding waders occurring on machair grasslands and associated habitats in the west of Ireland were re-surveyed in 2009. Fifty five sites, surveyed in either 1985 or 1996, within Counties Donegal, Sligo, Mayo and Galway were visited at least once over the breeding season (April to June). Forty nine of the sites were considered to have machair as their primary habitat. Seven species of wader were recorded breeding. These were lapwing Vanellus vanellus, redshank Tringa totanus, dunlin Calidris alpina, snipe Gallinago gallinago, oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, ringed plover Charadrius hiaticula and common sandpiper Actitis hypoleucos. Lapwing and redshank are red listed in Birds of Conservation Concern in Ireland (Lynas et al, 2007), with dunlin being listed in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC). Thirty of the sites held at least one territorial pair of breeding waders. In total, 714 breeding wader territories of seven species were recorded from a total area of 3,904 ha surveyed. Of these, 327 pairs (46%) were recorded on the machair plain covering 2,986 ha whilst the rest (387 pairs) were recorded on the adjacent areas surveyed covering 918 ha. Significantly, 65% of all the breeding wader territories (464 pairs) were recorded from just four sites which were Inishkea North (35%), Inishkea South (17%), Roonagh Lough (7%) and Trawmore (6%). Only the first three of these sites were considered to be of high importance based on an evaluation of three attributes and the resulting index value. Previous machair breeding wader surveys recorded totals of 604 pairs (Nairn & Sheppard, 1985) and 697 pairs (Madden et al., 1998) respectively. This would indicate that the breeding wader populations over the past 12 years are relatively stable. However, due to some differences in the survey areas between years, direct comparisons are not possible. Instead, densities at key sites were compared, and these indicate declines of the order of 30%. On a county basis, Co. Mayo held the majority of the recorded breeding wader territories with 515 pairs of seven species. Of these, 212 pairs were recorded on the machair plain covering 1,341 ha. Next was Co. Donegal with 114 breeding wader territories of five species. Of these, 51 pairs were recorded on the machair plain covering 787 ha. Co. Galway held 78 breeding wader territories of five species with 57 pairs on the machair plain covering 611 ha. Finally, Co. Sligo had only one site holding seven pairs. Of the seven species of breeding wader recorded, lapwing was the most numerous species with a total of 230 pairs from 23 sites with the top three sites being Inishkea North (84 pairs), Trawmore (18 pairs) and Roonagh Lough (15 pairs). Ringed plover and oystercatcher were the next most abundant species with totals of 170 pairs and 122 pairs, respectively. The next three species, in descending order, were snipe (96 pairs), dunlin (52 pairs) and redshank (27 pairs). The final species, common sandpiper was the least numerous species with a total of 17 pairs. Dunlin, being an Annex I listed species is of key conservation concern. They were only recorded breeding at seven sites, all of which were in Co. Mayo. These were Inishkea North (34 pairs), Roonagh Lough (6 pairs), Inishkea South (4 pairs), Fahy Lough (4 pairs), Dooyork (2 pairs), Dooaghtry (1 pair) and Lough Baun (1 pair). Direct comparisons with the 1996 survey from 32 sites where the area of machair plain surveyed is comparable, indicates that there has been a 38% decline in the breeding wader populations, from 433 pairs to 267 pairs. On a county basis, these population declines were greatest in Co. Sligo (down by 75%), then Co. Donegal with a 69% decline followed by Co. Mayo with a 27% decline. Co. Galway was the only county to show an increase, with populations increasing by 37%. Overall, density estimates were prepared for each year and site to enable comparisons where the areas surveyed were not identical. These comparisons indicate a 30% decline since 1996 and a 24% decline since 1985. However, when assessing the breeding wader populations at the mainland sites alone, these populations have declined by up to 63% (68% since 1985). In contrast, the populations on the offshore islands have increased by 66% overall since 1996 (301% since 1985). The key site to have notably increased in population size, and hence influence the differences found between the surveys, is Inishkea North, where the total number of breeding pairs has increased by 344% since 1996 (709% since 1985). Overall, the apparent increase in territorial oystercatchers noted in the 1996 survey has not continued. In fact, their numbers have decreased by 23% since then, and by 32% when excluding the offshore islands. In contrast, the ringed plover populations have continued to increase by 38% since 1996, although their populations at the mainland sites have actually decreased by 47%. Breeding lapwings have declined by 35% overall. Their rate of decline being much greater at the mainland sites with a 69% decline noted. The decline between 1985 and 1996 in the dunlin breeding populations continues with a further 27% decline. The decline being greater at the mainland sites and, at 88% is the largest decline noted for any of the breeding wader species. Breeding dunlin on machair appear to be contracting in their breeding range as, although five comparable sites held breeding dunlin between the three surveys, 76% (34 pairs) were recorded at one site, Inishkea North. The same island also being noted for the increase in breeding redshanks (36%) since 1996. Based on these findings it is estimated that, if declines continue at the observed rates, the breeding wader populations will soon be at unsustainably low levels, indeed this may well already be the case at some mainland sites, where densities of >0.1 pairs/ha occur. For lapwings these levels may be reached by 2015 and dunlin may become extinct as a breeding species by then at the mainland sites, with the island sites following soon after. Without urgent intervention to protect these remaining populations and bring about their recovery, then several key breeding wader species may be lost from the Irish machair grasslands altogether in the near future. Breeding waders are highlighted as a key suite of species requiring conservation action under the European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland in respect of implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives (issued in December 2007). Previous research (Suddaby & Newtown, 2006; Thompson et al, 2007; Gamero et al., 2008; Troake & Suddaby, 2008) has indicated that a range of threats to breeding waders occur at these sites, which can be broadly categorised as predation by avian and mammalian predators and habitat loss and degradation. Based on the findings of this survey, it is clear that urgent action is required to protect, maintain and restore the existing populations. The following suite of actions, encompassing both management and research and monitoring, are recommended as a matter of urgency: Assess specific threats to breeding wader populations on a site by site basis and produce a plan of action for each site to address the key threats. At key sites where the predator threat is known, provide protection, at least in the short term to increase breeding wader productivity, for example by the use of predator fences or other similar measures. Trial machair and associated grassland habitat management specifically for the benefit breeding waders at key sites and at sites with high potential for restoration. On the basis of results of these trials, develop a prescription for machair breeding waders inclusion in future agri-environment schemes. Monitor breeding wader parameters at key machair sites every five years to better understand population fluctuations. Conduct further research on key populations (including potential predator species) to be understand population dynamics (both predator and prey) and target remedial action effectively. Survey breeding wader populations in other areas in the wider countryside, for example grassland sites and offshore islands not covered in this survey, to ascertain national population levels.

Mullie, Wim C.; Gueye, Youssoupha				Journal of Orthoptera Research	19	1		139-155	2010	2010				English	0	7	A study at Khelcom, Central Senegal, from September 2008 till June 2009 tested two different dose rates (25 and 50 gconidia/ha) of the mycoinsecticide Green Muscle[registered trademark] (Metarhizium acridum) and an untreated control, against grasshoppers in a field trial on nine 400-ha plots in three blocks. The study area was a deforested sylvo-pastoral reserve, 12.5% cultivated, whereas the remainder was fallow or grassland in succession. Grasshopper densities were calculated by executing transect and quadrat counts on plots. The grasshopper community structure was assessed by systematic sweep-net sampling on plots. From these data grasshopper biomass on plots was calculated for each sampling date. Bird numbers were counted on the same transects by the Distance Sampling technique and their densities calculated from Effective Strip Widths (ESW). Energetic requirements of individual bird species were calculated from digestibility-corrected Field Metabolic Rates (FMRs) and for acridivorous species their daily intake of grasshoppers was calculated. Grasshopper densities were very high, with up to 90 ind./m2 in September and 30-35 ind./m2 in October. Numbers and biomass decreased on treated plots as grasshoppers became infected, and remained significantly different from control plots for three months (until January). The relative importance of grasshopper consumption by birds increased between October (high grasshopper densities) and December (medium densities) from an initial 0.06 ([plus or minus]0.03) %/day to a ceiling of 1.6 ([plus or minus]0.9)% per day. Total grasshopper removal during the dry season was 70 %, whereas during the rainy season this was < 1%. Birds specifically captured large and medium-bodied grasshoppers, but rarely small-bodied species, whose numbers initially increased. These findings were corroborated by field observations and by analysis of regurgitated pellet contents of Montagu's Harriers, i.e., small-bodied grasshoppers were only 1.4 - 2.6% of all grasshoppers taken, whereas they constituted 61 - 68% of random samples from the field. Densities of acridivorous Palaearctic migratory birds, in particular White Stork, Ciconia ciconia, Montagu's Harrier, Circus pygargus and Lesser Kestrel, Falco naumanni, were very high and unprecedented elsewhere. Their numbers largely exceeded the 1% criterion for international importance.

McIntyre, Annie F.; Heath, Julie A.; Jannsen, Joseph				Northeastern Naturalist	17	3		493-504	2010	2010				English	0	5	We evaluated thirteen years (1995[long dash]2007) of Charadrius melodus (Piping Plover) nesting activity at Jones Beach State Park (JBSP) to examine temporal trends in the number of pairs, productivity, total young produced per year, and nest initiation. The number of plover pairs has decreased over time at JBSP, while productivity (and total number of young produced per year) has increased. Productivity has increased more at JBSP compared to other areas in their range. In addition, nest initiation was significantly later in the nesting season in recent years. Increased productivity indicates that management efforts to increase this population parameter may have had a positive effect on nesting plovers. The decreased numbers of nesting pairs, however, suggests that management techniques to increase numbers of breeding pairs, such as nesting-habitat restoration, may also be necessary to increase local population size. In the absence of suitable nesting habitat for recruitment of locally fledged birds, JBSP may be functioning as a "source" for other regional breeding populations.

Rybak, Justyna				Opera Corcontica	47		(supplementum 1)	239-246	2010	2010				Polish	0	0	Objectives were to assess the sensitivity of epigeic invertebrates to sulphur contamination in forested, mountainous ecosystem. Sulphur compounds are among the main pollutants contributing to soil acidification and posing a threat to ecosystem health. The assessment was done with the application of a tool which is not based, as usual, on the use of physical, chemical and microbiological indicators. The applied index, called QBS index, is a new Italian approach based on the types of edaphic arthropods. The QBS is particularly sensitive to land management practices but has never been used in the assessment of sulphur contamination level. The aim of this study was to examine the usefulness of this tool for the indication of sulphur contaminants. We found that QBS index was not able to reflect very subtle changes in the invertebrates assemblages (species composition and change of dominant taxa), although, QBS values were generally very low which corresponds with poor conditions of studied area and the presence of spruce monocultures. Simpson index' values do not show any correlation with QBS values. Obtained high values are probably connected with change of dominant taxa in affected biocenosis, whereas the number of arthropods stayed nearly at the same level.

There were 7[long dash]8 breeding territories of White-backed Woodpecker and five of Three-toed Woodpecker (with the densities of 0.5[long dash]0.6 and 0.4 territories/10 km2 of forest area, respectively). White-backed Woodpecker inhabits 80-year or older beech forests (four territories) and multispecies deciduous forests on valley slopes (four territories). Three-toed Woodpecker occupied managed spruce forests, partially decayed as a result of Bark-beetle outbreak (four territories) and older than 60-year fir-spruce forests (one territory). Both species were detected mostly above 650 m a.s.l. on steep slopes where forest exploitation is limited, and in nature reserve (where many old trees and relatively high amount of dead wood still exist). In the whole Beskid Sredni range, the total number of breeding territories of White-backed Wood-pecker and Three-toed Woodpecker can be estimated at 10[long dash]15 for both of them.

Ortega-Alvarez, Ruben; MacGregor-Fores, Ian				Ornitologia Neotropical	21	4		519-533	2010	2010				English	1	41	Through habitat trait changes, urbanization can represent a threat to biodiversity. However, such effects depend on the capacity of wildlife to tolerate urban-related hazards and use urban resources. In this study, we measured the relative magnitude of the effect that human activity, the presence/abundance of potential bird predators, urban infrastructure, vegetation characteristics, and the presence/abundance of House Sparrows have on native urban park bird species. Our results show that the most important variables explaining the abundance of the studied bird species were vegetation ones, followed by both urban infrastructure variables and the number of potential bird predators. The results of this study show that the relative magnitude of the studied set of variables is species-dependent. Thus, proposing generalized park management and planning activities based on this study could be misleading. However, based on our results, we suggest three management and planning activities that could enhance native bird species numbers within urban parks: (1) increasing the abundance of old trees in urban parks; (2) avoiding urban infrastructure components within parks; and (3) carefully choosing shrub species that could attract large number of birds. Although the presence/abundance of House Sparrows and the number of passing pedestrians were not the principal variable explaining the abundance of any of the studied species, our results suggest that lowering the abundance of House Sparrows and passing pedestrians could enhance the abundance of native bird species in urban parks.

Reif, Jiri; Marhoul, Pavel				Sylvia	46			87-105	2010	2010				Czech	0	0	Birds breeding in open habitats have been declining throughout Europe, probably due to agricultural intensification and habitat loss. Abandoned military training sites can serve as important refuges for these species. This study summarizes results of our survey in 42 small-sized abandoned military training sites in the Czech Republic. At each site, we mapped occurrence of all birds during two visits in the breeding season of 2009. Based on these data, we calculated species richness of the particular sites, overall density of each species at the occupied sites and assessed habitat requirements of the species. The highest densities were recorded in species associated with dense scrubland (Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla, Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella). The species-richest sites were dominated by forest. However, the most remarkable bird communities were found at sites with scarce scrub and tree cover. Such sites were characterized by high abundance of the Corn Bunting (Miliaria calandra) or Woodlark (Lullula arborea) and presence of the Stonechat (Saxicola torquata), Northern Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) or Nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus). Therefore, succession of scrubland and forests at the abandoned military training sites reduces their value as refuges for open habitat birds. To maintain importance of these sites, we recommend (i) that their conservation value is recognised by governmental conservation authorities and an adequate level of their legal protection is established to prevent building activities; (ii) to block succession vegetation changes using even some unusual management tools such as motocross or tourism.

Woodin, Marc C.; Skoruppa, Mary Kay; Pearce, Bryan D.; Ruddy, Amanda J.; Hickman, Graham C.				U S Geological Survey Open-File Report	2010-1115			i-viii, 1-47	2010	2010				English	0	6	Grassland birds have undergone widespread decline throughout North America during the past several decades. Causes of this decline include habitat loss and fragmentation because of conversion of grasslands to cropland, afforestation in the East, brush and shrub invasion in the Southwest and western United States, and planting of exotic grass species to enhance forage production. A large number of exotic plant species, including grasses, have been introduced in North America, but most research on the effects of these invasions on birds has been limited to breeding birds, primarily those in northern latitudes. Research on the effects of exotic grasses on birds in winter has been extremely limited. This is the frst study in southern Texas to examine and compare winter bird responses to native and exotic grasslands. This study was conducted during a period of six years (2003[long dash]2009) on United States Navy facilities in southern Texas including Naval Air Station[long dash]Corpus Christi, Naval Air Station[long dash]Kingsville, Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Waldron, Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Orange Grove, and Escondido Ranch, all of which contained examples of native grasslands, exotic grasslands, or both. Data from native and exotic grasslands were collected and compared for bird abundance and diversity; ground cover, vegetation density, and foristic diversity; bird and vegetation relationships; diversity of insects and arachnids; and seed abundance and diversity. Effects of management treatments in exotic grasslands were evaluated by comparing numbers and diversity of birds and small mammals in mowed, burned, and control areas. To determine bird abundance and bird species richness, birds were surveyed monthly (December[long dash]February) during the winters of 2003[long dash]2008 in transects (100 meter x 20 meter) located in native and exotic grasslands distributed at all five U.S. Navy facilities. To compare vegetation in native and exotic grasslands, vegetation characteristics were measured during 2003[long dash]2008 in the same transects used for bird surveys and included fve measures of ground cover, plus estimates of plant species richness, vegetation density (visual obstruction) at two different heights, and shrub numbers. These data, plus seasonal rainfall, were then used to evaluate components of variation in native and exotic grasslands. Relations between total bird numbers and bird species richness with environmental variation in native and exotic grasslands were compared. To compare diversity of arthropods in native and exotic grasslands, insects and arachnids were collected using three different methodologies (standardized sweep-net, random sweep-net, and pitfall traps) during four seasons, (2005[long dash]2006), at Naval Air Station[long dash]Corpus Christi, Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Waldron, and Naval Air Station[long dash]Kingsville. To com- pare seed abundance and diversity between native and exotic grasslands, seeds were collected for two winters (2004[long dash]2006) at Naval Air Station[long dash]Corpus Christi and Naval Air Station[long dash] Kingsville. To evaluate effects of management on grassland vertebrates, abundance and diversity of birds and small mammals were estimated and compared in exotic grasses subjected to mowing, burning, or no active management (control) for one full year (2008[long dash]2009). Observations were made of 1,044 birds of 30 species in grassland transects during five winters. The Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) was the most common bird, which, with 644 detections, accounted for 63 percent of all individuals identifed to species. Meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) and Le Conte's Sparrows (Ammodramus leconteii) were the second (10 percent) and third (7 percent) most abundant bird species, respectively. Six of the seven most abundant spe- cies detected in grasslands were grassland species, and their numbers accounted for 87 percent of all birds, but 20 of the 30 species (67 percent) that used grasslands were not grassland species. Seven species observed in grassland transects during the study were Species of Conservation Concern: Le Conte's Sparrow, Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Long-billed Curlew (Numenius americanus), Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), Cassin's Sparrow (Aimophila cassinii), and Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus). Native grasslands consistently supported greater bird species richness than exotic grasslands. In one winter, exotic grasslands supported more birds than native grasslands. Native grasslands were determined to have more forb cover, more bare ground, and greater plant species rich- ness than exotic grasslands, whereas exotic grasslands were characterized by more grass cover and relatively greater veg- etation density during dry years. Not only did these individua measures differ between native and exotic grasslands, but components of variation also differed. In native grasslands, grass density and cover contributed more to variation, wherea in exotic grasslands, non-grass vegetation was a greater component of variation. Total bird numbers and bird species richness in native grasslands were related to the principal component that contained a measure of litter cover. Total bird numbers and bird species richness in exotic grasslands indicated no signifcant relationships with any of the principa components of variation. The two most common insect orders in native grasslands were Hymenoptera and Coleoptera, which accounted for 42 percent of all insects. The two most common insect orders in exotic grasslands were Hemiptera and Homoptera, which accounted for about 80 percent of all insects. Insect family richness was greater in exotic grasslands than in native grass- lands in two of four seasons. Proportions of arachnid families were similar in native and exotic grasslands, but arachnid family richness was greater in exotic grasslands than in native grasslands. Abundance of seeds was greater in exotic than in native grasslands. However, seed diversity was greater in native grasslands than in exotic grasslands. Among the three types of management (mowed, burned, and control) applied to exotic grasses, birds were most abundant in the mowed area. Sedge Wrens, however, were never encountered in mowed sites. Meadowlarks were similarly abundant in all treatments, but Le Conte's Sparrows were detected only in the control (unmanaged) area. Hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) accounted for 93 percent of all rodent captures, with the number of captures peaking December through February. Hispid cotton rat numbers and total rodent numbers were greatest in control and pre-burn areas, and lowest in the mowed area. Mammal diversity, however, was greatest in the mowed habitat. Native and exotic grasslands differed essentially in all categories (bird numbers and diversity, vegetation characteristics, components of variation, diversity of insects and arachnids, and seed abundance and diversity) used to measure and compare them. This indicates that fundamental ecosys- tem processes have been altered after native grasslands have undergone invasion and ultimate domination by exotic grass species. Future research in Texas grassland ecosystems is essential because: 1) Texas sustains more area in grasslands than any other state or province in the Central Flyway; 2) Texas serves as the winter destination or migration pathway for hundreds of species of birds, including winter residents an Neotropical migrants; 3) ecology, distribution, and numbers o grassland birds wintering in southern latitudes of the United States remains poorly understood; and 4) climate change threatens to further accelerate advances of invading grass species.

Pierluissi, Sergio				Waterbirds	33			123-132	2010	2010				English	2	14	Important and unique breeding bird communities occur in rice fields throughout the world, but little is known about breeding densities and nest success, and, therefore, the value of rice fields to breeding birds. Breeding bird use of rice fields is divided into five categories: 1) nesting in standing rice crop, 2) nesting on levees within fields or at field perimeters, 3) nesting in associated irrigation canals and ditches, 4) nesting in other wet areas that exist because of rice cultivation, and 5) use of fields for foraging, while breeding in adjacent habitats. Nest density and nest success vary greatly based on the region, management practices, and species' requirements. Birds commonly nesting in rice fields include ducks, bitterns, rails, shorebirds, terns and some passerines. Herons often use rice fields heavily while breeding in adjacent habitat. Research on nest densities, nest success, nestling and fledgling success, and microhabitat selection is needed to better understand the bird communities that use rice fields.

Bonnot, Thomas W.; Millspaugh, Joshua J.; Rumble, Mark A.				Forest Ecology and Management	259	2		220-228	December 15 2009	2009				English	3	31	Areas of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks in the Black Hills can provide habitat for black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), a U.S. Forest Service, Region 2 Sensitive Species. These outbreaks are managed through removal of trees infested with mountain pine beetles to control mountain pine beetle populations and salvage timber resources. To minimize impacts to black-backed woodpeckers while meeting management objectives, there is a need to identify characteristics of these areas that support black-backed woodpeckers. We examined the habitat associations of this species nesting in areas of beetle outbreaks in the Black Hills, South Dakota in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic approach and discrete choice models to evaluate nest-site selection of 42 woodpecker nests at 3 spatial scales-territory, nest area, and nest tree. At the territory scale (250 m around nest), availability and distribution of food best explained black-backed woodpecker selection of beetle outbreaks versus the surrounding forest. Selection at the territory scale was positively associated with densities of trees currently infested by mountain pine beetles and indices of wood borer (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) abundance, and was greatest at distances of 50-100 m from the nearest patch of infestation. At the nest-area scale (12.5 m radius around the nest), densities of snags positively influenced nest-area selection. Finally, at the nest-tree scale, aspen (Populus tremuloides) and 3-5-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags were important resources. The association between abundant wood-boring insects and black-backed woodpeckers creates a difficult challenge for forest managers. In the absence of fire, areas of beetle outbreak might serve as the only substantial source of habitat in the Black Hills. Regulating insect populations via salvage logging will reduce key food resources to black-backed woodpeckers during nesting. Therefore, given the relatively infrequent occurrence of large-scale fire in the Black Hills, management should recognize the importance of beetle-killed forests to the long-term viability of the black-backed woodpecker population in the Black Hills.

Montague-Drake, R.M.; Lindenmayer, D.B.; Cunningham, R.B.				Biological Conservation	142	12		2896-2903	December 2009	2009				English	3	59	Significant biodiversity loss is characteristic of agricultural landscapes worldwide. Biodiversity recovery efforts in such landscapes can be hamstrung by a paucity of information on factors affecting species' distributions, particularly for threatened and/or declining species. The temperate woodlands of south-eastern Australia have been extensively modified for agriculture and numerous bird taxa are declining. We have explicitly identified habitat and landscape attributes of woodland remnants affecting site occupancy by 13 woodland bird species of conservation concern. Using case-control data and linear logistic regression, we found that site occupancy for each species was related to both habitat and landscape variables. Habitat variables of particular importance included those in the ground layer (an abundance of leaf litter, an intact surface crust of mosses and lichens and a scarcity of annual grasses) and overstorey (a scarcity of eucalypt dieback and an abundance of mistletoe). Landscape variables strongly affecting site occupancy included the number of paddock trees and the area of native grass within 500 m of a site. Many of our study species were found most often in regrowth remnants. Our findings indicate a gap between current conservation practices and the actual habitat requirements of woodland bird species of conservation concern. Successful management will require protection and/or rehabilitation of the ground layer and overstorey of woodland remnants and sympathetic management of the surrounding landscape. It also will require managers to go beyond current practices of conserving old growth remnants and establishing replantings to maintaining and creating stands of woodland regrowth.

Breeuwer, Angela; Berendse, Frank; Willems, Frank; Foppen, Ruud; Teunissen, Wolf; Schekkerman, Hans; Goedhart, Paul				Biological Conservation	142	12		2949-2953	December 2009	2009				English	1	57	Since 1992 the European Union helps member states to reverse the loss of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes by the financial support of agri-environment schemes. Long-term studies investigating the effects of these schemes are an essential prerequisite for the development of an effective policy to restore biodiversity on farmland. In Dutch meadow landscapes almost all agri-environment schemes focus on the restoration of meadow bird populations by postponement of the mowing date. Between 1990 and 2002 we measured long-term changes in meadow bird densities in areas with and without agri-environment schemes in the Netherlands, both before and after the start of the contract. During these years bird territories were surveyed during five field visits between 15 March and 15 June. Densities of black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), and redshank (Tringa totanus) were higher in the areas with management agreements, but these differences were already present before the start of the contracts. After the start of the management contracts densities of black-tailed godwit and oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) did not increase, while those of lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) and redshank even declined relative to the control areas. It is concluded that the current agri-environment schemes are not sufficient to restore meadow bird populations in Dutch agricultural landscapes. In addition to the prescribed postponement of the mowing date, it is probably necessary to raise groundwater levels and to reduce fertilization to allow for the development of an open vegetation structure that will increase chick survival to sufficiently high levels.

Ecology, climate change threats and first population estimates from Papua New Guinea.		Simmons, Robert E.; Legra, Leo A.T.				Bird Conservation International	19	4		379-391	December 2009	2009				English	1	8	We undertook a 3-week expedition to Papua New Guinea in April-May 2007 to assess the breeding, threats and Population densities of the Papuan Harrier Circus spilonotus spilothorax and to determine a first global Population estimate for this almost entirely unknown species. Two of the first nests known were discovered in April 2007 with three chicks each, in the eastern lowlands, in rank grass and reeds. The melanistic form of this subspecies was more common in the lowlands ( 1,500 m a.s.l) than in the highlands, but interbreeding of this and the typical form occurred ill the lowlands. Movements of identifiable individuals through two highland grasslands indicated up to eight birds per day oil passage, corroborating local knowledge that other raptors move into the highlands at the start of the dry season (April). Linear road counts indicated no harriers in the wooded highlands but Up to 2.9 harriers 10 km-1 in lowland grasslands. Area counts gave all average of 6.5 harriers 100 km-2 in the grasslands and a breeding density of 1.21. nests 100 km-2. Given that preferred grassland and swamp habitat comprises c. 7% of the forest-dominated island of New Guinea, the global Papuan Harrier Population can be no more than c. 3,600 birds and c. 740 breeding pairs. Wildfires peaked at 38 per month in the Study area, Occur throughout the dry season, and led to the loss of both nests. This suggests that many nests and prey may be lost at critical times and burning may be ultimately detrimental for the species. Grassland fires throughout Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are increasing with climatic warming and ENSO events, so we suggest that the Papuan Harrier may warrant a 'Vulnerable' conservation ranking due to small total Population size and all accelerated reduction in habitat quality due to ongoing climate change.

Perot, Aurore; Villard, Marc-Andre				Conservation Biology	23	6		1550-1557	December 2009	2009				English	1	30	Ecological traps and other cases of apparently maladaptive habitat selection cast doubt on the relevance of density as an indicator of habitat quality. Nevertheless, the prevalence of these phenomena remains poorly known, and density may still reflect habitat quality in most systems. We examined the relationship between density and two other parameters of habitat quality in an open-nesting passerine species: the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla). We hypothesized that the average individual bird makes a good decision when selecting its breeding territory and that territory spacing reflects site productivity or predation risk. Therefore, we predicted that density would be positively correlated with productivity (number of young fledged per unit area). Because individual performance is sensitive to events partly determined by chance, such as nest predation, we further predicted density would be weakly correlated or uncorrelated with the proportion of territories fledging young. We collected data in 23 study sites (25 ha each), 16 of which were located in untreated mature northern hardwood forest and seven in stands partially harvested (treated) 1-7 years prior to the survey. Density explained most of the variability in productivity (R2 = 0.73), and there was no apparent decoupling between density and productivity in treated plots. In contrast, there was no significant relationship between density and the proportion of territories fledging >=1 young over the entire breeding season. These results suggest that density reflects habitat quality at the plot scale in this study system. To our knowledge this is one of the few studies testing the value of territory density as an indicator of habitat quality in an open-nesting bird species on the basis of a relatively large number of sizeable study plots.

Avifaunal composition of logged and unlogged karri forest was the most similar so far, 21 years after logging took place, but species richness and total abundance remained higher in unlogged karri forest. In jarrah forest, species composition in four treatments (two logged, two unlogged) had not closely converged after 10 years. Graphs of the abundance of each bird species against time for each treatment in karri and jarrah forest are presented. We recommend that monitoring of these forests be continued, and plots relating to an earlier study in karri forest be re-activated. The data accrued so far provide an important baseline for assessing future impacts from changing climate, and any associated changes in fire regimes and infection by animal disease and Phytophthora cinnamomi, as well as for evaluating the ecologically sustainable basis of forest management.

Tojo, Hitoshi				Ornithological Science	8	2		105-115	Dec 2009	2009				English	0	1	The breeding bird community of the Ogawa Forest Reserve (OFR), an old-growth deciduous forest in central Japan, was surveyed and compared with those of similar forests on Honshu, the largest island of Japan. Of the 63 bird species observed, 51 were potential breeders within the OFR, and 31 of these had territories in the 12-ha study plot for at least I year during the 5 study years. Annual changes in the breeding community were small; the average total density was 491 pairs per 100 ha and the average number of species was 25.6. The Great Tit Parus major was the dominant breeding species, followed by the Willow Tit P. montanus, Narcissus Flycatcher Ficedula narcissina, Coal Tit P. ater, Varied Tit P. varius, and Ashy Minivet Pericrocotus divaricatus, a national red-listed species. Some local red-listed species, such as the Brown Flycatcher Muscicapa dauurica and White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos were also common in the OFR. The results suggest that the OFR harbors a breeding bird community similar to its original status. Cluster and ordination analyses indicated that the avifauna of the OFR was characterized more by the elevation than by the geographic location and thus represents the original bird species diversity of the low-montane beech forests of Honshu. As low-montane areas of Japan have been degraded in recent decades, the OFR provides a valuable indicator of bird species biodiversity for sustainable forest management.

The portion of Planalto Meridional Brasileiro that corresponds to northeast Rio Grande do Sul and south-southeastern of Santa Catarina holds a high bird species richness that represents about 55% of all birds known for Rio Grande do Sul and a little more than 45% of the birds for Santa Catarina. Great portion of this environment is characterized by highland grasslands also known as Campos de Cima da Serra. The grassland avian fauna of the highlands are actually under minor number of published research than the forest avifauna of the Atlantic Forest Biome - Atlantic Forest sensu stricto and Araucaria Forest. Despite this an important parcel of the threatened or near-threatened birds (33%) are grassland species. It may reflect the situation of their habitats, which are under intensive anthropogenic pressure due to, for example, extensive monocultures plantations of Pinus spp., for timber or other uses; hydroelectric dams; roads, inappropriate field management with fire and other kind of human environmental modifications. Based on almost all literature produced about the region and the field work done along the last 10 years focusing on the highlands and their species, we elaborated a brief diagnostic of the knowledge produced until here. We also described the situation of conservation considering the diversity and composition of birds and their habitats. We concluded that the number of published papers about stricted grassland birds is four times lower than the ones that involve birds of forested habitats. We presented 42 new records and/or distribution extensions of birds for the studied region, which reflects the current lack of knowledge about its specific diversity. We emphasized the necessity of conservation initiatives that consider important areas to grassland birds. We indicated four biodiversity conservation priority areas.

Jeffrey; Bleier, William J.				Western North American Naturalist	69	4		491-500	December 2009	2009				English	0	14	Broad-spectrum herbicide applications and improved harvesting efficiency of crops have reduced the availability of weed seeds and waste grains for game and nongame wildlife. Over the last decade, corn and soybean plantings have steadily increased ill the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North Dakota, while sunflower plantings have declined. The PPR is an important corridor for migratory birds,;aid changes in food availabilities at stopover habitats may affect how food resources are used. In early spring 2003 and 2004, we compared bird use of harvested fields of sunflower, soybeans, small grains, and corn if the PPR of North Dakota. Across both years and all crop types, we observed 20,400 birds comprising 29 species. Flocks of Lapland Longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus) and Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris) and flocks of Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) made up 60% and 15%, respectively, of the bird counts. WC found that species richness and bird densities were higher in harvested sunflower fields and cornfields than in harvested small-grain and soybean fields, with soybean fields harboring the fewest species and lowest bird density Blackbird densities tended to he lower in fields tilled after fall harvest than in fields not tilled.

Biodiversity and Conservation	18	12		3139-3151	November 2009	2009				English	0	18	We examined the effect of traditional swidden agriculture on biodiversity using the litter arthropod top predator, the army ant Aenictus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) as an indicator species in and around an intact tropical rain forest in Sarawak, Borneo, Malaysia. We compared the encounter rates with Aenictus colonies among five forest types: continuous primary forest, isolated primary forest, old secondary forest (>20 years elapsed after abandonment of the fields), young secondary forest (5 years after abandonment), and new fallow (2 years after abandonment) by intensive area searching in 2003 and 2005. In total, seven Aenictus species (15 colonies) and six Aenictus species (11 colonies) were encountered in 2003 and 2005, respectively. The encounter rates were the highest in continuous and isolated primary forests, intermediate in old and young secondary forests, and the lowest in new fallow. Year and the interaction between year and forest type were not significant. That is, abundance of top predators, which is rare and likely to be vulnerable to disturbance, has never fully recovered even 20 years after the termination of cultivation. We discuss forest management strategies to sustain biological diversity.

Norris, Jennifer L.; Chamberlain, Michael J.; Twedt, Daniel J.				Journal of Wildlife Management	73	8		1368-1379	November 2009	2009				English	2	19	Effects of silvicultural activities on birds are of increasing interest because of documented national declines in breeding bird populations for some species and the potential that these declines are in part due to changes in forest habitat. Silviculturally induced disturbances have been advocated as a means to achieve suitable forest conditions for priority wildlife species in bottomland hardwood forests. We evaluated how silvicultural activities on conservation lands in bottomland hardwood forests of Louisiana, USA, influenced species-specific densities of breeding birds. Our data were from independent studies, which used standardized point-count surveys for breeding birds in 124 bottomland hardwood forest stands on 12 management areas. We used Program DISTANCE 5.0, Release 2.0 (Thomas et al. 2006) to estimate density for 43 species with >50 detections. For 36 of those species we compared density estimates among harvest regimes (individual selection, group selection, extensive harvest, and no harvest). We observed 10 species with similar densities in those harvest regimes compared with densities in stands not harvested. However, we observed 10 species that were negatively impacted by harvest with greater densities in stands not harvested, 9 species with greater densities in individual selection stands, 4 species with greater densities in group selection stands, and 4 species with greater densities in stands receiving an extensive harvest (e.g., >40% canopy removal). Differences in intensity of harvest influenced densities of breeding birds. Moreover, community-wide avian conservation values of stands subjected to individual and group selection, and stands not harvested, were similar to each other and greater than that of stands subjected to extensive harvest that removed >40% canopy cover. These results have implications for managers estimating breeding bird populations, in addition to predicting changes in bird communities as a result of prescribed and future forest management practices.

Li, Jian; Wang, Wen				Journal of Northeast Forestry University	37	10		39-43	Oct 25 2009	2009				Chinese	0	1	A survey on bird communities was conducted in eight main habitats of grassland-forest ecosystems in Honghuaerji region of Inner Mongolia from May to June during 2001 and 2005 ( except 2003) by the sampling method, in order to discuss the composition and variation of bird diversity in different habitats. The bird species diversity, community composition, community similarity, and evenness index were analyzed using the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. In the eight habitat types of Honghuaerji area, the number of bird species ranged form 11 to 24, and the reed wetland showed the highest number of bird species (24 species) and the Carex wetland exhibited the lowest one (11 speceis) . The bird diversity indices of the bird communities were between 1.35 and 2.49, among which the diversity index of the reed wetland was maximum (2. 49) and that of grassland was minimum (1.35) . The evenness indices of the bird communities were from 0.54 to 0.89, among which the evenness index of interforest grassland was the highest (0.89) and that of grassland was the lowest (0. 54) . Similarity index of the bird communities ranged from 0 to 0. 611. The similarity index of the bird communities between burned forest land and natural Mongolian pine forest was lower than that between burned forest land and brush grass-land, indicating that forest fire changed the structure of bird communities in forests.

Suazo, Alexis A.; Fauth, John E.; Roth, James D.; Parkinson, Christopher L.; Stout, I. Jack				Biological Conservation	142	10		2322-2328	October 2009	2009				English	1	30	Debate about the relative merits of single-species management versus more comprehensive approaches has intensified in recent years. In east-central Florida, USA, land managers use prescribed burns and mechanical cutting to manage and restore scrub habitat to benefit the imperiled Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens). However, these land-management techniques may affect non-target taxa, especially the threatened southeastern beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus niveiventris). We evaluated the collateral effects of single-species land management by trapping P. p. niveiventris and other small rodents in eighteen land-management compartments at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida during 2004[long dash]2005. Compartments were managed using either prescribed burns (N = 5), mechanical cutting (N = 6), checkerboarding (cut and uncut lanes alternating and overlapping, followed by a prescribed burn, N = 4) or left unburned and uncut for >50 year (N = 3). P. p. niveiventris was significantly more abundant in compartments managed with prescribed burns (mean [plus or minus]SE: 4.2 [plus or minus]0.7 individuals/transect) than those managed with cutting alone (1.0 [plus or minus]0.3) or not managed for >50 y (0.2 [plus or minus]0.1 individuals/transect). In contrast, the cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus) tended to be more abundant in compartments managed with mechanical cutting alone (2.6 [plus or minus]0.4 individuals/transect) compared to the other three management strategies (prescribed burns; 1.5 [plus or minus]0.4; checkerboarding, 1.1 [plus or minus]0.3; not managed, 1.6 [plus or minus]0.4 individuals/transect) but these differences were not statistically significant. Abundances of P. p. niveiventris and Florida Scrub-Jay breeding groups were positively correlated (r = 0.655), suggesting that both listed species benefit from similar management techniques. Thus, the mosaic of burned and cut patches used to improve habitat for the Florida Scrub-Jay also benefits an endemic, non-target species. Single-species management may benefit multiple species when restoration improves their shared habitat, which in this case is an endangered, fire-dependent ecosystem: Florida scrub.	Stout, I.

Jacquet, Karine; Prodon, Roger				Oecologia (Berlin)	161	4		801-811	October 2009	2009				English	1	35	Despite numerous studies on the response of Mediterranean ecosystems to fire, few have measured the respective resilience of vegetation and fauna compartments. For 28 years, we conducted an annual monitoring of avifauna composition and vegetation structure (cover profile) following a severe wildfire in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) stand in southern France. Our aim was to estimate the time necessary for this bird-vegetation system to return to a state analogous to its pre-fire state. In the burned plots, low herbaceous and shrub layers were gradually replaced by higher, woody layers of vegetation. Neither bird species richness nor inter-annual bird species turnover showed significant differences from one year to the next over the study period. In contrast, bird species composition did change steadily, leading to an almost complete replacement of early-successional species by late-successional ones. Using the first axes of multivariate analyses as 'proxy variables' of vegetation or avifauna recoveries, we estimated by extrapolation the recovery times of these two ecosystem components at ca. 50 and 35 years, respectively. Towards the end of the study period, the rate of change in avifauna composition decreased comparatively to that of vegetation structure. Our results show that holm oak woodlands are highly resilient and seem to tolerate a [approximately]50-year fire interval, even if it remains to be assessed how resilient they would be in the case of increased fire frequency. More generally, our multivariate approach, which allows comparative estimations of resilience in different components of an ecosystem using qualitative as well as quantitative criteria, could be applied to various case studies in disturbance and restoration ecology.

Zehetmair, Tobias				Ornithologischer Anzeiger	48	2		97-110	Oktober 2009	2009				German	0	3	In spring 2007, forest inventory parameters were investigated in territories of the middle spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos medius in the northern part of the forest area "Feilenforst" near Ingolstadt, Bavaria. For the evaluation the breeding territories - which were mapped each year from 2001 to 2005 - were divided into the categories "permanently occupied " (KAT 3) and "irregularly occupied" (KAT 2). In addition "control areas" (KAT 1) were examined, in which breeding of middle spotted woodpecker was never recorded. Altogether, 168 randomly selected sample plots of each 1000 m2 were examined, spread over the 24 territories and the control areas. Data were analyzed with different statistic methods for strength of influence on middle spotted woodpecker frequency. The results show that the occurrence of the middle spotted woodpecker depends not only oil the presence of oaks Quercus robur but significantly on the quantity of hardwood surface area, especially of rough-barked deciduous tree species. Tree species composition played only a subordinate role. Moreover, the positive influence of lime trees Tilia spec. was shown, a tree generally considered to be less important for the middle spotted woodpecker. Finally a list of proposals for forestry management of mixed-deciduous woodlands was developed to improve the habitat quality of potential middle spotted woodpecker territories. Many other threatened species with similar habitat requirements might also profit.

Coe, Holly J.; Kiffney, Peter M.; Pess, George R.; Kloehn, Kris K.; Mchenry, Michael L.				River Research and Applications	25	8		1025-1035	October 2009	2009				English	1	28	Wood abundance in aquatic systems has been dramatically reduced compared to historical levels due to anthropogenic activities that led to wood removal and stream simplification. As a result, reintroduction of wood to aquatic systems is now a widely used and relatively well-studied restoration technique for increasing habitat complexity. Although stream periphyton (biofilm) and invertebrates serve as food sources for a variety of predators including fish, birds and bats, data on how lower trophic levels respond to wood placement are relatively scarce. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periphyton biomass and aquatic invertebrate density were higher on Engineered Log Jams (ELJs) than on inorganic substrates in two large Pacific Northwest river systems. Among years and rivers, periphyton biomass and invertebrate densities were significantly higher on ELJs than on cobbles within the same reach. Invertebrate communities on ELJs were dominated by meiofauna (<500 [mu]m), whereas cobbles were dominated by larger chironomids. We attribute these trophic level differences to substrate type, as we did not detect taxonomic differences between cobbles in reaches with and without ELJs. We show that adding wood to reaches with little or no naturally occurring wood increased overall habitat surface area and thereby the potential for increased productivity relative to reaches with low levels of wood. Finally, wood supports a unique community of invertebrates that are often overlooked in lotic system studies but may be contributing substantially to overall biological diversity.

Hudson, Marie-Anne R.; Bird, David M.				Landscape and Urban Planning	92	3-4		335-346	September 30 2009	2009				English	0	43	It has been suggested that golf courses can serve as wildlife habitat, provided key landscape features are present. Breeding bird communities were characterized on six golf courses and six green spaces in the Montreal area, Quebec, Canada. Landscape variables were measured to see which were the best correlates of avian species richness within and across sites. While there was no difference in the mean number of bird species (golf: 31 [plus or minus] 2.4 SE; green: 33 [plus or minus] 4.5 SE), golf courses supported fewer total species (golf: 55; green: 66). However, most of the species contributing to the green spaces' higher cumulative total were found at one site. Species composition differed between golf courses and green spaces, and was most correlated with site size, housing density surrounding the site, and extent of coniferous tree, grass, and vegetated water cover. Our results support the work of others, and suggest that golf course architects can improve habitat quality by: (1) increasing deciduous and coniferous tree cover; (2) increasing native vegetation within and surrounding all water bodies; (3) reducing the amount of highly managed grass area; (4) ensuring large, undeveloped buffers are maintained to prevent a shift in avian community composition with increasing urban sprawl; and (5) ensuring sites are planned as large as possible.

Chandler, Richard B.; King, David I.; Chandler, Carlin C.				Forest Ecology and Management	258	7		1669-1676	September 15 2009	2009				English	1	30	Many shrubland bird species are declining in eastern North America and as a result forest managers have used a variety of techniques to provide breeding habitat for these species. The maintenance of permanent "wildlife openings" using prescribed burns or mechanical treatments is a widely used approach for providing habitat for these species, but there have been no studies of the effects of treatment regime on bird abundance and nest survival in managed wildlife openings. We studied shrubland birds in wildlife openings on the White Mountain National Forest (WMNF) in New Hampshire and Maine, USA, during 2003 and 2004. We analyzed bird abundance and nest survival in relation to treatment type (burned versus mowed), treatment frequency, time since treatment, and patch area. We found that wildlife openings provided habitat for shrubland birds that are not present in mature forest. There was relatively modest support for models of focal bird species abundance as a function of treatment regime variables, despite pronounced effects of treatment on habitat conditions. This probably was attributable to the combined effects of complex site histories and bird site fidelity. Overall nest success (52%) was comparable to other types of early-successional habitats in the region, but there were few supported relationships between nest survival and treatment variables. We conclude that wildlife openings provide quality habitat for shrubland birds of high conservation interest as long as managers ensure treatment intervals are long enough to permit the development of woody vegetation characteristic of the later stages of this sere. Also, wildlife openings should be large enough to accommodate the territory sizes of all target species, which was >=1.2 ha in this study.

Moning, Christoph; Mueller, Joerg				Ecological Indicators	9	5		922-932	September 2009	2009				English	3	54	Forest age is one of the most simple but ecologically effective key values that may be controlled by forest management. Young and mature but managed forests differ significantly from old-growth forests in species composition, structure and socio-ecological function. Human land-use has already caused the loss or dramatic reduction in occurrence of some entire species assemblages, especially of logging-sensitive species, in Central European forests. These general statements also apply to beech forests, beech (Fagus sylvatica) being the naturally dominating tree species in Central Europe. Based on data for breeding birds (from 258 sampling plots in a sub-montane and 228 plots in a montane area), molluscs (36 plots in the sub-montane and 79 plots in the montane area) and lichens (84 plots in the montane forest), this paper aims at identifying significant forest age threshold ranges for the occurrence of these old-growth sensitive taxa. The sampling plots in the sub-montane zone (420-520 m a.s.l.) are in beech-oak forests, plots in the montane zone (650-1150 m a.s.l.) are in beech-spruce-fir forests. Stand ages in both areas range up to around 350-400 years. Threshold values for the total number of species related to stand age were calculated by recursive partitioning. In all three taxonomic groups the number of species per plot significantly increases with forest age. The same analysis was run for red-listed lichen and mollusc species as well as hole-nesting bird species. The threshold values obtained are very similar to those for the whole species assemblages, except for molluscs where considerably lower threshold values are computed with red-listed species assemblages. Regarding the confidence intervals, the difference pattern between the whole species datasets and the more sensitive species subsets is inconsistent. Threshold values in sub-montane beech forests range from 100 to 170 years and in mixed montane forests from 160 to 220 years. These threshold levels are clearly incompatible with economic interests that aim on reducing the rotation period in beech stands to less than 140 years to avoid formation of red heartwood. It would therefore seem to be essential to establish a network of trees and stands that are never logged and may thus act as areas for retreat and dispersion for logging-sensitive species.

Human-Wildlife Conflicts	3	2		186-198	Fall 2009	2009				English	0	3	Mineral extraction sites that are restored to open water can increase bird-strike risk if they are planned near airports. This can generate conflict between the minerals industry and safeguarding authorities. To help resolve this potential conflict, it would be useful to predict how new restorations affect local water-bird populations so that mineral deposits can be exploited and restored in safeguarded zones without compromising flight safety. Bird abundances and movements at new restorations can be estimated with statistical models that use the environmental characteristics of restoration schemes as predictor variables. These models can improve guidance in safeguarding, provided that they comprise parameters that can be quantified or conceived at the planning stage. In this paper, we present suitable models based on bird counts conducted during 2004-2006 at 256 open-water restoration sites. We used the morphology of the restorations, their geo-spatial relationships, ecological characteristics and usage as explanatory variables in regression models that describe water-bird abundances, the likely presence of geese and gulls, and the frequency of bird movements in the nonbreeding and breeding seasons. The models that can best be used as predictive tools were selected using multi-modal inference techniques. We demonstrated how their application can provide objective data on the likely impact a restoration design will have on bird-strike risk.

During the 2003 and 2004 breeding seasons, we examined space use by Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) in the federally endangered Great Lakes population. We used coordinate geometry to estimate home range sizes of individual birds and examined relationships between home range size and breeding stage (incubation versus chick rearing), year, sex, number of locations, minimum plover age, distance to the nearest nest, and human beach use (high, medium, or low). The mean size of home ranges of Piping Plovers that fledged at least one chick was 2.9 +/- 0.5 (SE) ha (range = 0.4-11.2 ha), and the mean linear beach distance traversed was 475 +/- 53 m (range = 130-1435 m). Individuals used 3 times more beach area and 1.5 times more shoreline distance in 2003 than in 2004. Females used smaller areas than males overall and during chick rearing. Home ranges were smallest on beaches with low public use, suggesting that human disturbance may cause greater movement by individual plovers and that larger protected areas may be warranted on beaches frequented by the public to minimize disturbance to breeding birds. Our results demonstrate that nesting Great Lakes Piping Plovers occupy relatively small ranges and, therefore, that even relatively small areas of suitable habitat can have a high conservation value for this endangered population. However, the total area of habitat used varied substantially among individuals, and this should be considered when protecting habitat for the species.

Fleishman, Erica; Dobkin, David S.				Restoration Ecology	17	5		731-739	September 2009	2009				English	2	26	We examined the relationship of breeding birds to elevation across and within four adjacent mountain ranges in the central Great Basin, a cold desert in western North America. Data came from 7 years of point counts at elevations from 1,915 to 3,145 m. We focused on eight passerine species that in this region are associated frequently with Pinus monophylla-Juniperus spp. (pinyon-juniper) woodland. Mean elevation of species' presence differed significantly among mountain ranges for all species except Spizella passerina (Chipping Sparrow); all species except Spizella breweri (Brewer's Sparrow) occurred at the highest mean elevation in the Toquima Range. Observed patterns were consistent with the elevational distribution of pinyon-juniper woodlands that provide nesting and foraging habitat for these species. Across the Great Basin, driven in part by climate change, pinyon-juniper woodland is increasing in density and expanding its distribution at lower elevations. However, breeding habitat for species dependent on mature trees may not be available in expansion woodlands for several decades, and increased tree densities may have negative effects on bird species that are dependent on shrubs within open pinyon-juniper woodlands. Responses of individual species to elevation differed from the response of assemblage-level patterns. Responses to biotic and abiotic variables within guilds of birds are sufficiently diverse, and responses of individual species sufficiently heterogeneous, that one management strategy is unlikely to meet the needs of all species in the group.

The intensive urban occupation, principally since the 1970's, has fragmented the natural landscapes in the region. Isolation has been the destiny of the local restinga vegetation, while lagoons have been polluted and diminished by deposition of sediment and detritus. Since May 2004 we have studied the birds of the Jacarepagua lowlands. Several visits have been made to the municipal parks Chico Mendes, Bosque da Barra, Prainha and Marapendi. A bibliographical revision also was made searching by published ornithological studies in the region. A total of 176 species has been recently recorded for us in the field, corresponding to 63,5% of the 277 bird species known to the region. Thirty five species were never before reported for the Jacarepagua lowlands, although some species are common in the region, as Pale-breasted Thrush Turdus leucomelas and the invaders Picazuro Pigeon Patagioenas picazuro and Chestnut-capped Blackbird Chrysomus ruficapillus. Important bird species are the winter visitants Black-backed Tanager Tangara peruviana (a probably threatened species in the state of Rio de Janeiro), Ruby-crowned Tanager Tachyphonus coronatus, and Creamy-bellied Thrush Turdus amaurochalinus. The first record of Picui Ground-Dove Columbina picui in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro was made in the Chico Mendes Municipal Park. Our study has shown a significative and inevitable reduction of the local bird diversity in the last decades due to increasing human occupation and the isolation of the natural environments in the region	Mallet-Rodrigues, Francisco; UFRJ, Lab Ornitol, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, BR-21944-970, Brazil, Brazil.	fmallet@bol.com.br					Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology			Animals and man; Ecology; Community structure; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Pollution; Land zones; Neotropical region; South America	Aves [Disturbance by man / Urbanization / new record] [Species diversity /  / ] [Population dynamics / Seasonal population changes / ] [Scrub / Restinga / faunal list] [Pollution /  / ] [Brazil / Rio de Janeiro / ].

Murgui, Enrique				Urban Ecosystems	12	3		249-263	September 2009	2009				English	0	17	Studies on bird fauna of urban environments have had a long history, but the potential of studies mapping the distribution of birds in cities probably has not fully developed. The bird fauna of the municipality of Valencia (Spain) was studied to determine the influence of urbanization on bird species richness and abundance. Birds were censused during winter and the breeding season of years 1997-1998 in 197 squares measuring 49 ha each from a rural and an urbanized area. Across seasons the number of species decreased around 40% in the city compared with the rural landscape surrounding it. Such pattern could be attributed to the low number of farmland species capable to use the habitats inside the city, and the limited ability of urban parks in attracting woodland species. In the urban landscape, the influence of the dimensions and spatial arrangement of habitat patches was outweighed by the amount of each habitat per square. Bird richness and the abundance of most species were negatively related with the amount of built-up habitat per square and positively with the amount of urban parks, and of habitat diversity. Conversely, bird fauna was largely independent of mean park size per square especially during winter, indicating that at the landscape scale even small patches of habitat could play an ecological role. Conservation of urban bird diversity could benefit of two complementary strategies: (i) the protection of the surrounding rural landscape from urban development; (ii) habitat enhancement within the city. Particularly, a proper design and habitat management of urban parks could improve their suitability for urban bird fauna.

Aurora, Amanda L.; Simpson, Thomas R.; Small, Michael F.; Bender, Kelly C.				Urban Ecosystems	12	3		347-358	September 2009	2009				English	0	5	Residential development in urban and suburban settings is a major cause of habitat change affecting avian communities. The effects from land-clearing prior to initiation of construction followed by landscaping focused on traditional aesthetics has reduced habitat diversity at multiple levels. These residential developments generally emphasize the use of ornamental, nonindigenous vegetation with little to no concern for native species and natural vegetation parameters. As a result, avian community composition and diversity is changed. We compared avian communities at three sites in Bexar County, Texas; two residential neighborhoods in the city of San Antonio and an unincorporated undeveloped site, Government Canyon State Natural Area. The residential neighborhoods were a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department certified wildscapes development and a traditionally developed neighborhood. Bird abundance and species richness in the neighborhoods were greater than at Government Canyon State Natural Area (P 0.01), but no differences existed between the neighborhoods. Bird diversity was greatest at the wildscapes neighborhood (P < 0.01). Further, bird diversity did not differ between the traditional neighborhood and the natural area. Evenness differed among sites (P = 0.006) with the natural area having the greatest value. Bird diversity measures correlated with woody plant density and vertical cover (r = 0.358 to 0.673, P < 0.05) at residential sites. Residential areas incorporating natural landscapes into their design attracted a greater variety of birds than traditionally landscaped residential areas.

Wilson Journal of Ornithology	121	3		548-555	September 2009	2009				English	0	19	Avian communities can benefit from reconstructed herbaceous, strip habitats among agriculture; however, any benefits may be limited by width-dependent factors such as edge effects. We used 2 years of strip-transect surveys to evaluate avian density, richness, and conservation value between non-, narrow (mean width = 8.2 m), and wide (mean width = 40.7 m) field borders on intensive row-cropped field margins in the agriculture-dominated Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Wide field borders supported two times more birds (7.0 birds/0.2 ha) than narrow borders (3.6 birds/0.2 ha), which supported six times more birds than no border (0.6 birds/0.2 ha). Mean bird species richness was over five times greater in bordered (0.80-1.10 species/0.2 ha) than non-bordered margins (0.14 species/0.2 ha), but was largely uninfluenced by border width. We documented more bird use of agricultural fields and wooded fencerows adjacent to bordered than non-bordered margins. Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and Dickcissels (Spiza americana) had the strongest positive response to field border presence and width. Wide borders attracted high densities (2.0 birds/0.2 ha) of Dickcissels, an edge-sensitive species, suggesting the conservation potential of herbaceous vegetation patches 50 m of wooded edges for grassland birds. Extensive implementation of field borders, particularly of enhanced width, may contribute substantially to grassland bird conservation strategies in intensive, agricultural landscapes, although confirmation of these benefits requires additional demographic information.

Huffman, David W.; Laughlin, Daniel C.; Pearson, Kristen M.; Pandey, Sanjeev				Forest Ecology and Management	258	5		616-625	20 August 2009	2009				English	1	25	Large herbivores have potential to affect invertebrate community structure through numerous processes, but little work has been done to evaluate the relative importance of direct and indirect factors. In this study, we measured arthropod community assemblages on Ceanothus fendleri A. Gray (Fendler's ceanothus) plants that were growing inside and outside of 4-m2 exclosures. We used univariate analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate relationships within this herbivore[long dash]plant[long dash]arthropod system in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests of northern Arizona, USA. Results showed that individual arthropod abundance, family diversity, family richness, and functional group richness were significantly greater on plots where C. fendleri plants were protected from large ungulate herbivores (e.g., mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni)) than on unprotected plots in each of the three study years. Results also indicated the following: (1) arthropod abundance was significantly greater on protected plants than unprotected plants; (2) rarefaction curves suggested arthropod family richness was similar between protected and unprotected plants in two of the three years when scaled by number of individuals but the estimated total richness was consistently higher on protected plants; (3) arthropod abundance was directly affected by protection from herbivores, plant stem length, and number of flowers; (4) arthropod family richness was related to the number of individuals collected and affected by stem length. Results from this study illustrate that arthropod communities are directly affected by foraging vertebrate herbivores as well as indirectly affected through complex plant-mediated factors in this model system. Protection of preferred forage plants such as C. fendleri from ungulate herbivores can potentially increase diversity of arthropod assemblages in these forests, help conserve biological diversity, and enhance ecosystem restoration efforts.

However, few studies of burrow-nesting birds have experimentally manipulated nest site or substrate availability. The blue-tailed bee-eater (Merops philippinus) is a colony breeding, summer migrant that excavates nest burrows in sandy banks on Kinmen Island, 5 km east of mainland China. To test whether substrate availability influenced the density or reproductive success of breeding pairs of bee-eaters, we removed all vegetation and old nest holes on treated slopes and left control slopes unmanipulated in 2003 and 2004. Plant cover on control slopes was 37.7% (11.9-67.7%). Slope gradient, soil penetration resistance and vegetation height in front of slopes did not differ between treated and control slopes in either year. Combining data from both years, the density of active nests was significantly higher (3.1-fold) on treated slopes than on control slopes. However, the reproductive performance of bee-eaters nesting on treated and control slopes did not differ in either year. Thus, removing vegetation and old nest holes from slopes with sandy loam soil improved the breeding habitat and increased the number of breeding blue-tailed bee-eaters. This technique could be used to support and manage populations of this species and other burrow-nestling species with similar habitat requirements.

The aims of this work were: (a) to compare bird species richness and densities among different silvicultural designs with variable retention (dispersed and/or aggregated) and unmanaged primary forests, and (b) to assess temporal changes at community and species levels before and after treatments. A baseline avian survey was conducted prior to harvesting to evaluate canopy gap presence and forest stand site quality influences. Subsequent to harvesting, data on bird species richness and density were collected by point-count sampling during the summer season for 5 consecutive years (4 treatments x 5 years x 6 sampling points x 5 counts). Bird species richness and density (15 species and 9.2 individuals ha-1) did not change significantly with forest site quality of the stands and canopy gap presence in unmanaged forests. However, both variables were significantly modified in managed forests, increasing over time to 18 species and reaching to 39 individuals ha-1. Inside the aggregated retention, bird communities were more similar to unmanaged primary forests than those observed within the dispersed retention or in clear-cuts. Opting for a regeneration method with dispersed and aggregated retention has great potential for managing birds in Nothofagus pumilio forests. This method retained enough vegetation structure in a stand to permit the establishment of early successional birds (at least in dispersed retention), and to maintain the bird species of old-growth forests which could persisted in the retention aggregates.

Pita, Ricardo; Mira, Antonio; Moreira, Francisco; Morgado, Rui; Beja, Pedro				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	132	1-2		57-65	July 2009	2009				English	3	69	Predation is increasingly pointed out as one of the factors contributing to population declines of ground-nesting farmland birds, though it remains poorly understood how ongoing transformations of agricultural landscapes affect predator assemblages. This study addressed this issue, estimating the contribution of landscape composition and configuration to spatial variation in species richness and abundances of mammalian carnivores across a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Portugal. The carnivore assemblage was diverse (10 species), but it was largely dominated by just three widespread and abundant species of generalist predators: domestic dog (Canis familiaris), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon). The number of domestic carnivore species and the abundance of cats (Felis catus) increased along with farmland occupation by human dwellings, whereas dogs were not responsive to landscape variables. The species richness of wild carnivores was highest in landscapes with a patchwork of arable fields and semi-natural habitats such as forests and shrubland, though it was also high in irrigated landscapes with dense networks of irrigation channels and tree lines bordering agricultural fields. irrigation was also positively associated with the abundance of otters (Lutra lutra) and mongooses. Cats, foxes, badgers (Meles meles), and total and wild carnivore abundances, were positively affected by increasing cover by eucalyptus and pine forest plantations, In general, results suggest that the highest diversity and abundance of carnivores in Mediterranean farmland may Occur in mosaic landscapes with small agricultural fields, high cover by woody vegetation patches and corridors, and many human dwellings. Preventing scrub encroachment and afforestation may thus be necessary to maintain a low predation risk in open farmland habitats, which are often inhabited by ground-nesting birds of high conservation concern. Conversely, keeping shrubland and forest patches within farmed landscapes may be essential where carnivore persistence is a relevant conservation goal. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Suarez-Rubio, Marcela; Thomlinson, John R.				Biological Conservation	142	7		1311-1321	July 2009	2009				English	0	58	As human population continues to increase and intensification of human land use escalates, it is important to address the role of urban forest patches in supporting bird communities. We related bird species richness and community assemblage to landscape- and patch-level factors in 40 forest patches in the densely populated metropolitan area of San Juan, Puerto Rico. In total, 54 bird species were observed including 26 resident, 10 endemic, 12 migratory, and 6 introduced species. Patch size, level of urbanization in the surrounding matrix, and vertical heterogeneity of forest patches were the most important variables in explaining species richness. Patch size had the highest predictive power in explaining species richness for all groups except migrants, which were best predicted by patch-level factors (vegetation heterogeneity). The degree of matrix urbanization was correlated negatively with endemic species richness, but positively with introduced species. Endemic species were particularly sensitive to landscape factors (patch size, matrix urbanization, and canopy texture). Introduced species richness was not dependent on any patch-level factors. Eight species were relatively unaffected by urbanization, whereas two species were only found in large forest patches, and two species were sensitive to urban development. Seven species demonstrated a preference for small patches. Recommendations for land managers and conservation agencies to maintain a high bird species richness and diversity include: (1) preserve both large and small forest patches, (2) limit urban development near forest patches, (3) manage forest patch structure to maintain vertical heterogeneity, and (4) maintain forest patches with different vegetation types.

Nappi, Antoine; Drapeau, Pierre				Biological Conservation	142	7		1381-1391	July 2009	2009				English	3	43	The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is considered a fire specialist throughout its breeding range. Given its high abundance in recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time. Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success declined from 84% the first year after fire to 73% and 25%, respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests. Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests. Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature and over-mature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated species.

Diversity and Distributions	15	4		720-730	July 2009	2009				English	0	53	Aim We characterized changes in reporting rates and abundances of bird species over a period of severe rainfall deficiency and increasing average temperatures. We also measured flowering in eucalypts, which support large numbers of nectarivores characteristic of the region. Location A 30,000-km2 region of northern Victoria, Australia, consisting of limited amounts of remnant native woodlands embedded in largely agricultural landscapes. Methods There were three sets of monitoring studies, pitched at regional (survey programmes in 1995-97, 2004-05 and 2006-08), landscape (2002-03 and 2006-07) and site (1997-2008 continuously) scales. Bird survey techniques used a standard 2-ha, 20-min count method. We used Bayesian analyses of reporting rates to document statistically changes in the avifauna through time at each spatial scale. Results Bird populations in the largest remnants of native vegetation (up to 40,000 ha), some of which have been declared as national parks in the past decade, experienced similar declines to those in heavily cleared landscapes. All categories of birds (guilds based on foraging substrate, diet, nest site; relative mobility; geographical distributions) were affected similarly. We detected virtually no bird breeding in the latest survey periods. Eucalypt flowering has declined significantly over the past 12 years of drought. Main conclusions Declines in the largest woodland remnants commensurate with those in cleared landscapes suggest that reserve systems may not be relied upon to sustain species under climate change. We attribute population declines to low breeding success due to reduced food. Resilience of bird populations in this woodland system might be increased by active management to enhance habitat quality in existing vegetation and restoration of woodland in the more fertile parts of landscapes.

Cooke, Hilary A.; Zack, Steve				Environmental Management	44	1		173-184	July 2009	2009				English	1	23	The importance of riparian vegetation to support stream function and provide riparian bird habitat in semiarid landscapes suggests that standardized assessment tools that include vegetation criteria to evaluate stream health could also be used to assess habitat conditions for riparian-dependent birds. We first evaluated the ability of two visual assessments of woody vegetation in the riparian zone (corridor width and height) to describe variation in the obligate riparian bird ensemble along 19 streams in eastern Oregon. Overall species richness and the abundances of three species all correlated significantly with both, but width was more important than height. We then examined the utility of the riparian zone criteria in three standardized and commonly used rapid visual riparian assessment protocols-the USDI BLM Proper Functioning Condition (PFC) assessment, the USDA NRCS Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP), and the U.S. EPA Habitat Assessment Field Data Sheet (HAFDS)-to assess potential riparian bird habitat. Based on the degree of correlation of bird species richness with assessment ratings, we found that PFC does not assess obligate riparian bird habitat condition, SVAP provides a coarse estimate, and HAFDS provides the best assessment. We recommend quantitative measures of woody vegetation for all assessments and that all protocols incorporate woody vegetation height. Given that rapid assessments may be the only source of information for thousands of kilometers of streams in the western United States, incorporating simple vegetation measurements is a critical step in evaluating the status of riparian bird habitat and provides a tool for tracking changes in vegetation condition resulting from management decisions.

Nicolaus, Marion; Both, Christiaan; Ubels, Richard; Edelaar, Pim; Tinbergen, Joost M.				Journal of Animal Ecology	78	4		828-838	July 2009	2009				English	0	21	In birds, local competition for food between pairs during the nestling phase may affect nestling growth and survival. A decrease in clutch size with an increase in breeding density could be an adaptive response to this competition. To investigate whether breeding density causally affected the clutch size of great tits (Parus major), we manipulated breeding density in three out of eight study plots by increasing nest-box densities. We expected clutch size in these plots to be reduced compared to that in control plots.We analysed both the effects of variation in annual mean density (between-year comparisons) and experimental density (within-year comparison between plots) on clutch size variation, the occurrence of second broods and nestling growth. We examined within-female variation in clutch size to determine whether individual responses explain the variation over years.Over the 11 years, population breeding density increased (from 0.33 to 0.50 pairs ha-1) while clutch size and the occurrence of second broods decreased (respectively from 10.0 to 8.5 eggs and from 0.39 to 0.05), consistent with a negative density-dependent effect for the whole population. Nestling growth showed a declining but nonsignificant trend over years.The decline in population clutch size over years was primarily explained by changes occurring within individuals rather than selective disappearance of individuals laying large clutches.Within years, breeding density differed significantly between manipulated plots (0.16 pairs ha-1 vs. 0.77 pairs ha-1) but clutch size, occurrence of second broods and nestling growth were not affected by the experimental treatment, resulting in a discrepancy between the effects of experimental and annual variation in density on reproduction.We discuss two hypotheses that could explain this discrepancy: (i) the decline in breeding performance over time was not due to density, but resulted from other, unknown factors. (ii) Density did cause the decline in breeding performance, but this was not due to local competition in the nestling phase. Instead, we suggest that competition acting in a different phase (e.g. before egg laying or after fledgling) was responsible for the density effect on clutch size among years.

Pope, Theresa L.; Block, William M.; Beier, Paul				Journal of Wildlife Management	73	5		695-700	July 2009	2009				English	0	12	We examined effects of prescribed fire on 3 wintering, bark-foraging birds, hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus), pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea), and white-breasted nuthatches (S. carolinensis), in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona, USA. During winters of 2004[long dash]2006, we compared bird density, foraging behavior, and bark beetle activity among burned treatment and unburned control units. Hairy woodpecker density was 5 times greater in burn units, whereas white-breasted nuthatches and pygmy nuthatches had similar densities between treatments. Compared to available trees, trees used by foraging hairy woodpeckers had 9 times greater odds of having bark beetles in control units and 12 times greater odds in burn units. Tree diameter appeared to be the main factor bark-foraging birds used in selecting winter foraging trees. Our results suggest that forest managers can use prescribed fire treatments without detrimental effects to wintering nuthatches, while providing additional food to hairy woodpeckers.

Kennedy, Patricia L.; DeBano, Sandra J.; Bartuszevige, Anne M.; Lueders, Andrea S.				Restoration Ecology	17	4		515-525	July 2009	2009				English	2	45	One common problem encountered when restoring grasslands is the prominence of non-native plant species. It is unclear what effect non-native plants have on habitat quality of grassland passerines, which are among the most imperiled groups of birds. In 2004 and 2005, we compared patterns of avian reproduction and the mechanisms that might influence those patterns across a gradient of 13 grasslands in the Zumwalt Prairie in northeastern Oregon that vary in the degree of non-native plant cover (0.9-53.4%). We monitored the fate of 201 nests of all the breeding species in these pastures and found no association of percent non-native cover with nest densities, clutch size, productivity, nest survival, and nestling size. Regardless of the degree of non-native cover, birds primarily fed on Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and Araneae. But as percent non-native cover in the pastures increased, Orthoptera made up a greater proportion of diet and Coleoptera made up a smaller proportion. These diet switches were not the result of changes in terrestrial invertebrate abundance but may be related to decreases in percent bare ground associated with increasing cover of non-native vegetation. Measures of nest crypticity were not associated with cover of non-native vegetation, suggesting that predation risk may not increase with increased cover of non-native vegetation. Thus, the study results show that increased non-native cover is not associated with reduced food supplies or increased predation risk for nesting birds, supporting the growing body of evidence that grasslands with a mix of native and non-native vegetation can provide suitable habitat for native grassland breeding birds.

Goodale, Eben; Lalbhai, Punit; Goodale, Uromi M.; Ashton, P.M.S.				Forest Ecology and Management	258	3		314-322	June 30 2009	2009				English	2	22	Forest regeneration methods such as shelterwood treatments have been shown to substantially increase the diversity of bird species, specifically of species that prefer early seral forests, now rare in the eastern United States. Stand improvement techniques such as thinnings have also been found to increase avian diversity under some conditions. A sustainably managed forest, however, must simultaneously apply regenerative harvesting with stand improvements, and the effect of such treatment combinations on bird community composition is not clear. We compared bird distribution and abundance on shelterwood cuts, crown thinnings, and unmanaged stands at the Yale Myers Forest, a large privately owned and actively managed forest in southern New England. Bird abundance and species diversity was highest in shelterwood cuts and lowest in unmanaged forest, with thinnings being intermediary. Different suites of species inhabited the three treatments, with 18 of 49 common species differing significantly in their abundances between treatments. Characteristics of the vegetation that were directly influenced by silvicultural intervention, including canopy openness, seedling regeneration and vertical structural diversity, appeared to be the dominant drivers of bird abundance. The abundances of some species or groups of species were correlated with the number of trees retained in the implementation of the forestry practices. In conjunction with the conservation of a variety of mature forest habitats, regenerative cuts and stand improvement techniques can be used together to sustain a diverse assemblage of bird species.

At present, the annual western Palearctic duck bag is at least 17 million birds. From a sustainable management perspective, wetland users and managers request predictions of spatial distribution and abundance variations of these bird populations. The objective of this study was to analyze local factors potentially influencing the diurnal distribution and population size of wintering ducks and coots, the main game species, in Camargue (southern France). First, we showed that marshland surface area, salinity and hunting disturbance were the principal variables explaining the duck and coot distribution. Secondly, we tested the hypothesis that hunting disturbance would reduce the carrying capacity of the Camargue with two analyses: the effect of creating a protected area and the change of the hunting closing date. This hypothesis was not validated. Our study therefore led us to reconsider the research orientations on the carrying capacity in this wetland. The surface of protected day roosts seems presently sufficient in the Rhone delta. Consequently, to increase the population size with the same level of hunting disturbance at the scale of the Camargue, alternative strategies should be envisaged, such as the creation of nature reserves on nocturnal feeding ground or the creation of large management units with limited disturbance.

Dallimer, Martin; Acs, Szvetlana; Hanley, Nick; Wilson, Paul; Gaston, Kevin J.; Armsworth, Paul R.				Journal of Applied Ecology	46	3		647-656	June 2009	2009				English	0	26	Modern farmed landscapes have witnessed substantial losses in biodiversity principally driven by the ecological changes associated with agricultural intensification. The causes of declines are often well described, but current management practices seem unlikely to deliver the EU-wide policy objective of halting biodiversity losses.Available evidence suggests that property-scale factors can be influential in shaping patterns of biodiversity; however, they are rarely included in studies. Using 44 upland farms in the Peak District, northern England, we investigate the roles of ecological, agricultural and socio-economic factors in determining avian species richness, for the first time incorporating information from all three influences.Although we might expect that habitat quality would be the main factor affecting species richness, these variables had little influence. The landscape context of each property was unimportant in explaining any of the three measures of species richness (Total, Upland and Conservation Concern) used here. Within-property habitat quality did explain 42% of the variation in richness of upland specialist species, but had no influence on Total or Conservation Concern Richness.Socio-economic circumstances of farms alone accounted for 24% of the variation in Total Richness, with land tenure and labour inputs important predictors of avian diversity. However, net income, rental value and the level of Agri-Environment Scheme (AES) payments did not play a role in predicting species richness.Farm management variables, including many of the main prescriptions outlined in AES, accounted for 23% of the variation in the richness of species of Conservation Concern, but less than 10% for Total Richness. However, no farm management variable alone was shown to offer better predictive power of avian species richness than random.Synthesis and applications. The agricultural landscape is managed by a mosaic of landowners, all of whom can influence biodiversity conservation. We demonstrate that variation at the property-scale in habitat, management and socio-economics can feed into determining patterns of biodiversity. Currently, farmland conservation policy largely assumes that socio-economic barriers and financial costs of implementing conservation measures are constant. Incorporating a consideration of the varying circumstances of individual properties into policy design is likely to result in substantial biodiversity gains.

Western North American Naturalist	69	2		235-242	June 2009	2009				English	1	127	Little is known about how avian relationships to tracts of native sod prairie compare with avian relationships to single and multiple species of cool- and warm-season grassland plantings. We compared grassland bird species richness and density in 5 grassland cover types (n = 97) in the tallgrass prairie region of eastern South Dakota and western Minnesota, 2001-2004. Grassland bird species richness was significantly higher in native sod prairies than it m,as in all planted cover types except warm-season mixes. Grasslands dominated by exotic species did not support as many grassland bird species or have species densities as high as grasslands containing native species. Intermediate wheatgrass monotypes and cool-season mixes comprised of exotic species contained 40%-60% fewer grassland bird species than native sod prairie. Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) density was 68% and 51% lower in intermediate wheatgrass monotypes and cool-season mixes, respectively, than it was in switchgrass monotypes. Clay-colored Sparrow (Spizella pallida) density was 75%-91% higher in native sod prairies than it was in any other cover type. Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) density was 72% higher in native prairie than it was in grasslands dominated by exotic species. We recommend incorporating a diversity of native plant species into grassland plantings for biomass fuels or wildlife, rather than using monotypes or exotic species, to provide habitat for grassland birds. Although replacing croplands with planted grasslands would benefit grassland bird populations, we caution that replacing existing native sod tracts with planted grasslands would be detrimental to populations of several grassland bird species.

Wetlands	29	2		563-573	June 2009	2009				English	0	39	Channelization of rivers and streams threatens bottomland forest bird communities because it can lead to the formation of lateral gullies that connect streams to adjacent wetlands and unnaturally accelerate the draining of wetlands, potentially exposing some birds to high rates of nest predation. I Studied how the hydrologic restoration of off-channel wetlands (plugging gullies that drain off-channel wetlands) affects the diversity, abundance, and nesting success of birds breeding within forested wetlands within the Cache River watershed in Illinois. I compared surface area, water depth, bird diversity, bird densities, and nesting success between treatment (gully plugs added) and control (gully plugs not added) wetlands pre- and post-treatment. During the breeding season of birds, treatment wetlands retained more flooded area and greater depths of water compared to,control wetlands. Bird diversity was unaffected by the installation of gully plugs. The density and nesting success of prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea) was higher in treatment wetlands than in control wetlands. Documenting changes in the bird community in response to this conservation action provides a means to measure the success of restoration activities in the Cache River watershed and inform conservation plans and restoration. efforts in other bottomland forest ecosystems.

Caprio, Enrico; Ellena, Ivan; Rolando, Antonio				Biodiversity and Conservation	18	5		1287-1303	May 2009	2009				English	3	47	In this study we focused on deciduous managed forests in northwest Italy and investigated relationships between bird diversity and forest descriptors both at the habitat and landscape level through a seasonal, guild-based approach. Birds were censused by point counts in randomly selected plots of 50 m radius. Each census plot was described in habitat structure terms by using the Bitterlich variable plot-radius method. Landscape metrics (both at class- and landscape-level, according to Fragstats' terminology) were measured within 500 m radius circle of each plot using an existing GIS database. We first identified specialist and generalist species according to the presence/absence of each species in relation to habitat structure measurements using generalized additive models (GAMs), then we tested for the effects of habitat and landscape variables on guild parameters (namely, bird species richness, Shannon diversity and abundance) using generalized linear models (GLMs). Our analyses showed that several habitat and landscape predictors affected bird diversity. However, in general, guild parameters relative to specialists were especially influenced by oak biomass (a habitat predictor) and oak core area (a class-level predictor) irrespective of the season, while parameters of generalists were influenced by oak core area in winter and perimeter/area ratio of oak patches in spring. Landscape-level predictors significantly affected winter bird abundance only. Results clearly showed that the retention of native oaks both at the habitat and the landscape level is the key-factor for the conservation of diversity of specialist bird species in deciduous, originally oak-dominated woods. Results also suggest that studies focusing on different periods should be preferred to mono-season surveys and that a guild-based approach should be preferred to an holistic one taking into account all species.

Salinas-Melgoza, Alejandro; Salinas-Melgoza, Vicente; Renton, Katherine				Condor	111	2		305-313	May 2009	2009				English	1	26	Resource availability in a heterogeneous environment and density-dependent processes may influence the spatial distribution of individuals among habitats. The distribution of nests of secondary cavity nesters is rarely clumped because the birds are constrained by the distribution of existing cavities as nest resources. In this study, to evaluate the interplay of environmental and behavioral processes in the spacing of parrot nests, we compared the spatial distribution of active Lilac-crowned Parrot (Amazona finschi) nests with that of all cavities used as nests over 14 years. Parrots reused 42% of cavities, and the frequency of reuse was significantly associated with a previously successful nesting attempt. Positive fitness benefits of cavity reuse may indicate high-quality nest sites that are used more intensively by resident breeding pairs. Spatial-point-pattern analysis indicated that trees used as nests were significantly clustered within 60 m in the three nesting areas, with average distance of 100[long dash]200 m between nest trees. In a given breeding season, active parrot nests were separated by a mean 950 [plus or minus] 890 m. Parrot nests were also located significantly closer to a tree used as a nest in the previous breeding season than the distance between nearest nesting conspecifics. This pattern suggests that conspecifics influence the spatial distribution of reproductive pairs breeding simultaneously, with nesting pairs occupying areas where suitable cavities are more numerous. The behavioral spacing requirements of nesting parrots may limit breeding densities and restrict management strategies to increase numbers of nesting pairs within protected areas.

Moreno-Mateos, David; Pedrocchi, Cesar; Comin, Francisco A.				Biodiversity and Conservation	18	4		811-828	April 2009	2009				English	3	35	Numerous wetlands have been created spontaneously in the Ebro river basin as a consequence of new irrigation developments over the last 50 years. Water used for irrigating farmland drains into the lower parts of small valleys to form wetlands that are mostly dominated by common reed (Phragmites australis). Bird communities established in these wetlands are still simple, partly due to the lack of management to enable their ecological functions to improve. A knowledge of which environmental features favor these bird communities is essential in order to improve the design of newly created or restored wetlands associated to future irrigation developments. For this purpose, the habitat and vegetation features of 15 wetlands have been sampled. The structure of bird communities (richness, abundance and diversity) was monitored over 3 years during the breeding season and in winter at foraging and nocturnal roosting. The presence of bushes, height of stems and distance from large wetlands (>1 ha) proved to be the most influential variables on bird community structure and on most abundant species during the breeding season. Wetland area and compactness influenced species richness and the most abundant species during winter foraging and roosting. There was a maximum stem height at which only reed-dwelling birds remained. Uncontrolled winter burning had a severe negative effect upon these recently established populations. The ecological functions of newly created or restored wetlands, including those for run-off treatment in agricultural catchments, could be substantially improved taking into account simple guidelines from these results which relate bird community characteristics to wetland features.

Dickson, Brett G.; Noon, Barry R.; Flather, Curtis H.; Jentsch, Stephanie; Block, William M.				Ecological Applications	19	3		608-621	April 2009	2009				English	1	20	Landscape-scale disturbance events, including ecological restoration and fuel reduction activities, can modify habitat and affect relationships between species and their environment. To reduce the risk of uncharacteristic stand-replacing. res in the southwestern United States, land managers are implementing restoration and fuels treatments ( e. g., mechanical thinning, prescribed. re) in progressively larger stands of dry, lower elevation ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa) forest. We used a Before-After/Control-Impact experimental design to quantify the multi-scale response of avifauna to large ([approximately]250-400 ha) prescribed. re treatments on four sites in Arizona and New Mexico dominated by ponderosa pine. Using distance sampling and an information-theoretic approach, we estimated changes in density for 14 bird species detected before (May-June 2002-2003) and after (May-June 2004-2005) prescribed. re treatments. We observed few site-level differences in pre- and posttreatment density, and no species responded strongly to treatment on all four sites. Point-level spatial models of individual species response to treatment, habitat variables, and. re severity revealed ecological relationships that were more easily interpreted. At this scale, pretreatment forest structure and patch characteristics were important predictors of posttreatment differences in bird species density. Five species ( Pygmy Nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea), Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana), Steller's Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri), American Robin (Turdus migratorius), and Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides villosus)) exhibited a strong treatment response, and two of these species ( American Robin and Hairy Woodpecker) could be associated with meaningful. re severity response functions. The avifaunal response patterns that we observed were not always consistent with those reported by more common studies of wildland. re events. Our results suggest that, in the short term, the distribution and abundance of common members of the breeding bird community in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests appear to be tolerant of low- to moderate-intensity prescribed. re treatments at multiple spatial scales and across multiple geographic locations.

Maeda, Taku; Yoshida, Hoshiko				Japanese Journal of Ornithology	58	1		55-64	April 2009	2009				Japanese	1	7	Two segments of rice fields (0.4 ha each) in the coastal rice-producing region of Lake Kasumigaura, central Japan, were experimentally flooded from December to February (non-cultivation season), and bird abundance and macroinvertebrate availability in the fields were compared with those in unflooded rice fields and continuously flooded lotus fields. No waterbirds were recorded in the unflooded fields, but the experimentally flooded fields attracted Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus and snipe Gallinago spp., probably due to higher numbers of Tubificidae, Insecta (except Chironomidae) and Hirudinoidea in the soil and the water on the fields. Snipe were more abundant in unplowed flooded fields than plowed ones, indicating the importance of leaving rice stubble and post-harvest shoots as shelter for these secretive foragers. The flooded rice fields did not attract fish-eating waterbirds such as egrets Egretta spp., herons Ardea spp. or kingfishers Alcedo atthis, which occasionally appeared in the lotus fields. This was, probably because water pumped on to the experimentally flooded fields provided few fish or tadpoles. Landbird abundance also differed significantly among the field types. Unflooded fields supported more Skylarks Alauda arvensis and Siberian Meadow Buntings Emberiza cioides than others, whereas flooded fields were preferred by Water Pipits Anthus spinoletta. Lotus fields attracted Dusky Thrushes Turdus naumanni, White Wagtails Motacilla alba and Japanese Wagtails M. grandis. The results indicate that flooding fields in a dry rice-producing region in winter provides many water- and landbird species with suitable habitats, and contributes to increasing the diversity of the wintering bird community.

Fontaine, Joseph B.; Donato, Daniel C.; Robinson, W. Douglas; Law, Beverly E.; Kauffman, J. Boone				Forest Ecology and Management	257	6		1496-1504	March 10 2009	2009				English	5	47	Fire is a widespread natural disturbance agent in most conifer-dominated forests. In light of climate change and the effects of fire exclusion, single and repeated high-severity (stand-replacement) fires have become prominent land management issues. We studied bird communities using point counting in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of Oregon, USA at various points in time after one or two high-severity fires. Time points included 2 and 3 years after a single fire, 17 and 18 years after a single fire, 2 and 3 years after a repeat fire (15 year interval between fires), and >100 years since stand-replacement fire (mature/old-growth forest). Avian species richness did not differ significantly among habitats. Bird density was highest 17 and 18 years after fire, lowest 2 years after fire, and intermediate in repeat burns and unburned forest. Bird community composition varied significantly with habitat type (A = 0.24, P 0.0001) with two distinct gradients in species composition relating to tree structure (live to dead) and shrub stature. Using indicator species analysis, repeat burns were characterized by shrub-nesting and ground-foraging bird species while unburned mature forests were characterized by conifer-nesting and foliage-gleaning species. Bird density was not related to snag basal area but was positively related to shrub height. Contrary to expectations, repeated high-severity fire did not reduce species richness, and bird densities were greater in repeat burns than in once-burned habitats. Broad-leaved hardwoods and shrubs appear to play a major role in structuring avian communities in the Klamath-Siskiyou region. In light of these results, extended periods of early seral broadleaf dominance and short-interval high-severity fires may be important to the conservation of avian biodiversity.

Buchanan, Graeme M.; Donald, Paul F.; Fishpool, Lincoln D.C.; Arinaitwe, Julius A.; Balman, Mark; Mayaux, Philippe				Bird Conservation International	19	1		49-61	March 2009	2009				English	2	16	Over 1,200 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) have been identified in Africa, each meeting at least one of four objective criteria that identify it as an area of high conservation importance for birds. Despite their biodiversity value, many IBAs are threatened by habitat degradation and a high proportion lack legal protection. We integrate an inventory of these IBAs with remote sensing data to identify patterns that could be used to assess priorities for monitoring and conservation. Land cover composition in IBAs differed significantly from that in buffer zones of the same area immediately surrounding them and was significantly more homogeneous. Agriculture and deforestation were the most prevalent threats to IBAs, particularly in IBAs containing a high proportion of dense forest or shrub. Human population density within IBAs was no lower than that immediately outside IBAs, and was around three times higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. However, projected human population growth was lower than the average for sub-Saharan Africa, with the projected increase greatest in IBAs with a high proportional cover of dense forest and mosaic woodland and lowest in IBAs with a higher grassland component. Fifty seven percent of IBAs fell within or overlapped Protected Areas, though this percentage differed between different categories of IBA. IBAs that were included within Protected Areas supported a greater number of globally threatened bird species and contained proportionally more dense forest, woodland and shrub than IBAs falling outside Protected Areas. IBAs outside Protected Areas contained a high proportion of mosaic woodland and open water, suggesting that such habitats are under-protected in Africa. We suggest that because the most prevalent threats to IBAs involve changes in land cover that could be detected from satellites, remote sensing could play an important role in the monitoring of African IBAs. This would permit monitoring of a wider range of sites than is possible solely by conventional, ground-based approaches.

Wyshynski, Sarah A.; Nudds, Thomas D.				Forestry Chronicle	85	2		218-226	March-April 2009	2009				English	0	15	Policy direction to emulate natural disturbance in managed boreal forests has spurred a need to contrast the dynamics of biota on landscapes originating from timber harvest and from wildfire (hereafter, "managed" and "natural"). Typically, emphasis is on pattern emulation, and less on processes, such as competition, predation or habitat selection. Knowing how communities in the boreal forest assemble can provide further insight to the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the processes responsible, permitting assessments about whether forestry practices emulate processes as well as patterns. We contrasted variation in species richness among forest types, with stand area, and between local (forest stand) and regional (landscape) scales on managed and natural boreal landscapes in NW Ontario. Species richness varied more among forest stand types than between landscapes, or with stand area, on either landscape. On both landscapes, mean local species richness was 1/3 of regional richness, consistent with the hypothesis that competition structured stand-level assemblages regardless of stand origin. We further compared the structure of stand-level assemblages from randomized null models using presence/absence and abundance data with observed assemblages on each landscape, while controlling for variation in habitat structure among stands. Local bird assemblages were over-dispersed in niche space relative to random assemblages, also consistent with the competition hypothesis, regardless of stand origin. We found no evidence that patterns of variation in diversity of songbirds and woodpeckers, nor the processes that govern them, differed between managed and natural boreal forest landscapes. Our results suggest that past forest practices in this region, if by default, nevertheless emulated natural patterns of variation in diversity and species assembly of bird communities.

Wilson Journal of Ornithology	121	1		22-40	March 2009	2009				English	1	10	Estimates of community attributes such as species richness, local extinction, and turnover are critical when evaluating ecological restoration efforts. Estimates of species richness based on counts can be biased by variation in the probability of detection among different species. We quantified the effects of livestock exclusion on riparian bird communities using mark-recapture models to account for variation in species detection rates. Specifically, we estimated species richness and other community parameters for fenced and grazed sites with robust design models where closed-captures were treated as mixtures, and then used transition rates to calculate derived vital rates for avian communities. Estimates of species richness based on unadjusted counts were correlated with estimates from robust design models, but counts failed to detect important temporal changes in species richness. Estimates of species richness from robust design models increased at fenced and grazed sites over an 8-year period, but community vital rates were unaffected by cattle exclusion. We examined qualitative changes in abundance of birds in four nesting guilds, and concluded that temporal changes may have been driven by regional dynamics in avian communities. Our mark-recapture analysis allowed us to compare standardized estimates of community parameters between habitats, observers, and time periods after accounting for variation in detection rates. Robust design models are a useful tool that will facilitate accurate assessments of community dynamics following future restoration efforts.

Vallejo, Benjamin M., Jr; Aloy, Alexander B.; Ong, Perry S.				Landscape and Urban Planning	89	3-4		75-85	February 15 2009	2009				English	0	47	Urban environments are not considered areas with conservation importance. However greenspaces in cities have been previously identified as areas with significant avian biodiversity. We investigated the distribution and diversity of birds in what are increasingly considered as Metropolitan Manila's last greenspaces; the University of the Philippines campus, military cemeteries and two government operated parks. Using species-area analysis, abundance and diversity indices, TWINSPAN ordination and logistic regression to determine important landscape features for species presence, we describe the distribution of bird communities and diversity in Metropolitan Manila. Two major bird community groupings were observed. These are the urban exploiters and the urban adaptable with the former occurring in high abundances and the latter in low abundances in greenspaces. The number of built and natural spatial entities determines abundances. Species area analysis suggests that the greenspaces are distinct habitats that preserve faunal uniqueness whereas urbanization tends to decrease diversity. These observations suggest that greenspaces harbor significant avian biodiversity as well as the presence of endemic and threatened species. As the greenspaces possess remnant wetland and wooded habitat we recommend that they be preserved and maintained by ensuring that these habitats are incorporated in any urban development plan.

Forest Ecology and Management	257	3		1119-1128	February 10 2009	2009				English	0	23	In coniferous forests of western North American, fire is an important disturbance that influences the structure and composition of floral and faunal communities. The impacts of postfire management, including salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5[long dash]6 snags retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon. We used analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three hypotheses concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage on densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds, and two hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage logging on relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined the relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species. We did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities or relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P. villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment. We detected significant differences between years for four species of birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting robust patterns that transcend particular locations.

Burghardt, Karin T.; Tallamy, Douglas W.; Shriver, W. Gregory				Conservation Biology	23	1		219-224	February 2009	2009				English	10	115	Managed landscapes in which non-native ornamental plants are favored over native vegetation now dominate the United States, particularly east of the Mississippi River. We measured how landscaping with native plants affects the avian and lepidopteran communities on 6 pairs of suburban properties in southeastern Pennsylvania. One property in each pair was landscaped entirely with native plants and the other exhibited a more conventional suburban mixture of plants-a native canopy with non-native groundcover and shrubs. Vegetation sampling confirmed that total plant cover and plant diversity did not differ between treatments, but non-native plant cover was greater on the conventional sites and native plant cover was greater on the native sites. Several avian (abundance, species richness, biomass, and breeding-bird abundance) and larval lepidopteran (abundance and species richness) community parameters were measured from June 2006 to August 2006. Native properties supported significantly more caterpillars and caterpillar species and significantly greater bird abundance, diversity, species richness, biomass, and breeding pairs of native species. Of particular importance is that bird species of regional conservation concern were 8 times more abundant and significantly more diverse on native properties. In our study area, native landscaping positively influenced the avian and lepidopteran carrying capacity of suburbia and provided a mechanism for reducing biodiversity losses in human-dominated landscapes.

Gil-Tena, Assu; Brotons, Lluis; Saura, Santiago				Global Change Biology	15	2		474-485	February 2009	2009				English	2	23	Processes derived from global change such as land-use changes, climate warming or modifications in the perturbation regime may have opposite effects on forest extent and structure with still unknown consequences on forest biodiversity at large spatial scales. In the present study, we aimed at determining forest dynamics associated with global change processes (forest spread, maturation and fire) that have driven the variation in forest bird distributions in Mediterranean forest ecosystems in recent years. The study was located in Catalonia (NE Spain) and used changes in richness of specialist and generalist forest bird species in the last 20 years of the 20th century as indicators of forest biodiversity change. Forest bird distribution changes showed strong spatial patterns and appeared to be related to population processes occurring beyond sampling units (10 km x 10 km squares). Forest maturation appeared as the most important driver of such changes because most of the studied species have a non-Mediterranean origin and are associated with more mature forests. To a lower degree, forest spread also contributed to forest bird distribution changes whereas the impact of forest fires was not associated to a decrease in the richness of either group of forest species. Given the relatively coarse scale at which our study was conducted, caution should be taken when extrapolating our results to the possible future impacts of climate change on fire regime and forest bird distribution. Our results indicate that large-scale forest maturation and spread due mainly to land abandonment in Catalonia has overridden the potentially negative effects of fires on forest bird distributions and are currently driving changes in forest biodiversity patterns across the region.

King, David I.; Chandler, Richard B.; Schlossberg, Scott; Chandler, Carlin C.				Forest Ecology and Management	257	2		421-426	January 31 2009	2009				English	0	29	Many conservationists are concerned about reports of declining populations of scrub-shrub birds. Wildlife opening management, involving repeatedly burning or mechanically treating early-successional stands, is one strategy for creating habitat for these species, but this practice is costly. Some silvicultural treatments also create scrub-shrub habitat and have the advantage of potentially generating revenue, but the relative effectiveness of wildlife opening management and silviculture for creating bird habitat is not known. During 2004 and 2005, we compared scrub-shrub bird abundance, nest success, and habitat characteristics between wildlife and silvicultural openings in western Massachusetts to determine whether the habitats created by these practices are equivalent for birds. We recorded 1927 detections of 31 scrub-shrub bird species during the course of the study and monitored 368 nests. We found that although most species were present in both treatments, many differed in abundance between wildlife and silvicultural openings, including several species of high conservation concern. These differences were attributable to differences in habitat characteristics between treatments. The overall probability of a nest surviving to fledging was 0.43, and did not differ between wildlife and silvicultural openings. Our results indicate that the habitat quality of wildlife and silvicultural openings is not equivalent for scrub-shrub birds, but the two management approaches serve as complementary strategies for maintaining these declining species.

Nikolov, Stoyan C.				Forest Ecology and Management	257	2		580-587	January 31 2009	2009				English	1	24	To gain insight into the question of which vegetation characteristics have the most influence on avian assemblages in late-successional forests, the habitat preferences of bird-guilds in old-growth endemic forests of Macedonian pine were studied over 3 years in the Pirin National Park, Bulgaria. Bird[long dash]habitat relationships were investigated by comparing vegetation characteristics, and bird species richness, diversity, abundance, and guild structure of birds (determined according to food type, foraging and nesting sites) between mature (60[long dash]100 years old) and over-mature (>120 years old) Macedonian pine forest stands. Studied forest age-classes differed mainly by the density, height and diameter of trees, and the amount of dead wood. The first one of these parameters decreased and the latter two parameters increased with the forest succession. The difference in the vegetation structure affected the abundance of bird-guilds and thus, the overall bird abundance and the structure of avian assemblages within Macedonian pine forests. There was no significant difference in bird diversity among studied forest age-classes, but the overall bird abundance increased with forest maturation. Analyzed by study plots, species richness was higher in over-mature forests, but at cluster level, there was no significant difference between mature and over-mature forest age-classes. Half of the studied (insectivorous, hole- and ground-nesters, bark- and canopy-foraging bird species) guilds were more abundant in over-mature forests, while there was no bird-guild exhibiting a preference for mature forest stands. The abundances of bird-guilds were correlated with tree height, diameter at breast height and the amount of dead wood between the studied forest age-classes and this might explain their preferences for over-mature pine forests. Therefore, for future sustainable management of these endemic forests and the conservation of their avifauna, efforts should focus on protecting the remaining native old-growth forest stands and the importance of the structure of Macedonian pine forests on their bird assemblages should be considered in forestry practices.

McWethy, David B.; Hansen, Andrew J.; Verschuyl, Jacob P.				Forest Ecology and Management	257	2		665-678	January 31 2009	2009				English	0	14	We hypothesized that edge density more strongly influences species abundances in more productive environments. To test this hypothesis we collected songbird point count data across broad biophysical gradients and gradients in forest patch edge density in the west and east slopes of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon and Washington, U.S.A., which differ in ecological productivity. We then analyzed bird response (75 species) at both the species and community level to gradients in edge density (m/ha) of open and closed-canopy forest within 1-km radius landscapes. We found that (1) differences in vegetation and structural conditions between open and closed-canopy stands were significantly greater at a highly productive landscape than a landscape with intermediate levels of productivity; (2) more bird species responded to changes in edge density in more productive west-slope Cascade forests than less productive east-side Cascade forests; (3) pooled abundance data from both sites showed that 25 of the 60 most abundant bird species responded significantly to the interaction between forest productivity and changes in landscape-level edge density; and, (4) at the community level, ordinations showed that bird community similarity in the productive west-slope Cascade forests differed across low and high levels of edge density whereas no such differentiation occurred in harsh, east-side Cascade forests. These results provide some of the first evidence supporting the hypothesis that edge effects are more pronounced in productive west-side forests where higher levels of edge density benefit generalist and open-canopy species while negatively influencing closed-canopy species. Consequently, forest management aimed at supporting species diversity will be most effective if tailored to ecosystem productivity.	McWethy, David B.; P.O.

Peterman, William E.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.				Forest Ecology and Management	257	1		8-14	January 20 2009	2009				English	2	22	Headwater streams are an important and prevalent feature of the eastern North American landscape. These streams provide a wealth of ecosystem services and support tremendous biological diversity, which is predominated by salamanders in the Appalachian region. Salamanders are ubiquitous throughout the region, contributing a significant biomass that supports ecological and ecosystem processes. One of the greatest threats to salamanders is loss of headwater-riparian habitat through timber harvest. In this study, we measured larval salamander abundance at five headwater streams with different riparian buffer widths retained following logging. By sampling larval salamanders using leaf litter bags, we assessed the impacts of even-aged timber harvest on aquatic larval salamander abundances, where it was found that larvae are negatively impacted by increased stream sedimentation and a decrease in riparian buffer width. We found that retention of a 9-m buffer was effectively no different than complete removal of all riparian forest, and as such, current regulations to protect headwater streams are ineffectual. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the 30 mbuffer treatment and uncut control treatments suggesting that a 30 mor larger riparian buffer may assuage the in-stream effects of riparian timber harvest. Management guidelines for Appalachian forests should be revised to accommodate the biology of plethodontid salamanders.

Kardynal, Kevin J.; Hobson, Keith A.; van Wilgenburg, Steven L.; Morissette, Julienne L.				Forest Ecology and Management	257	1		54-65	January 20 2009	2009				English	2	28	Forest harvesting strategies that approximate natural disturbances have been proposed as a means of maintaining natural species' diversity and richness in the boreal forests of North America. Natural disturbances impact shoreline forests and upland areas at similar rates. However, shoreline forests are generally protected from harvest through the retention of treed buffer strips. We examined bird community responses to forest management guidelines intended to approximate shoreline forest fires by comparing bird community structure in early (1[long dash]4 years) post-burned and harvested boreal riparian habitats and the adjacent shoreline forest. We sampled riparian areas with adjacent: (1) burned merchantable shoreline forest (n = 21), (2) burned non-merchantable shoreline forest (n = 29), (3) 10 m treed buffer with 25% retention in the next 30 m (n = 18), and (4) 30 m treed buffer (n = 21). Only minor differences were detected in riparian species' abundance and bird community composition between treatments with greater differences in these parameters occurring between post-fire and post-harvest upland bird communities. Indicators of all merchantable treatments were dominated by upland species with open-habitat species and habitat generalists being typical upland indicator species of burned merchantable habitats and forest specialists typical upland indicators of harvested treatments. Riparian species indicative of burned riparian habitats were Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii) and Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus) and indicators of 30 mbuffers were Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum) and Wilson's Warbler (Wilsonia pusilla). Multivariate Redundancy Analysis (RDA) of the overall (riparian and upland birds) community showed greater divergence than RDA with only riparian species suggesting less effect of fire and forestry on riparian birds than on upland birds. Higher natural range of variability (NRV) of overall post-fire bird communities compared to post-harvest communities emphasizes that harvesting guidelines currently do not achieve this level of variability. However, lack of a large negative effect on common riparian species in the first 4 years post-disturbance allows for the exploration of alternative shoreline forest management that better incorporates bird community composition of post-fire riparian areas and shoreline forests.

Saab, Victoria A.; Russell, Robin E.; Dudley, Jonathan G.				Forest Ecology and Management	257	1		151-159	January 20 2009	2009				English	0	33	Large wildfire events in coniferous forests of the western United States are often followed by postfire timber harvest. The long-term impacts of postfire timber harvest on fire-associated cavity-nesting bird species are not well documented. We studied nest-site selection by cavity-nesting birds over a 10-year period (1994[long dash]2003), representing 1[long dash]11 years after fire, on two burns created by mixed severity wildfires in western Idaho, USA. One burn was partially salvaged logged (the Foothills burn), the other was primarily unlogged (the Star Gulch burn). We monitored 1367 nests of six species (Lewis's Woodpecker Melanerpes lewis, Hairy Woodpecker Picoides villosus, Black-backed Woodpecker P. arcticus, Northern Flicker Colaptes auratus, Western Bluebird Sialia mexicana, and Mountain Bluebird S. currucoides). Habitat data at nest and non-nest random locations were characterized at fine (field collected) and coarse (remotely sensed) spatial scales. Nest-site selection for most species was consistently associated with higher snag densities and larger snag diameters, whereas wildfire location (Foothills versus Star Gulch) was secondarily important. All woodpecker species used nest sites with larger diameter snags that were surrounded by higher densities of snags than at non-nest locations. Nests of Hairy Woodpecker and Mountain Bluebird were primarily associated with the unlogged wildfire, whereas nests of Lewis's Woodpecker and Western Bluebird were associated with the partially logged burn in the early years after fire. Nests of wood-probing species (Hairy and Black-backed Woodpeckers) were also located in larger forest patch areas than patches measured at non-nest locations. Our results confirm previous findings that maintaining clumps of large snags in postfire landscapes is necessary for maintaining breeding habitat of cavity-nesting birds. Additionally, appropriately managed salvage logging can create habitat for some species of cavity-nesting birds that prefermore open environments. Our findings can be used by landmangers to develop design criteria for postfire salvage logging that will reserve breeding habitat for cavity-nesting birds.

Olthoff, Matthias				Abhandlungen aus dem Westfaelischen Museum fuer Naturkunde	71	3		149-170	2009	2009				German	0	0	The Haltern-Borkenberge Training Area has a total area of approx. 1.800 ha and stretches across the administrative districts of Coesfeld and Recklinghausen (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). It is part of the Special Protection Area "Heubachniederung, Lavesumer Bruch and Borkenberge". In 2006 (supplementary in 2007), 91 breeding bird species were recorded on this military training area by territory mapping in total. Population sizes of important breeding birds (e.g. species of the red data book of North Rhine-Westphalia, bird species of the Annex I of the EU Birds Directive) were quantitatively recorded, while all other species w only qualitatively registered. The high breeding populations of Caprimulgus europaeus (26 pairs) and Lullula arborea (22) that breed on the margins of heathlands and dry grasslands as well as on clearings are extraordinarily remarkable. The open heathlands and dry grasslands are characterized by high densities of Anthus pratensis (88) and Alauda arvensis (45), while Saxicola torquata (14) prefers bushy areas. The bogs and wetlands represent important breeding areas for Tachybaptus ruficollis (5), Anas crecca (4), Rolhts aquaticus (8) and Acrocephalus scirpaceus (1 1). Two or three breeding pairs of Perris apivorus. Landis collurio, Drvocopus martius and Oriolus oriolus were recorded, while only one breeding pair of each Falco subbuteo, Jynx torquilla, Luscinia svecica and Corvus corax was found. Beside this, high numbers of Phoenicurus phoenicurus and Anthus trivialis breed in or on the edge of thin forests. Between 1988 and 2008, it was possible to record 167 bird species on the militar) training area. An old fish pond located in a bog (e.g. Pandion haliaetus, Botaurus stellaris, various waterbirds) and the open heathlands and dry grasslands (e.g. Circus cyaneus, Lanius excubitor, Lymnocryptes minimus, various passerine species) play an important role for migrating and wintering birds. This article puts emphasis on the positive effects of military disturbances on some bird species (e.g. Caprimulgus europaeus, Lullula arborea).

Ribic, Christine A.; Guzy, Michael J.; Sample, David W.				American Midland Naturalist	161	1		110-122	January 2009	2009				English	1	41	Because of the declines in grassland bird populations across North America, many State and federal agencies are making efforts to manage for grassland bird populations, particularly in a landscape context. To effectively manage for grassland birds, we need to understand how grassland bird Species Use different habitat types Within landscapes. We determined the densities of grassland birds in remnant prairie patches and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields and compared those to managed agricultural habitat types (pastures, alfalfa hay and strip crop fields). We also investigated whether densities were associated with landscape features. This Study took place in the Military Ridge Prairie Heritage Area (MRPHA) in southwestern Wisconsin May-Jul. 2002 and 2003. Land use in the MRPHA is primarily agricultural, with a relatively large portion of the land in pasture, hay, small grains and idle grasslands enrolled in CRP and relatively few acres of corn and soybeans compared to other areas of the state. This area also has numerous remnant prairie patches. We used line transect surveys to measure species density in the different habitat types. The five Most common grassland species in the study area were bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Henslow's sparrow (A. henslowii) and Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis). Densities did not differ between years. Habitat type was the most important factor associated with species density. Bobolink densities were greatest in hay fields, followed by CRP fields. Eastern meadowlark densities were greatest in CRP fields, remnant prairie patches and pastures. Grasshopper sparrow densities were greatest in remnant prairie, Henslow's sparrow densities were greatest in CRP fields and remnant prairie and Savannah sparrow densities were greatest in pasture and hay fields. There was no evidence that densities of any Of the grassland species increased With site size within habitat type. Only bobolink and eastern meadowlark were associated with a landscape variable; both species' densities in the field were positively associated with proportion of grassland within 200 in of the site. When managing for grassland birds in a landscape with a large amount of grassland, a diversity of habitat types will be needed to conserve grassland birds as a group.

Tremblay, Junior A.; Ibarzabal, Jacques; Dussault, Christian; Savard, Jean-Pierre L.				Avian Conservation and Ecology	4	1		art2, 1-16	2009	2009	http://www.ace-eco.org/archive.php			English	0	0	We investigated home-range characteristics and habitat selection by Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in an unburned, boreal forest landscape managed by mosaic harvesting in Quebec, Canada. Habitat selection by this species was specifically examined to determine home-range establishment and foraging activities. We hypothesized that Black-backed Woodpeckers would respond to harvesting by adjusting their home-range size as a function of the amount of dead wood available. Twenty-two birds were tracked using radiotelemetry, and reliable estimates of home-range size were obtained for seven breeding individuals (six males and one female). The average home-range size was 151.5[plus or minus] 18.8 ha (range: 100.4[long dash]256.4 ha). Our results indicate that this species establishes home ranges in areas where both open and forested habitats are available. However, during foraging activities, individuals preferentially selected areas dominated by old coniferous stands. The study also showed that the spatial distribution of preferred foraging habitat patches influenced space use, with home-range area increasing with the median distance between old coniferous habitat patches available within the landscape. Finally, these data show that Black-backed Woodpeckers may successfully breed in an unburned forest with at least 35 m3 [center dot] ha-1 of dead wood, of which 42% (15 m3 [center dot] ha-1) is represented by dead wood at the early decay stage.

Das EU-Vogelschutzgebiet "Unterer Niederrhein" - Nagelprobe fuer das europaeische Naturschutzrecht.	Wille, Volkhard; Doer, Daniel; Barkow, Andreas				Berichte zum Vogelschutz	46			85-106	2009	2009				German	1	2	The site "Lower Rhine Area" was designated as a Special Protection Area (as a provision of the Birds Directive of the European Union) in 1983 and it is one of the oldest and biggest European protected areas in Northrhine-Westphalia. The site is a very good example to demonstrate the powerful as well as the feeble parts of the European nature conservation law and its national implementation. The Lower Rhine Area has a nationwide importance as breeding site for Black-tailed Godwit, Corncrake, Black and Common Tern. It has international importance as wintering ground for Arctic goose and some duck species. The site was designated in 1983 as Special Protection Area and Ramsar site (Wetland of International Importance) with an approximated surface area of 25,000 ha. Because of the insufficient implementation a treaty violation proceedings was started in 2006 and was ceased in the beginning of 2009 with the compromise that 5,500 hectares will be added to the site area and the federal government was engaged to develop and implement a management plan for the complete SPA. The important bird species are threatened by different factors that are discussed in this paper: Erosion of the river bed and lowering of the groundwater level, Intensification of land use, Recreational activities such as air traffic, camping, aquatic sports, hunting and fishery, Infrastructure and building development as well as excavations. In the last decades negative population trends predominated within the value adding bird species. The population sizes of all breeding and resting bird species are stated for the time periods 1979-1983, 1994-1998 as well as 2000-2005. More than 40 percent of the breeding bird species have declining population trends since the implementation of the Special Protection Area in 1983. Especially the population declines of meadow birds such as Black-tailed Godwit or Common Snipe are serious. Some species, especially those which benefit from specific programs of the protection of species, show increasing populations. Of the bird species that use the Lower Rhine area as a stop-over or wintering site, many show changes as well. About one half of the species show increasing passage migrant or wintering populations. Declining populations have to be noted for the arctic swan species as well as different waders as European Lapwing, Ruff and Golden Plovers. The diverse reasons for the degradation of the site since the implementation as a Special Protection Area are stated and discussed in detail. Also the different nature conservation measurements as administrative law, contract nature protection schemes, purchase of land and site management are assessed comparatively to analyze the reasons why the conducted nature conservation actions were not sufficiently successful. An agricultural strategy that fits with the nature conservation targets is of vital importance for the evaluation of the perspectives for the development of the SPA "Lower Rhine area" in the future.

Berkut	18	1-2		143-163	2009	2009				Russian	0	1	The Aquatic Warbler (AW) is a globally threatened species. It is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List and as disappearing in the Red Book of Ukraine. Information concerning distribution and number of the species in Ukraine before 1995 was almost absent. The total number in Ukraine was estimated in about 1-10 singing males. During 1995-2000 the intensive researches were carried out in Northern half of Ukraine. About 25 breeding sites were found. The total number of AW for 2000 was estimated in 2600-3400 singing males. Two population groups were found in Ukraine: the Pripyat group - 2100-2800 males and the Desna-Dnieper group - 500-600 males. During 2001-2009 the survey of about 100 new potential sites in Ukraine were carried out (incl. central, southern, eastern regions). The most part of these territories does not represent interest as potential habitats of the warbler. They were drained or were strongly transformed as a result of euthrophication. Some suitable habitats for AW in Southern and Eastern Ukraine were identified, but they are too small (not more than 10-20 ha) and located very far apart from each other (more than 100-200 km). Most likely AW could nest in these regions more than 50 years ago. New breeding sites were found only in Volyn region - in valleys of the river Pripyat (600 ha suitable biotopes and 450-550 males), river Stokhid (more 300 ha and 150-180 males), river Chornoguzka (430 ha and nearly 150 males), area between lakes Bile and Pishchane (285 ha and 120-150 males). Till beginning of 2010 30 constant breeding territories ofAW are known (19 sites in Volyn region, 3 - Rivne region, 6 - Chernigiv region, 2 - Kyiv region). The total number of the Ukrainian population makes about 4200-4860 males (Desna-Dnieper group - 635-695 and Pripyat group - 3545-4167 males). Hydrological conditions of habitats are the most important factor for AW. They are related to occupation of habitats by birds and their breeding success. Therefore, the yearly dynamic of water level determines changes in number of breeding birds in specific sites. The character of dynamic water regime is essentially different for AW wetlands in two population groups. The habitats of the Desna-Dnieper population group are characterized by a relatively stable water level. Annual fluctuations of hydrological conditions are characteristic, but do not influence number of local AW groups very strongly. A completely different situation was observed in most AW habitats in Northwest Ukraine. Very strong yearly fluctuations of water level due to high river floods are characteristic for habitats in the river floodplains of Pripyat, Turya, Styr, and Stokhid. Especially critical the high waters are in breeding period (May - June), for example, in 1999 and 2005. A part of birds (sometimes all) leaves the traditional breeding sites and temporarily occupy less suitable habitats. The monitoring of 6 key settlements ofAW is carried out since 2002 every year. For this purpose was chosen 2 breeding sites of the Desna-Dnipro population group (valleys of Supoy and Uday) and 4 breeding sites of the Pripyat population group (2 sites in valley of Pripyat, and in valleys of Turya and Styr). These six key breeding sites keep about 56% of Ukrainian population. In all six plots the counts of AW are carried out on routes, which usually have length of 1,5 km. The birds are counted on a strip of 200 In width. Count is started 60 minutes before sunset and continued during 80-100 minutes. Other bird species register during this count and special morning count. The information about hydrological regime and vegetation is collected also. Main breeding sites of AW are described in the article. 24% of Ukrainian AW nest on territories of protected areas. The most important from them is the National Park "Pripyat - Stokhid" (Volyn region).

Stralberg, Diana; Applegate, David L.; Phillips, Steven J.; Herzog, Mark P.; Nur, Nadav; Warnock, Nils				Biological Conservation	142	1		94-109	January 2009	2009				English	1	30	Conservation planning and management decisions often present trade-offs among habitats and species, generating uncertainty about the composition and configuration of habitat that will best meet management goals. The public acquisition of 5471 ha of salt ponds in San Francisco Bay for tidal-marsh restoration presents just such a challenge. Because the existing ponds support large numbers of waterbirds, restoring the entire area to tidal marsh could cause undesirable local declines for many species. To identify management strategies that simultaneously maximize abundances of marsh- and pond-associated species, we applied an integer programming approach to maximize avian abundance, comparing across two objectives, two models, and five species weightings (20 runs total). For each pond, we asked: should it be restored to a tidal marsh or kept as a managed pond, and with what salinity and depth? We used habitat relationship models as inputs to non-linear integer programs to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. We found that a simple linear objective, based on maximizing a weighted sum of standardized species' abundance, led to homogeneous solutions (all-pond or all-marsh). Maximizing a log-linear objective yielded more heterogeneous configurations that benefit more species. Including landscape terms in the models resulted in slightly greater habitat aggregation, but generally favored pond-associated species. It also led to the placement of certain habitats near the bay's edge. Using the log-linear objective, optimal restoration configurations ranged from 9% to 60% tidal marsh, depending on the species weighting, highlighting the importance of thoughtful a priori consideration of priority species.

We used 23 50-m radius point counts to estimate bird abundance in areas with different degree of damage (including no damage). At each point we conducted a visual assessment of the damage of the canopy and the understory. We used Generalized Linear Models to assess the response of the abundance of different avian guilds to the damage at the different vegetation layers. In all the cases, canopy damage was the best predictor of changes in bird abundances. Among the latter, only Rhinocriptids and nectarivores were also affected by the level of damage at the understory.

Conservation Evidence	6			98-104	2009	2009	http://www.conservationevidence.com/			English	0	0	In a European context, Iceland has some of the highest levels of desertification (due primarily to historic overgazing, frequent volcanic eruptions and subsequent erosion) and also vast naturally occurring barren areas (mainly formed and maintained by flooding of glacial rivers). Since 1988 efforts have been made, by the Icelandic Soil Conservation Service, to reduce sandstorms by revegetation on some sandplains in the region of South-Iceland. Action includes sowing strips of Nootka lupin Lupinus nootkathensis, and lyme grass Leymus arenarius and other grasses, with repeated fertilization. Very few bird species occur on Icelandic barren sands and if present, occur only at low densities. The effects of revegetation on avian abundance and diversity were evaluated by comparison to adjacent barren areas. Revegetation has a clear and a positive effect on some species which benefit from vegetated land. Meadow pipit Anthus pratensis and common snipe Gallinago gallinago occurred in high densities, particularly in mature strips of lupins, and other species of birds were colonising. These bird species are absent from barren sandplains.

Meltofte, Hans; Grell, Michael B.; Lindballe, Peer L.; Nyegaard, Timme				Dansk Ornitologisk Forenings Tidsskrift	103	1		11-21	2009	2009				Dutch	0	2	During an atlas project in Denmark 1993-1996, the breeding birds of small biotopes (ponds, bogs, meadows, commons, heaths) were recorded within 212 squares of 4 km2, distributed all over Denmark. Small biotopes were defined as ponds of more than 100 m2 and bogs, meadows, commons and heaths of more than 2500 m2, which is the lower limit for areas of this type for which the Danish nature conservation legislation grants general protection. On the other hand, the selected areas were not so large as to qualify as so called "true bird sites" (Dybbro 1985). Each site was covered by 1-2 visits during 15 April [long dash] 30 June in at least one of the study years. Only certain species should be recorded, for example were most passerines neglected; see Table 1 for a complete list. The resulting figures must be regarded as minimum numbers. It appears from Table 1 that 61% of the visited sites held breeding birds associated with water, and that a limited number of species dominated; Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Moorhen Gallinula chloropus, Coot Fulica atra and Lapwing Vanellus vanellus were the commonest true waterbirds, while Thrush Nightingale Luscinia luscinia, Marsh Warbler Acrocephalus palustris, Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus and Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus were the most common water-associated passerines. In Table 2, the results are extrapolated to cover the entire country, and it appears that c. 130000 pairs of the species in question breed on the small biotopes of Denmark. In addition to this come all the passerines etc. which are found in bushes and trees in these biotopes. In Table 2, the number of pairs recorded on "larger sites" during the same national survey is added to make up the number living within bird sites of the entire country. Compared to the national totals estimated for the same period (Grell 1998) it appears that the national populations of several species may have been consider-ably underestimated. In Table 3 the degree of co-existence between the most common waterbird species is presented. It should be noted that the present study is not a thorough investigation of the bird fauna on small biotopes in Denmark. Instead, the intention is to give a rough indication of the species composition and abundance of breeding birds living in such areas, and so to give an idea of the overall importance of these biotopes as nature's "oases" in the extensive farmland that covers two thirds of Denmark. Small biotopes have disappeared at an alarming rate during most of the 20th century, but are now protected by law so that the the declining trend has slowed down or perhaps even ended or reversed. However, other threats, such as eutrofication and overgrowing, continue to be a concern.

Dietz, Markus; Pir, Jacques B.				Folia Zoologica	58	3		327-340	2009	2009				English	0	32	Bechstein's flat, Myotis bechsteinii is it European tree-dwelling vespertilionid bat species. which has to be considered as index species for old growth broadleaved woodland. However factors affecting density and habitat selection are still poorly understood. Therefore 22 representative woodland areas in Luxembourg that ire located in the central geographic range of the Bechstein's bat, were analysed. During 76 nights. forest dwelling bills were registered by intensive mist netting, 47 Bechstein bats were radio-tracked to identify tree-roosts and 24 individuals were radio-tracked oil 3-5 consecutive nights to determine their foraging areas. Ill total 14 reproduction areas and 12 nursery colonies were localized, with the number of females ranging between 20-70 individuals (mean 34 [plus or minus] 18.1 ind.). The distribution of Bechstein's bat revealed to be uneven and to be significantly positively correlated to mean temperature and the presence of Melico-Fagetum forest with a marked amount of old oak trees. Nevertheless the height, the mean precipitation and the occurrence of Luzulo-Fagetum forest is negatively correlated to the occurrence of M. bechsteinii. Alto.-ether. 78 tree-roosts from nursery colonies Were identified. Colonies Use it day-roost complex and show a significant preference for woodpecker holes. Female Bechstein's bats foraged on a mean area of 46 ha (MCP) with small core feeding areas (mean: 2.1 ha) which show no. or only a small overlap with each other. Roosting and feeding sites are characterised by canopy and understorey structures similar to native woodlands. The results of this study leads to a scientific data base for conservation and long time monitoring for this bat species.

Lesmeister, Damon B.; Gompper, Matthew E.; Millspaugh, Joshua J.				Journal of Wildlife Management	73	1		18-25	January 2009	2009				English	4	28	Since the 1940s, eastern spotted skunks (Spilogale putorius) have declined dramatically throughout the Midwest. One hypothesis for the decline is the loss of suitable habitat, although little is known about the ecological requirements of this species. To elucidate seasonal home range and habitat selection by eastern spotted skunks, we conducted telemetry-based field work in the Ouachita Mountains of western Arkansas, USA. During 2 years of field work, we collected day- and nighttime radiolocations for 33 eastern spotted skunks. We used kernel-based utilization distributions, volume of intersection indices, and weighted compositional analysis to evaluate seasonal home range dynamics and habitat selection. Although we found moderate adult male site fidelity, there were large seasonal differences in home range size, with ranges of between 76 ha and 175 ha ([plus or minus]22-62 SE) during summer, fall, and winter, and home ranges of 866 ha ([plus or minus] 235 SE) during spring. Male home range increases in the spring were likely caused by questing behavior in search of reproductive females. Females maintained home ranges of 54 ha to 135 ha ([plus or minus] 7-30 SE) and moderate site fidelity during all seasons. During each season, we observed selection of young shortleaf pine ( Pinus echinata) and hardwood stands over other available cover types, likely due to a preference for a dense, complex understory and a closed canopy overstory to reduce predation risk. Most habitats in the study region were managed for an herbaceous understory and an older, more open canopy, in part to benefit red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) populations. Thus, if simultaneous management for these 2 vertebrates is a goal, a balance of early and late successional habitat should be reached.

Lislevand, Terje; Myklebust, Magne; Rangbru, Bjorn; Rudolfsen, Geir; Aarvak, Tomas				NOF Rapportserie	4			1-36	2009	2009			Unpaginated appendixes.	Norwegian	0	0	The Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos minor) is the smallest European woodpecker and the only one which is found throughout Norway. Its population is thought to be declining in the country, primarily as a consequence of habitat destruction caused by modern forestry. The species is therefore classiied as Vulnerable (VU) on the national Red List (2006). The present report summarizes results from a project which collected information on distribution and population status of the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker in Norway between 1995 and 2009. The goal was to collect details on as many as possible locations where the species is found. Based on the resulting material distribution maps are presented which could be compared with the results of a previous national bird atlas (1970-1986). Changes in distribution are often dif- icult to demonstrate because distribution maps are inluenced of many possible factors which are hard to control for. However, there are no indications that the distribution has changed consider- ably in Norway the last 40 years. Information about nest sites and phenology was also collated by asking birdwatchers to sub- mit such data. The data set conirmed previously published information that the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker normally excavates nest holes in dead trees (a total of 96% of the nests, n = 49). Nests are reported from a total of 12 different tree species dominated by Birch and Alder (70% of nests, n = 167). The nest holes' average height above ground is 3.6 m. Two cases where nest holes were re-used for breeding in consecutive years are reported. Egg laying normally occur during May in southern Norway, but in rare cases as early as mid-April. Marked movements away from the breeding areas are evident in autumn in some years and the species could then be located in places where it does not breed. One such year was 2007 when a high number of Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers was observed along the southern coast, with a peak in September-October. Few recoveries of Norwegian-ringed birds exist and a previously published record of a Norwegian bird recovered in England (Bakken et al. 2006) is mentioned as erroneous. A number of Norwegian birdwatchers have contributed their views on local population sizes and changes in population size throughout the country. As a crude measure of population density we relate these local population sizes to forest areas in the same geographical region. The results show that the highest population densities are found along the coast from the southern part of Rogaland to Akershus counties. Previously published population numbers, and the population numbers collected in the current project, are used to calculate population estimates for each Norwegian county. The sum of these numbers makes up a national population estimate of about 2500-5500 breeding pairs. A review of reported population changes in the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker does not show a simple picture. However, there are indications that the population decrease was most prominent in the south- eastern part of Norway and that the population has been relatively stable in the southern part of the country the last 15 years. Finally, some recommendations for conservation of the habitat of Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers are given.

Ten[long dash]thirteen breeding territories of the Three-toed Woodpecker and 10-14 of the White-backed Woodpecker were found (1.1 and 1.2 territories/10 km2 of total forest area, respectively). The Three-toed Woodpecker inhabits 80-year-old or older forests of spruce (23% of territories; 30.0 territories/10 km2), spruce/fir (38%; 7.7 territories/10 km2), spruce/deciduous (8%; 10.0 territories/10 km2) and younger spruce forests (31%; 3.3 territories/10 km2) above 650 m a.s.l. The White-backed Woodpecker occupies 80-year-old or older forests of beech (57% of territories; 7.3 territories/10 km2), sycamore/lime (7%; 20.0 territories/10 km2), spruce/deciduous (7%; 10.0 territories/10 km2) and alder/riparian (29%; 8.0 territories/10 km'). From15 to 30% of territories were located in protected areas which cover only 1% of the total forest area. In managed forests these woodpeckers occurred mostly in hardly accessible areas which provide good numbers of old dying or dead trees. In the whole Beskid Wyspowy range, the total number of breeding territories of the Three-toed Woodpecker can be estimated at 20[long dash]25 and while that of the White-backed Woodpecker at 25[long dash]35. About 5% of the Polish population of these two wood-peckers is found in the study area, which indicates that an Natura 2000 Important Bird Area (IBA) ought to be established in these mountains.

Czeszczewik, Dorota				Ornis Fennica	86	1		30-37	2009	2009				English	0	14	I compared structural characteristics between foraging plots of an endangered European species, the White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos (WbW), and random plots in primeval deciduous stands of Bialowieza National Park. I expected that WbW would use plots with higher amount of dead wood in more advanced decay stage, with higher amount of birches Betula spp. and aspen Populus tremula, and with more large trees. Within 50, 0.25-ha plots (25 used by WbW and 25 random) tree-species composition, tree condition, tree diameter at breast height DBH and characteristics of dead trees were measured. WbW and random plots were similar in overall structure; only the volume of fallen timber was significantly larger in WbW than in random plots (65.3 and 47.4 m3/ba, respectively). There was also a tendency for the occurrence of more snags of 11-20 cm DBH within WbW plots. Thus, the amount of fallen timber might determine WbW choice of the foraging habitat. However, due to the relatively high similarity of WbW vs. random plots, the sections of Bialowieza National Park that are covered with old-growth deciduous stands represent high-quality habitat for WbW foraging.

We seasonally recorded birds at 60 point count stations (30 in each type of habitat) between March 1998 and August 1999. The shrubless area showed higher percentages of herb cover and bare ground than the forest, whereas in the forest there were higher covers of litter and shrubs and a higher shrub height than in the shrubless area. Moreover, the shrubless area showed a lower species richness and bird abundance than the forest in summer. At the guild level, analyses revealed that bark insectivores were more abundant in the shrubless area, whereas foliage insectivores, terrestrial insectivores, and arboreal seed eaters were more abundant in the forest. Our results show that shrub removal has a great influence on the structure of bird assemblages, which persists several years later after the application of this technique. We recommend that, in case of massive shrub removal, stripes of shrubby vegetation should be maintained in order to guarantee the inclusion of shrub-associated bird species in the mosaic landscape.

Comparaison de l'avifaune de sapinieres et de pinedes medio-europeennes et mediterraneennes.	Lebreton, Philippe; Thevenot, Michel				Revue d'Ecologie la Terre et la Vie	64	2		171-188	2009	2009				French	0	2	Bird communities of 11 fir forests (Abies pectinata and A. pinsapo + maroccana) and 6 pine forests (Pinus silvestris and P. pinaster) were compared along a 2000 kin transect from the Vosges (N.-E. France) to the Middle Atlas (Marocco). A common background of ca 15 Palearctic bird species accounts for three quarters of relative abundances in all communities. However, significant differences appear at several levels. (1) Between the medio-european and Mediterranean biogeographical areas, middle latitudes of Spain prevent the presence southward of ca 10 species, such as the Goldcrest and the Bullfinch. Conversely, although belonging to the same faunistic region, 11 species, such as the Short-toed "Free Creeper and the Serin, are more frequent in the Mediterranean than further north. Over the two forest types investigated, there are only 33 Passerine species, over a total of 54, common to Middle Europe and the Mediterranean area. (2) Abies and Pinus forests have in common a striking figure of 46 bird species. The distinctive species are the Firecrest and the Blackcap in fir forests, the Crested Tit and the Common Crossbill in pine forests. As already noted by various authors, as a consequence of its insularity and mesological peculiarities the Mediterranean forest avifauna can be considered as an impoverished version of its Medio-european counterpart. (3) At the broad regional scale, a multivariate analysis shows an avifaunistic gradient running from climacic forests, mainly on north-facing slopes from Vanoise (French Alps) to the Pyrenees, to para-climacic pre-forests, mainly on south-facing slopes, in Andalucia and Marocco. In the former case, boreal bird species account for three quarters of the abundances in the community but less than half in the latter where the rest consists predominantly of rather biogeographically and ecologically ubiquitous species (Carduelinae, Woodlark, Rock Bunting) which, for a mix of ecological and anthropogenic reasons, are able to colonize more and more common southward thermo-xerophilous and open wooded landscapes.

In this study we analysed bird species composition and bird diversity on forested heaps in the Most region, in the Northwestern part of the Czech Republic. The communities consisted of common species dominated with chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita) and blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) and only several less common species (pied flycather Ficedula hypoleuca, barred warbler Sylvia nisoria, wryneck Jynx torquilla). Increased bird diversity was linked to amount of edge habitats at the expense of continuous forest. Habitat attributes associated with increased bird diversity appeared rather in the stands left to spontaneous succession without technical reclamation which appeared more often nearby Krusne hory Mts than in Ceske stredohor Mts. In conclusion, in reclamation practice we recommend to include spontaneous successional stands as well as plantations combining mosaic of tree clumps and open patches, which would lead to increased diversification of bird communities on reclaimed land.

Normander, Bo; Levin, Gregor; Auvinen, Ari-Pekka; Bratli, Harald; Stabbetorp, Odd; Hedblom, Marcus; Glimskar, Anders; Gudmundsson, Gudmundur A.				TemaNord	509			1-130	2009	2009				English	0	2	The aim of the NordBio2010 project is to evaluate the 2010 biodiversity target by developing indicators that can describe changes in biodiversity over time in the Nordic countries. We have developed a simple concept to clarify the use of biodiversity indicators; a concept that can describe both the quantity and quality dimensions of biodiversity. Changes in quantity are measured as trends in the area of pre-defined habitats or ecosystems (such as forest, grassland or inland water bodies). Changes in quality are measured as species abundance trends and, when applicable, as other habi- tat quality parameters, such as trends in the proportion of old trees in for- ests or grazing pressure on grasslands. In order to measure changes in biodiversity quantity, we have devel- oped a common Nordic habitat classification system that defines a range of ecosystem types. At the 1st level we have defined 10 major habitat types, which at the 2nd level are divided into 27 sub-types. The classification at the 1st level is based on well-defined criteria, including the type and degree of vegetation cover, the type of underlying substrate as well as human influences, such as agricultural management practice. The division into sub- types at the 2nd level is based on a less stringent evaluation of various criteria relevant in a Nordic context. To measure biodiversity quality we have identified a range of species abundance indicators and other quality indica- tors for each of the main habitat types, and when data sources were sufficient these indicators have been calculated and presented. Based on the concept of measuring both quantity and quality, a two-dimensional biodi- versity index can be computed, and such indices are presented for those of the main habitat types (such as farmland, mire and forest) where adequate data exist. Our results comprise the most comprehensive documentation of land use in the Nordic countries to date. Based on recent and historic data sources we have been able to deduce key trends in land use. The results show that the area of important nature types such as mire, grassland and heathland have decreased significantly over the past one to two decades, whereas the area of constructed habitats, including city areas and transport net- works, has grown considerably in all of the Nordic countries. Each of these individual trends will cause the quantity of biodiversity to decline. On the positive side, however, a slight increase in the area of forest may count as the only trend in land use that may have a positive impact on biodiversity. Looking into the quality aspect of biodiversity, our results reveal that two-thirds of the quality indicators presented show declines and the re- maining one-third show improvements (or steady-state). While all of the quality indicators for farmland, mire and grassland show declines in bio- diversity, the indicators for constructed and coastal habitats, inland water and forest reveal both positive and negative trends in biodiversity. How- ever, none of the main habitat types exclusively shows improvements. The majority of the species indicators are based on bird populations. Even though birds generally are believed to be highly relevant indictors for biodiversity, they clearly represent only a corner of biodiversity. However, bird species are the best monitored group in the Nordic coun- tries and therefore constitute the best assessment tool for biodiversity. A limited number of population trends also exist for butterflies, mammals and a few plant species, whereas time series are almost non-existent for all remaining species groups. In conjunction with the other indicators, however, the bird indicators selected here represent valuable information on the trend and state of biodiversity in the Nordic countries. In respect to both the quantity and quality dimensions of biodiversity our results indicate an overall decline in biodiversity in the Nordic countries since 1990. In particular, farmland, mire, grassland and heathland show declines in biodiversity, but also the remaining habitats show negative trends. Therefore, based on the findings from this study, we conclude that it is highly unlikely that the target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 can be achieved by the Nordic countries. Our results should be perceived as a first attempt to make an overall assessment of the state of biodiversity in the Nordic countries. We believe that if further efforts were directed towards scrutinising existing and historic monitoring programmes and data sources, additional indicators could be calculated and hence a better knowledge base would be achieved. Also, our experience is that the monitoring programmes in the Nordic countries vary considerably between the individual countries and as a consequence it is often difficult to find matching datasets in all countries. We recommend that nature and biodiversity monitoring in future be coordinated at a Nordic level to a greater degree, and that monitoring be more focused on measuring temporal changes in biodiversity. If the target of halting biodiversity loss in the Nordic countries is to be achieved, major additional efforts will be necessary. It is not the scope of the NordBio2010 project, however, to suggest the policy actions that would be needed. It is simply the conclusion of this first assessment of Nordic biodiversity that further action is required if the Nordic countries are to approach their 2010 target for biodiversity.

In our study we compared birds of 1, 2 and 3 years old set-asides, winter cereal fields and grasslands in 39 sampling sites in the Heves ESESA in 2008. Bird census was conducted two times, in April and May in 100 meter radius circles. We spent 5 minutes in every circle and detected the birds by visual and acoustic signs. In 176 census points 1347 individuals of 51 species were detected. The most abundant species were the skylark (Alauda arvensis), the yellow wagtail (Motacilla flava) and the corn bunting (Miliaria calandra[long dash] The winter wheat fields were the poorest in species and individuals. The species richness and abundance of birds in set-asides increased with time of resting. The grassland was richer in species than the 1 and 2 years old set-asides, and in and abundance also than the 1 year old set-asides. According to our results we suggest that many bird species and individuals prefer the set-asides, and therefore their role in conserving farmland biodiversity could be considerable.

Prescribed fire and grazing timing are two management tools frequently used within publicly owned sagebrush ecosystems. We conducted a variety of surveys in order to assess the impacts of grazing timing strategies (early summer before peak green-up, mid-summer at peak green-up, and late summer after peak green-up) in conjunction with prescribed fire on avian and small mammal populations in a high-elevation sagebrush ecosystem. Avian surveys resulted in a large detection sample size for three bird species: Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri), horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), and vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus). Brewer's sparrows had the lowest number of detections within the mid-summer grazing treatment compared to early and late summer grazing treatments, while horned larks and vesper sparrows had higher detection frequencies within the late summer grazing treatment. Summer and fall sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) pellet counts revealed that the greatest over- winter and over-summer use by sage-grouse occurred within the early summer grazing treatment with minimal use of burn treatment areas across all grazing treatments. Deer-mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) represented approximately 90 percent of small mammals captured and were most prevalent within the mid-summer grazing treatment. Sagebrush cover was greatest within the mid-summer grazing treatment. We monitored 50 and 103 nests in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The apparent success rate for shrub-obligate nesting species was 58 percent in 2007 and 63 percent in 2008. This research will support management of sagebrush ecosystems by providing public land managers with direct comparisons of wildlife response to management regimes.

Seven circular plots with a 50m radius and their centers at least 150m apart were selected to represent all the habitat types available at the University. Avifaunal populations in those seven plots were recorded from 6:00 hrs to 9:00 hrs, four times each month. Thirty two bird species belonging to eight orders and twenty three families were recorded during the study period. Those included three migratory bird species, Forest wagtail (Dendronanthus indicus), Asian paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone paradisi}, Grey wagtail (Motacilla cinered) and one endemic species Crimson-fronted barbet (Megalaima rubricapilla rubricapilla). Four bird species, Rose ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), Red vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer cafer) and Yellow billed babbler (Turdoides affinis taprobanus} were recorded in all seven sites. Endemic Crimson fronted barbet was recorded only in the site which had canopy trees. Seventeen avian species were recorded in all the months from August 2004 to March 2005. There was no significant difference of the species diversity among months. Site with Casuarina equisetifolis had the highest species richness of 25 and site covered with grass had the lowest species richness of 11. Relative abundance indicated that Common myna was the most common bird followed by the Red-vented bulbul. Long-billed sunbird and Indian pond heron were the least common birds followed by Oriental white-eye and Crimson-fronted barbet. Although the University is situated 2 km away from the well known aquatic bird sanctuary, Bellanwila - Attidiya marsh, no aquatic birds were recorded. The University provides habitats for thirty two avian species despite the fact that it is situated in a highly urbanized area, and thus warrants step to protect them.

Six line transects (length 500m each) totaling 3.00 km, which provided the maximum visibility of the Bolgoda canal was marked along the canal bank using a GPS. All birds seen within one hundred meters on either side of each transect were recorded for each month from June 2005 to February 2006. A total number of 107 individuals belong to 53 bird species, thirteen orders and thirty one families were recorded during the study period. The globally endangered Spot Billed Pelican (Pelecanus philippensis) and four migratory species Common Sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos) Eurasion Thick- Knee (Burhinus Odicnemus), Gull - Billed Tern (Gelochelidon nilotica), and Asian Paradise Flycatcher (Terpsiphone paradisi) were among them. Diversity and density indices were significantly different among months (ANOVA, F=4.24, p < 0.01 and F=8.828, p < 0.001) respectively. Relative abundance indicated that House Crow (Corvus splendens) was the most abundant species while Crested Serpent Eagle was the least abundant bird followed by Pheasant Tailed Jacana and Lesser Whistling Teal. Present study revealed that although the study site is in close proximity to densely populated residential areas; it still provides a vital habitat to large number of bird species and therefore warrants protection.

We compared the species richness and abundance of bird communities in a field with 16 introduced woodland islets and in a nearby abandoned field located in central Spain during spring and winter time. The woodland islets presented higher accumulated species richness as well as a higher probability of finding new species if sampling effort were increased only in winter time. These trends were the opposite during spring time. Mean species richness and mean bird abundance were lower at the woodland islets than at the abandoned field in both seasons. We found a higher abundance of open-habitat specialist species in the abandoned field. Woodland islets favoured the wintering of chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita. We did not find any effects on the only forest specialist species (blue tit Parus caeruleus) in spring. Bird richness and abundance were higher in edge islets than in inner islets. The introduction of larger and mixed plantations connected by hedgerows and a management that favoured the development of big trees, a lower tree density and a diverse shrub layer could promote bird diversity, allowing forest specialists and open-habitat species to coexist at the landscape scale.

Howes, Alison L.; Maron, Martine				Wildlife Research	36	7		617-626	2009	2009				English	1	35	Context. Large reserves have potential to provide important refugia for fragmentation-sensitive species as they lack many aspects of habitat degradation associated with fragmented regions. However, large reserves often have a history of deleterious management practices that may affect the restoration of biological diversity. One significant symptom of habitat fragmentation and disturbance in Australia is the increased occurrence of the aggressive noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). In Queensland, however, even large continuous areas of woodland appear to be dominated by the noisy miner. Aims. We examined the severity of this phenomenon by identifying the interactions between habitat structure, noisy miner abundance and avian assemblages in a private and a public conservation reserve in central Queensland. We investigated potential constraints on restoration of avian diversity including: (1) how changes in habitat structure as a result of grazing by feral animals and burning regimes affect bird assemblages; and (2) how the noisy miner impacts on avian assemblages in these unfragmented woodlands. Methods. Bird surveys and habitat assessments were conducted in 49 sites on three separate occasions. Fire history and intensity of grazing pressure were determined for each site with direct and indirect observations. Sampling for lerp from insects of the family Psyllidae was also undertaken during the survey periods. A Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach was used to model avian response to each of the habitat variables. Key results. The noisy miner dominated most of the study area, reducing small passerine abundance and species richness. Noisy miners were advantaged where shrub cover was low and feral grazing impacts were evident. Disturbance factors including recent wild. re and heavy grazing strongly reduced small passerine bird richness and abundance. Conclusions. Reducing the abundance of this 'reverse keystone' species requires control of feral herbivore populations and modi. cation of. re regimes to achieve a mosaic including patches with a dense shrub layer. Implications. Deleterious interactions with competitive native species, such as noisy miners, are obstacles to bird conservation not only in fragmented landscapes but also in large, continuous woodland areas. Land mangers of protected areas need to be aware of shifts in interactions among native species driven by habitat disturbance, which may ultimately affect conservation outcomes.

The average density was 85.5 breeding pairs/100 km2 and was similar during both years of the study. The vegetation structure (visibility of the territory surroundings, and height and density of the under-storey vegetation) was described for 82 pipit territories in 2004, and for 33 additional territories in 2005. The same information on habitat variables was collected in randomly selected localities. Tawny Pipits use nesting sites with very short vegetation and with a high number of areas free of vegetation or only covered with dry mosses. The available data on the Tawny Pipit's habitat in different European localities show that the species is able to occupy a much wider range of habitats. Destruction of habitats, for example, for the construction of a new motorway, influenced pipit numbers and distribution in the study area; even so, the studied population remains the densest and most stable in the geographical range of the species. Although the study area contains Tawny Pipits and other interesting species from a conservation point of view, protection of the land may be very difficult owing to changes in habitats that are being destroyed both by infrastructure investments, and also by the financial support farmers receive from the European Union, which allows them to cultivate more land and thus destroy bird habitats.

This is particularly so in Ethiopia, where coffee is an indigenous shrub and a major commodity in national and local trade. In southwestern Ethiopia, coffee (Coffea arabica, "highland coffee") is harvested from both forests (its natural habitat) and from within farmland where it is grown in small patches under isolated shade trees. We investigated the effects of management practices on bird assemblages in each of these systems. We found that bird assemblages in the forest remnants were distinct from those in the farmland even if many species were regularly found in both habitats. Coffee cultivation in open farmlands promoted bird species diversity through the retention of forest trees, while coffee cultivation in forests reduced bird diversity. Forest coffee management may, however, ensure that forest remnants are not converted to other forms of more open agriculture. Certification standards for "ecologically friendly" coffee in Ethiopia need to take this complexity into account.

Malcolm				Ecological Applications	18	8		1967-1983	December 2008	2008				English	2	34	Disturbance is a key ecological process influencing the distribution and abundance of many elements of the earth's biota. Predicting the response of biota to disturbance is therefore important, but it nevertheless remains difficult to make accurate forecasts of response. We tested predictions from disturbance-related theories and concepts in 10 vegetation types at Booderee National Park (southeastern Australia) using a retrospective study of bird responses to. re history (over 35 years) on 110 sites and a prospective study following a single wild. re event in 2003 at 59 of these sites. Our data did not support predictions from the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis; observed bird species richness at a site was significantly (F1,99 = 6.30, P = 0.014) negatively related to the number of fires since 1972 and was 8.7% lower (95% CI, 1.8 -15.1%) for each additional. re. In contrast to. re history effects, we found that after the 2003. re, the vast majority of individual species and the bird assemblage per se in most vegetation types recovered within two years. Thus, recovery after a single. re did not reflect long-term effects of multiple fires on overall bird species richness at a site. We postulated that the recovery of bird species richness and bird assemblage composition after the 2003. re would be fastest in structurally simple vegetation types and slowest in structurally complex vegetation, but observed the opposite. Although observed bird species richness in vertically heterogeneous forest and woodland had returned to prefire levels by 2006, bird species richness in structurally simple vegetation types (e. g., sedgeland) had not. Post. re vegetation regeneration, together with a paucity of early-successional specialists, would explain the speed of recovery of the bird assemblage and why it changed relatively little during our investigation.

Jones, Phil; Hanberry, Brice; Demarais, Steve				NCASI Technical Bulletin	958			i-ix, 1-49, A1-A3	December 2008	2008				English	0	6	The conservation of biological diversity is a high priority in managed forests of the southern United States. Forest certification programs require participants to have biodiversity management programs in place supported by up-to-date science and, in some cases, to have guidelines for retention of important stand-level habitat features important to wildlife. To meet this information need, we reviewed the scientific literature for information on relationships between stand-level habitat features and wildlife communities. Within this report, we give definitions and general characteristics of habitat features considered particularly important to wildlife management in southern forests. Because of the prominence of pine plantation management in the southern U.S., particular attention is paid to research performed in southern pine systems. We follow with a comprehensive examination of wildlife relationships to each habitat feature and an analysis of information gaps and research needs. We selected five habitat features for review: coarse woody debris (CWD), snags, den trees, isolated wetlands, and streamside management zones (SMZs). These features have demonstrated potential for impacting diversity, though their contributions in pine systems are not always well-documented. There were indications of other features with potential impact (e.g., fork-topped pines, roads), but there was as yet little evidence of their importance. Coarse woody debris (CWD) is used by a great number of wildlife species; however, few manipulative experiments have been performed in southern pines to determine whether this use is obligatory or facultative. While some species have shown responsiveness to CWD, benefits supplied by pine litter may substantially overlap those supplied by CWD in other forest types. Snags increase wildlife species diversity and richness by providing nesting and roosting sites for cavity-nesting species and foraging sites for insectivores. The effects of snag density are generally well-documented, at least for avian communities; however, the impact of snag distribution on communities of snag-dependent wildlife, both within stands and across the landscape, has not been adequately investigated. Den trees are mostly confined to hardwood species, and can contribute multiple habitat values such as mast and vertical structure. Den users are often highly selective, and may take into account features of the den itself, the immediate habitat, or the surrounding landscape. Den tree research in pine-dominated landscapes is almost completely lacking, and study of den trees in SMZs and retention patches could provide much-needed information regarding optimum density, juxtaposition, and distribution. Isolated wetlands, while individually managed at the stand level, involve definite landscape-scale considerations as well. Species associated with isolated wetlands may spend most of their life cycle in adjacent uplands, requiring knowledgeable management of both wetland and upland to insure their contribution to biodiversity. The impacts of silvicultural practices on communities associated with isolated wetlands are not well known, and most of the research conducted in pine systems is of limited scope. Long-term manipulative experiments, complete with pre-treatment data and adequate replication, are critical to understanding the disturbance regimes to which wildlife communities associated with isolated wetlands in different regions are best suited. Streamside management zones also involve both stand- and landscape-scale consideration. Because they contain a heterogeneous mix of habitat elements not always found in pine plantations, SMZs have the potential to greatly increase biodiversity in pine-dominated landscapes, to provide refuges for disturbance sensitive species, and to serve as population sources for recolonization of disturbed sites. Studies regarding the impact of SMZ width in pine-dominated landscapes have produced inconsistent and even conflicting results, and it seems unlikely that a single recommended width will suffice for all situations. Management of sites adjacent to SMZs may have as much or greater impact than SMZ width. We suggest research goals and methodology to address information gaps and research directions in southern pine forests. Long-term manipulative experiments are encouraged both to increase the power of researchers to test hypotheses and to account for long-term variation in wildlife populations. Wildlife responses to habitat manipulations should be measured using demographic characteristics rather than density alone. Statistical methods such as multivariate analyses should be brought to bear on questions of community ecology and response to habitat characteristics. Studies performed in natural pine and pine-hardwood forests can provide baseline material for comparisons with managed pines. There also is a need to improve knowledge of the impact of silvicultural actions, including herbicide use, on the dynamics of snags and CWD, and to develop reliable landscape-scale models to predict the results of management on stand-level habitat features.

Alexander, John D.; Stephens, Jaime L.; Seavy, Nathaniel E.				Northwest Science	82	1		7-17	Winter 2008	2008				English	1	14	We examined the degree to which bird community composition is associated with livestock grazing in the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument in southern Oregon. We sampled riparian and adjacent upland areas along routes within mixed-conifer forests and oak woodlands. For each route, we generated a continuous measure (0-100%) of livestock grazing utilization and used this measure to group routes into low (0% to 40%) and high (>40%) grazing utilization classes. In 2003 and 2004, we conducted point counts along each route to quantify avian species richness and community composition. In mixed-conifer forest, species richness was significantly greater in upland areas and in areas with high grazing utilization; however, bird community composition differed only between upland and riparian areas and not between areas of low and high grazing utilization. In oak woodlands, bird community composition was significantly different between high and low utilization, but not between riparian and upland areas. Bird communities associated with high grazing utilization had significantly fewer shrub-nesting, foliage-gleaning, and long-distance migrant species than those associated with low grazing utilization. Our results suggest that grazing influences bird community composition in both riparian and upland areas of oak woodland vegetation. Reducing grazing in oak woodlands would likely lead to increases in the relative abundance of long-distance migrants, foliage gleaners, and shrub-nesting species in this habitat.

Kanold, Anna; Rohrmann, Nils; Mueller, Joerg				Ornithologischer Anzeiger	47	2-3		116-129	Dezember 2008	2008				German	0	1	To find out more about factors which influence cavities in trees, all such holes were recorded along five transects covering 293 hectares in the Bavarian Forest National Park. Age of woodland and amount of dead wood were found to be positive parameters and density of roads/paths and altitude to be negative parameters. In the montane mixed woodland zone, analysis of management types indicated significantly higher numbers of cavities in old woods and in non-intervention trial areas compared with managed areas. At higher altitudes also, supply of cavities is better in nonintervention areas. Use of a regression tree showed that presence of 5 cavities per hectare led to approximately double the number of cavity-breeding species. The analyses substantiate not just the outstanding role of old woods in providing an abundance of cavities, but also that of the non-intervention areas. Although management in the latter stopped only a few decades ago, they are developing into natural woods, with better conditions for woodpeckers and cavity-breeders.

Vergleichende Betrachtung der Brutbestandsentwicklung von Meisen der Gattung Parus und ausgewaehlter weiterer Arten im nordoestlichen Harz (Sachsen-Anhalt) seit 1993.	George, Klaus				Vogelkundliche Berichte aus Niedersachsen	40	1-2		201-211	Dezember 2008	2008				German	0	1	At a study site in the north-eastern Harz mountains, the population densities of breeding birds were annually surveyed by means of territory mapping from 1993 to 2007. The 49.3 ha large study area under agricultural and forestry management (forested area 52.3 %) is situated at an altitude of 400 to 450 m above sea level. There are no nesting boxes within the study area. All the species of Tits Parus native to Germany occur on the study site. Although in the course of 15 years neither significantly positive nor significantly negative trends could be proved for any of the six species inhabiting woodland, fluctuations of the breeding numbers were more or less clearly noticeable. Comparisons, which included the populations of Long-tailed Tit Aegithalos caudatus, Firecrest Regulus ignicapilla, Nuthatch Sitta europea and Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, revealed various similar or even identical fluctuations. The trend curves of Blue Tit P. caeruleus and Great Tit P major are identical. The population trends of Nuthatch, Chaffinch, and probably of Long-tailed Tit (a rare species in the study area) are very similar to those of Blue Tit and Great Tit. The trend curve of the population of Marsh Tit P. palustris deviates more distinctly, and there is only partial congruence between the trends of Great Tit and Coal Tit P. ater (maxi-mums in 1993 and 2005, the latter followed by sharp declines of both species). In recent years, there have been striking similarities between the population trends of Coal Tit and Firecrest, both inhabitants of coniferous forests. Possible causes are discussed. As in different cases the similarities in trend fluctuations concern resident species (Tits and Nuthatch) as well as migratory species (Firecrest and Chaffinch), winter losses should not be considered as the only regulating factors. As to the long-lived and particularly hardy Crested Tit and Willow Tit, whose respective trend curves are similar, this cannot be considered essential anyway. Apart from two sharp declines during the survey, their population fluctuations were all in all much less pronounced. One of these declines, caused by forest management measures, is exemplified in the study.

This figure is considerably smaller than former estimates, which were not based on specific surveys.

It has been shown that the replacement of primary dark conifer-deciduous forests by secondary forests is accompanied by a significant decrease in bird population density, with some species being lost and the composition of the dominant species group being changed. On the other hand, fires lead to increasing patchiness of the environment, which can sometimes provide for an increase in biological diversity.

Lloyd, Huw; Marsden, Stuart J.				Biodiversity and Conservation	17	11		2645-2660	October 2008	2008				English	1	48	The scattered and dwindling Polylepis woodlands of the high Andean global hotspot have been identified as being of particular importance to biodiversity conservation, and yet little is known of the make-up of their faunal communities, how these vary across landscapes, and how well species might tolerate matrix/edge habitats. We examined the bird communities and vegetation characteristics of Polylepis woodlands and the surrounding matrix habitats at three sites in the Cordillera Vilcanota, southern Peru (3,400-4,500 m). The vegetation structure of woodlands varied significantly across the three sites but all were dominated by two Polylepis tree species, with mossy ground cover. Matrix habitats were treeless and dominated by ground-level puna grass-steppe or boulder scree vegetation. Bird species richness and diversity, encounter rates and the number of globally-threatened and restricted-range bird species were consistently higher in the Polylepis forests, than in matrix habitat. We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to identify habitat gradients across the landscape, and to classify bird species according to their association with Polylepis, the matrix or Polylepis-matrix interface. There were few matrix-restricted bird species, but around half the bird community, including fourteen threatened or restricted-range species, were Polylepis-dependant. Many of these species had very narrow niches. The Polylepis-matrix interface was dominated by species traditionally considered invasive ecological generalists. Our study illustrates the overriding importance of Polylepis interior habitats, indicating that conservation strategies for high Andean birds must focus on patch size maintenance/enlargement, enhancement of within-patch habitat quality, and efforts to safeguard connectivity of suitable habitat across what is essentially an inhospitable puna/scree matrix.

Anand, Mandyam Osuri; Krishnaswamy, Jagdish; Das, Arundhati				Ecological Applications	18	7		1754-1763	October 2008	2008				English	0	35	Widespread loss of primary habitat in the tropics has led to increased interest in production landscapes for biodiversity conservation. In the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India, shade coffee plantations are located in close proximity to sites of high conservation value: protected and unprotected forests. Coffee is grown here under a tree canopy that may be dominated by native tree species or by nonnative species, particularly silver oak (Grevillea robusta). We investigated the influence of properties at the local scale and the landscape scale in determining bird communities in coffee plantations, with particular emphasis on species of conservation priority. We used systematic point counts in 11 coffee plantation sites and analyzed data in a randomized linear modeling framework that addressed spatial autocorrelation. Greater proportion of silver oak at the local scale and distance to contiguous forests at the landscape scale were implicated as factors most strongly driving declines in bird species richness and abundance, while increased basal area of native tree species, a local-scale variable, was frequently related to increased bird species richness and abundance. The influence of local-scale variables increased at greater distances from the forest. Distance to forests emerged as the strongest predictor of declines in restricted-range species, with 92% reduction in the abundance of two commonly encountered restricted-range species (Pompadour Green Pigeon and Yellow-browed Bulbul) and a 43% reduction in richness of bird species restricted to Indian hill forests within 8 km of forests. Increase in proportion of silver oak from 33% to 55% was associated with 91% reduction in the abundance of one commonly encountered restricted-range species (Crimson-fronted Barbet). One conservation strategy is providing incentives to grow coffee in a biodiversity-friendly manner. One implication of our study is that plantations located at varying distances to the forest cannot be compared fairly for biodiversity friendliness by existing certification methodology. Another is that conservation of existing forests at the landscape scale is essential for maintaining higher biodiversity in coffee plantations. Incentive schemes that promote conservation of remnant forests at the landscape scale and biodiversity-friendly practices locally and that relate to coffee communities as a whole rather than individual planters are likely to be more effective.

Lloyd, Huw				Ibis	150	4		735-745	October 2008	2008				English	1	27	Habitat restoration strategies for fragmented high Andean forest landscapes must consider the influence of within-patch habitat quality on bird abundance. I examined vegetation and bird abundance at three locations within a highly fragmented Polylepis forest landscape in the Cordillera Vilcanota, southern Peru. Across the landscape, there was significant variation in the vegetation structure of Polylepis forest patches of different size categories, especially in terms of tree girth, tree height, tree density, and canopy vegetation structure. Principal Component Analysis extracted five factors of habitat quality, which together accounted for 74.2% of the variability within 15 habitat variables. Polylepis bird species differed in their responses to habitat quality but, overall, variation in Polylepis bird abundance was not fully captured by the range of habitat quality variables. Tall, dense vegetation cover was clearly important for 11 conservation-important species, a high density of large trees was important for 10 species and primary forest ground cover was important for eight species. Habitat quality exhibited no significant influence on the abundance of only one species - Asthenes urubambensis. The abundance of seven species was associated with lower elevation forest, but only one species was associated with higher elevation forest. Management of habitat quality in large and medium remnant forest patches throughout the Cordillera Vilcanota, particularly in the 3800-4200 m elevation range, will be a cornerstone in ensuring the persistence of the majority of conservation-important bird species populations.

Au, Leakhena; Andersen, David E.; Davis, Mark				Natural Areas Journal	28	4		330-341	October 2008	2008				English	0	19	There is limited understanding of the influence of tire and Vegetation Structure on bird communities in dry oak (Quercus spp.) savannas of the Upper Midwest and whether bird communities in restored savanna habitats are similar to those in remnant savannas. During the 2001 and 2002 breeding seasons, we examined the relationship between bird communities and environmental variables, including vegetation characteristics and site prescribed-burn frequencies. across a habitat gradient in dry oak savannas in central Minnesota. The habitat gradient we studied went from: (1) prairie to (2) remnant oak savanna to (3) oak woodland undergoing savanna restoration via fire or mechanical removal of woody vegetation to (4) oak woodland. We conducted fixed-radius point Counts (n = 120) within habitats with either prairie groundcover or predominately oak canopy. We described canopy and groundcover characteristics at a sub-sample (n = 28) of non-prairie points. and collected canopy and woody species richness data and prescribed-burn frequencies over the past 20 years for all points. Observed bird communities were most strongly correlated with canopy cover and burn frequency and, to a lesser extent, attributes of the shrub component. Most savanna points had bird communities that were distinct from those found at oak woodland or oak woodland points undergoing restoration via burning. Savanna points similar to oak woodland points were in areas managed by periodic cutting rather than burning. Remnant savanna bird communities were more strongly associated with prescribed burning than those in other habitat types. but it appeared that most oak woodlands that had undergone 20 year's of prescribed burning remained ecologically distinct from remnant savannas. This suggests that some savannas that have converted to oak woodlands may exist in an alternative, or,table. ecological state even following extended restoration efforts.

Roberge, Jean-Michel; Mikusinski, Grzegorz; Svensson, Soeren				Biodiversity and Conservation	17	10		2479-2494	September 2008	2008				English	3	84	In northern Europe, a long history of land use has led to profound changes within forest ecosystems. The white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) is one of several specialised forest species whose populations have declined. Conservation management directed at this species' habitat has made it a de facto umbrella species for conservation of the biodiversity associated with forests rich in deciduous trees and dead wood. We assessed empirically the value of the white-backed woodpecker as an indicator and umbrella species in central Sweden. Occurrence of the woodpecker in breeding bird atlas squares (5 x 5 km2) indicated high species richness of forest birds, particularly species of special conservation concern, which included on average 13% more species in squares with than without the woodpecker. The number of red-listed cryptogam species expected to benefit from conservation actions directed at white-backed woodpecker habitats was higher in squares where the woodpecker bred compared to where is was absent. However, no such pattern was found for red-listed beetles, a group with very few records in the studied squares. White-backed woodpecker occurrence was positively associated with the current area of deciduous and mixed forest of high conservation value. Considering its indicator value, its specialised habitat requirements and its potential as a communication tool, using the white-backed woodpecker as an umbrella species may provide a coarse filter for the conservation of several other deciduous forest species. However, focusing solely on white-backed woodpecker habitat may not provide for the conservation of all such species, which stresses the need for a suite of complementary planning approaches.

Hawes, Joseph; Barlow, Jos; Gardner, Toby A.; Peres, Carlos A.				Biological Conservation	141	9		2262-2278	September 2008	2008				English	0	40	Remnant forest strips are frequently proposed as valuable conservation tools in fragmented tropical landscapes, yet we currently lack evidence to evaluate their potential conservation value for native biota. We examined the potential value for understorey forest birds of 30-year-old riparian and terra firme (unflooded) primary forest strips within a large silvicultural landscape in the north-east Brazilian Amazon, where the matrix is dominated by Eucalyptus plantations. We conducted mist-netting in eight forest strips connected to continuous forest (four of each forest type), with a total of 24 replicate sampling sites located near to (1 km), far from (2.5-9 km), and within undisturbed forest controls (i.e. 16 samples within the strips, and 8 in controls). Bird communities in both strip types changed with increasing distance along forest remnants into the plantation matrix. Matrix-embedded samples were characterised by a higher representation of birds typical of secondary growth forest but not those typical of the Eucalyptus-dominated matrix. While the long-term viability of the bird populations in these remnants remains unclear, our data demonstrate that forest strips can provide important habitat for many bird species that are otherwise rarely found outside primary forest. Forest strips therefore provide an important tool to enhance biodiversity conservation in plantation landscapes. The relative practical ease with which these areas can be selected and maintained means that the protection of forest strips as part of a wider conservation strategy is likely to have particular appeal to policy makers and landscape managers working in the human-dominated tropics.

Goijman, Andrea P.; Zaccagnini, Maria Elena				Hornero	23	2		67-76	Sept-Dec 2008	2008				English	0	2	Birds play several roles in agricultural lands and respond to habitat heterogeneity within the agricultural landscape. Agricultural intensification in Argentina has increased the sown area, mainly with soybean, fragmenting landscapes in the pampas and mesopotamic region. In Entre Ros Province, the original Espinal forest has been fragmented, leaving remnant patches of natural vegetation, in cases modified by cattle grazing. These changes represent a potential threat for avian conservation. In Entre Rios, terraces may be a useful habitat in maintaining avian diversity, similar to other non-cropped linear habitats in agricultural landscapes. We tested the hypothesis that habitat heterogeneity created by terraces would maintain higher species richness and densities of avian species that use original or modified forests within cropped areas compared to fields without terraces. The study was carried out in soybean fields with an adjacent forest and either herbaceous, shrub or no terraces in two periods (March-April 2004). Birds were surveyed using line transects in field interior and edge, and observations were carried out in one forest remnant adjoining each field. Most bird species recorded in soybean fields were insectivorous or consume invertebrates during the breeding season. Species richness, total bird density and the density of granivores, insectivores and omnivores were higher in fields with terraces than in fields without terraces. Moreover, shrub terraces had higher effect on species richness and bird density than herbaceous terraces. Our results suggest that terraces may serve as a possible tool for maintaining avian diversity in agroecosystems in Entre Rios.

Churchwell, Roy T.; Davis, Craig A.; Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.; Engle, David M.				Journal of Wildlife Management	72	7		1596-1604	September 2008	2008				English	1	24	Grassland birds have declined more than any other North American habitat-associated bird community. Because most species of grassland birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines, especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an alternative grassland management practice known as patch-burning has been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296 dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures. Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides further evidence that this practice can he a useful tool for grassland bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation, patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g., trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects of grazing, which are not available under traditional management. Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains.

Cooke, Hilary A.; Zack, Steve				Western North American Naturalist	68	3		365-373	September 2008	2008				English	2	57	Through dam-building activity, beavers (Castor canadensis) play an important role in creating pond and wetland habitat for bird communities. Their impact may be intensified in semiarid landscapes and may increase with increasing dam density on it stream. Out objective was to examine relationships between dam density, riparian area characteristics, and the riparian bird community in it semiarid landscape. In 2002 and 2003 we surveyed riparian birds, riparian area characteristics, and the number of dams along 1.2-km sections of 11 streams in sagebrush steppe regions of Wyoming. We categorized the riparian bird community into 2 assemblages based on their affiliation with terrestrial or aquatic riparian habitats. Average width of the woody riparian zone, average riparian shrub height, and percent cover of emergent vegetation all had significant positive relationships with dam density, but percent cover of ponded water did not. Species richness an() abundance of all riparian birds, and of the terrestrial assemblage, increased significantly with increasing woody riparian zone width. In contrast, richness and abundance of the aquatic assemblage were significantly positively influenced by cover of emergent vegetation and ponded water. When we accounted for riparian area characteristics, we found that total species richness, total abundance, and aquatic assemblage abundance were each positively correlated with dam density, suggesting that dam density is related to other riparian characteristics selected by birds. Our results suggest increasing dam-building activity may be important in creating favorable riparian conditions for it rich and abundant bird community in semiarid regions.

Arthur, Anthony D.; Pech, Roger P.; Davey, Chris; Jiebu; Zhang, Yanming; Lin, Hui				Biological Conservation	141	8		1972-1981	August 2008	2008				English	4	62	On the Qinghai[long dash]Tibet plateau increased livestock numbers have resulted in degradation of the grasslands with potential impacts on native biodiversity. Concurrently, perceived increases in populations of native small mammals such as plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) have led to poisoning programs, with uncertain impacts on species such as ground-nesting birds. We explored the relationships between the local seasonal abundance of small birds and (1) the density of pika burrows; (2) livestock grazing practices; and (3) local poisoning of pikas. Around Naqu prefecture, central Tibet, we used a nested experimental design to collect data from areas rested from grazing over summer, nearby areas with year-round grazing and areas subjected to pika poisoning. Additional data were collected from a site where grazing had not occurred for at least 4 years prior to the study. Poisoning pikas in spring had no detectable effect on the local abundance of birds the following autumn. However, two ground-nesting species, white-rumped and rufous-necked snowfinches, showed positive associations with the density of pika burrows, indicating that long-term pika poisoning could reduce the density of these species by reducing the density of pika burrows. Rufous-necked snowfinches and non ground-nesting species including horned larks and common hoopoes showed positive responses to reduced grazing pressure from livestock, particularly in the long-rested site, indicating current grazing levels could be having a negative impact on these species. Conservation of small passerine biodiversity in this system will require changed management practices for livestock and pikas that consider the complex three-way interaction between livestock grazing, pikas and small birds.

Koh, Lian Pin				Journal of Applied Ecology	45	4		1002-1009	August 2008	2008				English	5	92	1. Rising global demand for palm oil is likely to exacerbate deforestation rates in oil palm-producing countries. This will lead to a net reduction in biodiversity unless measures can be taken to improve the value of oil palm plantations.2. Here, I investigate whether the biodiversity of oil palm plantations can be increased by determining how forest-dwelling butterflies and birds in these plantations are affected by vegetation characteristics at the local level (e.g. epiphyte prevalence) and by natural forest cover at the landscape level (e.g. old-growth forests surrounding oil palm estates).3. Across transects, vegetation variables explained 0-1.2% of the variation in butterfly species richness and 0-7% of that in bird species richness. The most important predictors of species richness across transects were percentage ground cover of weeds for butterflies; and epiphyte prevalence and presence of leguminous crops for birds. Across estates, natural forest cover explained 1.2-12.9% of the variation in butterfly species richness and 0.6-53.3% of variation in bird species richness. The most important predictors of species richness across estates were percentage cover of old-growth forests surrounding an estate for butterflies; and percentage cover of young secondary forests surrounding an estate for birds.4. Synthesis and applications. In order to maximize biodiversity in oil palm plantations, oil palm companies and local governments should work together to preserve as much of the remaining natural forests as possible by, for example, creating forested buffer zones around oil palm estates or protecting remnant forest patches in the landscape.

Sladek, Brandon; Burger, L.; Munn, Ian				Southern Journal of Applied Forestry	32	3		111-119	August 2008	2008				English	1	7	Former agricultural lands converted to pine (Pinus spp.) plantations in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) have potential to provide early successional (ES) habitat for many regionally declining pine/grassland and shrub-successional bird species if actively managed with appropriate disturbance regimes. One such regime is use of the selective herbicide Imazapyr (Arsenal Applicators Concentrate) and prescribed burning, which is permitted on CRP lands and cost share payments are available. This study quantified combined effects of Imazapyr and prescribed fire on the breeding season avian community characteristics and pine volume growth in thinned, midrotation afforested loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations in Mississippi. Herbicide treatments were applied in fall of 2002 and winter burns were conducted during winter and early spring of 2002-2003. ES bird species richness was significantly greater in the treated plots compared with controls for both 2003 and 2004. Ten individual species exhibited treatment effects. These responses by ES bird species indicate that midrotation UP plantations can provide needed ES habitat if treated with appropriate disturbance regimes.

Caula, Sabina; Marty, Pascal; Martin, Jean-Louis				Landscape and Urban Planning	87	1		1-9	July 3 2008	2008				English	1	33	We studied the richness and composition of diurnal birds in relation to the percentage of built surfaces in an urban area of Mediterranean France and analyzed their seasonal variation. We recorded 61 species and identified three species groups: those characteristic of areas with the highest proportion of buildings, those associated with a mixture of buildings and gardens, and those typical from the green spaces embedded in the urban matrix. Although species richness was lowest in the downtown area, where building density was highest, in the suburbs there was no relation between building density and species richness and overall species richness did not differ from the values observed in the woodlands and croplands imbedded in the urban matrix. Overall spatial species distribution was narrower in spring and broader in winter, suggesting that many bird species have a broader use of the urban landscape in winter. We observed the highest species turnover between spring and winter in the croplands and woodlands found within the urban matrix. In winter, the amount of bird life increased in the suburbs and decreased in croplands and woodlands, which suggests that residential areas provide winter habitats for more species. Our results suggest that a complex urban landscape can host a diverse bird community, including species of conservation value. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We have limited knowledge about the effects of human activities on native species in these landscapes and which, if any, management practices might enhance the conservation of native biodiversity within them. Through a citizen volunteer bird-monitoring project, we compared bird abundance and species richness in northern Californian riparian zones surrounded by vineyards, urban areas, and natural areas. We assessed both local and landscape-level variables that may enhance native bird diversity in each land use type. We also demonstrate a new statistical approach, generalized estimating equations, to analyze highly variable data, such as that collected by volunteers. Avian abundance was highly correlated with both landscape context and local habitat variables, while avian richness was correlated with local habitat variables, specifically shrub richness, and percent of tree cover. In particular, shrub species richness has a strong positive correlation with riparian-preferring bird species. This suggests that active local management of riparian zones in human-dominated landscapes can increase our ability to retain native bird species in these areas.

Giralt, David; Brotons, Lluis; Valera, Francisco; Kristin, Anton				Biodiversity and Conservation	17	8		1997-2012	July 2008	2008				English	0	26	Birds of agricultural systems are one of the most threatened groups of birds in Europe mainly due to their sharp population decline in recent decades. Habitat intensification resulting from more productive agricultural practices has been proposed as a major cause for these declines. However, especially in some regions such as Eastern European and Mediterranean countries, little is known about the ultimate factors linked to habitat intensification that drive population declines for different species. The Lesser Grey Shrike is a good study species for a better understanding of such processes since it is closely related to agricultural habitats in Europe and has suffered a strong decline in range and population size across the western half of the continent. In this study, we explored variations in breeding parameters of this shrike related to habitat composition and food supply at the territory level. We found that fledgling success of early breeders was related to the presence of natural (shrub lands) and semi-natural (fallows) habitats in the predominantly agricultural matrix that dominated breeding territories. Their influence on fledgling success appeared to be mediated by a higher arthropod availability on these habitats. Indeed, Lesser Grey Shrike showed a strong preference for these habitats as hunting locations. Our results highlight the importance of natural habitats in intensified agricultural land mosaics for the conservation of bird species. We suggest that management plans should pay special attention to the availability of habitats which serve as high quality food reservoirs and can potentially contribute to enhance the species population viability in an area. Finally, we discuss the possible link between agricultural intensification and Lesser Grey Shrike population declines in Western Europe.

Verschuyl, Jacob P.; Hansen, Andrew J.; McWethy, David B.; Sallabanks, Rex; Hutto, Richard L.				Ecological Applications	18	5		1155-1170	July 2008	2008				English	1	28	Currently, the most common strategy when managing forests for biodiversity at the landscape scale is to maintain structural complexity within stands and provide a variety of seral stages across landscapes. Advances in ecological theory reveal that biodiversity at continental scales is strongly in. uenced by available energy (i. e., climate factors relating to heat and light and primary productivity). This paper explores how available energy and forest structural complexity may interact to drive biodiversity at a regional scale. We hypothesized that bird species richness exhibits a hump- shaped relationship with energy at the regional scale of the northwestern United States. As a result, we hypothesized that the relationship between energy and richness within a landscape is positive in energylimited landscapes and. at or decreasing in energy-rich landscapes. Additionally, we hypothesized that structural complexity explains less of the variation in species richness in energy- limited environments and more in energy-rich environments and that the slope of the relationship between structural complexity and richness is greatest in energy- rich environments. We sampled bird communities and vegetation across seral stages and biophysical settings at each of. ve landscapes arrayed across a productivity gradient from the Paci. c Coast to the Rocky Mountains within the. ve northwestern states of the contiguous United States. We analyzed the response of richness to structural complexity and energy covariates at each landscape. We found that ( 1) richness had a hump- shaped relationship with available energy across the northwestern United States, ( 2) the landscape- scale relationships between energy and richness were positive or hump shaped in energy- limited locations and were. at or negative in energy- rich locations, ( 3) forest structural complexity explained more of the variation in bird species richness in energy- rich landscapes, and ( 4) the slope of the relationship between forest structural complexity and richness was steepest in energy- limited locations. In energy- rich locations, forest managers will likely increase landscape- scale bird diversity by providing a range of forest structural complexity across all seral stages. In lowenergy environments, bird diversity will likely be maximized by managing local high- energy hotspots judiciously and adjusting harvest intensities in other locations to compensate for slower regeneration rates.

Journal of Wildlife Management	72	5		1168-1174	July 2008	2008				English	0	17	We assessed responses of the breeding bird community to mechanical thinning and prescribed surface fire, alone and in combination, between 2000 and 2006 in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in northern Arizona, USA. Fuel-reduction treatments did not affect species richness or evenness, and effects on density of 5 commonly detected species varied among species. Populations of some species, such as the western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), increased following burning treatments, whereas others, such as the mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli), decreased in response to thinning treatments. Our results also identified a temporal response component, where avian community composition and structure changed synchronously on all treatments over time. Given the modest effects these small-scale fuel-reduction treatments had on avian composition and the specific density responses of particular species, our results suggest that land managers should consider implementing prescribed surface fire after thinning projects, where appropriate.

Smith, Timothy A.; Osmond, Deanna L.; Moorman, Christopher E.; Stucky, Jon M.; Wendell Gilliam, J.				Southeastern Naturalist	7	2		277-288	June 30 2008	2008				English	0	17	Riparian buffers can be valuable refuge areas for wildlife in otherwise homogeneous agricultural landscapes. Government sponsored programs like the Cropland Reserve Program generally require the planting of specific vegetative species during buffer restoration, although the effectiveness of such an approach when compared to restoration by volunteer species is unknown. We studied the effect of differences in vegetation structure on avian habitat in riparian buffer zones. A 25 m (82 ft) wide planted woodland buffer, 30 m (98 ft) wide grass, shrub, and woodland three-zone buffer, and a 9 m (30 ft) wide shrub buffer were evaluated for habitat potential using breeding-bird counts and vegetation surveys. Bird density and species richness varied with the structure of the vegetative communities present at the three sites. Avian species richness and total detections were higher in the three-zone buffer than in both the shrub and planted buffer, likely a result of the diversity of vegetation at the site. These data suggest that restoration of riparian areas by allowing fallow vegetation to recolonize is at the very least equally beneficial to avian wildlife as is restoration by planting specific grass, shrub, and tree species. Buffer restoration by natural revegetation using this method could be recommended as an alternative to implementation by planting riparian species due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness.

Bird Conservation International	18	2		129-143	June 2008	2008				English	0	16	We studied bird community composition and abundance within four vegetation and disturbance categories located within selectively logged and unlogged forest in a Bolivian subtropical lowland forestry concession. The logged forest was subject to reduced-impact logging between 1 and 4 years prior to our study. The four categories were: 1) 'gap' points possessing natural or anthropogenic tree-fall gaps,' 2) 'target' points with one of five commercial tree species of harvestable size; 3) 'future' points possessing a commercial tree below harvestable size; and 4) 'non-target' points not possessing harvestable tree species. The bird community composition of logging gaps significantly differed from that found within natural tree-fall gaps in the unlogged forest (P 0.05). Species richness was higher in natural tree-fall gaps than in anthropogenic gaps. Furthermore, a higher proportion of disturbance sensitive species were associated with natural-tree fall gaps, whereas a higher proportion of disturbance tolerant species were associated with anthropogenic gaps. No significant difference was detected in the bird community composition for the other three vegetation categories surveyed. We discuss the conservation and silvicultural repercussions of these results.

Lloyd, Huw				Bird Conservation International	18	2		164-180	June 2008	2008				English	1	14	Point count distance sampling surveys were conducted at three sites in the Cordillera Vilcanota to determine whether variation in high-Andean species richness, diversity and abundance was a reflection of Polylepis habitat quantity. Bird community and abundance measures revealed that there was considerably variation in bird species richness, diversity and mean encounter rates between large, medium, and small forest patches. Densities of Polylepis-dependent bird species (including five globally-threatened and eight restricted-range species) were greater in larger forest patches and differed significantly between different patch size categories. Density estimates for matrix-dependent species were higher in smaller Polylepis patches indicating that the matrix exerts an influence on bird species composition and abundance in remnant Polylepis forests, particularly smaller patches. Comparison of lowland forest habitat specialists using three categories of rarity revealed that between 19-22% of all Polylepis-dependent species were intrinsically rare within larger forest patches, and a greater number (34-74%) were rare in smaller forest patches. Population estimates for all species, in particular for all threatened species, were extremely low, numbering = 10 individuals at nine of the ten sites examined. The results suggest that declines in the densities of certain Polylepis birds may be predictable following habitat loss and that these patterns of rarity should govern population recovery goals through appropriate habitat restoration strategies. Such strategies are urgently required and must be designed to prevent further habitat loss, and to increase Polylepis habitat quantity to boost threatened bird populations in the Cordillera Vilcanota.

Battisti, C.; Ukmar, E.; Luiselli, L.; Bologna, M.A.				Community Ecology	9	1		107-113	June 2008	2008				English	2	12	Breeding bird communities were studied by line-transect in burnt pinewood and unburnt pinewoods, during three years subsequently to a fire event, in a coastal woodland of Mediterranean central Italy. We analyzed data following a diversity/dominance approach that ranks the species in order of their abundance, to obtain rank/abundance diagrams ('Whittaker plots'). Although it is generally accepted that fire may induce structural changes in forest communities of breeding birds, we observed more evident effects when considering the assemblage of forest-specialist species. When considering the whole community of birds, ordinate intercepts of the regression between rank and relative abundance of species were not significantly different between unburnt and burnt plots in any of the three years of study. However, when considering only the forest-related species, there was a significant difference between unburnt and burnt plots in all the years of study. Evenness showed lower values that were explicited by the diversity/dominance diagrams (lower collocation of the curves of burnt pinewoods if compared to unburnt ones). Overall, the patterns observed in this study suggest that the effects of fire disturbance were more evident at the ecological level than at the taxonomic-level assemblages. The gradual decline of the more sensitive species due to fires and the proportional increase of edge/generalist species may induce a species turnover in burnt woods with cascade and relaxation effects which could be evidenced by diversity/dominance diagrams. Consequently, it is useful to separate the effects of fires at community-level and at assemblage-level when studying bird communities in areas subjected to fires.

Raposa, Kenneth B.				Journal of Coastal Research			Special Issue 55	180-192	Summer 2008	2008				English	1	33	Tidal exchange was restored to the flow-restricted, 2.3-ha Potter Pond salt marsh on Prudence Island in the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in April 2003. Ecological monitoring was conducted for 1 year before and 2 years after restoration to quantify ecological changes. Simultaneous monitoring was conducted in a nearby marsh that served as an experimental control. Tidal restoration increased the tide range in Potter Pond from approximately 4 cm in 2000 to 120 cm in 2003. After 2 years of restoration, the height of Spartina alterniflora remained unchanged, and the same was true of the composition of the emergent marsh vegetation community. However, by 2004, the percent cover of live Phragmites australis decreased by 69%, and the average height of Phragmites decreased by 76 cm. Seven additional bird species were observed at Potter Pond after 1 year of restoration, and the number of birds observed increased from 6 to 85 per viewing effort, mostly due to large numbers of shorebirds using the newly exposed mud flats. Nekton density decreased from 100 m-2 to 38 m-2 after 1 year, probably because of the change from subtidal to mostly intertidal conditions and increased predation by birds. Initial results from monitoring demonstrate that restoration of the Potter Pond marsh complex improved tidal exchange, negatively impacted Phragmites, and increased bird use, resulting in an overall shift to a more natural functioning salt marsh system. This study also demonstrates that restoring even very small tide-restricted marshes can result in impressive ecological improvements.

Golet, Gregory H.; Gardali, Thomas; Howell, Christine A.; Hunt, John; Luster, Ryan A.; Rainey, William; Roberts, Michael D.; Silveira, Joseph; Swagerty, Helen; Williams, Neal				San Francisco Estuary & Watershed Science	6	2		1-26	June 2008	2008	http://repositories.cdlib.org/jmie/sfews/			English	0	3	Studies that assess the success of riparian restoration projects seldom focus on wildlife. More generally, vegetation characteristics are studied, with the assumption that animal populations will recover once adequate habitats are established. On the Sacramento River, millions of dollars have been spent on habitat restoration, yet few studies of wildlife response have been published. Here we present the major findings of a suite of studies that assessed responses of four taxonomic groups (insects, birds, bats, and rodents). Study designs fell primarily into two broad categories: comparisons of restoration sites of different ages, and comparisons of restoration sites with agricultural and remnant riparian sites. Older restoration sites showed increased abundances of many species of landbirds and bats relative to younger sites, and the same trend was observed for the Valley elderberry longhorn beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus), a federally threatened species. Species richness of landbirds and ground-dwelling beetles appeared to increase as restoration sites matured. Young restoration sites provided benefits to species that utilize early successional riparian habitats, and after about 10 years, the sites appeared to provide many of the complex structural habitat elements that are characteristic of remnant forest patches. Eleven-year old sites were occupied by both cavity-nesting birds and special-status crevice-roosting bats. Restored sites also supported a wide diversity of bee species, and had richness similar to remnant sites. Remnant sites had species compositions of beetles and rodents more similar to older sites than to younger sites. Because study durations were short for all but landbirds, results should be viewed as preliminary. Nonetheless, in aggregate, they provide convincing evidence that restoration along the Sacramento River has been successful in restoring riparian habitats for a broad suite of faunal species. Not only did the restoration projects provide benefits for special-status species, but they also appeared effective in restoring the larger native riparian community. Increases in bird abundance through time were observed both at restoration sites and in remnant habitats, suggesting that restoration efforts may be having positive spill-over effects, although observed increases may have been caused by other factors. Although positive overall, these studies yielded some disconcerting results. The Lazuli Bunting (Passerina amoena) declined at restoration sites and remnant habitats alike, and certain exotic invasive species, such as black rats, appeared to increase as restoration sites matured.

Register, Sarah M.; Islam, Kamal				Forest Ecology and Management	255	8-9		3502-3505	15 May 2008	2008				English	1	11	The Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea), a once common summer inhabitant and breeder in southern Indiana, has declined at both the local and continental population levels. Because Cerulean Warblers tend to nest in large deciduous trees, they are especially at risk due to deforestation of mature tree stands. Few studies have examined the effects of specific silvicultural practices (i.e., group and single tree selection harvesting methods) on the distribution and abundance of the Cerulean Warbler. During the summers of 2005 and 2006, Cerulean Warblers were surveyed within the Morgan-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests, as well as the Hoosier National Forest in southern Indiana. Three treatment types were surveyed; unharvested reference sites (stands 35[long dash]100+ years old) were compared with single tree selection treatments and treatments where a combination of group and single tree selection was used (stands 2[long dash]30 years old). Mean bird abundance was estimated from bird surveys to determine if trends exists between silvicultural regimes and Cerulean Warbler abundance. Cerulean Warblers were located in all treatment types, with no significant differences (p = 0.654) in abundance among treatment types examined (unharvested [long dash] 0.36, single tree [long dash] 0.46, group and single tree combination [long dash] 0.36). These results suggest that uneven-age management practices, such as single tree and group selection harvesting, provide suitable breeding habitat for Cerulean Warblers.

One reason for limited effectiveness of AESs may be their application to small and scattered patches of land. This study presents the evaluation of a scheme adopted by the canton of Aargau, Switzerland, which seems to be unique in its consequent focus on entire farms, aiming at increasing quality and quantity of ecological compensated areas (ECAs). In vascular plants and snails, the species richness increased during a period of 5 years on plots with AES, but not on control plots without AES. In butterflies and birds, no significant differences were found between AES plots and control plots in the change of species richness over time. While butterfly species numbers generally decreased, bird species numbers increased on both AES plots and control plots. It appears that agri-environment schemes can be effective in protecting and promoting biodiversity, but the effect may depend on the group of organisms.

Haslem, Angie; Bennett, Andrew F.				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	125	1-4		191-203	May 2008	2008				English	2	33	Throughout the world, many native species inhabit agricultural landscapes. While natural habitats will form the cornerstone of conservation efforts in production-oriented environments, the success of these efforts will be enhanced by a greater understanding of the potential contribution of the increasingly modified countryside ('matrix') elements in these landscapes. Here, we investigate the relative occurrence of birds in some landscape elements (i.e. land-uses, vegetation types) common to agricultural environments around the world. Twenty-seven study mosaics (1 km x 1 km in size), selected to incorporate variation in the cover of native vegetation and the richness of different landscape elements, were sampled in Gippsland, south-eastern Australia. Birds were surveyed in five main types of elements: native vegetation, linear vegetation, plantation, scattered trees and pasture. The greatest number of species was recorded in native vegetation, the most important element for the majority of birds in Australian agricultural landscapes. Nevertheless, most countryside elements had value for many species; particularly structurally complex elements. Ordination analyses (based on presence/absence data for 81 species) showed that the composition of bird communities differed between elements. The number of mosaics in which 'all species' and 'woodland species' were recorded was positively related to the breadth of elements they used; thus species using a greater number of elements occurred more frequently in the study region. Correlation analyses identified that the richness of woodland species (those of increased conservation concern in Australia) in different elements was influenced by features of the mosaic in which they occurred. Notably, the richness of woodland bird species recorded in scattered trees and pasture increased with local native vegetation cover. Key implications for conservation in Australian agricultural environments include: (1) native vegetation is vital for the persistence of birds in these landscapes, and thus is the primary element on which conservation efforts in agricultural landscapes depend; (2) countryside elements can enhance the conservation value of agricultural landscapes by (a) increasing structural complexity in largely cleared areas and (b) increasing the heterogeneity of the entire landscape; and (3) patches of different elements cannot be managed in isolation from their surroundings, as landscape properties affect the richness of bird assemblages in different elements.

Lantschner, Maria Victoria; Rusch, Veronica; Peyrou, Celina				Biodiversity and Conservation	17	5		969-989	May 2008	2008				English	0	28	Forest plantations of exotic conifers represent an important economic activity in NW Patagonia, Argentina. However, there is a remarkable lack of information on the impact of forestry on native biodiversity. We analyzed the effect of Pinus ponderosa plantations on bird communities, considering different stand management practices (dense and sparse tree covers), and different landscape contexts where they are planted (Austrocedrus chilensis forest and steppe). Ultimately we wished to assess in which way plantations may be designed and managed to improve biodiversity conservation. Bird richness and abundance did not change significantly in the steppe, although community composition did, and was partially replaced by a new community, similar to that of ecotonal forests. In contrast, in the A. chilensis forest areas, species richness decreased in dense plantations, but bird community composition remained relatively constant when replacing the native forest with pine plantations. Also, in A. chilensis forest, stand management practices aiming at maintaining low tree densities permit the presence of many bird species from the original habitat. In the steppe area in turn, both dense and sparse plantations are unsuitable for most steppe species, thus it is necessary to manage them at higher scales, maintaining the connectivity of the native matrix to prevent the fragmentation of bird populations. We conclude that pine plantations can provide habitat for a substantial number of native bird species, and this feature varies both with management practices and with the landscape context of areas where afforestation occurs.

Biological Conservation	141	5		1196-1203	May 2008	2008				English	5	74	This study examined the importance of natural and manmade structural features on the avian community relative to management-induced vegetation dynamics. The study was conducted within the context of two alternative vegetation management treatments applied to pastures on a tallgrass prairie site in northcentral Oklahoma from 2001 to 2003. The brown-headed cowbird, a brood parasite, and the grasshopper sparrow, a common grassland obligate species, were most abundant in areas managed under a traditional treatment in which entire pastures were annually burned. Conversely, Henslow's sparrow, a grassland obligate of conservation concern, was completely absent from traditional treatment pastures. Total bird species diversity and grassland obligate richness was highest in the patch-burn treatment, in which only discrete portions of each pasture were burned each year to create a mosaic of vegetation 'patches' in various stages of recovery from disturbance. Models of bird abundance reflected not only species-specific vegetation preferences, but also the often negative influence of structural features such as woody edges, roads, and ponds on breeding bird use of grasslands.

George, T. Luke; Zack, Steve				Canadian Journal of Forest Research	38	5		936-942	May 2008	2008				English	0	15	We compared the effects of two contrasting silvicultural treatments and prescribed fire on bird occupancy at Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest. Each silvicultural treatment was applied to two approximately 100 ha units within each of three blocks. Prescribed burning was applied to one-half of each silvicultural treatment in a split-plot design. Occupancy was estimated at eight points in each plot for 11 bird species and three foraging guilds (bark gleaners, woodpeckers, and foliage gleaners). The frequencies of species detections on the point counts were used to estimate species richness on each plot. Occupancy did not differ among treatments for any of the guilds. Four of the 11 bird species, the American robin (Turdus migratorius L., 1766), the chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina (Bechstein, 1798)), the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis Latham, 1790), and the western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana (A. Wilson, 1811)), showed responses to the treatments. Species richness did not differ between the silvicultural or the burn treatments. The general lack of response of the bird community to the silvicultural and burn treatments is likely a result of the relatively large size of the trees and snags retained on both silvicultural treatments, the low intensity of the prescribed burns, and the lack of a strong contrast in tree density between the silvicultural treatments.

Brand, L. Arriana; White, Gary C.; Noon, Barry R.				Condor	110	2		199-210	May 2008	2008				English	0	50	The San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona is one of the last free-flowing rivers in the southwestern United States that maintains significant stretches of perennial water. While critical for birds, this river is vulnerable to salt cedar (tamarisk, Tamarix spp.) invasion, woody encroachment into grassland, and alteration of hydrologic regime resulting from groundwater pumping. Bird species richness and community composition metrics provide a means to assess effects of management or conservation efforts. To estimate these metrics, we used methods that incorporated species detection probabilities from data collected at 160 points at 23 sites on the San Pedro River during 1998-2001. Species richness, co-occurrence, and uniqueness were estimated as a function of four riparian vegetation types (cottonwood-willow (Populus-Salix), salt cedar, mesquite (Prosopis spp), and grassland), three hydrologic regimes (perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral), and riparian location (floodplain and terrace). We found significantly higher species richness in cottonwood and mesquite compared with salt cedar and grassland. Intermittent and perennial flow sites had higher species richness compared with ephemeral. Cottonwood and mesquite supported more unique species compared with grassland and salt cedar, and cottonwood or perennial sites supported canopy or water-dependent species, for which habitat is rare on the landscape. Within the intermittent class, salt cedar maintained all estimated 0-2 unique species compared with native woody vegetation types, while cottonwood and mesquite contributed all estimated 20-21 unique species compared with salt cedar. Thus, while maintaining relatively high species richness, salt cedar contributed little to regional avian diversity compared with native woody riparian vegetation. This research has important implications for regional conservation planning and riparian restoration efforts.	Brand, L.

Jentsch, Stephanie; Mannan, R. William; Dickson, Brett G.; Block, William M.				Journal of Wildlife Management	72	4		994-1000	May 2008	2008				English	2	7	Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests with Cambel oak Quercus gambelii) are associated with higher bird abundance and diversity than are ponderosa pine forests lacking Gambel oak. Little is known, however, about specific structural characteristics of Gambel oak trees, clumps, and stands that may be important to birds in ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (hereafter pine-oak) forests. We examined associations among breeding birds and structural characteristics of Gambel oak at a scale similar in size to individual bird territories in pine-oak forests in northern Arizona and western New Mexico, USA. Avian species richness and occurrence of some bird species were associated with specific growth forms of Gambel oak. Estimated probability of Virginia's warblers (Vermivora virginiae), black-headed grosbeaks (Pheucticus melanocephalus), and red-faced warblers (Cardellina rubrifrons) occurring at points increased with increasing density of pole-sized Gambel oak 715 cm in diameter at breast height. We also found evidence that large Gambel oak trees (>=23 cm dbh) were associated with increased occurrence of yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata) at points. Some avian associations with oak were influenced by characteristics of ponderosa pines. For example, bird species richness was positively associated with the abundance of large Gambel oak when density of large pine trees >=23 cm in diameter at breast height was low. Because large oak trees are rare and their numbers are thought to be declining, efforts should be made to retain and promote growth of additional oaks in this size class. Forest management practices that maintain forest openings, such as prescribed burning, could promote growth of pole-sized Gambel oak, which appears important to some bird species in pine-oak forests.

Thyen, Stefan; Exo, Klaus-Michael; Cervencl, Anja; Esser, Wiebke; Oberdiek, Nadine				Vogelwarte	46	2		121-130	May 2008	2008				German	0	1	In contrast to most other European breeding sites, the breeding population of the Redshank Tringa totanus in the European Wadden Sea is stable in most areas of the ecosystem. As suggested by recent studies on hatching success, however, Redshank reproduction is spatially variable and cannot reliably explain the population trend mentioned above. From 2004 to 2006, a telemetry study on Redshank chicks was conducted in Petersgroden (mainland) and on the island of Wangerooge to record annual breeding success and its spatial variability and to derive predictions on future population trends. Due to lower predation, birds on Wangerooge achieved considerably higher hatching success than birds at the mainland (2005/06: 64 and 93 of clutches vs. 4 to 15 %, 2004-2005). Apart from total losses due to weather conditions in 2004 at the mainland, chick mortality was relatively constant between regions and years (70-80 %). Derived from chick mortality, breeding success was 0.51 (2005) and 1.0 (2006) chicks per pair on Wangerooge and constantly 0.15 chicks per pair at the mainland. Considering published estimates of annual subadult (35 %) and adult (25 %) mortality, breeding success achieved during this study should not be sufficient to maintain the regional population of the mainland study site. In contrast, the Wangerooge population produced more chicks than needed to sustain its local population. The assumption of spatially varying reproduction of Redshanks breeding in the Wadden Sea could be confirmed by this study. However, it still has to be clarified whether Redshank population dynamics is explained by this varying breeding success. Due to a lack of knowledge in annual survival rates, the necessity of initiating an integrated population monitoring project is discussed. As additionally revealed by chick telemetry, non-fledged chicks were found up to only about 200 m from its former nest site and used about 0.4 ha of the respective saltmarsh habitat. Small home range sizes of Redshank broods within the saltmarsh suggest a potential vulnerability to agricultural habitat management, especially to mowing. Derived from these results, it is unlikely that agriculture is an appropriate way of managing saltmarsh for breeding birds.

Ding, Tzung-Su; Liao, Huan-Chang; Yuan, Hsiao-Wen				Forest Ecology and Management	255	7		2038-2048	April 20 2008	2008				English	1	20	To examine the relationship between forest succession following fire and the composition of bird communities, we investigated the vegetation structure, bird population density, foraging behavior and guild structure in bamboo grasslands (11 years since the last fire), pine savanna (41 years), pine woodland (58 years), old-growth hemlock forest (never burned), and old-growth spruce forest (never burned) in the Tatachia area of central Taiwan. Canopy height, total foliage cover, tree density, total basal area of tree, total basal area of snags, foliage height diversity, and tree species richness all increased with successional age. However, shrub cover peaked in intermediate successional stages. The vertical profile of foliage cover was more diverse in later successional forests, which had more breeding bird species and ecological guilds. All the breeding bird species recorded in early and intermediate stages were also found distributed in the late successional forests. Because Taiwan has high precipitation and humidity, and most forest fires in Taiwan are caused by human activities, forest fires and large areas of early successional vegetation were probably rare in the mountain areas of Taiwan prior to the arrival of humans. Therefore, bird species have not had enough time to adapt to areas with early or intermediate successional vegetation. Moreover, late successional forests host all the major plant species found in the early and intermediate stages and have higher foliage height diversity index, which was positively correlated with the bird species richness and bird species diversity index in this study. As a result, all breeding bird species and guilds in the area can be found in late successional forests. Efforts for conserving avian diversity in Taiwan should focus on protecting the remaining native old-growth forests.

Vaillancourt, Marie-Andree; Drapeau, Pierre; Gauthier, Sylvie; Robert, Michel				Forest Ecology and Management	255	7		2272-2285	April 20 2008	2008				English	0	21	Large cavity-nesting birds depend on large-diameter trees for suitable nest sites. The increased spatial extent of commercial timber harvesting is modifying forest structure across the land base and may thus compromise the availability of large trees at the landscape scale. In this study, our objectives were to (1) characterize the availability of large living and dead trees in old-growth stands dominated by different tree species and surficial deposits that encompass the range of natural cover types of eastern Quebec's boreal forest; (2) analyze the distribution of trees among decay-classes; and (3) compare the availability of large trees in unharvested, remnant, and harvested stands for the entire range of decay-classes. A total of 116 line transects were distributed across unharvested forests, remnant linear forests, and cutblocks in cutover areas. Unharvested forest stands (black spruce (Picea mariana), balsam fir (Abies balsamea)-black spruce, balsam fir-white spruce (Picea glauca) and balsam fir) reflected a gradient of balsam fir dominance. The remnant forests selected were isolated for 5-15 years. Analyses were performed at two diameter cut-off values. Trees with DBH =20 cm were considered for availability of total trees whereas trees with DBH =30 cm were considered for availability of large trees. Forest stands comprised high proportions of standing dead trees (33% of all stems, 8% were large dead stems). Availability of total and large standing trees increased with the dominance of balsam fir in stands. Forest stands located on thick surficial deposits showed higher densities of large dead trees for every stand type suggesting a higher productivity on those sites. Availability of stems according to decay-classes showed a dome-shaped distribution with higher densities of snags in intermediate decay stages. However, for large stems, black spruce stands showed a significantly lower availability that was consistent across all decay-classes. In linear remnant forests, pure balsam fir stands were absent. Remnant stands thus showed a much lower availability in large trees when compared with unharvested balsam fir stands. Clearcuts had the lowest densities of dead trees across sampled stands. Current even-aged management practices clearly affect availability and recruitment of large trees, therefore forest-dwelling wildlife relying on these structures for breeding is likely to be affected by large-scale harvesting in coniferous boreal forests.

During the reproduction period (April-July 2005), territories and territorial behaviour of breeding birds were recorded along nine hedgerows (1180 m). Different parameters of hedgerows (length, height, number of gaps between bushes, prominent trees, structural density of shrubs, proximity to forests and human settlement) were recorded. Biotopes and land use were mapped. During autumn birds feeding on fruit carrying plants within the hedgerows (Crataegus laevigata, Sorbus aucuparia, Euonymus europaeus) were identified. Data were digitalized and analysed by using GIS. A total of 41 breeding territories of twelve species were recorded. We registered on average 3,6 breeding territories (n = 9, SD = 1,1) and 3,1 species (n = 9, SD = 1,3) per 100 m hedgerow. Nine species (five non breeding in hedges) were recorded to feed on fruits offered in the hedgerows. The diversity and the density of territories per hedge extension (m) are positively correlated with the height and negatively with the number of gaps between bushes. High structural density of single shrubs had a significant positive effect on the diversity of breeding birds. Measures to improve hedges as habitat for breeding birds arc suggested.

Scott; Greenberg, Russell				Ecology (Washington D C)	89	4		921-927	April 2008	2008				English	1	37	Unique components of tropical habitats, such as abundant vascular epiphytes, influence the distribution of species and can contribute to the high diversity of many animal groups in the tropics. However, the role of such features in habitat selection and demography of individual species has not been established. Understanding the mechanisms of habitat selection requires both experimental manipulation of habitat structure and detailed estimation of the behavioral and demographic response of animals, e.g., changes in movement patterns and survival probabilities. Such studies have not been conducted in natural tropical forest, perhaps because of high habitat heterogeneity, high species diversity, and low abundances of potential target species. Agroforestry systems support a less diverse flora, with greater spatial homogeneity which, in turn, harbors lower overall species diversity with greater numerical dominance of common species, than natural forests. Furthermore, agroforestry systems are already extensively managed and lend themselves easily to larger scale habitat manipulations than protected natural forest. Thus, agroforestry systems provide a good model environment for beginning to understand processes underlying habitat selection in tropical forest animals. Here, we use multistate, capture[long dash]recapture models to investigate how the experimental removal of epiphytes affected monthly movement and survival probabilities of two resident bird species (Common Bush-Tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus) and Golden-crowned Warbler (Basileuterus culicivorus)) in a Mexican shade coffee plantation. We established two paired plots of epiphyte removal and control. We found that Bush-Tanagers were at least five times more likely to emigrate from plots where epiphytes were removed compared to control plots. Habitat-specific movement patterns were not detected in the warbler. However, unlike the Golden-crowned Warbler, Common Bush-Tanagers depend upon epiphytes for nest sites and (seasonally) for foraging. These dispersal patterns imply that active habitat selection based on the presence or absence of epiphytes occurs in C. ophthalmicus on our study area. Survival rates did not vary with habitat in either species. Interestingly, in both species, survival was higher in the nonbreeding season, when birds were in mixed-species flocks. Movement by Common Bush-Tanagers into areas with epiphytes occurred mostly during the breeding season, when mortality-driven opportunity was greatest.

Environmental Management	41	4		468-486	April 2008	2008				English	0	9	Water level management in Mississippi River Pool 25 differentially influences off-channel habitats in the mid-pool and lower pool. Hydrologic models indicate lower pool off-channel habitats dry with greater frequency and duration compared to similar habitats at mid-pool. We examined the influence of this contrasting hydrology on substrate characteristics, organic matter, macroinvertebrate, and fish communities in off-channel habitats during 2001-2003. Benthic organic matter standing stocks were stable in mid-pool habitats but lower pool values were variable because of annual differences in moist-soil vegetation production. Generally, small-bodied and multivoltine invertebrate taxa had high community biomass and dominated lower pool habitats, whereas longer-lived and large-bodied taxa were more abundant and had higher community biomass in mid-pool habitats having longer hydroperiods. Fish communities were dominated by cyprinids in both habitats, and mid-pool habitats tended to be higher in overall species richness. Unique fish taxa were collected in each pool, with primarily rheophilic forms in mid-pool habitats and limnophilic forms in lower pool habitats. Results indicate that contrasting hydrology associated with a mid-pool control point directly and indirectly influences biological communities in off-channel habitats. Further, management regimes that promote hydrologic diversity in off-channel habitats may enhance biological diversity at larger spatial and temporal scales.

Weber, Theodore C.; Blank, Peter J.; Sloan, Anne				Environmental Management	41	4		538-550	April 2008	2008				English	0	17	Maryland's Green Infrastructure (GI) is a network of large, intact natural areas (hubs), interconnected by linear swaths of riparian or upland vegetation (corridors). The GI serves significant ecological functions and provides the bulk of the state's natural support system. This study examined whether the GI as mapped does, in fact, identify Maryland's most ecologically valuable forested lands, using forest interior dwelling birds (hereafter called "forest birds") as bio-indicators. We conducted bird point counts within forest both inside and outside of hubs on Maryland's Eastern Shore. We also collected a wide variety of habitat data. We found that both the condition of a forest and its surrounding landscape influenced the bird communities. On average, forest bird richness was significantly higher within hubs; furthermore, almost all sites with at least five forest bird species present were in hubs. Forest bird richness and abundance were highest in undisturbed, mature broadleaf forest with wetlands and streams nearby. We detected a significant relationship between forest bird richness and the ecological score of a finer-scale landscape assessment, focused on "cells" of about 0.1 ha in size. This field study also validated the Rapid Field Assessment (RFA) protocol developed in 2001 to assess, on the ground, the relative condition of individual sites or properties within the GI. Forest bird richness and abundance were positively correlated with the RFA community scores. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining regional biological diversity by retaining large blocks of forest, especially mature forest containing streams and wetlands.

Wetlands enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) provide many ecological functions but may be particularly important as habitat for migrant and resident waterbirds; however, use of, and factors associated with use of, CREP wetlands as stopover and breeding sites have not been evaluated. We surveyed a random sample of CREP wetlands in the Illinois River watershed in 2004 and 2005 to quantify use of restored wetlands by spring migrating and breeding waterbirds. Waterbirds used 75% of wetlands during spring migration. Total use-day abundance for the entire spring migration ranged from 0 to 49,633 per wetland and averaged 6,437 [plus or minus] 1,887 (SE). Semipermanent wetlands supported the greatest total number of use-days and the greatest number of use-days relative to wetland area. Species richness ranged from 0 to 42 ((x)over bar> = 10.0 [plus or minus] 1.5 (SE)), and 5 of these species were classified as endangered in Illinois. Density of waterfowl breeding pairs ranged from 0.0 pairs/ha to 16.6 pairs/ha ((x)over bar> = 1.9 [plus or minus] 0.5 (SE) pairs/ha), and 16 species of wetland birds were identified as local breeders. Density of waterfowl broods ranged from 0.0 broods/ha to 3.6 broods/ha and averaged 0.5 [plus or minus] 0.1 (SE) broods/ha. We also modeled spring stopover use, waterbird species richness, and waterfowl reproduction in relation to spatial, physical, and floristic characteristics of CREP wetlands. The best approximating models to explain variation in all 3 dependent variables included only the covariate accounting for level of hydrologic management (i.e., none, passive, or active). Active management was associated with 858% greater use-days during spring than sites with only passive water management. Sites where hydrology was passively managed also averaged 402% greater species richness than sites where no hydrologic management was possible. Density of waterfowl broods was 120% greater on passively managed sites than on sites without water management but was 29% less on sites with active compared to passive hydrologic management. Densities of waterfowl broods also were greatest when ratios of open water to cover were 70:30. Models that accounted for vegetation quality and landscape variables ranked lower than models based solely on hydrologic management or vegetation cover in all candidate sets. Although placement and clustering of sites may be critical for maintaining populations of some wetland bird species, these factors appeared to be less important for attracting migrant waterbirds in our study area. In the context of restored CREP wetlands, we suggest the greatest gains in waterbird use and reproduction may be accomplished by emphasizing site-specific restoration efforts related to hydrology and floristic structure.

Kissling, Michelle L.; Garton, Edward O.				Journal of Wildlife Management	72	3		674-681	April 2008	2008				English	1	19	Forested buffer strips are used to mitigate fragmentation and habitat loss and are a common feature in management of riparian landscapes. Low-elevation, old-growth coastal forests are a rare riparian habitat that can benefit from similar conservation measures. We evaluated the effectiveness of postlogging, forested buffer strips for forest-dwelling birds in the coastal temperate rainforest of southeast Alaska, USA. Our objective was to compare bird composition and density among forested buffer strips of differing widths and controls at the stand and landscape scales. We applied a 2-stage sampling design stratified by forested buffer width and randomly selected 24 managed and 18 control sites to sample over 2 breeding seasons. We estimated abundance of birds using the paired-observer, variable-circular plot method. We modeled combined effects of buffer width and vegetation and landscape characteristics on bird density at 2 spatial scales. Species richness and diversity were greatest in the narrowest buffers, but species composition in the largest buffers (>=400 m) was most similar to that in control blocks. Abundance of 3 of 10 common species differed across forested buffer treatments and controls. Densities of red-breasted sapsucker (Sphyrapicus ruber) and Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis) were positively related to buffer width, whereas density of ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula) was negatively associated with buffer width. Parameter estimates for buffer width effects at both spatial scales were similar within species. We found few habitat and landscape variables that clearly affected density of our focal species, and among species no predictor variables affected density in a similar fashion. We recommend retaining forested buffers >=400 m to support composition and abundance of forest-dwelling birds, particularly those species that rely on interior forest conditions.

Augenfeld, Kimberley H.; Franklin, Scott B.; Snyder, David H.				Forest Ecology and Management	255	3-4		1271-1282	March 20 2008	2008				English	2	24	We studied the relationship between the effects of shelterwood logging on forest structure and long-term abundance, diversity, and richness of breeding bird communities in an upland hardwood forest at Land Between The Lakes (LBL), Kentucky and Tennessee. Breeding bird communities (point counts in 1987[long dash]1989, 1999) and forest vegetation structure (1987[long dash]1988, 1999), the year prior to, 1 and 2 years after, and 12 years after shelterwood logging were compared between logged and uncut (>40 years since logging) forest sites. Shelterwood sites had significantly greater mid-story canopy. General avian community trends demonstrated an initial increase in diversity and density the year following logging, and decreased diversity and density in 1999. Uncut sites showed a general decline in diversity in 1989 and 1999. The influence of shelterwood logging varied among taxa and among foraging guilds. Specifically, the ground-gleaning guild was significantly more diverse on uncut sites than on shelterwood sites. We attribute this greater diversity to a more complex and diverse forest understory with greater opportunity for foraging. Logging did not significantly influence diversity, evenness, or richness of the nesting guilds. We examined four priority species of concern (as designated by Partners in Flight): Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus), Kentucky Warbler (Oporonis formosus), and Hooded Warbler (Wilsonia citrina). Of these, population densities of Wood Thrush were significantly lower on logged sites than on uncut sites while worm-eating warblers were higher on logged sites. The Kentucky Warbler and Hooded Warbler did not occur on logged sites. Higher densities of birds in our study sites compared to regional surveys suggest LBL is an important local area for breeding bird communities.

Drever, Mark C.; Aitken, Kathryn E.H.; Norris, Andrea R.; Martin, Kathy				Biological Conservation	141	3		624-634	March 2008	2008				English	4	74	Woodpeckers (family Picidae) show promise as indicators of avian diversity in forests because their populations can be reliably monitored, and their foraging and nesting activities can positively influence the abundance and richness of other forest birds. A correlation between woodpecker richness and richness of forest birds is known to exist at the landscape scale, but uncertainty remains whether this correlation occurs at the smaller stand-level spatial scales where forest management activities take place. We used data collected under a diverse range of forest types, harvest treatments, and forest health conditions during a long-term study of bird communities in interior British Columbia, Canada, to examine two basic questions: (1) at the level of individual forest stands, is woodpecker richness correlated with bird richness (measured as richness of all other bird species)? and (2) do woodpecker richness and bird richness have similar habitat correlates? Bird richness was positively correlated with woodpecker richness ([beta] = 0.59, SE = 0.22, 95% CI = (0.14 1.03)). Richness of both woodpeckers and all other birds were positively correlated with tree species richness and negatively correlated with density of pines, and the effect for forest harvest type was similar for both measures of avian richness (uncut < partial harvest < clearcut with reserves). The effect of density of lodgepole pines killed by mountain pine beetles differed between the two richness measures, being positive for woodpecker richness and negative for forest bird richness. We conclude that the richness of woodpeckers is indeed correlated with the richness of other birds at the stand-level, and can serve as a reliable indicator of overall bird richness in most forest stands and conditions, except during insect outbreaks when differential responses by woodpeckers and the rest of the avian community may decouple the relationship between bird richness and woodpecker richness.

Maes, Joke; Musters, C.J.M.; De Snoo, Geert R.				Biological Conservation	141	3		635-645	March 2008	2008				English	2	33	The Western Peat District of The Netherlands has a characteristic Dutch landscape. It consists mainly of meadows for dairy farming, crisscrossed by a dense network of ditches. Its biodiversity is regarded as of high national and international importance, but is declining as a result of intensive farming. Besides the establishment of reserves, measures to conserve and restore biological diversity have been implemented in the form of agri-environment schemes (AES). The aim of this research is to investigate, first, whether the reserves, assuming these provide source populations, affect the distribution of amphibians and, second, whether AES in the form of nature-friendly ditch bank management benefits amphibian diversity and abundance and enhances distribution across the agricultural landscape. In total, 42 ditches (24 control ditches and 18 AES ditches) were studied. Each ditch was perpendicular to the boundary of one of the reserves and was divided into five ditch sections of 100 m spread over 800 m, starting in the reserve and proceeding into the farmland. Generalized Linear Modelling was used to quantify the effect of nature-friendly ditch bank management (AES) and distance to the nature reserve on amphibian diversity and abundance. Species richness was high in AES ditches as compared to control ditches. The number of observed green frog (Rana esculenta synkl.) seemed to decline in the control ditches at large distances from the reserve. The other species, although their abundances were higher in the reserves, did not show a declining trend across the farmland. However, all adult amphibians except green frogs together had significantly higher abundances in the AES ditches compared to the control ditches. These results illustrate the potential role of agricultural ditches, combined with reserves and nature-friendly ditch bank management, in the conservation of amphibian populations.

Dinata, Yoan; Nugroho, Agung; Haidir, Iding Achmad; Linkie, Matthew				Bird Conservation International	18	1		30-37	March 2008	2008				English	2	18	Tropical forests are becoming increasingly degraded and fragmented by logging, which can affect the survival of forest bird species in different ways. In this study, we present avifauna data collected from a monitoring programme in west-central Sumatra that set camera traps in three study areas with different habitat types, levels of degradation and protection status. From 5,990 camera trap-nights, 248 independent bird photographs were recorded, comprising four orders and nine species, including three endemic species. The Great Argus Pheasant (Argusianus argus) was recorded in all study areas and most frequently (n = 202 photographs), followed by the threatened Salvadori's Pheasant (Lophura inornata). The greatest diversity of bird species (five) and abundance index (1.44 bird photographs/loo trap-nights) was recorded from a primary hillsubmontane forest site located inside Kerinci Seblat National Park (KSNP) bordering degraded forest in a former logging concession recently repatriated into KSNP. However, inside a primary-selectively logged hill-submontane forest site spread over KSNP and an ex-logging concession, a Sumatran Ground Cuckoo (Carpococcyx viridis) was photographed. This species is noteworthy because prior to this study it had only been documented once since 1916. It is therefore crucial to use the camera trap results to increase the protection status for the ground cuckoo area. This has already happened in the other two study areas, where camera trap data have been used to reclassify the areas as Core Zones, the highest level of protection inside KSNP. This study illustrates how routine monitoring can have wider benefits through recording, and conserving, threatened and endemic non-target species in unexpected habitats that might not otherwise have been surveyed.

Bird Study	55	1		8-22	March 2008	2008				English	0	11	Capsule Farmland bird species occurred at low densities and were highly aggregated in a small proportion of available pastures, stubble fields and farmyards. Aim To document the current distribution and abundance of farmland birds and their habitats within the lowland farmland of Britain in winter. Methods Over three winters volunteer observers visited a stratified random sample of 1090 1-km squares within which they counted a suite of 30 farmland bird species and mapped agricultural habitats. Results For individual species, less than 10% of habitat patches were occupied and densities in occupied patches were low. Several differences were apparent in patterns of relative abundance compared to the 1980s. In particular marked declines of Tree Sparrow and Corn Bunting were apparent. The national distribution of cereal stubbles was localized. A large proportion of most species was found in grassland. Positive associations at the patch scale were apparent for improved grassland by invertebrate feeders and cereal and maize stubbles and farmyards, mostly by granivores. Conclusion Many farmland passerines are highly aggregated, even within particularly favoured field types. These results are consistent with winter food resources being highly localized and the need to create more food-rich patches if declines are to be reversed.

In 2005 the counts referred to the Bagno Bubnow and Bagno Staw wetlands as well as the southern part of the external protection zone of the Park and in 2006 to the main complex of the PPN with the total area of 101 km2 (Fig. 1). The counts were conducted by 2-3 person groups along transects of 3-7 km about half an hour before sunrise and 3-4 hours after it. In total, 28-30 territories (couples) of cranes in the Polesie National Park were found (Table 2). Population density was 27.7-29.7 couples/ 100 km2. Territories were situated in water-logged forests (alder forests and Vaccinio uliginosi-Betuletum pubescentis) - 13-14 territories (46.5% in average, 29 territories were considered as 100%), in moist meadows - 7-8 territories (25.8%), in peat bogs - 6 territories (20.7%), in fish ponds - 1 territory (3.5%) and at a pool located within arable fields - 1 territory (3.5%) (Table 2). Non-breeding fraction of cranes was estimated in the years 2005-2006 at 110-120 individuals. Together with breeding birds during breeding season in the area of the Poleski National Park about 140-170 individuals of this species were present. The Poleski National Park and its surroundings are crucial areas for cranes as gathering sites before the autumnal migration. The gatherings start in the end of June and last till the turn of October and November. In August 2006, 954-976 cranes were found at gathering sites. As the area of the "Krowie Bagno" wetland is an important gathering place of cranes in the Polesie region, it is crucial to protect this area and include it to the protection zone of the Poleski National Park or to extend the area of "Natura 2000" site together with the prohibition of hunting until end of November. The number of cranes recorded at the gathering sites justifies the joining of the "Krowie Bagno" and the areas between Andrzejow and Hansk villages to an ornithological refugium of European importance for non-breeding birds.

Journal of Field Ornithology	79	1		41-52	March 2008	2008				English	3	78	No other group of North American birds has declined as precipitously and over so large an area as has the grassland assemblage. In the Flint Hills of Kansas, the largest extant region of tallgrass prairie, annual spring burning of rangeland has largely replaced traditional regimes and natural patterns with longer intervals between burns. I examined effects of burning and low-intensity cattle grazing on abundances of seven bird species at Konza Prairie Research Natural Area in June 2002 and 2003. Every species was affected by fire, with Upland Sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) more abundant, and six species-Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Henslow's Sparrow (A. henslowii), Dickcissel (Spiza americana), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), and Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii)-either less abundant or absent at sites in the breeding season following a fire. These results demonstrate that annual burning limits the potential of much of the Flint Hills prairie to harbor high breeding densities of many grassland birds. On the other hand, I found a trade-off between immediate and longer-term effects of burning for several grass-dependent species. Grasshopper Sparrows, Henslow's Sparrows, and Eastern Meadowlarks, although more numerous in areas that were not burned the preceding spring, were less abundant at sites burned every 4 yrs than those burned at shorter intervals. In contrast, shrub-dependent Bell's Vireos were more abundant at sites burned every 4 yrs. Upland Sandpipers, Grasshopper Sparrows, and Eastern Meadowlarks were more abundant in grazed areas. Use of alternatives to annual burning could increase habitat heterogeneity by transforming the Flint Hills into a mosaic of regularly, but asynchronously, burned pastures that would better meet the diverse habitat needs of the region's grassland birds.

Northwestern Naturalist	89	1		33-45	Spring 2008	2008				English	0	1	Silvicultural practices such as thinning are performed both for commodity production and to help achieve fuel reduction and biodiversity goals. Although there are several studies that have examined effects of clearcut harvest techniques on forest songbirds, few have examined the effects of thinning. We studied the response of songbirds to different silvicultural approaches to forest management. We experimentally manipulated three 80 to 110 y-old Douglas-fir stands to evaluate influences of commercial thinning and clearcut harvest silvicultural systems on populations of diurnal breeding birds in southwestern Oregon. We conducted 10 to 12 bird point count surveys in each stand between 1992 and 1994 (prior to treatment), and point count surveys of birds 6 times each year from 1998 through 1999 (subsequent to treatment). We found that relative abundance and species richness were highest in the uncut control plots, slightly lower in the thinned plots, and lowest in the clearcut plots. A species-by-species analysis of those species with sufficient data showed marked negative short-term impacts of clearcutting on 12 of 16 species, potentially moderate negative impacts of thinning on 9 of 16 species, as well as positive impacts of thinning on at least 3 species.

Das Auerhuhn - eine naturschutzbiologische Betrachtung.	Suter, Werner; Graf, Roland F.				Ornithologische Beobachter	105	1		17-32	Maerz 2008	2008				German	0	1	All grouse species inhabiting Swiss mountain forests have been declining and are red-listed or classified as near-threatened, with the Western Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus being of highest concern. However, grouse declines do not reflect a general trend in bird species inhabiting mountain forests. We argue that the Capercaillie's predicament stems from its habitat selection, which is however not fundamentally different from other typical mountain forest birds. The difference rather lies in the fact that it requires higher local structural diversity of forest stands which, at the same time, should extend over larger areas. This is mainly due to life history traits ultimately related to its large body size and sexual size dimorphism. Capercaillie can thus make an excellent umbrella species. It has indeed been demonstrated that Capercaillie presence is associated with higher species richness and abundance of typical mountain forest birds, but not with total bird species richness and abundance. Most likely, Capercaillie can also be seen as an umbrella species for other components of biodiversity ranging from beetles to phanerogames. This is because high structural diversity and conditions allowing enough light to reach the forest floor are beneficial for many groups of organisms. Therefore, managing forests according to the needs of Capercaillie is not to be seen as a onesided policy for the benefit of a popular flagship species but as a useful strategy for enhancing a wider part of biodiversity in mountain forests.

Restoration Ecology	16	1		155-167	March 2008	2008				English	0	31	Many of the world's large river systems have been greatly altered in the past century due to river regulation, agriculture, and invasion of introduced Tamarix spp. (saltcedar, tamarisk). These riverine ecosystems are known to provide important habitat for avian communities, but information on responses of birds to differing levels of Tamarix is not known. Past research on birds along the Colorado River has shown that avian abundance in general is greater in native than in non-native habitat. In this article, we address habitat restoration on the lower Colorado River by comparing abundance and diversity of avian communities at a matrix of different amounts of native and non-native habitats at National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona. Two major patterns emerged from this study: (1) Not all bird species responded to Tamarix in a similar fashion, and for many bird species, abundance was highest at intermediate Tamarix levels (40[long dash]60%), suggesting a response threshold. (2) In Tamarix-dominated habitats, the greatest increase in bird abundance occurred when small amounts of native vegetation were present as a component of that habitat. In fact, Tamarix was the best vegetation predictor of avian abundance when compared to vegetation density and canopy cover. Our results suggest that to positively benefit avian abundance and diversity, one cost-effective way to rehabilitate larger monoculture Tamarix stands would be to add relatively low levels of native vegetation ([approximately]20[long dash]40%) within homogenous Tamarix habitat. In addition, this could be much more cost effective and feasible than attempting to replace all Tamarix with native vegetation.	van Riper, Charles, III; U.S. Geological Survey, Southwest Biological Science Center SDRS, 125 Biological Sciences East, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA, USA.	charles_van_riper@usgs.gov					Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology	1061-2971		Conservation; Conservation measures; Ecology; Community structure; Population dynamics; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA	Aves [Habitat management / Habitat restoration / Exotic vegetation management] [Species diversity /  / ] [Population size / Abundance / ] [Habitat utilization / Exotic vs native vegetation habitat use / ] [Riparian habitat /  / ] [Arizona / Lower Colorado River / ].

Reinkensmeyer, Daniel P.; Miller, Richard E.; Anthony, Robert G.; Marr, Vern E.; Duncan, Corinne M.				Western North American Naturalist	68	1		25-35	March 2008	2008				English	0	12	We compared winter (December, January, and February), and early spring (March and April) bird communities among 4 successional stages that included grassland, shrubsteppe, juniper-shrubsteppe, and old-growth juniper woodland in central Oregon. Birds were surveyed monthly from December through April in 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 using the point count method to estimate relative abundance of birds (individuals - transect-1 year-1). We used distance sampling to correct for potential bias in estimating abundance and density among successional stages. A total of 4513 birds (32 species) were detected. Relative abundance of total birds (all species combined) was similar in tile juniper-shrubsteppe and old-growth woodland (48.7 and 48.9 individuals - transect-1, respectively) but 6 times greater than in the grassland and shrubsteppe (8.0 and 7.7 individuals - transect-1, respectively) during the 5-month period. Total density of birds was greater in old-growth juniper woodland and juniper shrubsteppe than in grassland or shrubsteppe. However, median bird species richness in 1998/1999 was highest in grassland and lowest both in shrubsteppe and juniper-shrubsteppe, and in 1999/2000 it was highest in shrubsteppe and lowest in juniper-shrubsteppe and old-growth juniper woodland. American Robins and 'Townsend's Solitaires were the most abundant species in juniper shrubsteppe and old-growth juniper woodland during the winter months. Sage Sparrows and Horned Larks were tile most abundant species in shrubsteppe during winter, and Horned Larks were most abundant in grasslands during tile early spring transition period prior to nesting. Our results indicate that a different suite of species use these successional stages during the nonbreeding season. If avifauna conservation is a part of long-term management goals, a broad range of successional stages Should be maintained on the landscape to provide habitat for it variety of avian species throughout the year.

Valkama, Elena; Lyytinen, Sami; Koricheva, Julia				Biological Conservation	141	2		364-374	February 2008	2008				English	4	71	We reviewed European studies on the effect of reed management (harvesting, burning, mowing and grazing) on reedbed wildlife, and in addition, on the performance of re-growing reed (Phraymites australis). Our database consisted of 21 studies conducted on 10 plant species, 17 taxonomic groups of invertebrates and 11 bird. species, and published between 1982 and 2006.We found that reed management modifies the structure of re-growing reed stands: reed stems were shorter and denser in managed sites than in unmanaged sites. However, harvesting does not have an impact on aboveground biomass. Plant species richness increased by 90% in managed stands in fresh water marshes, but not in saline water marshes.Overall, reed management had a significant negative impact on invertebrate community, but the duration of management was an important factor determining the magnitude of the effect. Short-term management (1-2 years) had no effect on invertebrates, whereas management for longer period significantly reduced invertebrate abundance. Reed harvesting and burning reduced abundance of passerine birds by about 60%. This was probably associated with food limitation as the numbers of butterflies, beetles and some spiders were reduced. Therefore, the optimal reed management regime to preserve number of birds and invertebrates in reedbeds could be a rotation of short-term management (1-2 years). However, the optimal interval between management applications should be established in future studies. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Felton, Adam; Wood, Jeff; Felton, Annika M.; Hennessey, Bennett; Lindenmayer, David B.				Biological Conservation	141	2		545-555	February 2008	2008				English	0	40	We studied bird community composition and abundance within the logged and unlogged forest areas of a certified forestry concession in lowland Bolivia. The logged forest was harvested using reduced-impact logging techniques between one and four years previously We used canonical correspondence analysis to describe the relationship between selected environmental variables and bird species abundance data, and the indicator Value procedure to test for associations between bird species and the logged and unlogged habitats. Approximately one-third of birds were restricted to either the logged or unlogged areas, with 20% of all species only encountered in, or significantly more abundant in, the unlogged areas of the concession. The majority of birds found in significantly higher abundance in the unlogged areas of the concession were associated with forest habitats dominated by large trees, or a high diversity of trees, providing dense canopy cover and deep leaf litter, with an understorey dominated by ferns. Over 40% of bird species that were significantly associated with the unlogged areas of the concession are of conservation concern. In contrast, the majority of birds associated with the logged areas of the concession are known to be relatively resilient to human disturbance. The majority of species which exhibited significant lower abundances in the logged areas of the concession belonged to insectivorous or frugivorous feeding guilds. We discuss whether current management practices within this certified concession are sustainable and how our results can be used to guide future research and inform better practice.

Grundel, Ralph; Pavlovic, Noel B.				Journal of Applied Ecology	45	1		315-324	February 2008	2008				English	1	36	1. Managers considering restoration of landscapes often face a fundamental challenge - what should be the habitat composition of the restored landscape? We present a method for evaluating an important conservation trade-off inherent in making that decision.2. Oak savannas and grasslands were historically widespread across central North America but are now rare. Today, in north-west Indiana, USA, habitats spanning a range of woody vegetation density, from nearly treeless open habitats to forests, occur across the conserved landscape where savannas probably once dominated. To understand the benefits of different potential landscape compositions, we evaluated how different proportions of five habitats - open, savanna, woodland, scrub and forest - might affect the conservation value of the north-west Indiana landscape for birds. Two variables of potential conservation importance were examined: species diversity, a measure of avian community richness, and conservation index, the percentage of a bird species' global population occurring on a hectare of landscape, summed across all bird species present. Higher values of conservation index were associated with higher local densities of globally more rare and more threatened species.3. Conservation index and species diversity were correlated negatively across hypothetical landscapes composed of different proportions of the five habitats. Therefore, a management trade-off existed between conservation index and species diversity because landscapes that maximized species diversity differed from landscapes that maximized conservation index.4. A landscape of 50% open, 22% savanna, 15% scrub and 13% forest was predicted to represent a compromise at which conservation index and species diversity reached the same percentage of their maxima. In contrast, the current landscape is dominated by forest.5. Synthesis and applications. We quantified the trade-off between two potential aspects of a landscape's conservation value for birds - the landscape's ability to promote avian species diversity and the landscape's use by threatened avian species. This quantification allowed us to evaluate the ability of different landscape compositions to achieve preferable trade-off compromises, such as maximizing diversity for a given level of landscape use by threatened species. Managers can use these trade-off results to determine which landscape compositions are associated with particular conservation and management priorities.

Garcia, Cesar; Renison, Daniel; Cingolani, Ana M.; Fernandez-Juricic, Esteban				Journal of Applied Ecology	45	1		351-360	February 2008	2008				English	0	32	1. In the high Mountains of Cordoba (Central Argentina) large native herbivores were replaced completely by domestic livestock early in the 20th century. Recently, livestock were excluded in a large portion of the mountains to reduce alarming soil erosion rates, leading to an unnatural situation as the area has a long evolutionary history of large herbivore grazing. Many of the birds living in this area are endemic subspecies. Lack of large herbivore grazing can reduce plant diversity, but the response of birds is unknown.2. We surveyed birds in 46 1.8-ha transects distributed across eight vegetation units under (a) traditional livestock rearing and (b) 4 years of livestock exclusion. We described bird communities per transect using density and richness. The effects of grazing situation and vegetation units on these parameters were analysed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Additionally, we analysed bird composition through detrended correspondence analysis (DCA).3. Livestock exclusion caused, in all vegetation units, significant reductions in observed bird density and richness when all species were included in the analysis, and when the 12 endemic subspecies were considered separately. An analysis for each guild showed a similar pattern but differences were significant only for richness of insectivorous and granivorous birds. Vegetation units always showed significant differences in bird density and richness, with no significant interactions between vegetation and grazing situations. Community composition described through DCA was different between vegetation units but not between grazing situations. Endemic birds were associated mainly with rocky areas.4. Synthesis and applications. In areas where large native herbivores are locally extinct, extensive exclusion of domestic livestock is not recommended where bird conservation is also a priority. Where possible, we suggest reintroducing native large herbivores. Where reintroductions are not feasible, livestock must be excluded only from those sites where it is most necessary, and maintained elsewhere at reduced stocking rates. To mimic past natural grazing regimes more effectively, livestock grazing regimes should incorporate temporal fluctuations at seasonal, yearly and decade scales.

Hoelker, Manfred				Abhandlungen aus dem Westfaelischen Museum fuer Naturkunde	70	1		1-75	2008	2008				German	0	0	For centuries now, intensively cultivated landscapes characterised by arable farming and a predominantly open structure with no woodland areas have been a typical element of Central European ecosystems. Such cultivated landscapes now hold the largest number of endangered animal and plant species and are therefore among the habitat types which require top-priority protection in every European country. The aim of this study was to survey and describe the avian community of the intensively used arable farmland of the Hellwegboerde ("Boerde" approx. = fertile plain). The studies were conducted between 1993 and 2002 in the natural landscape unit of the Hellwegboerde in Central Westphalia (51.24[long dash]51.43 N/7.50[long dash]8.35 E) in an area of around 1400 km2. The Hellwegboerde is characterised by arable farmland on preglacial loess clays and located on the southern fringe of the Westphalian Bight. It is situated within the sub-atlantic climatic region and is among the oldest areas of human settlement in Central Europe. As early as the Neolithic period 6,000 years ago, sedentary people tilled fields in this area. The landscape and human settlement situation that exists today in the Hellweg area was predominantly already to be found in the 9th century. In the middle of the 12th century, the area was already known as the "Granary" of Westphalia. Intensification of land use since the 1950s has resulted in a substantial increase in harvest sizes. The Hellwegboerde is now one of the most productive and most intensively used farming areas in Germany. The main characteristic features of the arable landscape of the Hellweg are its large fields, the intensive land utilisation and the low number of interspersed trees. The proportion of semi-natural landscape components is small. To obtain a valid representation of the biotope types and structural elements existing in the agricultural landscape of the Hellwegborde. eight representative census areas (approx. 850 ha) were surveyed. These census areas were selected according to the following criteria: area approx. 100 ha; minimum 95 % agricultural land: representative spectrum of land use types; open fields with very small proportion of woodland (< 1 %): compact form with few boundary lines; location in a homogenous "Borde" landscape. The dominant crop in the census areas was winter grain, which covered 60 % of the area, well ahead of root and tuber crops with their 10 % and Rape with 9.7 %. Self-seeded fallow land made up 6.2 %, while semi-natural structures (e.g. borders, green paths, ditches) accounted for 2.4 % of the areas. In the eight census areas a population density study based on three field visits per year was conducted from 1995 to 2002. A total of 4697 territories of 36 species of breeding birds (excluding Pheasant and Corncrake) was found and a total abundance of 69.2 territories/km2 was calculated. By far the most numerous species was the Skylark (2238 territories, dominance 47.7 %, abundance 33.0 BP/km2) before Yellow Wagtail (517.5 territories, dominance 11 %, abundance 7.6 %). Together with Lapwing and Yellowhammer, these four species hold 75 % of all territories. The highest determined abundance and dominance figures of 80.8 BP/km2 and 87.2 % were found in a census area situated on limestone, which had the high proportion of up to 72.6 % of self-seeded fallow land. In the census areas in the upper Hellwegboerde, which is characterised by shallow rendzina soil, the highest number of territories was recorded. The ecological guilds are dominated by species which spend their lives on or close to the ground. The majority of species recorded in the census areas were inhabitants of the largely treeless open field landscape, which had a dominance of 75.3 % (8 species), while species inhabiting the fringes of interspersed groves and woods only made up 4.8 % (16 species). The population trend results of arable-land birds show that the populations of most species are declining, some falling rapidly (e.g. Corn Bunting). A total of 19 of the proven 38 breeding bird species are, as a consequence, on the Red List of Germany or North-Rhine Westphalia. A fundamental prerequisite for the conservation of the agricultural landscape with its undisturbed, wide-ranging fields and almost treeless character is a significant reduction of the massive land consumption for new industrial and commercial estates, roads, quarries and windparks. In addition to the preservation of open countryside, it is extremely important to create semi-natural landscape elements (e.g. field borders, marginal strips with native plants, grass tracks), as well as self-seeded fallow areas in the intensively utilised arable farmland area.

Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae	54		(Supplement 1)	177-188	2008	2008				English	0	19	Reedbeds support high conservational value with their unique avifauna. Inadequate reed cutting methods can cause serious declines in the abundance of these bird species. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of reed cutting on the abundance and diversity of breeding passerine species, mainly Acrocephalus warblers. The study was carried out at Lake Kolon in Central Hungary, in homogenous reed (Phragmites communis) vegetation. Sample areas of 1 hectare in size were cut during 4 consecutive winters. Areas not cut but of the same size functioned as control areas. Sampling was carried out during the breeding season by mist-netting. Lake Kolon's passerine avifauna at the cut areas showed decreased species richness and decreased abundance of most of the reed-nesting species, which also resulted in decreased diversity. The Savi's Warbler (Locustella luscinioides), the Moustached Warbler (Acrocephalus melanopogon), the Sedge Warbler (A. schoenobaenus), and the Reed Warbler (A. scirpaceus) showed definite avoidance of the cut areas. Only the Great Reed Warbler (A. arundinaceus) showed preference for the cut areas. The study also revealed that edges created between cut and non-cut areas are much less preferred by passerine species than natural edges.

Egyck-Pusztakocs is the locality of the longest (since 1976) and largest (over 5000 ha) habitat restoration project in Hungary so far. Between 2004 and 2006, both species richness and diversity of bird assemblages increased, which was accelerated in the wet year of 2006, when birds of wetland and open water habitats appeared in great numbers. Farmland bird species richness increased slightly in three years. The presence of more than half of the regular raptor species in Hungary was confirmed by the spring and the autumn observations. Grassland reconstruction correlated with a decline in the abundance of Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) but not in that of Yellow Wagtails (Motacilla flava), likely due to high weed cover in the spring following grassland restoration. In conclusion, we did not find evidence for the grassland reconstruction leading to an increased bird species richness or diversity because high precipitation has masked its effect in the first year. However, the steady increase in species richness and diversity may be part of a longer-term process resulting from the first phase of restoration (marsh rehabilitation).

In Germany, the extent of non-plantation forest is not sufficient to maintain typical habitats and species. We have to expand natural habitats as well as to integrate aspects of nature-conservation practice into managed forests. In Europe and especially Germany, many conservation management practices are required by law. It is important, that these are implemented. For 'large bird species; key factors are the presence of mature trees, dead wood and a favour-able forest structure. The timing of forest management practices and the manner, in which they are conducted, are also important.

He presents the clues of presence and the biology of the seven meeting species, then the surches backgrounds of every species are described. Next, the author deals with the densities of each sort of woodpeckers, the territories' sizes, the population's historic. An estimation of alsacian forests populations is suggested, as well as regional maps of sharing. Finally, the author suggests to preserve the black woodpecker's holes, an absolutely original biotope and very important for forester's ecosystems.

Sviridova, T.V.; Volkov, S.V.; Koltsov, D.B.; Konovalova, T.V.; Zubakin, V.A.				Byulleten' Moskovskogo Obshchestva Ispytatelei Prirody Otdel Biologicheskii	113	1		12-20	January-February 2008	2008				Russian	0	5	The study was carried out at a model plot of 48 sq. km at the north of Moscow Region (56[degree]45'N, 37[degree]45' E). It was demonstrated that spatial distribution, numbers and nesting success of the Eurasian Curlew, (Numenius arquata) on farn-dands are primarily determined by intensity of landuse. Hatching success was increasing in a series of years 1997, 1999, 2005 from 32-97% due to improvement of protective characteristics of habitats on abandoned lands, as well as growth of the density of territorial pairs on considerably reduced area of mown meadows, a preferred nesting habitat. Abandonment of farmlands probably leads to decreased feeding activity of corvids, while density growth of Curlews facilitates effective nest protection by their communal agressive behaviour. Alterations of nesting habitats due to ploughing and growth of shrubs did not result in decrease of the species numbers, but caused changes in spatial distribution of territorial birds within the study plot. Catastrophic events in some years, like widespread grass fires (up to 43,5% of the area of nesting habitats burnt) did not result in changes of Curlew numbers or distribution, but markedly reduced total nesting success like in 2006 (49%, compared to 97% in 2005). This occures due to both decreased hatching success in nests affected by fire and low hatching success in replacement Clutches on burnt meadows (31,25%, n = 5) compared to clutches on unimpaired meadows (80516, n = 5). In years with late prolonged springs numbers of breeding pairs were increased from 10-15 to 26 32, the start of nesting was delayed by approximately 5 days ([chi]2 = 14,45, p = 0,025) and egg-laying period was prolonged compared to phenologically normal and early seasons.

Morrissey, Christy A.; Dods, Patti L.; Elliott, John E.				Ecological Applications	18	1		172-184	January 2008	2008				English	1	21	In British Columbia, Canada, management efforts used to control mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks have included treatment of infested trees with an organic arsenic pesticide, monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA). Cumulative pesticide applications over a large geographic area have generated concerns about arsenic loading in the environment and potential toxicity to nontarget wildlife. We investigated woodpecker foraging patterns in infested stands with and without MSMA treatment using a combination of tree debarking indices, point count surveys, and radiotelemetry methods in addition to insect flight traps to measure mountain pine beetle emergence. Debarking indices indicated woodpecker foraging of MSMA-treated trees was significantly lower than nontreated trees in all sampling years. However, [approximately]40% of MSMA trees had some evidence of foraging. Focal observations of foraging woodpeckers and point count surveys in MSMA treatment areas further confirmed that several species of woodpeckers regularly used MSMA stands during the breeding season. Radio-tagged Hairy (Picoides villosus) and Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) Woodpeckers spent on average 13% and 23% (range 0-66%) of their time, respectively, in treated stands, despite the fact that these areas only comprised on average 1-2% of their core home range (1 km2). MSMA strongly reduced the emergence of several bark beetle (Coleoptera, Scolytidae) species including the mountain pine beetle, and there was a highly significant positive relationship between Dendroctonus beetle abundance and Three-toed Woodpecker abundance. This study identifies the potential negative impact that forest management practices using pesticides can have on woodpecker populations that depend on bark beetles and their host trees.

Desrochers, David W.; Keagy, Jason C.; Cristol, Daniel A.				Ecoscience	15	1		36-43	2008	2008				English	2	39	Permits to destroy wetlands often require the creation of the same type of wetland elsewhere. An assumption underlying this practice is that such created wetlands will replace the ecological functions lost when the developed wetland was destroyed. Part of this ecological function is providing habitat for wildlife, including, in coastal areas, a suite of bird species tied to salt marshes for some portion of their life cycle. We tested the hypothesis that created wetlands provide habitat for the avian communities lost when wetlands are destroyed by comparing the breeding and wintering birds on I I small created salt marshes with those on I I natural reference salt marshes that were carefully matched for size and surrounding land cover. We found that, during the breeding season, created salt marshes had lower avian abundance and richness than reference salt marshes. In particular, wetland-dependent species were poorly represented on created wetlands. On the other hand, bird use outside of the breeding season and use by an important salt marsh obligate species, the clapper rail (Rallus longirostris), did not differ. Created wetlands that we surveyed failed to completely replicate the bird and plant communities that we observed on nearby natural reference salt marshes, raising the question of whether current mitigation policies that encourage wetland creation should continue without further investigation into the success of such wetlands at recreating wildlife habitat.

Bechet, Arnaud; Johnson, Alan R.				Ibis	150	1		69-79	January 2008	2008				English	0	13	Predicting how bird populations may respond to climate change is a major challenge which could be addressed by understanding how past environmental processes have driven the variations of breeding population size and productivity. In inhabited regions, this issue may be complicated by the interference associated with heterogeneous levels of habitat management. Here, we have explored how several hydrological variables influenced the breeding of the Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus in the Camargue (Rhone delta, southern France) over a 28-year period (1974-2001). In this region, Flamingos breed in a commercial salt pan. They forage in both salt pans and adjacent brackish lagoons. We hypothesized that breeding numbers, productivity and body condition of chicks at fledging were influenced positively by water levels of the Vaccares, the main lagoon of the delta, in spring (water and food availability) and the Rhone discharge in winter (nutrient availability in the salt pans). We controlled for variations of the flooding date of the breeding salt pan by the salt company and the size of the breeding island. We first found the Vaccares water levels and Rhone discharge to be negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Secondly, the number of Flamingo breeding pairs (range 3560-22 200) increased by 1767 [plus or minus] 1418 (95% CI) with a 10-day advance of the flooding date of the breeding salt pan and by 1146 [plus or minus] 1081 per 10-cm water level rise in the Vaccares. Productivity was 0.46 [plus or minus] 0.41 chicks per pair and could not be explained by any of the variables considered. Finally, chick body condition decreased with the number of breeding pairs and Rhone discharge. Our results show that (1) this intensely managed system remains sensitive to large-scale climate variations, (2) the breeding of the Greater Flamingo is affected by both climate variations and management of the salt pan, and (3) the expected enhancement of delta productivity by high river discharge was absent, probably prevented by dykes and embankments along the river. The response of bird populations to climate variations can thus be complex in intensely managed biological systems as found in the Mediterranean. We encourage pursuing such analyses incorporating anthropogenic variables explicitly in order to expand our capacity to make inference on the future of these systems.

We sampled birds and vegetation in seven transects, three transects in CLOSURE, two in BURNING and two in GRAZING. We detected 398 individuals of 30 species in 70 bird counts (ten visits per transect). The variable with greater variation was species composition. Ten bird species were present only in CLOSURE, seven species were only in BURNING and five species were only in GRAZING. Only one bird species was present in all management regimes. Rarefaction curves showed that CLOSURE sites could accumulate a higher species number. However, mean bird richness and mean abundance (total, grassland birds, and trophic groups) appeared not to be affected by management regime. Vegetation composition was heterogeneous in terms of cover among management regimes. Plant richness, tiller height and litter depth were higher in CLOSURE sites, with a significant management regime effect. Variation in plant richness and tiller height was explained by local-scale effect. However, we not find any association between vegetation variables and bird richness and abundance. Our results suggest that in the managed grasslands of Mburucuya National Park, closures could result in an increase of plant richness, plant height and litter accumulation. In the short-term, it could promote bird species turnover (?-diversity) among management regimes, that which represents a challenge to reconcile management and conservation goals.

Whelan, Chrisropher J.; Jedlicka, Dianne M.				Israel Journal of Ecology & Evolution	53	3-4		279-295	2007(2008)	2008				English	1	21	Restoration Ecology is the application of principles from Evolutionary Ecology to recover ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed by human activities. Successful restoration requires clearly defined objectives and the means to assess progress in meeting them. Often this includes monitoring population trajectories (changes in population size over time) of focal species. Unfortunately, population trajectories in and of themselves are often ambiguous and open to interpretation. Incorporation of additional information can increase the information content of such monitoring programs. Here we advocate using behavioral indicators, particularly the giving-up density (GUD) of food in experimental foraging patches, to complement more traditional monitoring programs that track changes in population sizes over time. We use the results of two field studies to demonstrate how GUDs reflect changes in environmental quality (background food abundance), changing physiological costs of maintenance over an annual cycle, and risk of predation. We then illustrate, through hypothetical examples, how knowledge of changes in GUDs over time can inform interpretation of actual population trajectories (based on 12 years of monitoring) of four bird species of conservation concern at the United States Forest Service Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois, USA. We conclude with a prospectus providing guidelines for incorporating behavioral indicators like the GUD in monitoring programs. Integrating behavioral indicators with more traditional population monitoring approaches provides an effective means of acquiring useful information in a timely and efficient manner.

English	0	0	Salinas are important wetland habitats, whose significance for nesting and migrating waterbirds is based on the process of salt production, i. e. the annual flooding and drying-out of evaporation basins. With a whole area of 14,9 km2 the salina of Ulcinj (Solana Ulcinj) belongs to the group of the largest, operative salinas in the Mediterranean region. The salina is situated in the delta of the Bojana-Buna River at the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea in southern Montenegro. Based on regular countings of resting and wintering waterbirds and breeding bird surveys since April 2003, the pre-sent management plan (MP) was developed by Euronatur Foundation in cooperation with the Solana Ulcinj. Because the regular flooding of the salt-pans with seawater and saline waters is essential for preserving the unique wetland habitats of the area, the maintenance of the Solana Ulcinj is a common aim of both parties involved in the MR EuroNatur and the Solana Ulcinj aim to develop and to preserve the natural values of the salina as a managed protection area based on best practice and international standards of nature conservation. The shear extent of the salina's wetland habitats and the high species diversity of its fauna and flora are unique for the eastern Adriatic region. The Solana Ulcinj is the most important resting, wintering and breeding site for many species of waterbirds along the Adriatic Flyway, and according to the presence of 15 species which reach the 1 % threshold of the Ramsar Convention (1971) a wetland of international importance. Therefore, the joined MP aims to preserve the wetland habitats of the salina, which is currently frequented by 12.000[long dash]32.000 waterbirds during spring and autumn migration, under the Ramsar Convention, by its formal protection under the laws of the Republic of Montenegro, and by the development of nature tourism and environmental education. According to the main objectives outlined in the MR indicators for a successful implementation of activities, joined by both parties, are: the population numbers of breeding, resting and over-wintering waterbirds, and the breeding success of colonially nesting shorebirds and other bird species, nesting in the salina the permanent (re)establishment of new breeding species in the Solana Ulcinj, with the main focus on Dalmatian Pelican (Pelecanus crispus) and Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber roseus) the numbers of tourists and other visitors which visit the salt-work and use the salina's educational facilities the acceptance of the project by local people, national authorities and by the international conservation community Beside a short description of techniques used for industrial salt production in the Solana, a characterization of habitat types, and of the fauna and flora of the area, the present action plan for the proposed Nature Park "Solana Ulcinj" outlines the main objectives of the project and includes detailed management planning for different parts, i.e. for dikes, canals and all evaporation basins of the salina. In addition, recommendations for the establishment of an information centre, the construction of visitor trails and other facilities for environmental education, are given.

Becker, Douglas A.; Brittingham, Margaret C.; Goguen, Christopher B.				Northeastern Naturalist	15	2		227-240	2008	2008				English	0	25	To determine how Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock) decline caused by Adelges tsugae (hemlock woolly adelgid) affects bird communities in Pennsylvania, we surveyed breeding birds in hemlock and forested non-hemlock habitats in 2003 and 2004 at Fort Indiantown Gap, PA and monitored nesting Empidonax virescens (Acadian Flycatcher), a hemlock specialist in Pennsylvania. Of the nine species more abundant in hemlocks than other forested habitats, only two, the Acadian Flycatcher and Dendroica virens (Black-throated Green Warbler), were positively associated with living hemlocks. Contopus virens (Eastern Wood-pewee), Myiarchus crinitus (Great-crested Flycatcher), and Hylocichla mustelina (Wood Thrush) were negatively associated with the amount of living hemlocks and were apparently benefiting from the increased number of dead trees and canopy gaps associated with the adelgid infestation. Acadian Flycatcher nest sites had more living hemlocks and were less impacted by adelgid than random sites. Nest success did not differ by habitat variables. Initially, hemlock decline will negatively impact hemlock specialists while providing habitat for opportunistic species. Some specialist species might persist by shifting habitats, but long-term studies are needed.

During the study a total of 34 territories were found, the majority of which were located in swampy stands, subjected to limited forest management. The species population size in the whole Puszcza Knyszynska forest was estimated at 30-45 pairs (density 3 pairs/100 km2). However, within the areas designated as nature reserves the population density was found to be much higher (3 pairs per 10 km2). The importance of these nature reserves for the Three-toed Wood-pecker can stem from the fact that, despite making up only 3% of the Puszcza Knyszynska area, they contained 13 territories with 38% of all pairs recorded in this forest.

Dauphine, Nico; Tsamajain-Yagkuag, Segundo; Cooper, Robert J.				Ornitologia Neotropical	19		(Supplement)	587-594	2008	2008				English	0	7	Between July 2003 and March 2005 we conducted field research on birds in the Cordillera de Colin in collaboration with two indigenous Aguaruna Jivaro communities in an area previously unexplored by ornithologists, using field surveys, mist net sampling, and interviews with local residents. We detected 315 bird species, including the globally threatened and near-threatened species: Royal Sunangel (Heliangelus regalis), Orange-throated Tanager (Wetmorethraupis sterrhopteron), and Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus coopers). Aguaruna collaborators exhibited substantial knowledge of bird taxonomy, ecology, and behavior. We observed a low rate of deforestation in Aguaruna communities and a high rate of forest clearance in adjacent areas recently colonized by immigrants from elsewhere in Peru. Forest within Aguaruna territories currently appears to be protected from large-scale destruction by existing management practices and a general prohibition on immigration. We expect that extensive deforestation and over-hunting in recently colonized areas elsewhere in the Cordillera de Colin will continue in the absence of effective conservation action. Conservation initiatives by Aguaruna communities include a moratorium on hunting a number of bird species whose populations were perceived to be in decline due to overexploitation, and the designation of a 7000-ha reserve where logging, forest clearance, and human settlement is prohibited. Aguaruna residents of the Cordillera de Colan appear to be motivated conservationists of forest birds, due in part to their concern with long-term forest protection and to the high cultural value traditionally placed on birds.

Lawson, Tina; Goosem, Miriam; Gillieson, David				Pacific Conservation Biology	14	1-2		20-33	2008	2008				English	0	2	GIS and aerial photographic techniques were applied to assessing riparian vegetation quality in an agricultural landscape formerly covered in lowland rainforest. Canopy cover and width of woody riparian vegetation, both easily determined from remotely sensed data, were investigated as indicators of riparian quality. High correlations between field measurements of canopy cover and width of woody riparian vegetation with several other vegetation attributes indicative of vegetation quality (weed abundance, debris, human disturbance, native species richness) demonstrated that these two habitat attributes were suitable field vegetation quality surrogates. Desktop quality analysis combined GIS measurement of riparian width with aerial photographic analysis of canopy cover. Desktop quality equalled field quality in 78% of cases, with a further 13% showing errors due to clearing or thickening of vegetation after aerial photographs were taken. Bird communities in higher vegetation quality areas comprised mainly rainforest-dependent species, whereas poor quality areas mostly supported birds of open habitats. Bird community diversity and rainforest-dependent bird diversity increased significantly both with increasing levels of canopy cover and greater riparian width, but a combination of these factors explained more variance than each factor separately. Desktop riparian vegetation quality therefore proved a satisfactory indicator of habitat quality for birds in rainforest riparian zones. This quick and efficient desktop method of riparian habitat quality assessment can determine conservation values of rainforest riparian areas with minimal field validation, thereby allowing more effective targeting of appropriate management practices, identification of areas of conservation concern and prioritisation of revegetation and rehabilitation efforts.

Salmane, Ineta; Brumelis, Guntis				Pedobiologia	52	1		69-76	2008	2008				English	1	26	The feather moss layer of boreal coniferous forests is known to buffer the underlying soil. temperature and to be a major component in the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles by efficient scavenging of nutrients from throughfall and direct precipitation. Through indirect or direct effects the feather moss layer may also play a significant role in forming soil organism communities. In this 4-year experimental field study, the predatory Gamasina mite diversity was estimated in plots where the feather moss layer was removed or disturbed by turning over, in relation to that in control plots. Species richness, Shannon's diversity and equilabitity in spring but not autumn were decreased when the feather moss layer was removed. Those species that decreased in abundance and frequency tended to prefer the moss layer as opposed to the organic layer in control. plots. The results suggest that the observed decline in diversity of the top carnivore microarthropod guilds was due mainly to a toss of moss habitat and not via changed abiotic conditions in the O horizon.

Orlowski, Grzegorz; Martini, Krzysztof; Martini, Marek				Polish Journal of Ecology	56	3		487-495	2008	2008				English	0	7	The breeding (in 1991-1996) and wintering (1991/1992-1993/1994) avian community were surveyed in a suburban wood (29.27 ha) in Wroclaw city (SW Poland). The 1992 breeding season began together with a drastic clearance of the compact undergrowth with the use of heavy machinery. A slump of abundance of the species nesting on the ground and small shrubs (=1.5 m) followed, coupled with some modifications to their breeding behaviour, such as clustering of several singing males on the remaining bushes (Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla L.) and nesting in the piles of cut branches (Blackbird Turdus merula L.). As a result of the removal of 52% of the whole undergrowth the density of species nesting on the ground and small shrubs in 1992 was by 26% lower than in 1991 (decrease from 61.8 to 46.3 pairs 10 ha-1). After 1993 a spontaneous regeneration of the bushy vegetation took place, with the ground and shrub-nesting species' density recovering to 49.4 pairs 10 ha-1 in 1996. After 1991 the park was colonized by 9 new hole-nester species, which was accompanied by the increase of density of this group (from 21.9 in 1991 to 37.9 pairs 10 ha-1 in 1996). Throughout the entire study period a slight rise of density of birds nesting in tree canopies was visible (21.3 pairs 10 ha-1 in 1991 and 33.8 pairs 10 ha-1 in 1996). A year after the shrub clearance the wintering bird abundance was significantly lower (half of the previous numbers), with plant-eaters and insectivores hardest hit, especially Great Tit Parus major L. (average number of inidividuals per one count amounted to 59.2 in 1991/1992 and 21.9 in 1992/1993) and Blue Tit Parus caeruleus L. (respectively 37.0 and 16.0 ind.). An adequate timetable of vegetation clearance must be set up in the course of any decision-making process regarding green areas management to ensure the environmental issues are addressed properly.

The birds were monitored by means of the listening points technique, in points of 50 metres' radius scattered in an altitude gradient. The bird community was expressed in terms of Species richness, Abundance and Shannon's Diversity Index. 81 species were contacted, 10 of which are included in Annex I of the Birds directive. Bird population in the examined area includes a good number of nestling species (63 overall), representative of Alpine bird species in the north-western area. Some species are particularly interesting from a wildlife-ecological viewpoint, since they are rare or because of their small population in the regional and/or national territory (royal eagle, ptarmigan, rock partridge, black grouse, chough, etc.). For the protection of local bird species, though there were no particularly critical situations, our recommendation is that monitoring should be repeated over time and a series of management measures should be followed.

Purcell, Kathryn L.; Verner, Jared				U S Forest Service General Technical Report PSW	217			279-291	2008	2008				English	0	5	Detailed information about the nesting habitats of birds, including those needed for successful nesting, can provide a better understanding of the ecological factors that permit coexistence of different species and may aid in conservation efforts. From 1989 through 1994, we studied the nesting habitat of secondary cavity-nesting birds in oak woodlands at the San Joaquin Experimental Range, Madera County, CA. We measured habitat surrounding nests and examined similarities and differences in nesting habitat used by eight species to evaluate overlap in nesting habitat use and possible competition. Nesting habitat of Bewick's Wrens (Thryomanes bewickii) was unique among the species studied. Their nests were the lowest and located in the densest habitat on the steepest slopes where interior live oaks (Quercus wislizenii) were abundant. Nesting habitat was similar among European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), and Violet-green Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). These species all nested in open areas with the highest density of blue oaks (Quercus douglasii), the lowest densities of live oaks and snags, and the lowest basal area of trees. Nests of White-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis) were similar to the above three species, differing only in being lower compared to nests of European Starlings. Ash-throated Flycatcher (Myiarchus cinerascens) nesting habitat was characterized by dense stands of trees with a high density of live oaks and snags. Oak Titmouse (Baeolophus inornatus) nests were low and located in high-density stands of live oaks on steep slopes. House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) nested in dense stands of trees. Successful Ash-throated Flycatcher and Oak Titmouse nests had higher basal area of live trees compared to unsuccessful nests and, compared to other species, habitat surrounding their nests had high basal area. European Starling nests were highest, and nests located high in trees had higher nest survival. Consequently, these three species tended to select nest sites in habitats where they had higher nest success. We recommend management activities that maintain habitat diversity, including areas that differ in tree species composition and density, to promote species diversity.

Bidlack, Allison L.; Merenlender, Adina; Getz, Wayne M.				U S Forest Service General Technical Report PSW	217			541-548	2008	2008				English	0	5	European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were introduced into lowland California in the 1880s for fur farming and hunting. The introduced foxes quickly spread throughout much of the state and have been implicated in the decline of several federally threatened and endangered ground-nesting bird species. Red foxes have been present in the East Bay for 25 to 30 years and they are regularly sighted in coastal wetlands and in the Oakland and Berkeley hills. We were interested in documenting the extent of the invasion away from human-dominated habitats into oak woodlands in the East Bay, as foxes may negatively impact both prey populations and native carnivores such as gray foxes. We surveyed fire roads and hiking trails in core oak woodland sites in Contra Costa and Alameda counties for carnivore scat. All scat samples were collected, and their locations entered into a GIS. To positively distinguish the scat to species, DNA was extracted, amplified, and identified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) testing. Four carnivore species were identified, including coyote, gray fox, red fox, and bobcat. Red foxes were only detected in woodlands that were adjacent to urban or suburban development, and were not detected in more rural sites. They may be dependent on human-dominated systems for resources and cover, and the high numbers of coyotes present in the East Bay may be excluding them from some areas. This research is providing managers essential information about red fox distribution, habitat requirements, and interactions with other carnivores, which can be used to better monitor and eventually control red fox invasions and subsequent impacts to native species.

Brooks, William B.; Dean, Tylan				Waterbirds	31		Special Publication 1	50-59	2008	2008				English	0	9	In 1984, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the U.S. breeding population of Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) in their known range of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama as "endangered" under the Endangered Species Act, due to a population decline of 75 percent from the 1930s to the 1980s. In 1997, an updated Recovery Plan for the Wood Stork established two metrics to for determining the biological status: numbers of nesting pairs and regional productivity measured over time. Five-year averages of nesting pairs from annual aerial surveys show an increasing trend (1981-85, 1991-95, 2001-2005). Since listing in 1984, the average number of active colonies has almost doubled, however colony size has decreased. Current productivity estimates are similar to those recorded in the 1970s and 1980s. Monitoring continues to indicate that nesting numbers and productivity rates are variable within and among years and within and among colonies. Variability is likely related to environmental factors affecting the quality of local and regional nesting and foraging habitats. Loss of natural foraging habitat continues to be a major threat, while the effects of the increasing number of constructed wetlands and their use as foraging areas is unknown. Habitat Management Guidelines are being updated and will address: managing colony sites, controlling predation and human disturbance, and core foraging habitat issues. One of the most important initiatives is the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), which has identifies the restoration of healthy wading bird populations as an expected benefit. It is anticipated that CERP will be a large contributing factor toward the recovery of this species.

Legge, Sarah; Murphy, Stephen; Heathcote, Joanne; Flaxman, Emma; Augusteyn, John; Crossman, Marnie				Wildlife Research	35	1		33-43	2008	2008				English	0	28	We report the effects of an extensive (>7000 km2), high-intensity late-dry-season fire in the central Kimberley, Western Australia, on the species richness and abundance of mammals, reptiles and birds. Five weeks after the fire we surveyed 12 sites (six burnt, six unburnt); each pair of sites was closely matched for soil type and vegetation. The species richness and abundance of mammals and reptiles was greater at unburnt sites, especially for mammals (with a 4-fold difference in abundance between burnt and unburnt sites). There was an indication that reptiles immigrated into unburnt patches, but mammals did not. There were also species-specific responses to the fire: Rattus tunneyi and Pseudomys nanus were much more abundant in unburnt sites, whereas Pseudomys delicatulus was caught in equal numbers at burnt and unburnt sites. Diurnal reptiles were more abundant at unburnt sites, but nocturnal reptiles were equally common at burnt and unburnt sites. Avian species richness and overall abundance was similar between burnt and unburnt patches, although a few species showed preferences for one state or the other. The overall high trapping success for mammals (18% across all sites; 28% in unburnt patches) contrasts with the well documented mammal collapse in parts of northern Australia and seems paradoxical given that our study area has experienced the same increase in fire frequency and extent that is often blamed for species collapse. However, our study area has fewer pressures from other sources, including grazing by large herbivores, suggesting that the effects of these pressures, and their interaction with fire, may have been underestimated in previous studies.

Vergara, Pablo M.; Schlatter, Roberto P.				Wildlife Research	35	2		134-139	2008	2008				English	0	4	Current legislation in Chile allows two alternative regeneration methods for evergreen forest: heavy shelterwood (retaining 30% of the basal area at the time of regeneration harvest) and strip cutting. We compared bird abundance among four stands: two evergreen forest stands managed with these cutting systems, an undisturbed stand and a light shelterwood stand (with a retention level of 65%). Eight out of 15 species, in addition to total bird abundance, were affected by partial cutting. Light shelterwood tended to be the treatment with the smaller negative effect on bird abundance, reducing the abundance of only two species, possibly due to the loss of the understorey vegetation. Nevertheless, the abundance of three species of trunk and foliage gleaners, as well as total bird abundance, decreased only in the heavy shelterwood and the strip cut stands. Further, the abundance of trunk and foliage gleaners was greater in the light shelterwood stand than in the other cutting stands, indicating that these species are particularly sensitive to partial cutting with low retention levels. Therefore, in order to reduce the detrimental effect of partial cutting systems on the evergreen forest birds, we suggest the use of shelterwood cutting with a retention level higher than 50% of the standing basal area at the time of the regeneration harvest.

Pabian, Sarah E.; Brittingham, Margaret C.				Ecological Applications	17	8		2184-2194	December 2007	2007				English	2	24	Studies in Europe have reported negative effects of acid deposition on forest birds, and research in North America has identified links between forest bird abundance and rates of acid deposition. We examined the bird community in an acidified forest in central Pennsylvania (USA) and evaluated the effects of terrestrial lime application on birds. We used a before-after control-impact (BACI) study design, with one year of observation before (2003) and three years after lime application (2004, 2005, and 2006). Between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons, 4500 kg/ha of dolomitic lime were applied to two of four 100- ha watersheds. Each year, we monitored bird abundance and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) eggshell thickness and territory size. Soil and snail abundance data were also collected. The bird community and territory size results indicated that the study area may be providing low-quality habitat for forest birds, perhaps as a result of acid deposition. We found lower forest bird abundances than have been found in less acidified areas of Pennsylvania, and larger Ovenbird territory sizes than have been found in other studies. We found a significant positive relationship between soil calcium and bird abundance, indicating that soil calcium may affect bird abundance. Liming increased soil calcium and pH and led to increased snail and bird abundances. After liming, bird abundance was positively related to snail abundance. No significant changes occurred in Ovenbird territory size or eggshell thickness. Our results suggest that acid deposition could be responsible for reduced bird abundance, and that liming is a potential mitigation technique.

Rosenvald, R.; Lohmus, A.				Forestry (Oxford)	80	5		502-515	December 2007	2007				English	0	14	The variability of natural disturbance regimes implies that retention cutting, aimed at emulating natural disturbances to support biodiversity, should be forest-type specific. We explored in four site types (ranging from dry nutrient-poor to wet nutrient-rich) in Estonia how the retention of live and dead trees affects post-cut abundance and species richness of birds. The whole bird communities and harvest-sensitive species groups responded differently: while the total abundance and relative species richness of birds increased along with the abundance of dead trees, the species of national conservation concern occurred more frequently at higher densities of live trees. Hence, although the species of conservation concern and hole-nesters preferred the cuts having the generally densest and most species-rich avian communities, this co-variation was obviously insufficient for using the total community characteristics (particularly density) as indicators of forestry impacts on bird biodiversity. In contrast to expectations, tree retention always influenced birds independently of forest type. This may be related to the particular study system (notably low retention levels) but future studies should nevertheless explicitly address to what extent forest species are adapted to natural disturbances, and in which cases that knowledge can be used for forestry planning.

Ian				Journal of Applied Ecology	44	6		1200-1208	December 2007	2007				English	2	32	Agri-environment schemes (AESs) are designed to create landscape-scale improvements in biodiversity. While the specific aims of AESs do not always include the enhancement of species of conservation concern, associated conservation strategies, such as the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, often rest on the assumption that AESs enhance environmental conditions and thereby improve the conservation status of target species. However, there is little evidence for the general efficacy of AESs in this respect.To evaluate the effects of the Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) scheme, a widespread AES in Northern Ireland, a spotlight survey of the relative abundance of three mammal species, Irish hare Lepus timidus hibernicus, European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and red fox Vulpes vulpes, was conducted. Of these, the Irish hare is a priority species for conservation action and the focus of a species action plan, while rabbit and fox are commonly considered agricultural pests. The effects of ESA designation and habitat on each species were assessed at 150 ESA and 50 non-ESA sites, matched for landscape characteristics. The ESA scheme had no demonstrable effect on the abundance of Irish hares, and this agri-environment scheme did not target the landscape and habitat variables associated with hares.In contrast, the abundance of rabbits and foxes was significantly greater within ESAs than the wider countryside. Agricultural factors such as reduced livestock stocking density, reduced overgrazing and field boundary enhancements may create more favourable conditions for both species. Aside from the implications for farm economics, the proliferation of rabbit populations within conservation areas may raise issues concerning the grazing of important plant communities, while increases in fox populations may adversely affect ground-nesting birds and other animal species of conservation concern.Synthesis and applications. The abundance of rabbits and foxes corroborates recent work that suggests AESs may benefit common species but can not be relied upon to encourage rarer species. The Irish hare species action plan relies on agri-environment schemes to enhance the species' status and realize the target of increasing the hare population by 2010 by promoting suitable habitat. However, the ESA scheme is unlikely to help in achieving these objectives. Targeted and evidence-based agri-environment prescriptions are clearly required in order to ensure the realization of species-specific conservation targets.

Lindenmayer, David B.; Cunningham, Ross; Crane, Mason; Machael, Damian; Montague-Drake, Rebecca				Landscape Ecology	22	10		1555-1562	December 2007	2007				English	0	16	Despite increasing revegetation of cleared landscapes around the world, there is limited research on the implications of different types of plantings for birdlife. We examined the ''intersection effect'', whereby species richness is higher at the intersection of ''corridors'' or vegetation strips for birds inhabiting replanted areas. We also examined individual species responses. Replicated sites at the intersections of plantings were compared with ''internal controls'' (located in the same plantings *100 m from intersections), ''external controls''(sites in isolated linear plantings), and block plantings. We surveyed the 39 sites in our experimental design repeatedly [long dash] on different days by different observers and in different seasons. We found no significant difference in species richness between intersections and block plantings, but intersections had higher species richness than isolated linear strips and the internal controls. Similar results were found for bird assemblage scores derived by correspondence analysis. We found evidence of extra-variation at the farm-level for species richness and derived assemblage scores, suggesting a farm-scale response. This suggests the importance of other (often unmeasured) factors at the farm level (e.g. baiting for feral animals). Our results suggest that replanting programs aimed at maximizing bird species richness may benefit from consideration of planting geometry. In particular, linking strip plantings to create intersections and/or establishing block plantings appear to be superior to isolated strips for aggregate species richness.

Francisco, Mercival R.; Gibbs, H. Lisle; Galetti, Mauro; Lunardi, Vitor O.; Galetti Junior, Pedro M.				Molecular Ecology	16	23		4908-4918	December 2007	2007				English	2	26	Determining the genetic structure of tropical bird populations is important for assessing potential genetic effects of future habitat fragmentation and for testing hypotheses about evolutionary mechanisms promoting diversification. Here we used 10 microsatellite DNA loci to describe levels of genetic differentiation for five populations of the lek-mating blue manakin (Chiroxiphia caudata), sampled along a 414-km transect within the largest remaining continuous tract of the highly endangered Atlantic Forest habitat in southeast Brazil. We found small but significant levels of differentiation between most populations. FST values varied from 0.0 to 0.023 (overall FST = 0.012) that conformed to a strong isolation by distance relationship, suggesting that observed levels of differentiation are a result of migration-drift equilibrium. Nem values estimated using a coalescent-based method were small (= 2 migrants per generation) and close to the minimum level required to maintain genetic similarity between populations. An implication of these results is that if future habitat fragmentation reduces dispersal between populations to even a small extent, then individual populations may undergo a loss of genetic diversity due to an increase in the relative importance of drift, since inbreeding effective population sizes are relatively small (Ne [approximately]1000). Our findings also demonstrate that population structuring can occur in a tropical bird in continuous habitat in the absence of geographical barriers possibly due to behavioural features of the species.

Schoedl, Michael				Ornithologischer Anzeiger	46	2-3		121-128	Dezember 2007	2007				German	0	0	Little Ringed Plovers rarely breed by rivers in Germany due to loss of habitat and disturbance of gravel banks. Between 2002 and 2004 breeding sites along the river Upper Isar (Bavaria) were protected from recreational disturbance. Parts of big gravel banks were marked off with plastic tapes. These tapes did not deter birds from using these sites for nesting but reduced recreational disturbance. Public information helped gain acceptance of the restrictions. Breeding success in the marked areas was more than 3 times higher in terms of the number of fledglings than in years without special protection. Fewer nests were directly destroyed and there was less disturbance of birds guarding their chicks. Monitoring of the entire river section between the Austrian border and the Sylvenstein Reservoir showed that Little Ringed Plovers bred earlier when gravel banks are so protected. Chicks hatched earlier and the chances of second clutches rose. The breeding success in the protected areas (1.6 km of river course) was significantly higher than in the remaining areas (4.6 km), which are also disturbed, if less intensively. There was however no obvious increase in the population size, which remained more or less constant at between seven to 12 breeding pairs from 1996 to 2006. It remains to be determined whether habitat quality and suitability stayed constant in spite of floods in 1999 and 2005 or whether the population is limited by basic mechanisms of territoriality.

Restoration treatments were designed to create stand structure and composition similar to pre-settlement forests, which were influenced by a frequent fire regime. Overall, avian community composition was changed as a result of the treatments. Cassin's Finch, Chipping Sparrow, and Yellow-rumped Warbler were found at higher densities in treated stands, whereas Mountain Chickadee, Western Tanager, and Red-breasted Nuthatch had higher densities in untreated stands. White-headed Woodpecker and Western Bluebird were only detected in the treated stands. Brown-headed Cowbird showed no response to treatments. We detected changes in the density of four of five foraging guilds in response to restoration treatments. Tree seedeaters, low understory and ground insectivores, and aerial insectivores all increased in density in treated stands. Overall, bark insectivores showed no density response to treatments. Tree foliage insectivore density was lower in treated than in untreated stands. Overall avian density, density of neotropical migrants, and density of some focal species were higher in treated stands. Monitoring should be continued to understand the longer-term (5-10 year) responses of land birds and to guide future forest restoration efforts.

Ants were sampled using pitfall traps in 6 sites for the elevation study and in 2 sites for the tree cover study, representing paired burn and control sites in a ran domized block design. Vegetation and ground cover variables were also sampled to determine how variation in ant populations was correlated with differences in vegetation and ground cover. Ant species richness remained unchanged for all treatments. Tree cover had no significant effect on ant populations. Significantly more ants were trapped after the burn treatment on burn plots. Variation in ant populations was not directly correlated with any of the vegetation or ground cover variables. According to ANOVA and multivariate analyses, elevation had the greatest effect on changes in ant communities, likely due to increased moisture availability Our results suggest that management for conservation of sagebrush-steppe ecosystems in this and similar watersheds should include a range of elevations to ensure maximum ant species diversity.

Wetlands	27	4		794-805	December 2007	2007				English	4	41	Created wetlands and water bodies that have wetland characteristics (old farm ponds) appear to provide many of the habitat attributes of natural systems. To compare the biological and physical characteristics of natural and created wetlands, we evaluated water chemistry and a suite of metrics associated with the plant, macroinvertebrate, and avian assemblages at 12 natural and six created systems in central Oklahoma. The natural wetlands had significantly shallower depths and higher turbidity levels than the created wetlands. Of 43 metrics across the three biotic assemblages, seven were significantly different between the two wetland types. The proportions of hemipteran insects from the family Corixidae and insectivorous bird species were both greater in natural than created wetlands. The proportion of perennial plant species, the proportion of invertebrates in the shredder feeding guild, the number of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Sphaeridae, and dragonfly (ETSD) taxa, the proportion of individuals in the dominant bird taxa, and the proportion of avian edge species were all greater in created wetlands than in natural wetlands. The community similarity (based on Jaccard's similarity index) in the two wetland types was 38% for plants, 56% for macroinvertebrates, and 65% for birds. For some individual metrics, assemblage members had similar attributes (e.g., proportion of omnivorous taxa) although the specific taxa often differed between natural and created wetlands. These differences may influence the performance of certain assessment methods when they are applied to created wetlands.

Birds were surveyed at 10 shrub-steppe sites in the southern Okanagan Valley of British Columbia to examine whether encroachment of pine affected grassland and shrub-steppe birds. Encounter rates did not differ between years and were combined for a total of 4,281 sightings and 80 species. Sites with more ponderosa pine had a greater diversity of birds. Grassland and shrub-steppe birds as a group declined with increasing numbers of trees. Forest and open woodland birds increased in number as did generalist birds. These results support conservation efforts to reduce conifer densities in shrub-steppe habitats to benefit associated declining bird populations.

These species are now common in upland sites as a result of past land use and disruption of fire regimes. We investigated the effect this invasion had on breeding bird diversity in upland mixed pine (Pinus spp.) stands based on 90 point counts conducted in spring 2005. Half of these stands had no water oak or sweetgum (open stands) and half had a minimum of 25% of their basal area as water oak and/or sweetgum (invaded stands). Bird species richness and abundance were 42 and 41 % lower, respectively, in invaded stands. Thirty-five bird species had more than 20 records and were tested for an association with invaded stands. No species were positively associated with invaded stands while 10 were negatively associated with invaded stands; these were mostly grassland pine savanna and shrubland bird species of high conservation value. Invasion of upland pine forest by these native tree species is similar to invasion by exotic species, and appears to disrupt ecosystem function causing declines in bird diversity.

Biodiversity and Conservation	16	12		3287-3300	November 2007	2007				English	0	14	Breeding bird communities in burnt and unburnt residual pinewoods were studied over 3 years by line-transect method, following a catastrophic fire event in Castelfusano (Rome, Central Italy; July 2000). We applied bootstrap procedures to evaluate whether the observed data were true or just produced by chance, and then examined the emerging patterns at three levels: community, guild and species levels. At the community level, fire acted on breeding bird communities by altering especially the total abundance patterns: the species abundance decreased in the burnt pinewood compared to the residual one, but other parameters were not significantly affected by fire. As a consequence of fire, the destruction and structural simplification of the canopy and shrubby component, as well as the increase of edge habitat and patchiness at landscape scale, induced a turnover in species between pinewoods. Species turnover was higher at the burnt than at the residual pinewoods, during all the 3 years of study. At the guild level, the forest species decreased strongly in terms of richness and abundance in the burnt pinewoods, contrary to the edge and open habitat species which increased in terms of richness, abundance and evenness. Edge species showed the highest turnover in burnt pinewood during the whole period of study. At species level, after an a priori subdivision (based on bibliographic search) of the various species in two ecological guilds (forest versus edge species), it was found that an a posteriori statistical analysis confirmed the expected trend, i.e. that the species which decreased significantly in burnt pinewood were essentially the forest species, whereas the species which increased were essentially the edge/open habitat ones. Overall, in order to investigate the effects of fire catastrophes on birds, the guild approach seems more exhaustive than the taxonomic community approach, where intrinsic confounding trends are present.

Grundel, Ralph; Pavlovic, Noel B.				Condor	109	4		734-749	November 2007	2007				English	0	10	Oak savannas were historically common but are currently rare in the Midwestern United States. We assessed possible associations of bird species with savannas and other threatened habitats in the region by relating fire frequency and vegetation characteristics to seasonal densities of 72 bird species distributed across an open-forest gradient in northwestern Indiana. About one-third of the species did not exhibit statistically significant relationships with any combination of seven vegetation characteristics that included vegetation cover in Five vertical strata, dead tree density, and tree height. For 40% of the remaining species, models best predicting species density incorporated tree density. Therefore, management based solely on manipulating tree density may not be an adequate strategy for managing bird populations along this open-forest gradient. Few species exhibited sharp peaks in predicted density under habitat conditions expected in restored savannas, suggesting that few savanna specialists occur among Midwestern bird species. When fire frequency, measured over fifteen years, was added to vegetation characteristics as a predictor of species density, it was incorporated into models for about one-quarter of species, suggesting that fire may modify habitat characteristics in ways that are important for birds but not captured by the structural habitat variables measured. Among those species, similar numbers had peaks in predicted density at low, intermediate, or high fire frequency. For species suggested by previous studies to have a preference for oak savannas along the open-forest gradient, estimated density was maximized at an average fire return interval of about one fire every three years.

Wesolowski, Tomasz				Ibis	149		(Suppl 2)	64-77	November 2007	2007				English	1	9	In this paper 1 argue that prehistoric British forests and their avifauna were similar to those persisting in a near-primeval condition in the Bialowieza Forest (Polish/Belarussian border). Therefore, observations in the Bialowieza Forest may serve as a baseline against which effects of changes in the British woods can be assessed. The results of long-term (30 years) studies of the breeding birds in the Bialowieza National Park are summarized. They reveal that the local avifauna shows some features (high species richness, low population densities, high nest predation and low production of young) regarded as typical for undisturbed tropical forests. It is proposed that high productivity, high population densities and sedentary habits found in many British populations are to a large extent a recent phenomenon, due to forest fragmentation, reduction of predator diversity and changes in forest structure. The necessity to preserve the whole Bialowieza Forest - currently seriously threatened by ongoing logging - as a benchmark for future biological studies is underlined.

Dolman, P.M.; Hinsley, S.A.; Bellamy, P.E.; Watts, K.				Ibis	149		(Suppl 2)	146-160	November 2007	2007				English	2	35	Habitat creation and management within wooded networks is a potentially effective strategy to reduce ecological isolation and the deleterious effects of fragmentation. However, questions remain over the relative advantages of different approaches, e.g. buffering patches vs. increasing connectivity. Potential effects of woodland fragmentation include reduction in regional woodland cover, reduced patch size, edge effects with loss of core habitat, and increased isolation with disruption of dispersal and metapopulation dynamics. We adopt an evidence-based approach to review how each of these affects woodland birds with an emphasis on studies from the UK and use this to identify management priorities for mitigation. There is evidence for both patch area and composition effects: larger woodlands support more woodland bird species, and woods located within sparsely wooded landscapes are less valuable to specialist woodland species. Bird assemblages show a nested pattern with respect to area, and thus species found in small woods also occur in large woods but not vice versa. However, small woods may be preferred by a few edge species, while small woods also have greater variability in bird species composition. Consideration of the metapopulation dynamics of specialist species with poor dispersal shows that creating or buffering large woodlands is more efficient than a greater total area of small fragments. Connectivity appears most useful for widespread generalist species with almost continuous populations. Woodland structure and quality are of overwhelming importance: as well as mature woodland, young growth, scrub and edges are also key components. There is an urgent need to examine the relationship between nest predation and landscape structure within UK woodlands.

Smiley, Peter C.; Maul, Jonathan D.; Cooper, Charles M.				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	122	2		149-156	October 2007	2007				English	2	14	Riparian zones and agricultural fields adjacent to incised streams in northwestern Mississippi are impacted by gully erosion initiated by runoff flowing over unstable streambanks. Currently, installation of erosion control structures (drop pipes) at the riparian zone-agricultural field interface halts gully erosion and simultaneously establishes one of four riparian habitat types. Avian communities were compared among four types of restored habitats and among four seasonal periods in northwestern Mississippi from June 1994 to May 1996. Fifty-seven species were observed among riparian habitats, of which 49% were neotropical migrants. Habitat type and season significantly affected species richness, abundance, and diversity. Species richness, abundance, and diversity increased as habitat area, pool volume, and vertical structure of woody vegetation increased among riparian habitat types. Additionally, species richness, abundance, and diversity increased during spring and fall. The influence of habitat type on avian species richness, abundance, and diversity did not differ among seasons. Present drop pipe installation practices focus on erosion control without consideration of habitat creation. Installation practices can be altered to more effectively incorporate habitat creation to provide the greatest ecological benefits for avian communities within impacted riparian zones.

Mander, Lucas; Cutts, Nicholas D.; Allen, James; Mazik, Krysia				Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science	75	1-2		163-174	October 2007	2007				English	2	31	The term coastal squeeze has been used to describe the process whereby hard flood defences in areas subjected to relative sea level rise constrain the ability of an estuarine system to respond naturally, thus leading to a loss of intertidal habitat, with an associated potential reduction in the carrying capacity of the estuarine system for fish and bird populations. The process of coastal squeeze, coupled with the long-term effects of climate change, has generated the need to create or restore intertidal habitats in estuaries. In Humber Estuary (UK) it is estimated that over 700 hectares of intertidal habitat will be lost due to coastal squeeze and rising sea levels over the next 50 years. In order to address this net loss, a process known as 'managed realignment' has been employed as an estuarine habitat management tool, whereby sections of flood defences are moved inland to create or restore intertidal habitat and offset potential losses in carrying capacity. On the Humber, the Paull Holme Strays site, to the east of Hull, has been the first managed realignment site on the estuary to become operational. The site at Paull Holme Strays was breached in September 2003 creating approximately 80 hectares of intertidal habitat. In order to assess the development of the waterbird assemblage at the Paull Holme Strays site, and ultimately the success of the habitat creation technique, monthly ornithological surveys were undertaken in the newly created habitat and on the mudflat fronting the managed realignment site. The analysis of avifaunal usage data at Paull Holme Strays has demonstrated that within 3 years of creation, the new intertidal habitat is capable of supporting at low water, a functional waterbird assemblage of similar composition to that of adjacent existing intertidal areas. At Paull Holme Strays, this has been achieved with little ongoing management of new habitats.

Iida, Tomohiko; Iida, Shigeru; Mohri, Takayuki; Inoue, Susumu				Japanese Journal of Ornithology	56	2		141-156	October 2007	2007				Japanese	0	1	Long-term monitoring of the Mountain Hawk Eagle Spizaetus nipalensis since the early 1980s has shown that its breeding success in various parts of Japan has rapidly decreased in recent years. We examined if any changes in forest vegetation within the eagle home ranges caused this reduced breeding success. The breeding success of three pairs of S. nipalensis in western Hiroshima prefecture was monitored from 1981 to 2005. The presumed environmental factors responsible for breeding success such as vegetation structure, abundance of major avian and mammalian prey, incidence of direct human disturbance, age of pairs, weather conditions, and aggravation of the nesting environment were also monitored. Two of the three pairs exhibited a great reduction in breeding success after the late 1980s. Their low reproductive successes were associated with significant changes in forest vegetation such as an increase in old-aged conifer plantations and a decrease in deciduous forests and young conifer plantations. The third pair of S. nipalensis did not show any marked reduction in breeding success; however, forest vegetation within their home range did not change significantly and was consistently predominated by deciduous forest. Though the forest vegetation within a pair home range shifted from a predominantly young conifer plantation to an old well-grown one, breeding success for that pair did not fall appreciably. This was probably due to greater prey abundance in the appropriately managed forest. A conifer plantation well managed by thinning, pruning and tending would not only support prey population, but would also provide appropriate hunting grounds for S. nipalensis. To improve breeding success, we propose that at least 400 ha of suitable forest vegetation should be sustained for every breeding pair by conducting management practices that ensure well groomed artificial forests.

Bouwman, Henk; Hoffman, Retha				Ostrich	78	3		591-608	October 2007	2007				English	0	11	Considering the frequent nature of fires and resultant drastic change in habitat following fire, research on the effects of fire on birds in the grasslands of South Africa is surprisingly scarce. For at least five months after burns we followed the changes in bird species composition, species richness and densities of two controlled burns and one accidental fire at the Barberspan Nature Reserve in grasslands that had not been burned or grazed in 10 years. Compared with the control areas, species richness and densities increased in the burned areas immediately following the burns, with more species and birds recruited to the burned areas than were lost. Immediate post-burn opportunists tended to be larger species, and the biomass increase mirrored the increases in species richness and densities in burned areas. Avian species richness, densities and biomass tended to return to the initial conditions after a number of months. Although the bird communities from two controlled-burns differed before the burns, they converged to a characteristic immediate post-burn composition. Five months after the burns however, the bird communities reflected a pre-burn composition. Indications were that birds in an area larger than that burned were affected. Mosaic burning, with shifting large and small patches, should be considered on a landscape scale.

Malan, G.; Meyer, E.; Panagos, M.D.				South African Journal of Wildlife Research	37	2		159-178	October 2007	2007				English	0	12	The study compared plant and avian diversity and species composition between four habitats to review the potential implications of two distinct management practices on a forestry estate, namely to rehabilitate riparian zones to grasslands or woodlands as the two habitats that historically occurred on the property. The study habitats were Plantation (Pinus trees in riparian zone), Bushland (recently harvested), Grassland (cleared of broadleaf plants), and Woodland (control). At seven sampling sites per habitat, a vegetation assessment was conducted, while birds were caught with mist nests. Plant species richness increased from Plantation to Woodland, whereas most bird species and individuals were found in Bushland. Plant and bird species composition differed significantly between habitats. Bushland and Grassland birds were closely associated with exotic forbs. Grassland attracted birds with diverse habitat and nesting-site associations, and Woodland birds associated with woody plants. It is recommended that the majority of riparian zones be managed as grasslands, although the exact affect of the biennial summer burning and presence of exotic plants on birds needs to be investigated. To attract cavity-nesting birds to the Estate, some suitable riparian zones should be rehabilitated to Woodland by planting Ficus and Acacia trees, as these trees are the most abundant and frequently occurring in this habitat. Rather than manage avian diversity per se, the African stonechat in Grassland and lesser honeyguide in Woodland can be employed as indicators of the rehabilitation state of the riparian zones.

Kavanagh, Rodney P.; Stanton, Matthew A.; Herring, Matthew W.				Austral Ecology	32	6		635-650	September 2007	2007				English	2	26	Most of the original forest and woodland cover on the western slopes of New South Wales and the northern plains of Victoria has been cleared for agriculture (wheat, sheep and cattle) and what remains is highly fragmented and modified by a long history of disturbance. Over the past three decades, native eucalypt trees and shrubs have been planted extensively in a part of this region to provide a range of environmental benefits. Our aim was to determine the extent to which these plantings could improve biological diversity in agricultural landscapes in south-eastern Australia and to identify the variables influencing their effectiveness. We sampled birds at 120 sites encompassing the range of available patch sizes, stand ages, floristic and structural conditions, and habitat attributes for revegetated areas and remnants of native vegetation, and we compared these to nearby paddocks. Eucalypt plantings were found to provide significant improvements in bird population density compared with cleared or sparsely treed paddocks, and mixed eucalypt and shrub plantings had similar bird communities to remnant native forest and woodland in the region. Birds displayed a strong response to patch size, with both larger (>=5-20 ha) eucalypt plantings and larger (>=5-20 ha) remnants having more species and more individuals per unit area than smaller (<5 ha) patches of these vegetation types. Older (10-25 years) plantings had more bird species and individuals than young (<10 years) plantings. The distance from remnant forest and woodland (habitat connectivity) appeared to be an important variable influencing bird species richness in eucalypt plantings. The main differences were due to the greater numbers of species classified as woodland-dependent in the larger-sized patches of plantings and remnants. Eucalypt plantings provided useful habitat for at least 10 declining woodland-dependent species, notably for the Speckled Warbler, Red-capped Robin and Rufous Whistler. The Brown Treecreeper and Dusky Woodswallow appeared to be the species most limited by the extent of remnant forest and woodland in the region. Plantings of all shapes and sizes, especially those larger than 5 ha, have an important role to play in providing habitat for many bird species. Restoration efforts are more likely to be successful if eucalypt plantings are established near existing remnant vegetation.

Michigan, the earliest record of Sharp-tailed Grouse was in 1904 from Isle Royale. Over the next 40 years Sharp- tailed Grouse populations increased in the Upper Peninsula as openland habitat increased in extent and area following the Great Cutover. This paper compiles Annual Narrative Reports from Seney National Wildlife Refuge and the author's personal observations of Sharp-tailed Grouse in and around Schoolcraft County, Michigan. The observed rise and fall of the Sharp-tailed Grouse population is placed in historical context and linked with the amount of open land in the area and past habitat management actions. Appropriate habitat management on both state and federal lands is called for if Sharp-tailed Grouse are to be maintained in the future in and around Seney National Wildlife Refuge.	Corace, R.

Goldsmith, Steven; Gillespie, Hayley; Weatherby, Cole				Southwestern Naturalist	52	3		356-363	September 2007	2007				English	2	10	Reforestation of degraded lands in the tropics is one of the most important goals of ecological restoration. Restoration of montane wet forest is in progress at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hawaii, using plantations of Acacia koa (koa), a canopy tree of montane wet forest. We used longhorned beetles (Plagithmysus claviger and P. varians) as indicator species to assess restoration. The beetles feed by boring into dead koa branches and are food for the endemic forest bird Hemignathus munroi. We quantified density of beetles in branches of koa from trees of 3 age categories: young plantations (3-8 y; 222 branches), older plantations (12-15 y; 212 branches), and canopy trees of intact forest (167 branches). We sampled by breaking dead branches into short pieces and counting the beetles within. Density of beetles was greater in canopy trees (4.89 beetles/branch) than in planted trees and was greater in older plantations (3.24 beetles/branch) than in younger plantations (0.90 beetles/ branch). Beetles were clumped in distribution among branches (coefficient of dispersion = 5.17). Mean basal diameter of branches in canopy trees (32.6 mm) was greater than in planted trees and was greater in older plantations (29.3 mm) than in young plantations (19.0 mm). In young and older plantations, branches that harbored beetles were larger than branches that did not, but in canopy trees there was no difference. Branch diameter had a positive effect on number of beetles per branch in all age categories. Koa plantations promote recovery of plant and animal biological diversity in degraded habitats formerly occupied by montane wet forest.

Goldsmith, Steven				Southwestern Naturalist	52	3		364-370	September 2007	2007				English	2	10	Elevation has strong effects on climate and biota. In Hawaii, elevation on volcanic mountains affects temperature, rainfall, vegetation, and fauna. The effect of elevation on animal distribution and abundance can be direct through effects on climate or, in the case of phytophagous insects, indirectly mediated through climatic effects on host plants. In montane wet forests dominated by Metrosideros polymorpha (ohia lehua) and Acacia koa (koa), longhorned wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae, Plagithmysus) play an important role as decomposers of wood and as food for higher trophic levels. The beetles I studied feed exclusively on dead wood of koa. I assessed the effect of elevation on the density of longhorned beetles in plantations of koa at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hawaii. Density per branch of longhorned beetles was more than twice as great in the low-elevation sample (1,620-1,650 m; 3.49 beetles/branch, n = 200) as in the high-elevation sample (1,8801,970 m; 1.61 beetles/branch, n = 200; t = 5.08, P 0.001). Beetles were contagiously distributed among branches at both low and high elevations (CD = 5.71). Size of branch had a consistent positive effect on density of beetles, although this effect was more pronounced at low elevation. Elevation affects biological diversity directly through climate and seasonality, and indirectly through climatic effects on key habitat features. Effects of seasonality and habitat features on longhorned beetles need further study in Hawaiian montane forest.

Because habitat management historically has been focused on the marsh, this study was initiated to determine the effects of spring burning on abundance and species richness of grassland-nesting birds. The effects of years since last bum and location on abundance and species richness were inconsistent among years. Unless additional bird surveys show consistent patterns in bird response to burning, frequency of bums will be determined based on vegetation characteristics rather than abundance of nesting birds.

Archaux, Frederic; Bakkaus, Noemie				Forest Ecology and Management	247	1-3		72-79	August 15 2007	2007				English	0	12	To recommend forestry practices favourable to birds, we estimated the relative importance of stand structure (mean tree height, overstory and understory cover), stand composition (from pure conifer or broadleaved to mixed conifer-broadleaf stands) and climate (altitude, aspect) on mountain forest birds (Mont-Ventoux, southern French Alps and Giffre valley, northern French Alps). Studies were conducted on species richness in forest birds (separated into species preferring broadleaves, preferring conifers or indifferent) and in cavity nesters. Climate, structure and composition had roughly equivalent weights on mountain forest birds, but their relative importance depended on the species group. Due to very contrasted climatic conditions, bird communities were the richest at low elevations in the northern site and at high elevations in the southern site. The richness of many ecological groups increased log-linearly with mean tree height; however, a decrease was observed for certain ecological groups at the northern site for a tree height above ca. 20-25 m. Mixed conifer-broadleaf stands (Holm Oak, Downy Oak or Beech mixed with Scots or Laricio Pines on Mont-Ventoux; Beech or Beech with other broadleaves mixed with Spruce in the Giffre valley) did not have higher bird richness than pure stands. The negative impact of broadleaf presence on birds preferring conifers was not compensated for (Giffre valley), or barely so (Mont-Ventoux), by a corresponding positive impact on birds preferring broadleaves. Conifers do not appear to systematically support poorer bird communities than broadleaves; therefore, juxtaposing pure stands of different trees may be more sensible than insisting on mixed stands if such stands are hard to manage. Furthermore, the introduced Laricio Pine stands supported bird communities as rich as native Scots Pine stands on Mont-Ventoux.

The site was surrounded by water of a mean depth of 20-50 cm. Nests were lined with dead Tamarix twigs, some were concealed below dead tree trunks and others were in old Lesser Flamingo Phoeniconaias minor nests. Breeding was not synchronised: we observed eggs being incubated, eggs hatching, nests with chicks, and large chicks accompanying adults. The number of breeding pairs was estimated at 900. Nests contained a total of c.192 chicks and more than 50 large chicks were seen following adults. Previous studies estimated the number of pairs in Aftout at only 100 and no significant breeding had been recorded in the area since the 1970s. The West African population of Caspian Terns has dramatically increased in recent years and is now estimated at 45,000-60,000 individuals, whereas c.10 years ago there were just c.5,000 pairs.

Greenberg, Cathryn H.; Tomcho, Aimee Livings; Lanham, J. Drew; Waldrop, Thomas A.; Tomcho, Joseph; Phillips, Ross J.; Simon, Dean				Journal of Wildlife Management	71	6		1906-1916	August 2007	2007				English	1	25	We compared the effects of 3 fuel reduction techniques and a control on breeding birds during 2001-2005 using 50-m point counts. Four experimental units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of 3 replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, North Carolina, USA. Treatments were 1) prescribed burn, 2) mechanical understory reduction (chainsaw-felling of shrubs and small trees), 3) mechanical + burn, and 4) controls. We conducted mechanical treatments in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls. Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird species did not detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species richness, total bird density, and some species, including indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year delay; eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus) declined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions, and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open habitat while retaining many forest and generalist species, but may have short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.

Journal of Wildlife Management	71	6		1917-1923	August 2007	2007				English	0	16	Transformations of agricultural practices in the southeastern United States have drastically reduced preexisting quantities of strip-cover habitat along field margins. The National Conservation Buffer Initiative has promoted the establishment of herbaceous field borders to restore wildlife benefits once provided by such habitat. We evaluated effects of native warm-season grass field border establishment and width on winter bird response. Narrow (approx. 8-m) field borders represented a marginal improvement to non-bordered margins that were cropped ditch to ditch, whereas wide (approx. 30-m) borders significantly enhanced total avian conservation value, abundance, species richness, and sparrow abundance compared to non- or narrow borders. Furthermore, presence of wide borders altered bird use of row-crop fields. We observed increased sparrow (Emberizidae) abundances in agricultural fields adjacent to wide borders, which likely resulted from enhanced waste grain foraging opportunities. Given these benefits to wintering farmland birds, we advocate the integration of herbaceous field border habitat in agricultural landscapes, particularly borders of enhanced width.

Benson, Thomas J.; Dinsmore, James J.; Hohman, William L.				Journal of Wildlife Management	71	6		1949-1957	August 2007	2007				English	0	27	Alteration of Iowa, USA, landscapes for agricultural production has resulted in a loss of >99% of the original prairie and >95% of native wetlands. This conversion has included riparian areas, which, as interfaces between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, are important to many wildlife species. Farm Bill programs have resulted in the reestablishment of millions of hectares of grasslands and wetlands nationwide, including >100,000 ha in riparian areas of the Midwest. We assessed plant and arthropod responses to burning and disking of riparian grasslands in east-central Iowa in 2001 and 2002. Burning altered the plant community by removing litter and standing dead vegetation and had negative effects on several arthropod taxa, including Hemiptera and Lepidoptera. However, we observed no differences in vegetation or arthropods between burned and unburned fields during the second year postburning (P > 0.05). Disking decreased the cover of grasses, litter, and standing dead vegetation and increased plant species richness and the cover of forbs and bare ground (P 0.05). Arthropod abundance and dry biomass were greater on disked than undisked portions of fields (P 0.05). Increases in the abundance and biomass of arthropods associated with changes in vegetation structure and composition likely improved habitat quality for a number of breeding bird species. Both burning and disking appear to be effective management options for maintaining or enhancing riparian grasslands for wildlife.

Shahabuddin, Ghazala; Kumar, Raman				Forest Ecology and Management	246	2-3		175-185	July 31 2007	2007				English	0	18	A study was carried out in a tropical scrub forest in India, to investigate the effects of extractive activities such as fodder and firewood collection, on native bird communities and to study the relative influences of altered vegetation composition and structure. The study was based on comparison between six 'disturbed' (extracted) and four 'undisturbed' (non-extracted) sites that were delineated using quantitative disturbance indicators. Birds were sampled seven times over two different seasons utilising the fixed radius point count method. Six different variables related to vegetation structure (canopy cover, basal area, average forest height, tree density, tree height diversity and tree species richness) were quantified, as was tree species composition. There was no significant difference in number of recorded species or bird abundance between disturbed and undisturbed sites. However, bird species diversity was significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Overall, bird species composition also differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Nine of 38 locally abundant bird species (23.6%) showed significant selection for either disturbed or undisturbed habitats. Of these nine species, seven chose undisturbed habitats and two chose disturbed. All seven species adversely affected by disturbance are primarily insectivorous. Canopy cover, tree basal area and height of trees were significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. In both habitats, bird species composition was significantly dependent on these components of altered vegetation structure. Tree species composition was also significantly altered by disturbance in scrub forest. However, altered tree species composition did not significantly affect bird species composition. Partial Mantel's tests confirmed that there were no significant residual effects of tree species composition on bird composition after the effects of vegetation structure were accounted for. Our study indicates that rural biomass extraction can have significant effects upon bird species composition of tropical scrub forest which is caused principally by alteration of vegetation structure, rather than by changes in forest tree composition.

Grundel, Ralph; Pavlovic, Noel B.				Auk	124	3		969-985	July 2007	2007				English	3	27	Oak savannas and woodlands historically covered millions of hectares in the midwestern United States but are rare today. We evaluated the ecological distinctiveness and conservation value of savannas and woodlands by examining bird distributions across a fire-maintained woody-vegetation gradient in northwest Indiana encompassing five habitats-open habitats with low canopy cover, savannas, woodlands, scrublands, and forests-during migration, breeding, and overwintering. Savannas and woodlands were significantly different in overall bird species composition from open and forest habitats but were often intermediate between open and forest in guild densities. Few bird species were consistently and highly concentrated in savannas or woodlands, and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) was the only species significantly more abundant in savannas and woodlands than in open, scrub, and forest habitats. Fire frequency over a 15-year interval was a significant predictor of bird community composition and was positively related to species diversity, spring transient migrant density, and density of the most threatened species. Each habitat type had characteristics potentially important for avian conservation. Scrub had the highest density of transient migrants, which suggests it plays an important role as migration stopover habitat. More species were significantly concentrated in open or forest habitats than in the other habitats. Lack of species concentration and intermediate community composition suggested that birds experienced savannas and woodlands more as ecotones than as habitats distinct from forests or grasslands. However, this intermediate character can benefit conservation, as evidenced by savannas and woodlands having the highest density of the most threatened species along this woody-vegetation gradient.

We found that many of the species' models performed relatively poorly in discriminating between occupied and unoccupied sites, primarily due to the high error of commission rates (false positive predictions). Since species presence and abundance were assessed by single, five-minute point counts, insufficient sampling was at least partly responsible for some of the observed over-prediction. Results suggested that model parameters for at least nine of the species tested (hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), blue-headed vireo (Vireo solitarius), red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus), hermit thrush ( Catharus guttatus), Tennessee warbler (Vermivora peregrina), Blackburnian warbler (Dendroica fusca) and dark-eyed junco (junco hyemalis)) should be reviewed to improve the predictive capability of the models and to ensure appropriate consideration of the habitat needs of these species during forest management planning.

Mac Nally, Ralph; Horrocks, Greg				Journal of Animal Ecology	76	4		643-650	July 2007	2007				English	0	20	1. Habitat structure long has been identified as a primary factor influencing local assemblage composition. Most evidence has been in the form of correlations of species occurrence and assemblage composition over a range of habitats, with experimental verification of relationships being relatively uncommon because of the difficulties of enacting precise manipulations of habitat structure.2. Fallen timber (also known as coarse or large woody debris) is one of the few habitat-structural elements in forests and woodlands that can be manipulated with relatively high precision. We report on manipulations of wood-loads on 30 experimental 1-ha plots in floodplain forests of northern Victoria, Australia, over 4 years (one pre- and three post-manipulation).3. We show that very high wood-loads (80 Mg ha-1) and intermediate wood-loads derived from tree crowns (40 Mg ha-1) increase species richness (all species and ground-foraging species) and numbers of birds (all species and ground-foraging species) relative to the control plots.4. Three bird species consistently increased most following manipulations: white-plumed honeyeater Lichenostomus penicillatus (Gould 1837) (fam. Meliphagidae), brown treecreeper Climacteris picumnus (Temm. & Laug. 1824) (fam. Climacteridae) and yellow rosella Platycercus elegans flaveolus (Gould 1837) (fam. Psittacidae). The honeyeater is not considered as a ground or fallen timber dependent species, while the treecreeper and rosella both are regarded as being dependent on ground-layer structure.5. Fallen timber management needs to be considered in a landscape and temporal context for improving conservation of avian biodiversity.

We used infrared video-monitoring systems to document nest fates of 127 bobwhite nests over 4 nesting seasons from 2002 to 2005 in southern Texas. A majority of depredation events (83%) were caused by 4 species: coyote (Canis latrans), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), southern fire ant (Solenopsis xyloni), and badger (Taxidea taxus). Observed bobwhite nest fates for the study period were 0.50 successful, 0.34 depredated, and 0.16 abandoned or undetermined. A universal approach to mitigating nest predation is not likely to be applicable in regions similar to southern Texas, with high nest-predator diversity (e.g., fire ants, rodents, and mammalian carnivores). We believe that infrared video surveillance is a valuable tool for documenting baseline information on predator context and nest fate for many avian species, considering the limitations of past methods (e.g., postfate evidence).

Salek, Miroslav; Svobodova, Jana; Zasadil, Petr				Acta Ornithologica (Warsaw)	42	1		89-97	Summer 2007	2007				English	0	13	Alterations to riverine ecosystems and the establishment of new man-made habitats along rivers have been accompanied by changes in vegetation composition and structure, which affect the birds inhabiting riparian stands. We examined the differences between bird communities inhabiting the relict growth of river meanders and those inhabiting secondary plantations along the Rivers Otava and Blanice (Czech Republic). In addition, we investigated whether the well-developed oak plantations on artificial fishpond dams, which are common in the studied landscape, might compensate for the loss of bird diversity following river regulation. Breeding bird community and habitat attributes were studied on 30 fixed-width line transects and analysed using Multivariate Redundancy Analysis. Relict meanders were the most structurally diversified habitat type, with the highest species diversity and the great richness of forest birds. In contrast, secondary plantations were the simplest stands with the poorest communities inhabited by more farmland species. Fishpond dams, though resembling the meanders more so than secondary stands, were found to be insufficient compensation for river meanders in regard to avian diversity. Supporting diverse plantations of softwood tree species and widening the narrow belts along river banks are highlighted as ways of managing riparian stands that are beneficial to birds.

Guichon, M. Laura; Cassini, Marcelo H.				Ecologia Austral	17	1		81-87	June 2007	2007				English	1	3	Riparian environments are usually characterized by high biological diversity, however, habitat degradation results from intensive use of the bank and the water course, and exploitation of the surrounding land. The Lujan River basin, located in East-central Argentina, shows two distinct geomorphologic portions: the Pampean and the Deltaic portions, which in turn can be subdivided based on physiographic and land use features. Our objective was to compare riparian wildlife richness among the three zones of the Pampean portion (upper, middle, and lower), and between the two zones of the Deltaic portion (protected and antropic). From March to October 1997, 82 transects were randomly placed along the banks of the Lujan River. We surveyed the presence of coypus, capybara, and Neotropical river otter based on signs of activity, and the presence of water birds (non Passeriformes) based on direct observation. In the Pampean portion, the number of species per transect in the middle zone was significantly lower than in the upper and lower zones. The middle zone is characterized by a narrow alluvial plain associated with more intense use of the land and less availability of water and hydrophilic vegetation in the surrounding habitats than the other two zones. In the Deltaic portion, the protected zone showed a larger species richness than the antropic zone, where intense use of the river and modification of its bank can negatively affect wildlife.

Impacto de diferentes disturbios antropicos sobre las comunidades de aves de bosques y matorrales de Nothofagus antarctica en el NO Patagonico.	Lantschner, Maria V.; Ruschi, Veronica				Ecologia Austral	17	1		99-112	June 2007	2007				Spanish	0	3	To be able to plan productive uses of the land compatible with the conservation of the biodiversity, it is essential to evaluate the changes that they cause. The Andean patagonic forests undergo different anthropogenic disturbances, like fires, grazing, wood extraction and substitution by exotic coniferous plantations. These activities cause changes on the vegetation and animal communities, and could be affecting the functioning of the forest ecosystems. In Argentine Patagonia, there is a growing opposition to productive activities, particularly to pine plantations, because of its supposed negative ecological consequences, however their impacts are unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate in which measure different uses of the vegetation of the basin of Foyel river (NO Argentine Patagonia) cause changes on bird communities, especially on the functionally important and the endangered species. Birds counts were conducted from November 2004 to March 2005 (summer) using the variable circular-plot method, in twenty four sites of Nothofagus antarctica native forests and scrubs with different levels of grazing and wood extraction (closed, semiopened, opened), and in eight exotic plantations of Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus spp. Although, the vegetation structure of each site was characterized, to identify structural elements of the forests that could be important for bird habitat. Population densities of birds did not differ between vegetation types (25.4 [plus or minus] 8.4 individuals/ha) associated to different disturbances. Bird richness and diversity (Shannon Index), however, were different among the vegetation types, in forestations both were similar to the undisturbed vegetation types, whereas they increased in vegetations with a medium intensity of wood extraction and grazing, and were highest in those sites whit a high intensity of wood extraction and grazing. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis and an analysis of species composition similarity showed that there are two differentiated communities: those of the more altered N. antarctica forests (by grazing and wood extraction), dominated by birds of opened areas; and another community in the rest of the vegetation types, dominated by species characteristic of forests. Among the key species for the Andean patagonic forests processes, foliage insectivores (Elaenia albiceps and Aphrastura spinicauda) were not seriously affected by any of the anthropogenic disturbances; ground insectivores (Scelorchilus rubecula and Pteroptochos tarnii) used the coniferous plantations, but not the areas opened by intense wood extraction and grazing; whereas the wood insectivore species (Campephilus magellanicus) was rare in all types of vegetation. Our results suggest that the structure and composition of the forest bird communities is mainly determined by changes in the structure of the vegetation, and not by changes in the floristic composition. The bird community of the coniferous plantations is similar to the community of the original systems. Intensive wood extraction and grazing, however, cause great changes, incorporating some species to the area, but eliminating others that are forest dependent.

John, Jasson R.M.; Kabigumila, Jonathan D.L.				Ostrich	78	2		265-269	June 2007	2007				English	0	6	The nesting bird species in natural forests and Eucalyptus plantations on the Amani Plateau, East Usambara, were studied during the breeding season of September 2003 to March 2004. Some forest birds - like barbets, batis, broadbills, doves, flycatchers, greenbuls, hornbills, and tinkerbirds -utilised similar nest sites with respect to plant species or forest structure in both Eucalyptus plantations and natural forests. Very low densities of nests in Eucalyptus plantations indicate that forest bird species have mostly failed to adapt to this habitat. However, management practices may contribute to the low densities of nests in these plantations. A concerted effort should be made to protect the remaining natural forests and management of the Eucalyptus plantations should take the breeding seasons of local birds into account.

Krook, Krissie; Bond, William J.; Hockey, Phlilip A.R.				Ostrich	78	2		271-279	June 2007	2007				English	2	25	Two distinct grassland types occur within Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP): short stoloniferous grazing lawns and tall, tussocklike 'bunch' grasslands. Grazing lawns are maintained by grazing mammals, among which White Rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum is of major importance. By contrast, tall bunch grasslands are promoted by frequent burning. The extent of each grassland type within the park is highly dynamic and can be altered by changes in mammal numbers and/or fire regimes. Such changes may have cascading consequences for other components of the ecosystem if they show specialisation towards one or other grassland state. This study compared avifaunal assemblages of grazing lawns and bunch grasslands to assess how bird species of the park might change with shifts in the grassland mosaic. Distinct bird communities were associated with each grassland type, including several specialists, and bird distribution was linked to vegetation structure rather than floristics. Post-fire bunch grasslands provided ephemeral habitats for short-grass specialists. Outside HiP, domestic livestock produced structurally-similar grasslands to grazing lawns and bunch grasslands, but heavy predation of birds by people reduced bird densities. Because HiP is surrounded by such communal grazing lands, the park is of key importance in conserving grassland birds on a regional scale, a factor that needs to be considered in managing the park's grassland mosaic.

Saunders, Debbie; Brereton, Raymond; Tzaros, Chris; Holdsworth, Mark; Price, Rob				Pacific Conservation Biology	13	2		111-119	June 2007	2007				English	0	4	Conserving habitat for wide-ranging fauna species provides a challenge because impacts on these species tend to be dismissed based on the assumption that there is sufficient habitat in other areas of its range. This incremental loss of habitat is a serious conservation issue for a diversity of bird species. As knowledge of wide-ranging and migratory bird species increases, it often becomes evident that they select specific sites on a regular basis (i.e., the species exhibit site fidelity). Gaining a better understanding of site fidelity and selective habitat use for wide-ranging species is clearly important, but also extremely challenging. In this paper, challenges associated with conservation of the migratory and wide-ranging Swift Parrot Lathamus discolor are discussed as an example of how a recovery programme has aimed to address such conservation and management challenges. Despite the small population size (less than 2 500 birds), broad distribution (1 250 000 km2) and often cryptic nature, the implementation of the national recovery programme has been successful in the identification and protection of important habitats. This has been made possible by involving large numbers of volunteers who collect long-term sighting and habitat data over large areas, together with more detailed ecological research. This information is then used to inform the conservation assessment process and to improve habitat conservation throughout the range of the species.

Management approaches for grassland birds frequently rely on prescribed burning to maintain habitat in suitable condition. We evaluated the relationships among years since burn, vegetation structure, and overwintering grassland bird abundance in coastal prairie. Le Conte's Sparrows (Ammodramus leconteii) were most common in areas that had: (1) been burned within the previous 2 years, (2) medium density herbaceous vegetation, and (3) sparse shrub densities. Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) were associated with areas: (1) burned within I year, (2) with sparse herbaceous vegetation, and (3) with sparse shrub densities. Sedge Wrens (Cistothorus platensis) were most common in areas that had: (1) burned greater than 2 years prior and (2) dense herbaceous vegetation. Swamp Sparrows (Melospiza georgiana): (1) were most common in areas of dense shrubs, (2) not related to time since burnings, and (3) demonstrated no relationship to herbaceous vegetation densities.

The effects of natural and human-caused disturbance on density of nesting pairs, reproductive success, and traditional home ranges were compared over 30 years in two areas and over 15 years in five additional areas. In one study area, density of nesting pairs of pileated woodpeckers decreased from five to one after extensive regeneration cuts eliminated most of the stands of mature and old-growth grand fir (Abies grandis) and reduced the density of nest and roost trees and foraging substrate since 1990. Density of nesting pairs, reproductive success, and home range location remained fairly consistent over 30 years in a second study area with extensive tree mortality resulting from insect outbreaks but without regeneration harvests. The amount of unharvested stands and closed canopy stands in home ranges were positively correlated with reproductive success, and the amount of area in harvested stands was negatively correlated with reproductive success in 2003-05. High tree mortality and subsequent loss of canopy closure in stands of grand fir and Douglas-fir from insect outbreaks did not appear to be detrimental to pileated woodpeckers provided that dead trees and logs were abundant and that stands were not harvested.

Westphal, Michael I.; Field, Scott A.; Possingham, Hugh P.				Landscape and Urban Planning	81	1-2		56-66	May 29 2007	2007				English	3	29	We formulate the optimal landscape reconstruction problem for 22 birds in the Mount Lofty Ranges (MLR), South Australia. The goal is to determine landscape configurations with revegetation that would maximize the projected number of bird species present across all revegetated sites in the landscape. We use simulated annealing and an iterative improvement heuristic algorithm to find the efficient solutions for different objective functions and budget sizes. Under scenarios assuming that possible sites for revegetation have equal costs, our analyses suggest that revegetation programs in the region should strive to create landscapes with a mean revegetation patch size ranging from 780 to 4010 ha. The inclusion of property value data as surrogates for revegetation costs results in optimal landscapes with more highly irreplaceable (priority) sites in less expensive parts of the region and smaller average patch sizes. This illustrates how the solutions to landscape design problems change with different assumptions of economic cost. The paper represents one of the first uses of decision-modeling tools for optimal habitat restoration on a real landscape. The software and methodology have applicability for general landscape design outside the Mount Lofty Ranges. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hannah, D.; Woinarski, J.C.Z.; Catterall, C.P.; Mccosker, J.C.; Thurgate, N.Y.; Fensham, R.J.				Austral Ecology	32	3		261-276	May 2007	2007				English	0	59	This study reports on the responses of bird assemblages to woodland clearance, fragmentation and habitat disturbance in central Queensland Australia, a region exposed to very high rates of vegetation clearance over the last two to three decades. Many previous studies of clearing impacts have considered situations where there is a very sharp management contrast between uncleared lands and cleared areas: in this situation, the contrast is more muted, because both cleared lands and uncleared savanna woodlands are exposed to cattle grazing, invasion by the exotic grass Cenchrus ciliaris and similar fire management. Bird species richness (at the scale of a 1-ha quadrat) was least in cleared areas (8.1 species), then regrowth areas (14.6 species), then uncleared woodlands (19.9 species). Richness at this scale was unrelated to woodland fragment size, connectivity or habitat condition; but declined significantly with increasing abundance of miners (interspecifically aggressive colonial honeyeaters). At whole of patch scale, richness increased with fragment size and decreased with abundance of miners. This study demonstrates complex responses of individual bird species to a regional management cocktail of disturbance elements. Of 71 individual bird species modelled for woodland fragment sites, the quadrat-level abundance of 40 species was significantly related to at least one variable representing environmental position (across a rainfall gradient), fragment condition, fragment size and/or connectivity. This study suggests that priorities for conservation management include: cessation of broad-scale clearing; increased protection for regrowth (particularly where this may bolster connectivity and/or size of woodland fragments); control of miners; maintenance of fallen woody debris in woodlands; increase in fire frequency; and reduction in the incidence of grazing and exotic pasture grass.

Prescribed burning is a management strategy that has potential for restoring and rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, and through such restoration, might create habitat for birds dependent upon prairies. To provide improved data for management decision-making regarding the use of prescribed fire in tallgrass prairies, we compared responses of plant and bird communities on five burned and five unburned tallgrass prairie fragments at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, Iowa, USA, from 1995 to 1997. Overall species richness and diversity were unaffected by burning, but individual species of plants and birds were affected by year-treatment interactions, including northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), which showed time-delayed increases in density on burned sites. Analyses of species/area relationships indicated that, collectively, many small sites did make significant contributions to plant biodiversity at landscape levels, supporting the overall conservation value of prairie fragments. In contrast, most birds species were present on larger sites. Thus, higher biodiversity in bird communities which contain area-sensitive species might require larger sites able to support larger, more stable populations, greater habitat heterogeneity, and greater opportunity for niche separation.

Batary, Peter; Baldi, Andras; Erdos, Sarolta				Biodiversity and Conservation	16	4		871-881	April 2007	2007				English	2	59	Declines of West European farmland birds have been associated with intensive agricultural practices, while in Central and Eastern European countries grasslands still harbour a diverse and unique bird community. However, in these countries comparative studies on the effects of agricultural intensity on biodiversity are virtually missing. We compared bird communities of paired extensively and intensively grazed cattle pastures in three different regions of the Hungarian Great Plain. The influence of grazing intensity, landscape and regional effects were tested on the abundance and species richness of two ecological groups of bird species (grassland and non-grassland birds), as well as on the abundance of the three commonest grassland bird species (Skylark, Yellow wagtail, Corn bunting) in linear mixed models. We found significant effects of grazing intensity on the abundance of grassland birds, which were more abundant on the extensive sites, whereas no effects were found on non-grassland birds. This could be explained by a closer dependence of grassland birds on grasslands for nesting and foraging, whereas non-grassland birds only used grasslands opportunistically for foraging. Landscape effect was shown on grassland bird abundance, but not on non-grassland birds. The regions did affect only the species richness of grassland birds. At species level, the effect of management was significant for the three commonest grassland species, which were more abundant on the extensive fields in all regions. Additionally, on Skylark abundance landscape and regional effects were also shown. These findings suggest that conservation of biodiversity in agricultural systems requires the consideration of landscape perspective to apply the most adequate management.
