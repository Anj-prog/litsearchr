Iserhard, Cristiano Agra; Duarte, Leandro; Seraphim, Noemy; Lucci Freitas, Andre Victor				Biodiversity and Conservation	28	3		621-638	Mar 2019	2019				English	11	11	We evaluated how the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversities of butterflies and their community-weighted traits are affected by urbanization in the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For this purpose, a dataset of Nymphalidae species distributed across 15 urban, semiurban, and rural fragments was analyzed. Urbanization was defined by a set of environmental variables. Furthermore, the total area of each fragment was also considered in the analyses but did not influence the results, in which disturbance level and patch connectivity drove the environmental variation across the urban matrix. Species diversity increased towards the more connected fragments, while phylogenetic and functional diversity did not vary in relation to urbanization. A high forewing: hindwing ratio and the frequency of tiger-like wings were positively related to the urban fragments, while a low forewing: hindwing ratio and iridescent wings were related to the semiurban and rural fragments. The suitability of highly interconnected rural habitats for the maintenance of butterfly diversity was corroborated as expected. Nonetheless, our results also showed that semiurban fragments preserved the ecologically relevant traits of butterflies related to forested habitats, expressed in butterfly groups possibly linked with dispersal capability to avoid predation. Careful management of semiurban fragments and urban landscaping, including highly structured and native vegetation outside urban parks, may increase the functional and taxonomic diversities or at least maintain the current levels of functionality in the urban matrix. Thus, it is possible to preserve the biological diversity of native fauna and flora and recover relevant ecosystem services, ensuring the conservation of Neotropical urban centers.

Journal of Wildlife Management	83	2		343-355	Feb 2019	2019				English	10	10	Populations of grassland songbirds continue to decline, and grasslands devoted to conservation are rare across the Great Plains. To gain the most value from grasslands for grassland birds, we must understand what types of management benefit these species. We evaluated the relative abundance of grassland birds on ownership types and the association of different land use activities with their abundance. We surveyed a wide range of grasslands (e.g., from idle to heavily managed, from remnant prairie to reconstructed) across western Minnesota and northwestern Iowa, USA, in 2013 and 2014. Sites surveyed covered a gradient of landscape context, management history (fire, grazing, reconstruction), and public and private ownership. We evaluated the influence of ownership and management history on the abundance of 12 species of grassland birds by comparing Akaike's Information Criterion values of linear models that included the variables of interest to models that included only local and landscape habitat factors. Ownership explained additional variation in bird abundance beyond local and landscape variables for 7 of the 12 species, and 5 species were more common on private lands. Fire or grazing history explained variation in bird abundance for 11 species, and 7 species had greater abundance on remnant prairie than on reconstructed grassland. For all but 1 species, ownership and management factors significantly improved models above a base model of local and landscape variables typically used to predict abundance. Our results suggest remnant prairie plays an important role for grassland birds, and that grazing could be a tool to increase abundance of some grassland bird species in the region. Furthermore, tracking management history of public lands in a consistent and accessible way could help improve landscape-based models for these species. [copyright] 2018 The Wildlife Society.

Lewis, Katharine E.; Rota, Christopher T.; Lituma, Christopher M.; Anderson, James T.				PLoS ONE	14	1		e0210878	Jan 24 2019	2019				English	0	0	Wetlands enrolled in the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) are established as a means of restoring wetland ecosystems and wildlife habitat on private, agricultural land. In West Virginia, USA, ACEP wetlands have never been evaluated to determine how they function as wildlife habitat in comparison to other available wetland habitat in the state. We measured the wintering occupancy of Passerellidae species and apparent avian species richness on ACEP wetlands and a set of reference wetlands located on public land in West Virginia to evaluate if ACEP wetlands are being used similarly by avian species to other available wetland habitat in the state. Apparent avian species richness and the occupancy probability of four Passerellidae species-song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), darkeyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana), and white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis)-did not differ between ACEP and reference sites. In addition to other vegetative and habitat associations for each species, dark-eyed junco occupancy was negatively correlated with wetland size while swamp sparrow occupancy and apparent avian species richness were positively associated with wetland size. These results indicate that ACEP wetlands are providing winter avian habitat as well as another source of wetland habitat in the state. Maintaining and expanding ACEP wetlands in West Virginia would continue to provide wetland systems in areas that are otherwise lacking these habitats.

Shaffer, Jill A.; Roth, Cali L.; Mushet, David M.				PLoS ONE	14	1		e0198382	Jan 9 2019	2019				English	6	6	Birds are essential components of most ecosystems and provide many services valued by society. However, many populations have undergone striking declines as their habitats have been lost or degraded by human activities. Terrestrial grasslands are vital habitat for birds in the North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), but grassland conversion and fragmentation from agriculture and energy-production activities have destroyed or degraded millions of hectares. Conservation grasslands can provide alternate habitat. In the United States, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the largest program maintaining conservation grasslands on agricultural lands, but conservation grasslands in the PPR have declined by over 1 million ha since the program's zenith in 2007. We used an ecosystem-services model (InVEST) parameterized for the PPR to quantify grassland-bird habitat remaining in 2014 and to assess the degradation status of the remaining grassland-bird habitat as influenced by crop and energy (i.e., oil, natural gas, and wind) production. We compared our resultant habitat-quality ratings to grassland-bird abundance data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to confirm that ratings were related to grassland-bird abundance. Of the grassland-bird habitat remaining in 2014, about 19% was degraded by crop production that occurred within 0.1 km of grassland habitats, whereas energy production degraded an additional 16%. We further quantified the changes in availability of grassland-bird habitat under various land-cover scenarios representing incremental losses (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of CRP grasslands from 2014 levels. Our model identified 1 million ha (9%) of remaining grassland-bird habitat in the PPR that would be lost or degraded if all CRP conservation grasslands were returned to crop production. Grassland regions world-wide face similar challenges in maintaining avian habitat in the face of increasing commodity and energy production to sate the food and energy needs of a growing world population. Identifying ways to model the impacts of the tradeoff between food and energy production and wildlife production is an important step in creating solutions.

Kitazawa, Munehiro; Yamaura, Yuichi; Senzaki, Masayuki; Kawamura, Kazuhiro; Hanioka, Masashi; Nakamura, Futoshi				Ornithological Science	18	1		3-16	Jan 2019	2019				English	7	7	Populations of birds inhabiting wetlands and grasslands are decreasing globally due to farmland expansion and subsequent agricultural intensification. In addition to conserving natural habitats, managing cultivated farmland and abandoned farmland are likely to be important future conservation measures; however, their relative suitability as avian habitat remains understudied. In this study, we evaluated five habitat types (wetland, pasture, cropland, abandoned farmland, and solar power plant) for openland birds in an agricultural landscape in central Hokkaido. northern Japan. Abandoned farmlands had bird species richness and total bird abundance values similar to those of wetlands. These values were generally higher in abandoned farmlands and wetlands than in croplands, pastures, and solar power plants. The per pair reproductive success of Stejneger's Stonechat Saxicola stejnegeri and the amount of its prey (arthropods) did not differ among the five habitat types. Tine species (Black-browed Reed Warbler Acrocephalus bistrigiceps, Common Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus, and Japanese Bush Warbler Cettia diphone) arrived earlier in wetlands than in other habitat types. These results suggest that, although protecting the remaining wetlands is of prime importance for the conservation of openland birds in agricultural landscapes, valuing and managing abandoned farmlands would be a promising alternative.

Reiley, Bryan M.; Stodola, Kirk W.; Benson, Thomas J.				ECOSPHERE	10	1		e02574	Jan 2019	2019				English	1	1	Agricultural intensification has negatively affected biodiversity throughout the world. In the United States, population declines of many early successional bird species have been linked with habitat loss due to agriculture. In light of this, recent efforts have attempted to prioritize conservation actions at continental scales. Importantly, these efforts have used existing data to estimate the global population size for declining species and set future population goals. Though these efforts consider broad scales for conservation efforts and provide population targets, they lack explicit plans to achieve established goals. One way to achieve these population goals is through the process of habitat restoration, such as voluntary private-land conservation programs that restore habitat in agricultural landscapes and are implemented at a sufficiently large scale to achieve population goals. Our goal was to understand how private-land conservation programs can be used to achieve population goals for declining species. To do this, we examined the population-level impacts of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, a program that has created more than 57,000 ha of restored habitat in Illinois, for four declining conservation priority species, the Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii bellii), Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla), Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), and Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax trailli trailli). We surveyed 172 randomly chosen restored fields in 10 counties in central and west-central Illinois during the 2012-2015 breeding seasons. We found that current private-land conservation efforts in Illinois are probably effective in achieving state population goals for rare species with restricted habitat preferences such as the Bell's Vireo and may be close to achieving the goal for the Willow Flycatcher. However, more than 10 times the current amount of restored habitat ([approximately]1% of land used for agriculture in Illinois) would be required to achieve the population goals set for all of our focal species. Our results suggest that achieving population goals for early successional bird species using land restored through private-land programs may be possible for some rare species, but the large amount of habitat needed for many species makes achieving these goals only possible with significant increases in private-land habitat.

Besiedlungsrelevante Lebensraumelemente des Baumpiepers Anthus trivialis in einem Muschelkalkgebiet in Nordbayern.	Gansbuehler, Stefanie Agnes; Obermaier, Elisabeth; Pfeifer, Robert				Ornithologischer Anzeiger	57	1-2		29-44	Dec 2018	2018				German	0	0	The number of suitable nesting sites and the quality of breeding habitat in general are among the most important conditions for the colonization of an area by a bird species. Breeding habitat quality habitat significantly influences breeding success and the fitness of nestlings. Given the declining numbers of the species in Germany over many years, the aim of this study was to determine relevant habitat variables of the highly endangered Tree Pipit Anthus trivialis. For this purpose a 440-ha study area, located 7 km northeast of the center of the town of Bayreuth, was examined. The area was mainly characterized by a semi-open landscape with lowland meadows, semi-arid grasslands, as well as by diverse hedgerows and field crops. In spring 2017 Tree Pipit territories were mapped using the point-stop-method, and in summer 2017 a habitat analysis (33 habitat parameters) was carried out on 74 sample sites each with an area of 0.2 ha. The 74 sample sites consisted of 24 Tree Pipit territories that were recorded by the territory mapping in spring, and 50 random points for a statistically meaningful data basis. The population density for the entire study area was 0.6 breeding pair territories/10 ha and for the NSG (FFH protected area) "Muschelkalkgebiet am Oschenberg" (323 ha) 0.8 territories/10 ha. The Tree Pipits had a significant preference for sites close to woodland edges (54 % at < 100 m from the edge of woodland) and for semi-open habitats (83 % of occurrence, population density of 0.96 territories/10 ha). In addition, the calculation of a logistic regression model showed that the open areas created by paths, the number of potential song posts higher than one meter, and the structure of the herb layer (density and heterogeneity) had a significant positive influence on the occurrence of the species. Therefore the bird depends on extensively managed open, not overgrown habitats with song posts. For the preservation of the species it is important to stop the progressive succession by appropriate conservation measures (e.g. grazing and removal of dense scrub).

Sommer, Nathalie R.; Moody, Nicole M.; Lantz, Samantha M.; Leu, Matthias; Karubian, Jordan; Swaddle, John P.				Austral Ecology	43	8		876-889	Dec 2018	2018				English	9	9	Fire disturbance in tropical savannas is integral to maintaining habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity, but its impact on avian species is highly variable. Savannas in northern Australia have recently been invaded by gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus), a perennial tussock grass that fuels late season fires at eight times the intensity of native vegetation. As gamba grass rapidly outcompetes native species and promotes more frequent and intense fires, it greatly decreases landscape heterogeneity and alters the effect of fire in tropical savannas. To investigate how a small passerine, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus), responds to fire disturbance and gamba grass cover, we studied their fine-scale habitat use throughout the dry season before and after a high intensity fire. We used two spatially distinct approaches, radio-telemetry and a transect-based population census, to quantify fairywren habitat use at the group and population level, respectively. Radio-telemetry and transect surveys revealed no direct mortality associated with the severe bushfire during the middle of the study season, suggesting fairywrens are resilient in the short-term to fire disturbance. Our results indicate that fairywrens are largely flexible in their habitat use - instead of relocating after fire, they re-centre their home range around the most photosynthetically productive habitats, dominated by saplings. While we found substantial variation in habitat use among social groups, red-backed fairywren groups generally avoided dense habitat areas dominated by mature gamba grass. We conclude that red-backed fairywrens are resilient to fire and flexible in their habitat use in the short-term; however, in the long-term, gamba grass may pose a threat to population viability. The importance of flexible behavioural strategies in tropical passerines will increase as fire regimes are exacerbated by invasive species and climate change.

Although most often used to study medium- and large-sized mammals, camera traps also detect non-target species. These detections provide useful ecological information on little-known species, but such data usually remain unanalysed. We used detections from camera-trapping surveys of native carnivores and small mammals to examine distribution patterns and occupancy trends of little-known ground-dwelling rainforest birds at seven sites across the Masoala-Makira protected area complex in north-eastern Madagascar. We obtained 4,083 detections of 28 bird species over 18,056 trap nights from zoo to 2013. We estimated occupancy across the Masoala-Makira protected area complex (hereafter, landscape occupancy) and annual trends in occupancy at three resurveyed sites for five commonly observed species. Landscape occupancy across Masoala-Makira ranged from 0.75 (SE 0.09; Madagascar Magpie-robin Copsychus albospecularis) to 0.25 (SE 0.06; Scaly Ground-roller Geobiastes squamiger). Ground-dwelling forest bird occupancy was similar at forest sites that ranged from intact to fully degraded; however, three species were detected less often at sites with high feral cat trap success. Nearly half of all focal species showed declines in annual occupancy probability at one resurveyed site (So2) from 2008 to 2013. The declines in ground-dwelling bird occupancy could have community-wide consequences as birds provide ecosystem services such as seed dispersal and pest regulation. We suggest immediate conservation measures-such as feral cat removal-be implemented to protect ground-dwelling forest birds and other threatened taxa across this landscape.

We classified coastal areas into four watersheds of South Korea and conducted multivariate regression analysis between migratory bird populations and landscape structures including total class area (CA), patch area distribution (MN), patch density (PD), and edge density (ED). At the national level, sandbank MN, sandbank CA, water ED, and grasslands were derived as key landscape structures affecting the abundance of migratory birds. At the watershed level, key landscape structures were determined as follows: Urban area_MN for the Han River watershed, rice paddy MN for the Asan watershed, rice paddy CA for Saemangeum, and grassland MN for the Youngsan River watershed. Considering the multifunctionality, redundancy, and connectivity of the resilience strategy, we provide specific coastal infrastructure planning recommendations at the national and watershed scales.

Steinert, Mari; Moe, Stein R.; Sydenham, Markus A.K.; Eldegard, Katrine				ECOSPHERE	9	11		e02509	Nov 2018	2018				English	1	1	To mitigate biodiversity loss, it is essential to understand how areas altered by human land use can act as alternative habitats for functional groups of species, which are in decline. In forested landscapes, power-line clearings can be valuable habitats for early successional plant species, which in turn provide important food resources for pollinating insects. However, we know little about how management practices affect plant diversity, or how changes in species diversity translate into the functional diversity of floral resources. We conducted an experiment at 19 sites in power-line clearings across southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was (1) cut and left to decay, (2) cut and removed, or (3) uncut. We assessed the effects of treatments on species diversity (richness, evenness, diversity) and functional diversity (functional evenness, functional dispersion) of understory plant communities of insect-pollinated plants. We also investigated the influence of environmental conditions within the power-line clearings, the surrounding landscape, and climatic factors on species and functional diversity. We found that the cut and cut-remove treatments were effective in increasing biological diversity of insect-pollinated plants. The species and functional diversity showed contrasting responses to treatments, and the treatment effects depended on the environmental context. This shows that ecosystem functioning is not necessarily predictable from the ecological processes that drive species composition. The treatment effects on species diversity were partly explained by the stress-gradient hypothesis; species richness was higher in the cleared plots in areas of low environmental stress from precipitation and elevation. In contrast, the treatment effects on functional diversity were positively influenced by productivity, stem density, temperature, available source habitats, elevation, and canopy density. Functional diversity, based on effect traits, should be emphasized when the aim is to maintain a broad range of pollination functions and services in power-line clearings. This study shows that inclusion of power-line clearings in conservation plans can mitigate biodiversity decline in forested landscapes. We recommend the cut-remove treatment in productive areas with available source habitats and high stem density. In low productive areas, with high stem density and high temperatures, the standard cut treatment is sufficient, but a higher cutting frequency is recommended.

Laursen, Karsten; Balbontin, Javier; Thorup, Ole; Nielsen, Henrik Haaning; Asferg, Tommy; Moller, Anders Pape				Ecology and Evolution	8	21		10489-10496	Nov 2018	2018				English	3	3	Environments are rapidly changing due to climate change, land use, intensive agriculture, and the impact of hunting on predator populations. Here, we analyzed long-term data recorded during 1928-2014 on the size of breeding populations of waders at two large nature reserves in Denmark, Vejlerne and Tipperne, to determine the effects of components of environmental change on breeding populations of waders. Environmental variables and counts of waders were temporally autocorrelated, and we used generalized least square (GLS) by incorporating the first-order autoregressive correlation structure in the analyses. We attempted to predict the abundance of waders for short-term trends for two nature reserves (35 years) and for long-term trends for one nature reserve (86 years), using precipitation, temperature, nutrients, abundance of foxes Vulpes vulpes, area grazed, and number of cattle. There was evidence of impacts of nutrients, climate (long-term changes in temperature and precipitation), grazing, mowing, and predation on bird populations. We used standard random effects meta-analyses weighted by (N-3) to quantify these mean effects. There was no significant difference in effect size among species, while mean effect size differed consistently among environmental factors, and the interaction between effect size for species and environmental factors was also significant. Thus, environmental factors affected the different species differently. Mean effect size was the largest at +0.20 for rain, +0.11 for temperature, -0.09 for fox abundance, and -0.03 for number of cattle, while there was no significant mean effect for fertilizer, area grazed, and year. Effect sizes for two short-term time series from Tipperne and Vejlerne were positively correlated as were effect sizes for short-term and long-term time series at Tipperne. This implies that environmental factors had consistent effects across large temporal and spatial scales.

Roels, Steven M.; Porter, Jade L.; Lindell, Catherine A.				Restoration Ecology	26	6		1203-1211	Nov 2018	2018				English	14	14	Recovery of animal-dependent ecosystem functions is a key component of ecological restoration on degraded tropical forest lands. One of these functions, regulation of herbivorous insects by predators, shapes tropical communities through cascading trophic effects. An improved understanding of how predation pressure on herbivorous insects varies with reforestation strategy, management decisions, and landscape context would guide restoration practice. We measured predation pressure by birds and arthropods on dummy caterpillars in five forest types in Panama. These land covers represent natural and managed forest conditions: non-native monoculture plantation, native multispecies plantation, young natural forest succession, secondary gallery forest, and old-growth forest. We also placed dummy caterpillars in residential countryside, a heavily disturbed nonforest land cover. In three land covers, we surveyed bird communities to examine the relationship between predator abundance and predation pressure. Predation pressure from birds was lowest in the intensively managed plantations and highest in land covers with structurally complex vegetation: successional forest, gallery forest, and residential countryside. In the non-native plantation, bird predation increased with proximity to gallery forest. We found strong correspondence between bird abundance and bird attacks on dummy caterpillars. Arthropod predation pressure was highest in the native plantation but, unlike bird predation pressure, did not vary strongly by land cover. Our results suggest that ecosystem functions by insectivorous birds can be enhanced on reforestation lands by incorporating unmanaged areas and tolerating nonplanted understory vegetation. We recommend that, regardless of management objectives, forest managers adopt a holistic approach to reforestation to facilitate recovery of animal-dependent ecosystem functions.

From 2007 to 2017, the number of avian species detected increased from 58 to 88, which represents a 51.7% increment, with an upsurge of eight families in the same time frame. Comparing resident with migratory species, 45 resident and 13 migratory species were registered for 2007, while in 2017, there were 63 residents and 24 migratory species. We consider that the increase in the number of species relates to growth in forest cover, as well as native flora for feeding and shelter, which demonstrates the importance of conserving natural areas with Costa Rican native vegetation in urban zones.

Rolek, Brian W.; Harrison, Daniel J.; Loftin, Cynthia S.; Wood, Petra B.				Forest Ecology and Management	427			392-413	Nov 1 2018	2018				English	18	27	The quantity of spruce-fir forest and some conifer-associated breeding bird abundances in the Atlantic Northern Forest have declined in recent decades emphasizing the need to better understand avian responses to forest management and to identify options that proactively conserve habitat for birds during the breeding and post-breeding period. We conducted avian point counts and vegetation surveys on publicly and privately-owned lands with known management histories to assess relationships between avian assemblages in harvest and post-harvest treatments that could provide habitat for passerine birds associated with the spruce-fir forest type. We sampled regenerating conifer-dominated stands 5-41 years-since-harvest (YSH) in three harvest treatments (selection, irregular first-stage shelterwood, and clearcuts) and three postharvest treatments including regenerating clearcuts treated with aerially applied herbicide (e.g., glyphosate), precommercial thinning (PCT), both herbicide and PCT, and mature stands (>=48 YSH). Spruce-fir obligate and associate birds were more abundant in stands with greater spruce-fir tree composition (>=70% and >=60%, respectively). Avian richness of spruce-fir obligates, associates, and species of concern was greater in clearcuts and clearcuts with post-harvest treatments. Vegetative features associated with greater richness and abundance of spruce-fir birds, such as greater spruce-fir composition and smaller tree diameter at breast height, were prominent in regenerating clearcuts and post-harvest treatments and suggested that these management practices promote local abundances and richness of spruce-fir birds. Richness and abundances of spruce-fir birds were least in selection, shelterwood, and mature stands, and vegetative features associated with greater richness and abundance of spruce-fir birds were diminished in these stands. Forestry trends in Maine indicate that the extent of the clearcut suite of treatments has decreased on the landscape while selection and shelterwood harvests have increased. Thus, changes in incentives for managers to apply even-aged management coupled with postharvest applications of herbicides or precommercial thinning might mitigate further declines in habitat for spruce-fir passerines assemblages. A greater ratio of clearcuts with postharvest treatments 11-40 YSH compared to other treatments (mature forest >=48 YSH, selection and shelterwood 5-41 YSH) would maintain diverse spruce-fir bird communities on the landscape. Use of clearcuts with post-harvest treatments in the hemiboreal forests of northern New England, southern Quebec, and Maritime Provinces of eastern Canada may enhance habitat for breeding and post-breeding spruce-fir birds, especially where the quantity of conifer forests are declining and residual patches of conifers are increasingly fragmented.

Specht, Hannah M.; Arnold, Todd W.				Journal of Applied Ecology	55	6		2854-2864	Nov 2018	2018				English	6	6	1. Fecundity estimates for demographic modelling are difficult to acquire at the regional spatial scales that correspond to climate shifts, land use impacts or habitat management programmes. Yet they are important for evaluating such effects. While waterfowl managers have historically used harvest-based age ratios to assess fecundity at continental scales, widely available age ratios from late summer banding (ringing) data present an underutilized opportunity to examine a regional fecundity index with broad temporal replication. 2. We used age ratios from banding data and hierarchical mixed-effect models to examine how fecundity of five North American dabbling duck species was affected by temporal variation in hydrological cycles, intra- and interspecific density dependence and alternate prey availability, and whether those relationships were consistent across a broad geographic area. 3. Model-estimated fecundity was within the range of traditional harvest-based fecundity estimates for each species. Ecological covariates explained between 16% and 53% of the temporal variation in fecundity, dependent on species. Increasing wetland inundation and an indicator of vole population irruptions were consistent predictors of increasing fecundity across all species. Species exhibited mixed positive and negative responses to interspecific and intraspecific breeding pair densities hypothesized to affect nest and brood survival respectively, highlighting the importance of integrating brood survival into fecundity metrics for precocial species. 4. Declines in fecundity over time and across space at more northern latitudes may reflect stronger policies for grassland and wetland protection in the U.S. versus Canadian portions of the prairies over the time period of our study. Maintaining the capacity of less permanent basins to rehydrate in wetter periods through easement protection benefits fecundity, particularly for late-nesting species that acquire a greater proportion of their reproductive energy on the breeding grounds. 5. Synthesis and applications. Age ratios derived from postbreeding banding operations allowed us to attribute variation in waterfowl fecundity to temporal ecological variables. Effects of habitat management for waterfowl may be masked unless analysts account for this temporal variation. Postbreeding-pulse age ratios atcapture could be useful as fecundity metrics in integrated population models and for evaluating population dynamics of extensively banded nongame species, especially if adjusted for capture vulnerability using within-season recapture data.

Mentil, Lorenzo; Battisti, Corrado; Carpaneto, Giuseppe Maria				Web Ecology	18	2		143-151	Oct 2 2018	2018				English	9	9	Forest structural complexity could be a good predictor of overall species diversity. Since tree harvesting has a negative effect on forest structure, it is important to analyse the effects of this disturbance on sensitive groups, as forest birds. In this study, we aimed to shed light on this aspect by analysing a set of univariate metrics in bird communities breeding in three coppiced forest habitats (coppiced of chestnut, coppiced of Turkey oak and high forest of beech) along a gradient in age classes. We hypothesised that, with increasing forest age, (i) breeding bird communities will progressively increase in diversity and, (ii) due to higher habitat heterogeneity due to coppicing, a higher species turnover in the first age classes could appear. In each forest habitat, all the metrics significantly increased, from recently coppiced to more mature forests, due to progressively higher availability of resources and niches along the gradient. When comparing paired forest habitats, abundance and richness were significantly different only in the two oldest age classes, highlighting that responses to different tree composition were more marked in the mature phase. In all forest habitats, species turnover ([beta]w diversity) decreased progressively along the age gradient and was highest in the youngest age classes where many vegetation layers were present. Due to different coppice management practices, growth regime and consequent habitat heterogeneity, chestnuts showed a different pattern when compared to other forest habitats, with an increase in species turnover ([beta]w diversity) at intermediate level. With increasing age of the forests, all the diversity metrics increased and species turnover decreased, highlighting the role of older forests as strategic habitats for highly structured bird communities.

Duchardt, Courtney J.; Porensky, Lauren M.; Augustine, David J.; Beck, Jeffrey L.				ECOSPHERE	9	10		e02483	Oct 2018	2018				English	8	8	Ecotones, or transitional zones between ecosystems, are often hotspots for biodiversity and targets for conservation. Where the Great Plains meet the sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe, an opportunity exists to conserve habitat for the two most imperiled avian guilds in North America, grassland and shrub-steppe birds. This ecotone creates a unique challenge with respect to the management of disturbance processes, such as fire and grazing, because grassland and sagebrush-shrubland birds respond quite dissimilarly to disturbance. To address this management challenge and maximize conservation opportunities, we examined the responses of grassland and sagebrush bird communities to disturbance at a grassland-sagebrush ecotone in northeast Wyoming, USA. Specifically, we surveyed bird communities on active black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies and burned areas, as well as on paired undisturbed points in 2016 and 2017. Bird community structure varied in response to both the presence and type of disturbance. Although alpha diversity of avian species was highest on undisturbed sites and burned areas, only prairie dog colonies provided breeding habitat for the imperiled shortgrass-obligate mountain plover (Charadrius montanus), and species turnover (beta diversity) was greatest between on-colony and off-colony points. Furthermore, bird communities were shaped by both disturbance-dependent (e.g., disturbance age) and disturbance-independent (e.g., topography and soils) landscape features. Managers must balance the benefits of high species diversity in undisturbed sagebrush with habitat requirements of other imperiled species like the mountain plover. This may entail prioritizing the amount and distribution of disturbances in relation to population goals for species of conservation concern while simultaneously maintaining a mosaic of all three patch types in this landscape.

For the Corncrake, a multi-brooded, ground-breeding rail that inhabits mostly agricultural grassland, more frequent mowing at earlier dates is a threat to nests and broods and induces dispersal of adults. We used an occupancy model that allows for staggered arrival and departure times to estimate within-season movements of male Corncrakes and analysed how departure probabilities, calling site occupancy and habitat suitability were affected by land use. This study covered two study periods before (1998-2000) and after (2012-2015) a change in the local management regime. Male Corncrakes showed continuous arrival and departure during the breeding season, but delayed mowing dates reduced departure probability in the second study period, which should enhance the probability for second broods because less calling sites were affected by mowing especially during early July. Late mowing, however, implies economical losses for farmers and cessation of land use expanded. On unused meadows litter heights increased and plant species richness and forb cover declined, thus preferred habitat conditions deteriorated. Calling sites in unmanaged meadows were abandoned by male Corncrakes after few years without land use. Postponing first mowing dates until broods fledge is effective in protecting Corncrake broods, because more chicks should have survived until fledging but habitat quality depends on annual management. Because currently mowing late in the season is unattractive to farmers, we suggest that future Corncrake habitat conservation should along with financial compensations promote and evaluate the utilization of late-cut biomass for energy production.

However, the area of abandoned farmland has been increasing globally in recent years and is expected to provide novel habitats for various organisms. Despite the promising potential for biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes, few studies have compared biodiversity among multiple land use types, including abandoned farmland. We examined the effects of major land use types (wetland, grassland, forest, farmland, abandoned farmland) and the surrounding landscape openness (proportion of wetland/grassland in the surrounding area) on the abundance and species richness of bird communities and four functional groups (wetland, grassland, farmland, and forest species) in the agricultural landscape of central Hokkaido in northern Japan. The abundance of wetland/grassland species in abandoned farmland tended to be intermediate between those of their original habitats (wetland and grassland) and other land uses (forest and farmland), and to be positively associated with the landscape openness. The abundance of forest species tended to be higher in forest areas than in areas with other land use types and was not associated with the landscape openness. The abundance and species richness of the bird community were predicted to be high in large abandoned farmland areas surrounded by open land. For wetland species, whereas total abundance was predicted to be primarily mediated by landscape openness, species richness was predicted to be primarily mediated by the farmland abandonment area. The abandoned farmland in our study area would not currently have a high conservation value for forest birds. However, the abandonment of farmland surrounded by open land would significantly improve the conservation of wetland/grassland birds in the agricultural landscape. Given the decline in the area of grassland, wetland, and low intensity farmland, farmland abandonment provides an opportunity to conserve and restore the declining populations of wetland and grassland birds.

We implemented a novel approach to understanding community-level demographic responses of birds and their habitats to these stressors in the context of climate change at 14 study sites in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. A large wildfire affecting three of the sites provided a natural experiment for also examining fire effects on vegetation and the bird community. We assessed (1) trends in drought and end-of-century (2071-2100) predicted average drought conditions under mid-range and high greenhouse gas concentration trajectory scenarios; (2) effects of drought and fire on habitat (vegetation greenness); and (3) effects of drought and fire on community-level avian productivity and adult apparent survival rates. Drought has increased and is expected to increase further at our study sites under climate change. Under spring drought conditions, vegetation greenness and avian productivity declined, while summer drought appeared to negatively affect adult apparent survival rates. Response to fire was mixed; in the year of the fire, avian productivity declined, but was higher than normal for several years post-fire. Our results highlight important links between environmental stressors and avian vital rates that will likely affect population trajectories in this region under climate change. We suggest that the use and continued development of community-level demographic models will provide useful tool for leveraging sparse species-level data to provide multi-species inferences and inform conservation.

Fair, Jeanne M.; Hathcock, Charles D.; Bartlow, Andrew W.				Biological Conservation	226			186-195	Oct 2018	2018				English	10	10	An increase in tree mortality is expected to occur worldwide due to climate-induced drought and increasing temperatures. The 2000-2002 drought in the southwestern United States was one of the most severe in the last 50 years. It led to a severe outbreak of bark beetles that resulted in high mortality of pinon pine (Pinus edulis) trees on the Pajarito Plateau in Northern New Mexico beginning in 2002. Many areas in pinon-juniper habitat had entire stands of pinon die leaving only juniper (Juniperus spp.). Point count surveys were used to determine avian responses to tree mortality from 2003 to 2013. We also tested whether birds responded differently in sites that were mechanically thinned in 2002 and 2003 on Los Alamos National Laboratory property compared to sites not thinned. Junipers and dead pinon pines due to bark beetles and drought were removed on thinned sites. Richness, diversity, and abundance steadily declined after 2003. There was a 73% decrease in abundance and a 45% decrease in richness from 2003 to 2013. There was no difference in community composition between thinned and unthinned sites. Bird abundance and species richness declined faster in thinned sites than unthinned sites, but diversity decreased similarly in both treatments. Several species disappeared over time and some declined substantially. Our results suggest a delay in bird responses to tree mortality on the Pajarito Plateau. Pinon mortality may be a significant threat to bird communities in the southwestern U.S., and tree thinning to control fire may be an added risk.

Valasiuk, Sviataslau; Giergiczny, Marek; Zylicz, Tomasz; Klimkowska, Agata; Angelstam, Per				Wetlands Ecology and Management	26	5		943-960	Oct 2018	2018				English	6	6	Abandonment of traditional farming practices, such as hay-making and pasturing, has resulted in rapid loss of open wet grassland habitats in Europe. The globally threatened Aquatic Warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola L.) is a bird species that occurs almost exclusively in open fen mires, which have virtually disappeared in Western Europe, but still persist locally in Eastern Europe. Focusing on the world's most important breeding site for Aquatic Warbler, the Zvaniec fen mire in Belarus, we estimated Belarusian citizens' willingness-to-pay for adequate conservation management of this fen mire and its focal species the Aquatic Warbler. Results from a discrete choice experiment indicated that Belarusian citizens were willing to pay for appropriate conservation programmes of the Zvaniec fen mire. Scything and mechanical mowing were preferred compared to controlled burning, and especially over herbicide treatment of encroaching shrubs. Conservation management was preferred over legal protection of wetland areas without management. Respondents considered such passive conservation to be insufficient to maintain open fen mire habitat and gave a higher priority to active conservation management programmes. These preferences are consistent with evidence-based knowledge about what is effective conservation management for the Aquatic Warbler. Given the gradual disappearance of Europe's traditional cultural landscapes, we discuss the challenge to fund the maintenance of this biocultural biodiversity legacy.

Perez-Granados, Cristian; Serrano-Davies, Eva; Noguerales, Victor				Biodiversity and Conservation	27	12		3087-3102	Oct 2018	2018				English	8	10	Semi-natural open habitats have drastically changed in the last few decades due to agricultural intensification and rural depopulation. Steppe-birds, and especially those adapted to primary stages of vegetation succession, are threatened by an increase in scrub cover, and management actions are being applied to reverse scrub encroachment and restore habitat suitability in semi-natural open habitats. In this paper we evaluated for the first time, the long-term effects of a wildfire on habitat structure, vegetation productivity, and the associated response of an endangered scrub-steppe specialist bird, the Dupont's Lark Chersophilus duponti. Wildfire occurred in a Mediterranean steppe of central Spain dominated by permanent community of dwarf cushions scrubs. Bird abundance was evaluated by line transects in the burnt and unburnt areas 3 years prior to the fire and 4 and 7 years after the fire. We quantified changes in habitat structure at fine scale level through vegetation sampling points and in vegetation productivity by estimating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Fire had strong effects for at least up to 4 years after the fire, when lower NDVI values, less scrub cover and fewer, but not significant, number of males were detected in the burnt area with respect to the pre-fire conditions. Seven years after fire most vegetation variables measured did not differ between areas, number of males detected within the burnt area was recovered and NDVI values in burnt area were slightly recovered but were significantly lower than in control area. Slow regeneration of the scrub cover after fire explained the unsuccessful occupation of the burnt area by the Dupont's Lark up to several years after fire. The more dispersed and shorter habitat created by fire 7 years after the fire seems to be more suitable for the species than that in control areas. The large number of males around the burnt area may have played a role in the recolonization process. In sum, vegetation recovery and the presence of a low scrub-steppe specialist, as the Dupont's lark, suggests that fire management could be integrated into conservation plans to effectively manage scrub encroachment processes in Mediterranean scrub-steppes.

Schwarz, Cinja; Trautner, Juergen; Fartmann, Thomas				Journal of Ornithology	159	4		945-954	Oct 2018	2018				English	11	12	Agricultural landscapes play an important role in biodiversity conservation. The Tree Pipit (Anthus trivialis) was once a widespread breeding bird in European farmlands. Today, however, its numbers are sharply declining in most European countries. The aim of our study was to compare territory densities of Tree Pipits in common pastures and control plots in the surrounding pre-alpine agricultural landscape in southern Bavaria (Germany). Additionally, we determined the drivers of territory and home-range establishment in Tree Pipits. Habitat composition in common pastures and control plots reflected distinct differences in land-use intensity. Common pastures had larger areas of nutrient-poor habitats and higher landscape diversity compared to control plots. In line with this, we detected a clear response of Tree Pipits to differences in habitat composition. Territories were nearly exclusively found in common pastures. Within the common pastures, Tree Pipits preferred those parts that had higher landscape diversity and, additionally, at the territory scale, larger areas of groups of trees. The common pastures are important refuges for the threatened Tree Pipit in the pre-alpine agricultural landscape of the study area. In contrast to the control plots, the common pastures provided (i) sufficient suitable song posts and (ii) heterogeneous vegetation with appropriate nesting sites and a high availability of arthropod food resources. Our study corroborates findings from other studies across Europe highlighting the prime importance of traditionally used wood pastures for the Tree Pipit, and for biodiversity in general.

Greenberg, Cathryn H.; Tomcho, Joseph; Livings-Tomcho, Aimee; Lanham, J. Drew; Waldrop, Thomas A.; Simon, Dean; Hagan, Donald				Forest Ecology and Management	424			367-377	Sep 15 2018	2018				English	14	16	Forest restoration, fuel reduction, and wildlife conservation management requires understanding if, and how repeated prescribed fire, fire severity, or mechanical methods can promote goals. We examined breeding bird response to repeated fuel reduction treatments by mechanical understory reduction (twice; Mechanical-only), prescribed burning (four times; Burn-only), or mechanical understory reduction plus burning (then three subsequent burns; Mechanical + Burn). Initial burns were hotter in Mechanical + Burn than Burn-only resulting in heavy tree mortality, canopy openness, thick shrub density, and abundant snags lasting several years. Relative density and species richness of birds increased in Mechanical + Burn within three breeding seasons of high severity burns, and remained greater throughout subsequent burn. Increases were due to an influx of species associated with young forest conditions, with little change in most mature forest species. Repeated burning in Mechanical + Burn likely impeded forest maturation, allowing many scrub-shrub bird species to persist. Species richness in Burn-only did not differ from any treatment, but modest increases over time were apparent as structural heterogeneity increased with delayed tree mortality. Cavity-nester density was highest in Mechanical + Burn, but remained high even as snags fell to pretreatment levels. Ground-nester density was lower in Mechanical + Burn than Control and Mechanical-only, but ground-nesting species responded differently. Open woodlands were not created by any treatment due to persistent re-sprouting of top-killed trees and shrubs. We note that breeding birds appear to respond similarly to high-severity burns and silvicultural treatments with heavy canopy reduction, offering possible alternatives in managing upland hardwood forests for diverse breeding bird communities.

Batisteli, Augusto F.; Tanaka, Marcel O.; Souza, Andrea L.T.				Diversity-Basel	10	3		90	Sep 2018	2018				English	2	2	Monitoring wildlife responses is essential to assess restoration projects. Birds are widely used as bioindicators of ecosystem restoration, but most studies use only taxonomic descriptors to compare categories of reference and restoring sites. Here, we used forest structure as a continuous predictor variable to evaluate avifaunal taxonomic and functional indicators in riparian forest reference and restoration sites on southeastern Brazil. Reference sites were riparian forest remnants, and restoration sites were pasture before seedling reintroduction. Forest structure variables (mean tree height, canopy depth, mean diameter at breast height, basal area, tree layering, tree density, and grass cover) were reduced into two axes using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Forest Axis 1 (tree biomass vs. grass cover) and Forest Axis 2 (canopy depth vs. tree density). Bird species were classified in relation to five functional categories (i.e., diet, foraging stratum, nest height, cavity dependence for nesting, and forest dependence). Forest Axis 1 influenced the functional diversity of bird assemblages and the relative abundance within levels of each functional category (except for nest height). The relative abundance of all functional categories combined was also affected by Forest Axis 2. Therefore, forest structure affected the predominant functional traits of bird species in riparian sites under restoration. Sites with higher tree biomass were the richest, with canopy birds that were insectivores and frugivores of high forest dependence, whereas more open sites were associated with birds of low forest dependence and ground-foraging insectivores. Forest structures of similar-aged sites were strongly variable, due to natural and anthropic disturbances, so restoration age was a poor indicator of forest development. These unpredictable disturbances can change the development of sites under restoration, so that forest structure can be a better descriptor of the trajectory of these ecosystems.

Khan, U.; Lovari, S.; Shah, S. Ali; Ferretti, F.				Biodiversity and Conservation	27	11		2795-2813	Sep 2018	2018				English	36	66	Large carnivore-human coexistence is a challenging issue in wildlife conservation worldwide. An adequate and diverse prey spectrum favours carnivore persistence. Prey depletion and habitat loss elicit conflict with humans and require sound conservation measures. We evaluated the conflict between common leopards and humans in a densely populated Himalayan forest area of Pakistan. In two decades, the local forests decreased at an average rate of 65.5 ha/year (6.6%), with a concomitant increase in areas covered by human settlements (81.5%) and agricultural lands (15.4%). Ranging movements of a GPS/GSM-radiotagged male leopard over 16 months encompassed an area inhabited by c. 124,000 people. Livestock dominated the leopard's diet (absolute frequency of occurrence: 80%), while wild ungulates were rarely eaten (absolute occurrence: 22%). Domestic goats were the most frequent diet item (61%), followed by domestic dogs (12%) and Bos spp. (6%). Wild prey included canids, small carnivores, rhesus monkeys, small mammals and gallinaceous birds. Socioeconomic implications of human-leopard coexistence were investigated: 18.5% of the households interviewed (N = 1016) suffered livestock depredation by leopards, with an overall loss of 123 USD/km2/year, in an area of 328 km2. In the first c. 15 years of this century, about 2 attacks to humans/year were recorded, half of which were lethal, whereas c. 6 leopards/year were killed in retaliation. The common leopard is 'critically endangered' in Pakistan mainly because of habitat loss and concurrent prey depletion. To increase the long-term survival of leopards and mitigate human-carnivore conflicts, priority should be given to restoration of a diverse natural prey assembly and protection of forest habitats, together with improved livestock management practices and livestock compensation. The latter will require a sustainable financial mechanism.

We combined large-scale databases available for continental Spain on: (1) distribution of breeding birds, (2) forest inventory stands, (3) land-use cover, (4) 18 global climate models recently developed at local scales, and (5) historical and genetically-based information on the distribution of natural versus planted pine forests, to analyze whether back to nature strategies may help to mitigate biodiversity loss due to climate change. We performed the analysis along environmental and ecological gradients of pine forests in Southern Europe. Models suggested that, naturalization strategies, in this case defined by the replacement of planted pine forests and eucalyptus forests by natural pine forests, could help to mitigate the expected loss of bird diversity due to climate change, but that mitigation efficiency will vary along environmental and ecological gradients. Maximum levels of diversity mitigation were predicted at intermediate levels of naturalization, with lower bird richness in areas where all pine forests were either planted or naturalized. Efficiency also varied spatially, given that both cold-and hot-spots of climate-driven bird diversity loss were identified. Transforming planted forest into natural forest is not a mitigation panacea, and additional regionally-adapted strategies may be identified to mitigate the expected biodiversity loss in forest ecosystems.

Li, Li; Tietze, Dieter Thomas; Fritz, Andreas; Lu, Zhi; Burgi, Matthias; Storch, Ilse				Biological Conservation	224			75-86	Aug 2018	2018				English	25	35	Ecological restoration is becoming a primary strategy to increase provisions of ecosystem services and reverse biodiversity losses. In cultural landscapes undergoing land use extensification, rewilding has been proposed as a viable approach to reverse biodiversity loss through reducing human impacts. The world's largest ecological restoration campaign is taking place on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) to combat grassland degradation and enhance the upper stream region's water retention capacity. However, little is known about whether the large-scale rewilding also benefits the unique bird assemblage of the eastern QTP. Our study aims to make science-based conservation recommendations for the Tibetan avifauna by detecting their diversity and endemism distribution patterns at the local scale. In the breeding seasons of 2014 and 2015, we carried out bird surveys and conducted a habitat mapping using three Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We developed a comprehensive set of 2D and 3D habitat feature parameters from the high-resolution (10 cm level) UAV-derived images. Meanwhile, we employed the participatory GIS approach to acquire farm-scale human land-use data. Our results indicate that the distributions of avian diversity, endemism and abundance are not congruent across the eastern QTP, which calls for the conservation of different habitat types. Vertical and horizontal habitat heterogeneity maintain the local bird diversity with anthropogenic elements significantly enriching the overall bird abundance. Degraded pastures provided key habitats for two highly abundant endemic passerines the White-rumped Snowfinch Ortychosmuthus taczanowskii and the Ground Tit Pseudopodoces humilis. At the landscape scale, historical human-nature interactions between Tibetan nomads and the alpine environment formed the landscapes patchy vegetation structure. Our results reveal that the Tibetan cultural landscape maintains the structural heterogeneity needed to achieve multiple bird conservation objectives on the eastern QTP. Restoring the cultural landscape to a 'natural' tall-grass or dense-shrubland state of high water-retention capacity may result in the loss of both high-abundance avian communities and endemic species diversity. Our empirical study also indicated that rewilding abandoned agricultural landscape will not necessarily lead to a desired conservation outcome, especially when the requirements of habitat specialists and endemics are not taken into account. Moreover, ecological restoration projects should evaluate the divergences between their ecosystem service and biodiversity objectives.

Toenies, Matthew J.; Miller, David A.W.; Marshall, Matthew R.; Stauffer, Glenn E.				Condor	120	3		489-506	Aug 2018	2018				English	16	18	Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) is undergoing widespread decline throughout the eastern United States due to the introduction of the nonnative hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). In light of hemlock's unique significance for avian communities, we examined the long-term response of the breeding bird community to the decline and die-off of this foundational forest species. We conducted variable-radius point counts to survey bird communities in both hemlock and hardwood stands in 2000, during the early stages of adelgid infestation, and again in 2015 and 2016, following significant hemlock decline. We also measured the severity of hemlock decline and associated vegetation variables in the same hemlock stands in which avian surveys were completed. We used multispecies occupancy models to examine species-specific and species group responses to hemlock decline. Results showed that, across hemlock stands, hemlock basal area declined from a mean of 56% of the total basal area to 46%, and that hemlock decline was correlated with current vegetation structure, including an increased deciduous understory. Species richness of hemlock-associated birds declined by an average of [approximately]1 species per survey location. The Black-throated Green Warbler (Setophaga virens) was the most strongly affected, declining in occupancy by 30%. All other species groups responded positively, with the strongest responses by species associated with the shrub layer, forest edge, and mature deciduous habitat. The species composition in hemlock and hardwood stands became more similar over time as the unique species assemblages in hemlock stands gave way to the avian community of the surrounding hardwood landscape, highlighting a trend toward homogenization of the avian community. Where hemlock-associated bird species persisted, their presence was correlated with a combined effect of greater hemlock basal area and better hemlock condition. Our results demonstrate that the decline of hemlocks has restructured vegetation communities and their associated avian communities over time, with strong implications for forest-specialist birds.

St-Amand, Julien; Tremblay, Junior A.; Martin, Kathy				Condor	120	3		680-702	Aug 2018	2018				English	11	11	Williamson's Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus thyroideus) are montane woodpeckers threatened by widespread tree removal activities and climate change. Current forest management plans focus on nesting trees, but the incorporation of foraging trees would lead to a more effective management strategy to mitigate habitat loss for this species. We investigated the selection of foraging trees in forests managed for timber extraction and maintenance of wildlife values using foraging observations of 27 radio-tagged adult Williamson's Sapsuckers during the breeding season in 2 regions (Okanagan and Western) of their limited Canadian range. Characteristics of foraging trees (88% of observations on live trees, 11% on dead trees) differed with foraging mode. Large, live Douglas-firs (Pseudotsuga menziesii; >=22.5 cm dbh) were used for gleaning and sap feeding on tree trunks in both regions, whereas trees used for trunk pecking were mostly large, senescent western larches (Larix occidentalis) in the Okanagan region and large, dead ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) in the Western region (average dbh = 46 cm). For overall foraging activities, Williamson's Sapsuckers selected large, live Douglas-firs with signs of resin exudation and blistering (pitching), and avoided live lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta), quaking aspens (Populus tremuloides), and ponderosa pines. Larger trees and standing dead conifer trees were reused more often for foraging than smaller and live trees. The quality of Williamson's Sapsucker habitat could decrease over the long term if forest management practices reduce the overall size of trees or alter tree species composition to promote lodgepole pine. Forest management should focus on retaining and promoting large live Douglas-fir trees and large senescent or standing dead conifers (also used for nesting), which can be achieved by using thinning, prescribed fire, partial harvesting, and tree retention strategies.

Novitates Caribaea	12			1-13	Jul 2018	2018				English	0	0	Avian frugivores are of great interest to ecologists because they play an important role in ecosystem functioning, and can serve as important components in habitat restoration. In the Neotropics, observational studies have demonstrated the importance of a variety of fruit trees to numerous bird species, but undoubtedly other tree species exist that are a key resource for birds. I explored the relationship between Trema micrantha (L.) Blume, which produces superabundant fruit nearly continuously, and its disperser assemblage in Hispaniolan pine forest and montane broadleaf forest in the Sierra de Bahoruco, Dominican Republic. In 174 hours of observation at sixteen trees I recorded 513 visits by nineteen species of birds. Birds did not visit Trema in numbers reflecting their relative abundance in each habitat. The most frequent consumer of Trema fruit was the migratory Cape May Warbler, Setophaga tigrina (Gmelin, 1789), but other frequent visitors included the Black-throated Blue Warbler, S. caerulescens (Gmelin, 1789), and the endemic Palmchat, Dulus dominicus (Linnaeus, 1766), and Hispaniolan Highland-Tanager, Xenoligea montana (Chapman, 1917). I recorded 85 aggressive interactions among nine species of birds in Trema trees, with female Cape May Warblers involved in most of these. There was no evidence that Trema was dependent on any one species of bird for dispersal of its seeds, and despite the large proportion of visits by the Cape May Warbler, I found no evidence that any species of bird was dependent upon fruit from Trema. Rather, because male Cape May Warblers dominate females and defend nectar sources in these habitats, I suggest that for female Cape May Warblers, these scattered Trema trees represent a known, reliable, and accessible source of food which they can defend. Trema trees will benefit these bird species as a food resource, but may also function as a target for many other birds moving across the landscape, thereby facilitating the dispersal of a wider variety of seeds and the restoration of deforested sites.

Morelli, Federico				Ecological Indicators	90			540-546	Jul 2018	2018				English	18	19	In an attempt to mitigate the decline of biodiversity, the European Union introduced the high nature value (HNV) farmland concept into the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The rationale was to reinforce biodiversity conservation through the maintenance of traditional low-intensity fanning systems. HNV farmland is in fact defined as a system which includes semi-natural habitats, low intensity farming and diverse, small-scale mosaics of land-use types, comprising hotspots of biological diversity. However, until now few studies have focused on the degree to which HNV farmland as defined and identified through a set of farming practices and/or farmland typologies is successful in supporting biodiversity. The values of taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and evolutionary distinctiveness of breeding bird communities between HNV and non-HNV farmland were compared in Central Italy. Bird species richness and functional richness were higher in HNV than in non-HNV farmland. HNV farmland supported bird communities 27% more unique in terms of phylogenetic diversity than non-HNV farmland. A combination of land cover composition (land use coverage) and configuration (spatial arrangement of patches) differentially affects each component of bird diversity. Variation in species richness was explained by land use composition (31%) and shared contribution between land use composition and landscape metrics (13%). The functional diversity of bird communities was little explained by changes in land cover of farmland (less than 14%). As a conclusion, I highlight that HNV farmland needs to be protected because it supports bird communities characterized by high overall bird diversity. Conservation planning should pay attention to the relative association of farmland features with each component of bird diversity.

Lee, Myung-Bok; Carroll, John P.				Ecology and Evolution	8	14		6909-6920	Jul 2018	2018				English	6	6	Relationships between avian diversity and habitat area are assumed to be positive; however, often little attention has given to how these relationships can be influenced by the habitat structure or quality. In addition, other components of biodiversity, such as functional diversity, are often overlooked in assessing habitat patch value. In the Sandhills Ecoregion of Georgia, USA, we investigated the relationship between avian species richness and functional diversity, forest basal area, and patch size in pine forests using basal area as a surrogate for overstory structure which in turn impacts vegetation structure and determines habitat quality within a patch. We conducted bird surveys in planted mature pine stands, during breeding season of 2011. We used three classes of stand basal area (BA): OS, overstocked (BA >= 23 m2/ha); FS, fully/densely stocked (13.8 m2/ha <= BA<23 m2/ha); and MS, moderately stocked (2.3 m2/ha <= BA<13.8 m2/ha). MS patches showed more structural diversity due to higher herbaceous vegetation cover than other two pine stocking classes of patches. Total species richness and functional richness increased with the size of MS patches, whereas functional divergence decreased with the size of OS patches (p<0.05). Functional richness tended to be lower than expected as the size of OS patches increased. Greater richness of pine-grassland species was also found at MS patches. Percent cover of MS patches within a landscape influenced positively the richness of pine-grassland species (p<0.05). Our results suggest that (a) avian species-habitat area relationship can be affected by habitat quality (structural diversity) and varies depending on diversity indices considered, and (b) it is important to maintain moderate or low levels of pine basal area and to preserve large-sized patches of the level of basal area to enhance both taxonomic and functional diversity in managed pine forests.

Newman, Erica A.; Potts, Jennifer B.; Tingley, Morgan W.; Vaughn, Charles; Stephens, Scott L.				Journal of Applied Ecology	55	4		1615-1625	Jul 2018	2018				English	41	47	1. Chaparral, a type of shrubland common throughout the California Floristic Province, is subject to management and removal in regions where wildfire threatens human lives and property. Management practices include conducting prescribed burns outside of the historical fire season and employing mechanical fuel reduction (mastication). As the wildland-urban interface grows, particularly in coastal California, more of this ecosystem is subject to active management. 2. To understand the ecological implications of current California chaparral fire management practices, we studied bird species composition, abundance and foraging guilds in managed and unmanaged chaparral over 5 years. Study areas were located in Mendocino County in the coast ranges of northern California. We contrast six chaparral removal or "fuels manipulation" treatments: (1) fall fire, (2) winter fire, (3) spring fire, (4) fall mastication, (5) spring mastication and (6) untreated control. Treatments and controls were implemented in plots 2 ha or larger, and replicated four times each. 3. We find that species richness in prescribed fire treatments reaches comparable levels to controls in the first 3 years following treatment, whereas masticated units always have lower species richness. Generalized linear mixed models additionally confirm that mastication has highly negative effects on observed abundances of birds compared to controls and to prescribed fire. 4. The season in which fuels reduction occurred was less important to species richness, although fall fire was more beneficial to bird abundance than spring or winter fire. Fire treatments in all seasons maintain the same general bird community structure as controls, while mastication results in strongly differentiated assemblages, increasing granivores while nearly excluding foliage gleaners. 5. Synthesis and applications. We compare two California chaparral management techniques, prescribed fire and mastication, in three seasons (fall, winter and spring) in northern California, USA. We tracked chaparral bird community response in 23 experimental units for 2-5 years. We conclude that prescribed fire and mastication are not interchangeable management techniques, and that mastication negatively impacts bird communities, altering guild structure and reducing both diversity and abundance.

Lindenmayer, David B.; McBurney, Lachlan; Blair, David; Wood, Jeff; Banks, Sam C.				Journal of Applied Ecology	55	4		1626-1636	Jul 2018	2018				English	8	18	1. Forests world-wide are increasingly subject to natural and human disturbances, including wildfires and logging of varying intensity and frequency. Understanding how biodiversity responds to different kinds and combinations of natural and human disturbance is critical to enhanced forest management. 2. We completed an 8-year study of bird responses across a spectrum of disturbance types in Australian mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests following wildfires in 2009. 3. We found evidence of a gradient in bird species richness over the study duration. It was highest in unlogged and unburned (least disturbed) sites, decreasing through burnt unlogged forest (subject to high or low intensity fire), lower still in logged forest, and lowest in the most disturbed sites (subject to salvage logging without island retention). Retention of uncut islands within logged areas increased bird species richness above that found in areas that had been clearcut. 4. The greatest rate of increase per year after disturbance in bird species richness was on sites burnt by high-severity fire but which were not subject to any form of logging. The level of disturbance affected the composition of the bird assemblage. Sites that were unlogged and unburned were more likely to support species that were larger, more mobile, and nested at greater heights above the ground. 5. Synthesis and applications. All forms of logging on burned sites impaired recovery in bird species richness relative to sites subject to high-severity fire. Alterations in stand structure and plant species composition (and hence modification in bird habitat suitability) due to logging are the most likely reasons for reduced bird species richness and delayed patterns of recovery. This study highlights the importance for native bird species of retaining patches of unlogged forest not only within otherwise clearcut forest, but also in areas that are burned and subject to salvage logging. We therefore suggest that the adoption of retention harvesting be expanded to include stands disturbed by wildfires.

Our objective was to map abundance and provide a population estimate of black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains of South Dakota and Wyoming, USA. We conducted 3,666 and 3,384 5-minute point count surveys from late-March to late-June in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We characterized vegetation around each point using geographic information system-derived landscape variables and fit 3-level hierarchical time-removal models in R package unmarked using gmultmix. The global abundance model received the most support and included year, latitude, and percent area of green trees, beetle-killed trees, dead trees, 1- to 2-year-old wildfire, 3-year-old wildfire, and 4- to 5-year-old wildfire. Points with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees had the greatest density of black-backed woodpeckers, followed by 1- to 2-year-old wildfires. After 4 years, areas burned by wildfire supported lower densities of black-backed woodpeckers than undisturbed forests. Mean density was 0.528birds/km2 in 2015 and 0.626birds/km2 in 2016. There were an estimated 2,920 and 3,439 black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We suggest areas with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees may support high densities of black-backed woodpeckers and are important to sustaining populations when the availability of recent (<4 years old) wildfire is declining or scarce.

Munteanu, Catalina; Pidgeon, Anna M.; Radeloff, Volker C.				Biodiversity and Conservation	27	8		2051-2068	Jul 2018	2018				English	6	7	Land use change alters species' abundance and distributions by affecting habitat availability and quality. The decline of bird populations worldwide is of major concern, and habitat protection and restoration are primary conservation actions. However, conservation decisions largely consider only short-term habitat changes and species' population dynamics in a given area. Disregarding long term modifications in species' available habitat, and the role of a given population for a species' global population may lead to misdirected conservation action. Our goal here was to combine the assessment of conservation responsibility, with that of century-long available habitat dynamics, in order to inform better conservation practice. We compiled available habitat data for 170 bird species in the Carpathian Region from 1860 to 2010 from historic maps and satellite data. We analyzed these species' range distributions, IUCN extinction risk and population trends, and we identified 29 species of high conservation responsibility, and all of them were forest or and grassland specialists. Furthermore, we found major land use trends including cropland abandonment and increase in forests and grasslands that resulted in increases in potential habitat for the species for which the Carpathians have high conservation responsibility. The loss of row-crop agriculture, on the other hand, reduced habitat for species for which the Carpathians do not have high responsibility, and thus subsidizing agriculture may not be warranted from a conservation perspective. More broadly, many regions worldwide are undergoing rapid land use changes, and we suggest that these should be analyzed relative to a given regions' conservation responsibility to see if there are opportunities for conservation, i.e., cases similar to the Carpathians, where conservation efforts 'only' have to foster current land use trends, and make them permanent, rather than to try to revert the loss of habitat.

Ganesh, T.; Prashanth, M.B.				Ardea	106	1		19-29	Jun 2018	2018				English	0	0	The Indian subcontinent is a major wintering area for many migrant birds from Central Asia and Russia and has experienced unprecedented landscape changes over the last two decades. The effects of these changes on the population of bird communities, especially on raptors, are unknown or poorly assessed. Migrant harriers Circus spp. that require large open grassland, savannahs or sparse scrubland to roost and forage in their wintering quarters, have become scarce in recent times. The species composition and abundance of harriers at historically documented roost sites, when monitored across years, can provide valuable information on their demographic status since data from their possible breeding locations in Russia is not readily available. Here, we collate published and unpublished information on various harrier roosts using predefined protocols to assess trends in the counts of harriers in protected and unprotected sites across the Indian subcontinent. Harrier counts across all sites, both protected and unprotected, showed a declining trend over the period 1985-2015. Limited species-specific data from two sites show a significant decline in Western Marsh Harrier Circus aeruginosus but not in Pallid Harrier C. macrourus and Montagu's Harrier C. pygargus. These may be early signs of population declines at a continental scale, and we urge the development of more robust systematic ways, along with the current method, to monitor harrier populations. There is a need for improvement of international collaborations with researchers in the breeding areas to conduct studies on long range migrants and to set up a national conservation plan to protects harriers and grasslands.

Riquelme, Carlos; Hinojosa, Ana; Figueroa, Ricardo A.; Gonzalez-Acuna, Daniel				Gayana	82	1		40-64	Jun 2018	2018				Spanish	2	2	Between 2007 and 2008, we evaluated the seasonal richness, abundance and diversity of bird species in the Isla Mocha National Reserve, southern Chile. We recorded birds in point-count stations (radius = 50 m, length = 10 min) in five habitat types: coastline, pastureland, prairie with trees, forest-prairie ecotone, and Valdivian forest. We also include occasional records outside count points to determine species richness. In total, we recorded 70 species on the island. The habitat with higher species richness was the pastureland (29 species), followed by the forest-prairie ecotone, coastline (25 species, respectively), prairie with trees (21 species), and Valdivian forest (17 species). We did not detect seasonal patterns when we compared species richness among habitats. In all habitats, the abundance distribution among species showed the typical pattern of many organisms: few species were very or few abundant, and several had an intermediate abundance. However, the numerical dominance between species changed seasonally. The most regular species were Kelp Gull in the costline and pastureland, Chilean Lapwing in the pastureland, Black-chinned Siskin in the prairie with trees, Chilean Pigeon, Chucao Tapaculo and Thom-tailed Rayadito in the forest-prairie ecotone, and Chucao Tapaculo, Thom-tailed Rayadito, and Green-backed Firecrown in the Valdivian forest. All these species showed noticeable seasonal numerical fluctuations possibly caused by the recruitment of juveniles, reproductive congregation and/or variation in food availability. All habitats had a high diversity because they were rich in species and had high evenness among species regarding abundance. Avifaunally, the island Mocha represents a continental "slice" of southern Chile as the similarity in habitat diversity of this island to the mainland result in similar bird assemblages.

Landscape Ecology	33	6		895-910	Jun 2018	2018				English	15	31	In agricultural landscapes, small woodland patches can be important wildlife refuges. Their value in maintaining biodiversity may, however, be compromised by isolation, and so knowledge about the role of habitat structure is vital to understand the drivers of diversity. This study examined how avian diversity and abundance were related to habitat structure in four small woods in an agricultural landscape in eastern England. The aims were to examine the edge effect on bird diversity and abundance, and the contributory role of vegetation structure. Specifically: what is the role of vegetation structure on edge effects, and which edge structures support the greatest bird diversity? Annual breeding bird census data for 28 species were combined with airborne lidar data in linear mixed models fitted separately at (i) the whole wood level, and (ii) for the woodland edges only. Despite relatively small woodland areas (4.9-9.4 ha), bird diversity increased significantly towards the edges, being driven in part by vegetation structure. At the whole woods level, diversity was positively associated with increased vegetation above 0.5 m and especially with increasing vegetation density in the understorey layer, which was more abundant at the woodland edges. Diversity along the edges was largely driven by the density of vegetation below 4 m. The results demonstrate that bird diversity was maximised by a diverse vegetation structure across the wood and especially a dense understorey along the edge. These findings can assist bird conservation by guiding habitat management of remaining woodland patches.

Zawadzka, Dorota; Drozdowski, Stanislaw; Zawadzki, Grzegorz; Zawadzki, Jerzy; Mikitiuk, Artur				Polish Journal of Ecology	66	2		162-181	Jun 2018	2018				English	2	7	We assessed the assemblages of birds inhabiting pine-dominated managed forest, aged between 1-5 years and above 140 years. Birds were counted on study plots representing eight different phases to the forest's development, with nesting, foraging and migratory guild categories recognised. Numbers of bird species and population densities, both increased markedly with stand age (respectively r = 0.988 and r = 0.936, P < 0.001). While numbers of ground-nesting bird species failed to correlate with stand age, successively older stands did support ever-greater proportions of species in the assemblage that nested in tree crowns (r = 0.976, P < 0.005) or tree holes (r = 0.833, P < 0.005). Raptors were most abundant in forest at the oldest stages of growth, and there was an age-gradient-related increase in the shares of both plant-eating species (r = 0.952, P < 0.005) and raptors (r = 0.764, P < 0.005). Resident birds were most numerous in the oldest forest. PCA for ten selected variables (relating to guild type) showed that the two principal components explained almost 98% of the variation among groups of bird guilds in relation to forest age. On the basis of their suitability for birds it was possible to distinguish three categories of stand by age group, of which the first encompasses the initial stage, the second a broad interval involving middle-aged stands of between 16 and 140 years, and the third forest more than 140 years old. The presence of the oldest stands of all can thus be seen to play a very important role in maintaining high-diversity populations of birds in managed forest.

Farrell, Patrick D.; Baasch, David M.; Farnsworth, Jason M.; Smith, Chadwin B.				Avian Conservation and Ecology	13	1		1	Jun 2018	2018				English	3	4	The Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (PRRIP) and its partners invested substantial resources in creating and managing off-channel nesting habitat for Interior Least Terns (Sternula antillarum athalassos) and Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) along the central Platte River in Nebraska. Among other things, management activities implemented at nesting sites to increase nest and brood survival have included tree removal, construction of a water barrier surrounding the nesting areas, installation of predator fences, and predator trapping. We used 15 years of data at off-channel sites along the central Platte River to assess the influence of several biotic and abiotic variables on the survival of Interior Least Tern and Piping Plover nests and broods. We observed high survival rates for Interior Least Tern and Piping Plover nests and broods as two-thirds of Interior Least Tern and three-quarters of Piping Plover nests were successful and three-quarters of all Interior Least Tern and Piping Plover broods were successful. We found productivity of Interior Least Terns and Piping Plovers was reduced during both the nesting and brood-rearing stages by weather-related variables rather than variables the PRRIP can manage. As such, we conclude habitat management activities implemented at off-channel sites to date are sufficient for maintaining high levels of productivity for Interior Least Terns and Piping Plovers along the central Platte River.

Van Wilgenburg, Steven L.; Hobson, Keith A.; Kardynal, Kevin J.; Beck, Elizabeth M.				Avian Conservation and Ecology	13	1		3	Jun 2018	2018				English	10	15	The boreal forest provides important breeding habitat for many migratory songbirds; however, changes in disturbance regimes have led to concern for populations breeding there. Monitoring data to track changes in boreal forest bird populations are scarce. Therefore, we repeated surveys at historic research sites in aspen-dominated boreal mixedwood forest in central Saskatchewan, Canada, to test for changes in abundance in different forest age classes. We used GIS analyses and habitat data to test whether observed changes in abundance were correlated with within-stand changes in habitat over approximately 20 years. Eight of the ten species examined showed evidence for change in abundance. Trends from our study showed little correlation with regional trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and generally displayed greater magnitude and precision. Species associated with closedcanopy forests declined more rapidly than suggested by BBS surveys, whereas species associated with disturbance generally had opposite trends to the BBS. Decreased abundance of species such as Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) and Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronata) correlated with loss of forest cover from fire or harvesting. Conversely, changes in the abundance of species associated with early successional forest and canopy gaps were primarily correlated with within-stand disturbances (e.g., Magnolia Warbler (Setophaga magnolia)) and changes in the proportion of the stands composed of conifers (e.g., White-throated Sparrow (.Zonotrichia albicollis)). We suggest repeating historic surveys and comparing trends with other monitoring programs to provide a weight-of-evidence approach to assess overall support for changes in species' status for regions where data are sparse. Our results are consistent with previous studies that predict that changes in the forest age-class distribution could alter boreal forest bird abundance and community composition. Long-term conservation plans should integrate projected land-use and climate effects on boreal forest bird populations.

Tarbill, Gina L.; White, Angela M.; Manley, Patricia N.				Avian Conservation and Ecology	13	1		16	Jun 2018	2018				English	3	3	The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a snag-associated species that colonizes and utilizes patches of burned forests typically within 10 years of fire. Previous research has indicated that salvage logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species. In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following logging operations that covered 45% of the burned area. We systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year, which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed Woodpeckers postlogging.

Schulze, E.D.				Journal for Nature Conservation	43			213-226	Jun 2018	2018				English	38	48	This overview of relationships between biodiversity and management focuses on Central European Fagus forests. Present management and conservation activities are embedded in the geographic and historic background of Central European forest flora, including endangered, protected, and plant species for which Germany has taken special responsibility to ensure their future survival. Managed and unmanaged forests are compared with respect to plants and other organisms. Based on the floristic background, management for climate change and consequences of conservation on a global ecological footprint will be discussed. The Central European tree flora contains only about 7% of the tree diversity of East Asia. Only a few genera re-migrated to Central Europe after the Pleistocene, while others were lost during the Pleistocene, e.g. the genus Pseudotsuga. In this study the forest flora is characterized by specialized plant species that only grow in forests. These forest specialists contribute only 10% of the plant species of the total German flora. This fraction is even less (4-5%) for Romania which is generally regarded as a region with close to "natural" forest conditions. Also, the forest flora of Germany and Romania contains fewer apomictic and hybrid plant species than the non-forest flora. No forest plant species have gone extinct in Germany in the past 250 years, which is the time since the first floristic documentation of a plant species that was lost in Thuringia, despite intense forest use including changes in dominant tree species. With respect to the Natura 2000 goals of maintaining species diversity of Europe, the deciduous forest, as managed by rotation forestry, contain more protected and endangered species, and species for which Germany has taken responsibility than protected forest. Forests managed with permanent forest cover (so-called "management close-to-nature") contain fewer plant species than age-class (rotation) forestry. The abundance of dead wood-fungi and of soil bacteria is higher in rotation forest than in protected forests. For the initial phase of decay, a dead wood experiment identified two important tree species, Carpinus betulus and Picea abies, as the most preferred tree species for xylobionts. Carpinus has the most diverse fungal flora among all wood types and is a typical species for managed forests. The Natura 2000 habitat types were defined by plant species, but the assessment of ecosystem health is based on bird species in Central Europe. A time series extending from 1927 until 2015 indicates that most non-migratory forest bird species show an increasing abundance since 1970. Adding migrating and rare bird species populations resulted in constant average abundances since 1970. There is no evidence that sustainable forest management has led to decreased biodiversity in Central Europe. In view of climate change and increasing presence of tree diseases, Europe should avoid enlarging its ecological footprint by taking Central European forests out of management.

Taylor, J. Scott; Bogenschutz, Todd R.; Clark, William R.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	42	2		184-194	Jun 2018	2018				English	12	14	We describe ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) habitat needs, historical U.S. cropland conversion programs (CCPs), research documenting pheasant responses to these programs, and make policy recommendations for programs to more efficiently elicit such responses. Cropland conversion program principles supported in the pheasant literature include establishment of an initial seeding, a multiyear contract structure, prohibition of mowing during the nesting season, promotion of forbs in seedings, provision of large-block enrollments options, and inclusion of midcontract management. These principles are compatible with the habitat needs of many other grassland bird species. We therefore recommend the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and any future CCPs retain these foundational aspects. Initial plantings of higher diversity seed mixes have become prioritized over time, but we note whatever increase in average habitat quality these standards achieved, it was not enough to prevent widespread pheasant declines following more severe statutory limitations on CRP acreage enrollments beginning in 2008, coupled with long-term declines in other habitat types (e.g., hay, pasture, small grains). When faced with a trade-off, we thus recommend emphasis of enrolled area over quality, provided enrolled herbaceous tracts provide adequate structure (>=3dm of 100% visual obstruction) and canopy cover components (>5% forbs and >5% bare ground). Efficiencies may also be gained by altering initial seeding rates, offsetting program costs using grazing income, allowing more discretion in the use of midcontract management, and prioritizing enrollments in focus areas. Individual states, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and bird conservation joint ventures should work cooperatively to share data and perform return-on-investment-oriented research at multiple spatial scales concerning the effects of CCPs on pheasants.

Pejchar, Liba; Gallo, Travis; Hooten, Mevin B.; Daily, Gretchen C.				Diversity and Distributions	24	6		811-819	Jun 2018	2018				English	8	15	Aim: Ecological restoration is critical for recovering biodiversity and ecosystem services, yet designing interventions to achieve particular outcomes remains fraught with challenges. In the extensive regions where non-native species are firmly established, it is unlikely that historical conditions can be fully reinstated. To what degree, and how rapidly, can human-dominated areas be shifted via restoration into regimes that benefit target species, communities or processes? Location: We explore this question in a >20-year-old reforestation effort underway at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge in montane Hawaii. This large-scale planting of Acacia koa trees is designed to secure populations of globally threatened bird species by transitioning the site rapidly from pasture to native forest. Methods: We surveyed all forest birds in multiple corridors of young planted trees, remnant corridors of mature trees along gulches and at sites within mature forest. Using a Bayesian hierarchical approach, we identified which factors (distance from forest, habitat type and surrounding tree cover) had the most important influence on native and exotic bird abundance in the reforestation area. Results: We found that 90% of native and exotic bird species responded quickly, occupying corridors of native trees approximately a decade after planting. However, native and exotic forest birds responded to markedly different characteristics of the reforested area. Native bird abundance was strongly predicted by proximity to mature forest and remnant corridors; conversely, exotic bird abundance was best predicted by overall tree cover throughout the area reforested. Main conclusions: Our results demonstrate that large-scale tree planting in corridors adjacent to mature forest can catalyse rapid recovery (both increased abundance and expanded distribution) of forest birds and that it is possible to design reforestation to benefit native species in novel ecosystems.

We identified 11 mammal species and 16 bird species, including 1 Class I state key protected animal Syrmaticus ellioti and 4 Class II state key protected animals-Prionodon pardicolor, Macaca mulatta, Lophura nycthemera and Pitta nympha. Based on the relative abundance index (RAI), Leopoldamys edwardsi (RAI=15.22), Dremomys pyrrhomerus(RAI=9.58), Atherurus macrourus(RAI=1.46), Melogale moschata (RAI=1.04)and Callosciurus erythraeus(RAI=0.57) were ranked as the top five most abundant mammal specices. Myophoneus caeruleus (RAI=3.79), Lophura nycthemera (RAI=3.25), Zoothera citrine (RAI=0.45) and Zoothera dauma (RAI=0.45) were ranked as the top four most common bird species. In addition, Prionailurus bengalensis, Pitta nympha, Turdus rubrocanus, Turdus boulboul, Alcippe morrisonia, Chalcophaps indica and Blythipicus pyrrhotis were new species, recorded in the reserve for the first time.

Giosa, Efthymia; Mammides, Christos; Zotos, Savvas				PLoS ONE	13	5		e0197286	May 10 2018	2018				English	4	16	The degradation of natural wetlands has significant effects on the ecosystem services they provide and the biodiversity they sustain. Under certain conditions, these negative effects can be mitigated by the presence of artificial wetlands. However, the conservation value of artificial wetlands needs to be explored further. In addition, it is unclear how certain anthropogenic variables, such as road networks and hunting reserves (i.e., areas where hunting of birds is prohibited) affect biodiversity in both artificial and natural wetlands. Here, we use data from thirteen artificial and six natural wetlands in Cyprus, to assess their similarities in bird species diversity and composition, and to quantify the relationship between species diversity and the density of road networks, hunting reserves, wetland size, and wetland depth. We found that while on average natural wetlands have more species and support higher abundances, certain artificial wetlands have the potential to support similarly diverse communities. Overall, regardless of the type, larger wetlands, with shallower waters tend to be more biodiverse. The same is true for wetlands surrounded by a higher percentage of hunting reserves and a lower density of road networks, albeit the effect of road networks was weaker. We conclude, from our results, that although the conservation value of natural wetlands is higher, artificial wetlands have the potential to play a complimentary role in the conservation of bird communities, assuming those wetlands have the right characteristics (e.g., in terms of size and depth) and assuming that the disturbances resulting from highimpact human-activities (e.g., hunting) are minimized.

Diversite et abondance des oiseaux nicheurs des bocages en Pays de la Loire.	Pithon, Josephine; Beaujouan, Veronique; Geneves, Auriane; Pain, Guillaume				Ornithos	25	3		129-141	May 2018	2018				French	0	0	In 2014 and 2015 territory mapping of breeding birds was carried out in 29 pastures surrounded by hedgerows covering 85 ha in Pays Yon-et-Vie (Vendee) and to the west of Angers (Maine-et-Loire). The levels of richness and abundance observed seemed low, with a few generalist species dominating, although the Pays de la Loire region is renowned for the quality of its hedgerow and grassland networks. We compared our results with around forty other studies from the scientific or French naturalist literature, carried out in similar contexts, most however presenting lower ratios of hedgerow per unit area sampled. We observed higher levels of richness and abundance of nesting bird species (47 breeding species and 66 pairs per 10ha) than the mean values from the literature (40 and 33 per 10 ha, respectively). Many species, and in particular generalists, were present at higher than average densities, but lower than the maximum observed in the literature, except for Common Chaffinch, which attained higher levels of abundance than in any other study we consulted. The mean total breeding bird density declined with survey date, between 1963 and 2002. For most specialist species, of forest or especially farmland, observed densities were lower in Pays de la Loire than on average in the literature. Nonetheless, the levels of species richness and abundance of the community as a whole are amongst the highest and correspond to the levels observed in the oldest studies.

Salgueiro, Pedro A.; Mira, Antonio; Rabaca, Joao E.; Santos, Sara M.				Ecological Indicators	88			205-213	May 2018	2018				English	6	16	Landscapes are showing increased fragmentation and habitat loss due to land-use conversion and intensification, leading to species-poor and homogeneous communities. The identification of ecological thresholds above which major changes in community composition take place, may prevent the critical downfall of biodiversity while improving the effectiveness of conservation, resource management and restoration practices. In this study, we provide a new insight on how species distribute along a highly variegated agro-ecosystem in the Mediterranean region. We aim to define the thresholds of occurrence of a bird community inhabiting a tree canopy gradient, and determine the patterns of community change. We fit Huisman-Olff-Fresco models to bird occurrence data (assuming non-linear responses) to identify species-specific responses to the gradient, species richness, and turnover patterns. The tree canopy gradient is responsible for major changes in bird community likely related to the variation of the tree stratum and canopy enclosure which reflect different niche segregation opportunities. Maximum species richness was reached at 10% canopy cover while total turnover rate was higher than expected from a null model up to 10% canopy cover. Ecological thresholds can be used as indicators of specific resource limits responsible for changes in community composition and species occurrence, identifying where populations may be more sensitive. Choosing a single management scheme will invariably result in winners and losers, but optimal levels of management can be explored in order to maximize species diversity across Mediterranean agroecosystems.

Garabedian, James E.; Moorman, Christopher E.; Peterson, M. Nils; Kilgo, John C.				Condor	120	2		305-318	May 2018	2018				English	11	24	Understanding how the interplay between social behaviors and habitat structure influences space use is important for conservation of birds in restored habitat. We integrated fine-grained LiDAR-derived habitat data, spatial distribution of cavity trees, and spatially explicit behavioral observations in a multi-scale model to determine the relative importance of conspecific density, intraspecific interactions, and the distribution of cavities on space use by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) on 2 sites in South Carolina, USA. We evaluated candidate models using information theoretic methods. Top scale-specific models included effects of conspecific density and number of cavity tree starts within 200 m of Red-cockaded Woodpecker foraging locations, and effects of the number of intraspecific interactions within 400 m of Red-cockaded Woodpecker foraging locations. The top multi-scale model for 22 of 34 Red-cockaded Woodpecker groups included covariates for the number of groups within 200 m of foraging locations and LiDAR-derived habitat with moderate densities of large pines (Pinus spp.) and minimal hardwood overstory. These results indicate distribution of neighboring groups was the most important predictor of space use once a minimal set of structural habitat thresholds was reached, and that placing recruitment clusters as little as 400 m from foraging partitions of neighboring groups may promote establishment of new breeding groups in unoccupied habitat. The presence of neighboring groups likely provides cues to foraging Red-cockaded Woodpeckers that facilitate prospecting prior to juvenile dispersal and, to a lesser extent, indicates high-quality forage resources. Careful consideration of local distribution of neighboring groups in potential habitat may improve managers' ability to increase Red-cockaded Woodpecker density on restored landscapes and mitigate isolation of Red-cockaded Woodpecker groups, a problem that negatively affects fitness across the species' range.

De Camargo, Rafael X.; Boucher-Lalonde, Veronique; Currie, David J.				Diversity and Distributions	24	5		629-639	May 2018	2018				English	7	23	AimIt is usually thought that habitat fragmentation acts negatively on species survival, and consequently, on biodiversity. Recent literature challenges whether habitat fragmentation per se affects species richness, beyond the effect of habitat area. Theoretical studies have suggested that fragmentation may matter most when the amount of available habitat is small or at intermediate levels. However, a recent review suggests that the effect of fragmentation on species richness is usually positive. Here, we dissect the richness-fragmentation relationship. What is the effect size? Does it depend upon the amount of habitat cover? How do individual species respond to fragmentation? MethodsApplying a macroecological approach, we empirically related avian richness and the probability of occurrence (pocc) of individual species to fragmentation (number of patches), after controlling for habitat amount in 991 landscapes, each 100-km2, in southern Ontario, Canada. ResultsSpecies richness was strongly related to total habitat amount, but habitat fragmentation had no detectable additional effect. Individual species' pocc related strongly to habitat amount. For some species, pocc also related secondarily to habitat fragmentation within landscapes. Logistic models revealed that pocc related significantly negatively to fragmentation after controlling for habitat amount for only 13% of forest- and 18% of open-habitat species bird species. However, pocc related significantly positively to fragmentation for even greater proportions of species, including some red-listed species. Fragmentation effects were not stronger at low or intermediate levels of habitat amount within landscapes. ConclusionIn earlier studies, negative effects of isolation were observed at the patch level in experimental manipulations. However, at the landscape level, avian species richness in southern Ontario apparently responds primarily to habitat amount and negligibly to fragmentation. We argue that the evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis that reducing habitat fragmentation per se would be an effective conservation strategy for birds at the landscape level.

We explored the current land cover in areas of high species richness of woodpeckers to determinate regions where urgent conservation actions are needed. In addition, we identified woodpecker species that are sensitive to forest loss and that have high levels of human habitat modification and low levels of protection (through protected areas) in their distribution ranges. LocationGlobal. MethodsWe joined available range maps for all extant 254 woodpecker species with information of their conservation status and tolerances to human habitat modifications and generated a richness map of woodpecker species worldwide. Then, we associated this information (the richness pattern and individual species' maps) with land cover and protected areas (PAs) maps. ResultWe found that the foremost woodpecker species richness hotspot is in Southeast Asia and is highly modified. At the second species richness hotspot in the eastern Andes, we observed a front of deforestation at its southern extreme and a greater deforested area in its northern extreme but most of its area remains with forest coverage. At the species level, 17 species that are sensitive to forest modification experience extensive deforestation and have low extents of PAs in their ranges. Main conclusionsThe most diverse woodpecker hotspots are mostly occupied by human-modified landscapes, and a large portion of the species there avoids anthropogenic environments. The level of representation of woodpecker species in PAs is low as a global general pattern, although slightly better in Asia. Our global analysis of threats to woodpecker from land use patterns reiterates the urgent conservation needs for Southeast Asian forests. Finally, based on our results, we recommend a re-evaluation for inclusion in the Red List of five woodpecker species.

Journal of Wildlife Management	82	4		682-697	May 2018	2018				English	24	42	The 3 spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) subspecies in North America (i.e., northern spotted owl (S. o. caurina), California spotted owl (S. o. occidentalis), Mexican spotted owl (S. o. lucida)) have all experienced population declines over the past century due to habitat loss and fragmentation from logging. Now, the emerging influences of climate change, high-severity fire, and barred owl (Strix varia) invasion also appear to be synergistically and differentially affecting population trends of each subspecies. Our objective was to review the existing literature on the spotted owl to describe historical and emerging threats and whether those threats have been adequately examined for each subspecies. Using 527 publications from a Web of Science search of the literature from 1900-2015, we statistically evaluated the emphasis placed on each subspecies regarding 4 influences: mechanical tree removal, fire, climate change, and barred owl invasion. There were 98 papers that explicitly examined the effects of 1 of these influences. Most of these papers were focused on the northern spotted owl, and for all 3 subspecies, most papers examined short-term effects only. We used our results to identify significant information gaps relative to historical and emerging threats. Commercial timber harvesting remains a potential threat for all 3 spotted owl subspecies, but effects from forest thinning may be increasing because of the heightened emphasis on fuels reduction and forest restoration treatments on public lands. Owl response to mechanical tree removal, especially forest thinning, remains understudied. Climate change also may threaten all 3 subspecies. Changes in climate likely affect survival and reproduction of spotted owls and their prey, and alter habitat availability by affecting disturbance regimes and vegetation composition and succession, but little empirical information is available describing specific responses to climate change. The literature on response to high-severity fire is sparse for some subspecies, primarily short-term in nature, and not consistent. Barred owl invasion is a major threat to the northern spotted owl and the California spotted owl but does not currently threaten the Mexican spotted owl. Rigorous research on the response of spotted owls to all factors influencing population change, particularly for the Mexican spotted owl, is needed. The most useful information for predicting owl response to these threats stems primarily from long-term studies of owl demography. The lack of such studies within the range of the Mexican spotted owl greatly limits our understanding of its population dynamics and our ability to predict the effects of various threats on Mexican spotted owl populations. For all 3 subspecies, we encourage long-term studies of their responses to threats, using uniquely marked owls across large spatial extents to account for spatiotemporal variability in ecological conditions within and among subspecies.

Moreno-Opo, Ruben; Pique, Josep				PeerJ	6			e4518	Apr 24 2018	2018				English	3	4	Resolving human-wildlife conflicts requires the assessment and implementation of appropriate technical measures that minimize negative impacts on socio-economic uses, including agriculture, and ensure the adequate protection of biological diversity. Rice paddies are widely distributed in the western Mediterranean region. Because of their high productivity, they can be a good habitat for waterbirds, including the purple swamphen Porphyrio porphyrio, particularly in areas where natural wetlands have been removed or reduced. As a result of its population growth, there have been increasing levels of damage caused by this species in rice fields due to stem-cutting and opening of bald patches in rice fields. With the aim of reducing damage, we evaluated the effectiveness of passive and active measures that would limit access to rice fields and deter/scare away purple swamphens in affected areas of the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). We selected the techniques according to the growth phase of rice and the activity of birds in the rice fields (perimeter fences and clearing vegetation around the rice plots during sprouting and growing phases, and falconry at maturation). There were positive results during the sprouting and growing phases thanks to fences and clearing vegetation, reducing the affected area by 37.8% between treatment and control plots. This would mean an economic savings of 18,550 V/year in compensation payments by regional administrations including the investment in implementing and maintaining passive protection measures. Active deterrence through falconry did not reduce the level of damage. The analysis of purple swamphen home range, activity centers (centroids), and the proportion of locations in and outside of rice fields showed no differences before and after dissuasive practices. These results were influenced by multiple concurrent factors including weather, the structural configuration of the rice plots and their location. In summary, we recommend the establishment of protection measures (perimeter fences + clearing vegetation around the rice plots) to reduce the level of damage.

Helms, Jackson A.; Woerner, Christopher R.; Fawzi, Nurul I.; MacDonald, Andrew; Juliansyah; Pohnan, Erica; Webb, Kinari				Tropical Conservation Science	11			1-8	Apr 18 2018	2018				English	0	0	The island of Borneo suffers from one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, primarily due to agriculture, logging, and other human activities. This habitat loss may be partly mitigated by reforestation programs in degraded landscapes, especially anthropogenic grasslands that have little conservation or economic value. By monitoring native bird communities, we evaluated the success of two small (<20 ha) community reforestation projects in Gunung Palung National Park in Indonesian Borneo. Birds responded rapidly following reforestation, with species richness doubling over 7 years at one site, and increasing by 29% in just 3 years at the other Final tallies (63-70 species per site) were comparable to those obtained in older secondary forests elsewhere in Borneo. Anthropogenic fire is the primary threat to reforestation success, but intensive fire prevention allows bird communities to recover from temporary setbacks. Absence of fire was thus the most important factor in recovery, and we detected no effect of replanted area on bird species richness. Our results suggest that by engaging local communities and ensuring long-term maintenance, even small reforestation sites in Borneo can provide immediate benefits for native biodiversity.

Swanteson-Franz, Rachel J.; Krofcheck, Daniel J.; Hurteau, Matthew D.				ECOSPHERE	9	4		e02191	Apr 2018	2018				English	6	11	Uncertainty remains about whether current rates of forest carbon uptake will be maintained with on-going climate change and increasing rates of disturbance. The potential exists for climate and disturbance to exceed the physiological tolerances of certain tree species and push forest ecosystems to a point where they become C sources. Thus, a diversity of tree species with a range of physiological tolerances could provide adaptive capacity and potentially sustain a C sink despite adverse abiotic influences. The fire-prone pine forests of the southeastern USA have been impacted by a combination of land use and fire exclusion, which has altered the demographics and composition of these historically diverse forests. We sought to quantify how prescribed fire and planting of climate-resilient tree species would alter forest carbon dynamics under projected climate change at Fort Benning, Georgia. This landscape is comprised of a diversity of forest types with a range of land-use histories and is heavily managed to meet military training objectives and federally listed species habitat requirements. We used a simulation approach to determine species-specific growth responses to projected climate and develop two management scenarios: no-management and prescribed fire coupled with planting. We ran landscape simulations of these two management scenarios under climate projections from ten global climate models to quantify how active management would alter forest carbon dynamics as a function of changing climate and wildfire. We found that the prescribed fire and plant scenario increased total ecosystem carbon (TEC) over our no-management scenario by over 20 Mg C/m2 by late century. Despite the differences in TEC, differences in net ecosystem exchange were not realized over the entire simulation. The primary drivers of TEC differences were sustained carbon uptake and lower carbon loss to wildfire in the prescribed fire and plant scenario. Our results demonstrate that under projected climate, managing to reduce the impacts of fire and planting climate-adapted species can increase the mitigation potential of these forests.

Lacko, Jozef; Topercer, Jan; Sul'ovsky, Marek				Acta Oecologica	88			29-40	Apr 2018	2018				English	10	21	We studied how interactions between disturbances, succession, human alterations and other habitat and landscape attributes affect bird community patterns in a lower reach of a large West Carpathian river Vah with complex disturbance and alteration histories. Breeding-bird communities, their habitats (54 variables) and surrounding landscapes (11 metrics) were sampled using standardized point counts with limited distances at 40 riparian sites divided among two transects along a 12.9 km river stretch. The most frequent and abundant birds were generalists typically associated with forest edge habitats, such as Parus major, Sylvia atTicapilla, Fringilla coelebs, Oriolus oriolus, Phylloscopus collybita, Sturnus vulgaris, Turdus merula and Luscinia megarhynchos. Abundances show significant increase at the lower transect responding apparently to greater size and heterogeneity of riparian habitats and more abundant food supply linked to more diverse and intense human influences in a suburban zone. Both indirect (NMDS) and direct ordination (CCA) revealed remarkably large number of evenly important factors underlying riparian bird-habitat interactions. It suggests considerable environmental heterogeneity and complexity of these interactions as a likely outcome of long and complex disturbance and alteration histories of the area. Yet structure and relative importance of first two gradients (longitudinal and lateral linkages) remains simple and stable, complying well with predictions of river continuum concept and stream ecosystem theory. Of the nine statistically significant variables most strongly correlated with first two CCA axes, percentages of Helianthus tuberosus, footpaths, fields, Calystegia sepium and steep banks uphold our hypotheses predicting significant effects of invasive species, visitor disturbances, agricultural land use and unaltered river banks/bed on bird community composition and structure. A small but significant contribution of patch size standard deviation within a 150 m radius to the CCA model provides the sole evidence for a hypothesized effect of adjacent terrestrial landscapes on riparian bird communities over different scales of patch size variability. Percentages of fields, invasive species and vertical banks along with average tree diameter were also the most productive predictors across our generalized linear models of riparian bird species diversity, evenness and abundance. Adopting an integrated river basin management, maintaining or restoring both longitudinal and lateral connectivity, taking advantage of natural processes and traditional management practices to maintain or restore riverine biodiversity can be recommended by our data in support of more systematic and evidence-based decision-making.

Ecological Applications	28	3		771-785	Apr 2018	2018				English	6	14	Environmental pollution is an important driver of biodiversity loss. Yet, to date, the effects of chemical exposure on wildlife populations have been quantified for only a few species, mainly due to a lack of appropriate laboratory data to quantify chemical impacts on vital rates. In this study, we developed a method to quantify the effects of toxicant exposure on wildlife population persistence based on field monitoring data. We established field-based vital-rate-response functions for toxicants, using quantile regression to correct for the influences of confounding factors on the vital rates observed, and combined the response curves with population viability modelling. We then applied the method to quantify the impact of DDE on three bird species: the White-tailed Eagle, Bald Eagle, and Osprey. Population viability was expressed via five population extinction vulnerability metrics: population growth rate (r1), critical patch size (CPS), minimum viable population size (MVP), probability of population extirpation (PE), and median time to population extirpation (MTE). We found that past DDE exposure concentrations increased population extirpation vulnerabilities of all three bird species. For example, at DDE concentrations of 25mg/kg wet mass of egg (the maximum historic exposure concentration reported in literature for the Osprey), r1 became small (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey) or close to zero (Bald Eagle), the CPS increased up to almost the size of Connecticut (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey) or West Virginia (Bald Eagle), the MVP increased up to approximately 90 (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey) or 180 breeding pairs (Bald Eagle), the PE increased up to almost certain extirpation (Bald Eagle) or only slightly elevated levels (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey) and the MTE became within decades (Bald Eagle) or remained longer than a millennium (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey). Our study provides a method to derive species-specific field-based response curves of toxicant exposure, which can be used to assess population extinction vulnerabilities and obtain critical levels of toxicant exposure based on maximum permissible effect levels. This may help conservation managers to better design appropriate habitat restoration and population recovery measures, such as reducing toxicant levels, increasing the area of suitable habitat or reintroducing individuals.

This has led to national and international conservation strategies aimed at restoring habitat extent and improving functional connectivity (i.e., maintaining dispersal processes). However, biodiversity responses to landscape-scale habitat creation and the relative importance of spatial and temporal scales are poorly understood, and there is disagreement over which conservation strategies should be prioritized. We used 160 years of historic post-agricultural woodland creation as a natural experiment to evaluate biodiversity responses to habitat creation in a landscape context. Birds were surveyed in 101 secondary, broadleaf woodlands aged 10-160 years with >=80% canopy cover and in landscapes with 0-17% broadleaf woodland cover within 3000 m. We used piecewise structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect relationships between bird abundance and diversity, ecological continuity, patch characteristics, and landscape structure and quantified the relative conservation value of local and landscape scales for bird communities. Ecological continuity indirectly affected overall bird abundance and species richness through its effects on stand structure, but had a weaker influence (effect size near 0) on the abundance and diversity of species most closely associated with woodland habitats. This was probably because woodlands were rapidly colonized bywoodland generalists in <=10 years (minimum patch age) but were on average too young (median 50 years) to be colonized by woodland specialists. Local patch characteristics were relatively more important than landscape characteristics for bird communities. Based on our results, biodiversity responses to habitat creation depended on local-and landscape-scale factors that interacted across time and space. We suggest that there is a need for further studies that focus on habitat creation in a landscape context and that knowledge gained from studies of habitat fragmentation and loss should be used to inform habitat creation with caution because the outcomes are not necessarily reciprocal.

Sadoti, Giancarlo; Johnson, Kristine; Smith, Jacqueline W.; Petersen, Nathan				Journal of Arid Environments	151			49-57	Apr 2018	2018				English	8	21	Changes in the structure, composition, and distribution of desert vegetation have resulted in altered desert bird communities. One of the most well-known influences on bird diversity and abundance in these ecosystems is the degree of woody shrub dominance. While the influence of vegetation structure and composition gradients on Chihuahuan Desert bird communities of North America has received valuable attention, seasonal variation in these influences is poorly understood. Our goal was to understand how vegetation gradients across space influence bird communities over four seasonal periods. We employed three years of avian survey data and static, spatial vegetation data in generalized linear mixed-effects models, identifying effects of (1) shrub cover in predicting shrubland bird species richness and abundance, (2) grass cover in predicting grassland bird abundance, and (3) grass height in predicting grassland and shrubland species richness and abundance. Effect sizes varied by season, with grass heights exhibiting (1) greatest positive effects on grassland species in the breeding season and (2) greatest negative effects on shrubland species in the winter. In targeting management for birds of the Chihuahuan Desert and other arid regions, managers should consider both bird-habitat associations and the variation in these relationships between seasons.

Lindtner, Peter; Ujhazy, Karol; Svitok, Marek; Kubovcik, Vladimir				Mammal Research	63	2		223-229	Apr 2018	2018				English	3	8	Disturbances are important natural factors affecting biological diversity, community composition, and ecosystem structure. The European ground squirrel is a semi-fossorial organism, and through disturbances caused by burrowing activities, it can play an important role as an ecosystem engineer of grasslands in central and south-eastern Europe. The aim of this study was to assess the response of grassland vegetation to disturbances by the European ground squirrel. We conducted a pairwise survey within a 1-ha study site with homogenous environmental conditions. We compared the vegetation characteristics of 2 x 2-m plots placed on 30 mounds, with paired control plots situated at a distance of 10 m from each mound. The results showed that plots disturbed by the European ground squirrel achieved a higher species richness and diversity and a distinct species composition compared to the undisturbed control plots. Vertical structure of vegetation was also significantly different with a higher proportion of the high and medium vegetation layers on the mounds. Shifts in the composition of plant life forms and life strategies were reflected by the reduction of graminoids and plant competitors, and support of forbs on the mounds. These findings suggest that the European ground squirrel helps to maintain heterogeneity in grassland ecosystems and creates patches of higher diversity and higher structural complexity in the relatively homogenous grassland vegetation of the Western Carpathians.

Neotropical Entomology	47	2		161-170	Apr 2018	2018				English	12	41	Augmentation biological control has successfully replaced a lot of insecticide use in 'closed system' agriculture (e.g., greenhouses). The profitable commercialization of biocontrol agents in greenhouses has created an incentive to expand markets for mass-reared beneficial insects into open agricultural systems, often without sufficient scientific justification. However, the semi-contained nature of greenhouse culture is often critical to the success of augmentation and can serve to mask potential pitfalls and intrinsic limitations of this approach in open systems. Factors contributing to greenhouse successes include the reduced biological diversity of contained agroecosystems, the prevention of agent dispersal, the ability to maintain environmental conditions within a range favorable for the agent, the exclusion of competitors and natural enemies of the agent that might otherwise diminish its efficacy, and the absence of alternative prey/hosts that could divert predation/parasitism from the target pest. There are also problems arising from collection of source material from locally adapted populations, and the inadvertent imposition of artificial selection in the course of laboratory rearing. Besides highlighting these pitfalls, this paper aims to encourage more consideration of conservation approaches prior to investment in augmentation programs which entice farmers into perpetual cycles of 'rear and release.' I argue that although augmentation can benefit agriculture whenever it replaces pesticide applications, it does not constitute an ecologically sustainable solution because it requires continued inputs, and it can distract research attention away from more sustainable objectives. Sustainable biological control is best achieved through modifications to cultural practices that increasingly 'naturalize' agroecosystems, thus facilitating the natural recruitment and persistence of beneficial arthropod fauna, combined with habitat management geared to increasing overall plant and arthropod diversity in the agroecosystem.

De La Hera, Ivan; Fandos, Guillermo; Fernandez-Lopez, Javier; Onrubia, Alejandro; Perez-Rodriguez, Anton; Perez-Tris, Javier; Luis Telleria, Jose				Ibis	160	2		355-364	Apr 2018	2018				English	4	16	Mediterranean woodlands and associated shrub formations of southern Iberia are key habitats for conservation of migratory birds. In some bird species, migratory and sedentary conspecifics meet in these areas during winter, but our understanding of how each population group is distributed over available habitats and the factors that determine their spatial organization are still unclear. This seriously limits our ability to assess their vulnerability to ongoing environmental changes affecting wintering habitats in this region. We used hydrogen isotopic signatures of feathers (Df) to shed light on the habitat distribution of seasonally sympatric European Robin Erithacus rubecula populations wintering in Campo de Gibraltar that are currently facing a drastic decline. In contrast to previous studies that used morphological methods to distinguish the migratory behaviour of wintering Robins in this area, our isotopic approach revealed that sedentary Robins were not outcompeted upon the arrival of migrants and remained in the woodlands where they reproduce, which agrees with results obtained in other regions. Interestingly, we also found that migratory Robins with a closer breeding origin (higher Df values) had a higher probability of occupying woodlands than did migrants coming from further away. Overall, our results suggest that the role of breeding origin in shaping the distribution of Robins during winter in Campo de Gibraltar is more relevant than the effects of sex, age or body size, which might facilitate the evolution of local adaptations for the exploitation of each habitat type.

Assandri, Giacomo; Bogliani, Giuseppe; Pedrini, Paolo; Brambilla, Mattia				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	256			200-210	Mar 15 2018	2018				English	33	95	Agriculture, during its millenarian history, had contributed to shape impressive cultural landscapes; however, in recent decades, many of these have been lost or degraded because of widespread intensification or abandonment. Low-intensive agricultural landscapes are of utmost importance for biodiversity conservation and the delivery of cultural ecosystem services. We worked in a cultural landscape shaped by viticulture (in Trentino, Italy), which recently underwent a widespread intensification. We explicitly quantified two cultural services (aesthetic and cultural heritage values), and the biodiversity (bird species richness) associated with this landscape at 24 sampling sites. We then related these variables with the territory density of an indicator/flagship bird species, the common redstart. Finally, we assessed redstart ecological requirements at the territory scale. We aimed to define an appealing strategy combining biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service delivery in the cultural landscapes. Redstart density was positively related with avian species richness and landscape aesthetic value, the latter being related with the cultural heritage value. Redstart occurrence was positively associated with hedge and tree rows, dry-stone walls, marginal habitats, and the compositional diversity of the land-cover. We concluded that managing the agricultural landscape to maintain aesthetic and heritage values, which primarily means conserving and enhancing its key 'traditional' traits, would favour an indicator/flagship species and likely the wider bird diversity. It will also promote the heritage and recreational value of the landscape itself, underlining the importance of the synergistic integration of multiple conservation targets into a combined strategy.

Dybala, Kristen E.; Engilis, Andrew, Jr; Trochet, John A.; Engilis, Irene E.; Truan, Melanie L.				Ecological Restoration	36	1		76-85	Mar 2018	2018				English	2	2	Restoration of river processes and riparian vegetation is a high priority, particularly in the western United States, where it provides critical habitat for fish and wildlife along with many other environmental and economic benefits, yet few studies have quantified long-term responses of wildlife. We evaluated responses of the breeding bird community to restoration and management of the lower Putah Creek watershed in the Central Valley of California following the establishment of the Putah Creek Accord in 2000, an historic agreement designed to improve ecosystem structure and function and protect the livelihoods of farmers and residents along the lower creek. We surveyed the breeding bird community at 14 sites distributed over 38 km of the creek between 1999 and 2012, and we detected significant increases in the abundance of 27 breeding bird species as well as increases in the size and diversity of the entire breeding bird community, which could not be accounted for by broader regional trends or the influence of local nest box installation. Further, changes in the watershed favored riparian and woodland-associated species over synanthropic species. However, in comparison with Central Valley Joint Venture density objectives for seven riparian focal bird species, there is still considerable room for improvement, particularly at sites farthest downstream. Overall, our results echo shifts in the Putah Creek fish community and provide evidence that the Putah Creek Accord and subsequent management actions have contributed to a long-term improvement in riparian ecosystem condition for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms.

Buehlmann, Jost; Lueseher, Stephan; Mueller, Mathis				Ornithologische Beobachter	115	1		1-10	Mar 2018	2018				German	0	0	In 2005, oak forests of the canton of Thurgau were searched for the first time for Middle Spotted Woodpeckers. In 2015, we surveyed the same forests and some new locations using the same method. A total of 244 territories of Middle Spotted Woodpeckers were found, and the population has increased by 119 territories or 95 % since 2005. However, the increase in the canton of Thurgau was only about half as large as in the canton of Zurich. The low population density in the central part of the Seerucken is a cause for concern, with populations at Mammern and Ilardli showing the only declines observed. As a result, the Seerucken is still only weakly connected with the populations in western Thurgau. In the forest reserv es and areas for promotion of oaks, and their surroundings, we found 123 territories in 2015. which corresponds to about half of the population. Measures such as the establishment of forest reserves, for example in floodplains, and of areas for promotion of oaks should be continued. Another important aspect is the further promotion of deadwood that may sene woodpeckers for searching food and for the construction of nesting cates.

Darrah, Abigail J.; van Riper, Charles, III				Biological Invasions	20	3		709-720	Mar 2018	2018				English	4	20	Biocontrol of invasive tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) in the arid Southwest using the introduced tamarisk beetle (Diorhabda elongata) has been hypothesized to negatively affect some breeding bird species, but no studies to date have documented the effects of beetle-induced defoliation on riparian bird abundance. We assessed the effects of tamarisk defoliation by monitoring defoliation rates, changes in vegetation composition, and changes in density of six obligate riparian breeding bird species at two sites along the Dolores River in Colorado following the arrival of tamarisk beetles. We conducted bird point counts from 2010 to 2014 and modeled bird density as a function of native vegetation density and extent of defoliation using hierarchical distance sampling. Maximum annual defoliation decreased throughout the study period, peaking at 32-37% in 2009-2010 and dropping to 0.5-15% from 2011-2014. Stem density of both tamarisk and native plants declined throughout the study period until 2014. Density of all bird species declined throughout most of the study, with Song Sparrow disappearing from the study sites after 2011. Blue Grosbeak, Yellow-breasted Chat, and Yellow Warbler densities were negatively related to defoliation in the previous year, while Lazuli Bunting exhibited a positive relationship with defoliation. These findings corroborate earlier predictions of species expected to be sensitive to defoliation as a result of nest site selection. Tamarisk defoliation thus had short-term negative impacts on riparian bird species; active restoration may be needed to encourage the regrowth of native riparian vegetation, which in the longer-term may result in increased riparian bird density.

Stanton, R.L.; Morrissey, C.A.; Clark, R.G.				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	254			244-254	Feb 15 2018	2018				English	18	75	Globally, agriculture has intensified during the past 50 years due to increased mechanization, changes in the dining of fanning operations, grassland conversion to cropland, and increased agrochemical inputs. Birds associated with farmlands and grasslands in North America have experienced severe declines over the last several decades, prompting the need for a comprehensive review of the drivers, mechanisms and magnitude of effects on bird populations. Here we evaluated changes in North American farmland bird populations over time and conducted a systematic review and analysis of the published literature to identify the major causes. Based on North American Breeding Bird Survey data, populations of 57 of 77 (74%) farmland-associated species decreased from 1966 to 2013. Multiple species exhibited highly congruent declines during the 1960s-1980s - a period with rapid changes in fanning practices to low tillage systems, heavy pesticide use and widespread conversion of grassland habitat to cropland. The most severe declines occurred in aerial insectivorous birds (average change of - 39.5% from 1966 to 2013), followed by grassland (-20.8%) and shrubland (-16.5%) bird species. Direct agricultural drivers impacting bird abundance, survival, and reproduction include loss of natural habitats, interference from farming equipment, and direct mortality or sublethal effects from pesticide exposure. Subtle interference with behaviour or physiology are reported through indirect drivers such as reduced food supplies, sublethal pesticide toxicity, habitat fragmentation and alteration, and disturbance. Indirect effects are likely significant for many species, particularly aerial insectivores, but detailed mechanistic studies are lacking. Our review of 122 studies found that pesticides (42% of all studies), followed by habitat loss or alterations (27%), were most predominant in negatively affecting farmland birds, with pesticides (93% negative) and mowing/harvesting (81% negative) having the most consistently negative effects. Modifications to farmland management such as reducing pesticide inputs through integrated pest management and maintaining or restoring uncultivated field margins and native habitat could positively influence farmland birds without significantly reducing agricultural crop yields.

Stevens, Kate; Harrisson, Katherine A.; Hogan, Fiona E.; Cooke, Raylene; Clarke, Rohan H.				ECOSPHERE	9	2		e02114	Feb 2018	2018				English	2	9	Understanding the effects of landscape modification on gene flow of fauna is central to informing conservation strategies that promote functional landscape connectivity and population persistence. We explored the effects of large-scale habitat loss and fragmentation on spatial and temporal patterns of gene flow in a threatened Australian woodland bird: the Grey-crowned Babbler Pomatostomus temporalis. Using microsatellite data, we (1) investigated historical (i.e., pre-fragmentation) and contemporary (i.e., postfragmentation) levels of gene flow among subpopulations and/or regions, (2) identified first-generation migrants and likely dispersal events, (3) tested for signatures of genetic bottlenecks, (4) estimated contemporary and historical effective population sizes, and (5) explored the relative influences of drift and migration in shaping contemporary population structure. Results indicated that the functional connectivity of landscapes used by the Grey-crowned Babbler is severely compromised in the study area. The proportion of individuals that were recent immigrants among all subpopulations were low. Habitat fragmentation has led to a clear division between subpopulations in the east and west, and the patterns of gene flow exchange between these two regions have changed over time. The effective population size estimates for these two regions are now well below that required for long-term population viability (Ne<100). Demographic history models indicate that genetic drift was a greater influence on subpopulations than gene flow, and most subpopulations show signatures of bottlenecks. Translocations to promote gene flow and boost genetic diversity in the short term and targeted habitat restoration to improve landscape functional connectivity in the long term represent promising conservation management strategies that will likely have benefits for many other woodland bird species.

However, baselines for management guidelines aimed at mitigating the impacts of working landscapes on biodiversity are lacking for the most biodiverse regions in the world. In addition, there is a scarcity of empirical examples of how information collected using community based approaches can be used to both define management guidelines and measure outcomes for sustainability. In this study, we used bird observations collected by community monitors to identify the functional relationships between bird occupancy and habitat traits to inform management of productive landscapes. Our results indicated that relationships between bird occupancy and habitat traits depended on species residence status and their affinity to urban-cropfield areas. Percentage of shrub cover was found to significantly influence the probability of occurrence across bird species in the landscape, followed by tree diameter, tree species richness, and time since anthropogenic disturbance. Tree species richness was the only habitat trait that was found to have a positive relationship across all species groups. Seasonal variation in the number of bird species related to habitat traits was only important for shrub cover. Following our results, we identified specific management targets for current land use categories (i.e., conservation forests, forestry plots, urban-cropfield areas) to benefit birds. Overall, we concluded that selective forestry management was not entirely detrimental for birds, as it preserves habitat heterogeneity and vegetation structure. In contrast, intensive forestry management was found to be unfavorable for most bird species, likely driven by the clearing of critical vegetation from the area. Our participatory approach for defining research objectives and collecting data to directly inform management guidelines for communal lands, while using robust analytical tools, shows great potential for promoting sustainable working landscapes in biodiverse regions across the globe.

Liu Shengdong; Meng Xin; Meng Qingfan; Li Yan; Zhao Hongrui; Gao Wentao				Scientia Silvae Sinicae	54	2		110-118	Feb 2018	2018				Chinese	0	0	(Objective)The broad-leaved Korean pine forests were typical zonal forest community in eastern forest areas in northeast China, with high biological diversity. In this paper, we systematically investigated species composition and diversity of ground-dwelling beetles in the different stands of broad-leaved Korean pine forests, and revealed the influence of stand types and stand factors on diversity of ground-dwelling beetles, in order to evaluate the role of natural forests in the protection of ground-dwelling beetles, and provide a scientific basis for the formulation of forest management plans based on the protection and utilization of the ground-dwelling beetles. (Method) In the active period of ground-dwelling beetles during 2012 and 2013, the beetles were traped by using pitfall traps at four stands in Jiaohe district, Jilin Province. The influences of stand types and stand factors, including canopy density, stand age, litter thickness, herb coverage, stems per hectare, and shrub coverage, on the diversity of the beetles were analyzed. (Result) Totally 9 849 specimens of ground -dwelling beetles were catched and they belong to 79 species of 22 families. The dominant groups included Carabidae, Silphidae and Staphylinidae, in which Pterostichus acutiden (Coleoptera: Carabidae) was the most dominant species. Species compositions of the ground-dwelling beetles were different in different stands. Their diversity was higher in the broad-leaved Korean pine forests (A and B) than the poplar-birch forest and the ash-walnut forest. It was showed that there was a significant negative correlation between individual and evenness of ground-dwelling beetles, and the similarity coefficient was highest between broad-leaved Korean pine forest A and broad-leaved Korean pine forest B. The individual number of Carabidae, Silphidae, Staphylinidae was significantly different in different stands. It was significantly greater in the broad-leaved Korean pine forest (A and B) in than the poplar-birch forest and ash-walnut forest. Carabidae had slightly higher adaptive capacity to the poplar-birch forest than Silphidae and Staphylinidae, and there was a strong correlation in the individual number between Carabidae and Staphylinidae in different stands, with the linear model Y = 89.68 + 3. 241x. Conclusion) The composition and structure of the stand directly affected the internal ecological environment and related factors. The different stand factors had different effects on each group of ground dwelling beetles. Canopy density, stand age, litter depth had a strong positive influence on the individual number of Silphidae, herb coverage, stems per hectare, shrub coverage had a small influence on the individual number of Carabidae, and the stand factors had a weak influence on the individual number of Staphylinidae. In this study, the stand structure and age were different with less human disturbance, thus a stable internal ecological environment was formed in the process of long-term growth, and the environment influenced survival and reproduction of ground-dwelling beetles as well. The composition of the broad-leaved Korean pine forest (A and B) was complex, and the internal ecological environment was favorable for the survival of ground-dwelling beetles with relative abundant rare species. Therefore it played a more important role in protecting the diversity of ground-dwelling beetle.	Liu Shengdong; Beihua Univ, Forestry Coll, Jilin, Jilin, 132013, China, China.

Dross, Camille; Prince, Karine; Jiguet, Frederic; Tichit, Muriel				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	253			55-61	Feb 1 2018	2018				English	5	28	Impacts on birds of intensive management practices and of landscape simplification have been widely studied, but there is a lack of knowledge about impacts on birds of landscapes associated with intensive livestock production. The objective of this work was to investigate changes in several bird community descriptors along different production gradients. Production of amble crops and from grazing livestock was computed over French agroecosystems and expressed in terms of edible energy. Using data from the French Breeding Bird Survey along with data from national agricultural statistics, we modeled the relationship between production and five bird community descriptors, namely, community trophic index, community specialization index, and three group specific species richness indices. Bird communities were shaped by two production gradients. Along a gradient of increasing crop production, we observed a shift from locally species-diverse communities dominated by generalist or grassland specialist species towards species-poor communities dominated by granivorous species specialized in arable habitats (all p-values <= 0.002). Second, we observed a shift towards homogenized communities dominated by generalists along a gradient of increasing livestock production (p-values 0.001). Our research highlights the need to consider crop and livestock separately when investigating their impacts on biodiversity. It also hints towards the need for differentiated strategies to protect farmland birds in crop regions and in livestock regions.

Hunt, Kelsi L.; Fraser, James D.; Friedrich, Meryl J.; Karpanty, Sarah M.; Catlin, Daniel H.				Condor	120	1		149-165	Feb 2018	2018				English	4	14	Globally, riparian ecosystems are in decline due to anthropogenic modifications, including damming. Reduced frequency and altered timing of flood events decreases sandbar deposition, which reduces habitat for sandbar-breeding birds, including the threatened Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus). In response to limited breeding habitat and small populations, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed 255 ha of sandbar habitat on the Missouri River, USA, from 2004 to 2009. During the breeding seasons of 2010 and 2011, historically high flows resulted in the creation of 1,046 ha of suitable sandbar habitat on the Missouri River. We compared the demographic responses of Piping Plovers to this anthropogenic and natural habitat creation. We found that demographic parameters, including nest success ((X) over bar preflood = 0.45 [plus or minus] 0.02 SE vs. (X) over bar postflood = 0.74 [plus or minus] 0.02 SE), prefledging chick survival ((X) over bar preflood = 0.39 [plus or minus] 0.09 SE vs. (X) over bar postflood = 0.65 [plus or minus] 0.03 SE), and hatch-year survival ((X) over bar preflood = 0.16 [plus or minus] 0.03 SE vs. (X) over bar postflood = 0.46 [plus or minus] 0.03 SE), were consistently higher on the flood-created habitat than on the engineered habitat, leading to population growth after the flood. These differences were related to increased sandbar habitat, low nesting densities, and decreased nest and chick predation. As ecosystems are increasingly altered, ecologists seldom have the opportunity to make appropriate comparisons between managed and natural ecosystem processes. Our results suggest that management intervention may not be an appropriate substitute for natural ecosystem processes in riparian ecosystems.

Murillo-Pacheco, Johanna; Lopez-Iborra, German M.; Escobar, Federico; Fernando Bonilla-Rojas, Wilian; Verdu, Jose R.				Aquatic Conservation	28	1		87-97	Feb 2018	2018				English	3	11	Small wetlands are considered a refuge for biodiversity, but the importance of natural and man-made lentic wetlands for the maintenance of bird diversity in human-dominated landscapes is not well-known in the Neotropics. This study evaluated the influence of the types and origins (natural or man-made) of lentic wetlands on bird diversity of three guilds (aquatic, semi-aquatic and landbirds) in the Meta Piedmont, Colombia. The species richness and the structure and composition of each bird guild were estimated and compared between and within wetland types (swamps, heronries, rice fields, semi-natural lakes, constructed lakes and fish farms) and origins (natural, mixed and artificial). In total, 275 bird species were recorded (196 landbirds, 60 aquatic birds and 19 semi-aquatic birds). Local species richness had a wide variation (39 to 144 species), and total and mean richness were significantly different between among wetland types and origins. Semi-natural lakes were the most diverse wetland type, and heronries were the least diverse. Mixed-origin wetlands had the highest species richness. The cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) was the most abundant species, while heronries and rice fields showed the greatest total bird abundance. Bird diversity is strongly related to type and origin of wetlands, with significant variations in species composition among different types, which show high local and landscape heterogeneity. It is suggested that small lentic wetlands, whether natural, mixed or artificial, are important for the maintenance of local and regional bird diversity. Conservation and management actions are required to preserve wetland heterogeneity and the birds associated with it.

Mueller, Anke; Bocher, Peder K.; Fischer, Christina; Svenning, Jens-Christian				Landscape and Urban Planning	170			256-265	Feb 2018	2018				English	22	114	Urbanization is increasing worldwide, making it essential to improve management of urban greenspaces for better provisioning of ecosystem services and greater biodiversity benefits. At the same time, societal interest in reduced intensity management regimes is growing for a range of practical and normative reasons. We assessed if relative wild urban greenspaces, under little or no management, are associated with increased levels of biodiversity. We conducted a GIS-based relative wildness mapping for the Danish city Aarhus, and compared relative wildness to field-measured perceived biodiversity at 100 randomly placed sample sites in the city centre. Perceived biodiversity was estimated using the bioscore methodology. The results show a positive relationship between mapped wildness and bioscores, notably within artificial vegetated areas such as parks and gardens, while woodland had the highest wildness and bioscore values overall. All bioscore components measuring structural diversity increased with increasing mapped wildness. The bioscore component compositional richness covered site-level species richness for birds, invertebrates and plants, with invertebrate and bird species richness increasing and plant species richness decreasing with increasing wildness. The latter reflects that woodlands had low site-level plant diversity. Overall, woodlands nevertheless harboured many unique plant species, with woodlands and ruderal areas contributing the greatest beta diversity (inter-site variability in species composition). These findings show that urban greenspace management allowing for spontaneous ecological processes (greater wildness) overall also promotes urban biodiversity, pointing to potential synergies between urban design and management goals for reduced management intensity, increased wildness experiences, and higher biodiversity in urban greenspaces.

Their impact on native biodiversity and public health highlight the importance of knowing patterns of establishment (timing of establishment, population size and dispersion patterns), and potential biotic interactions with other species. We recorded use of perching substrates of the Eurasian-collared Dove density at the beginning and end of one reproductive season in Morelia, Mexico. We used variable-long transects to calculate Eurasian-collared Dove density, and recorded substrate used for each individual observed. Density did increase between survey seasons significantly, however, S. decaocto distribution inside the city was not homogeneous: 82% of records (56 individuals) were concentrated in only two transects. Furthermore, we documented significative change in Casuarina equisetifolia use as perching substrate between the beginning and the end of the reproductive season. Our observations also confirm that the Eurasian-collared Dove is stablished in Morelia city. It is crucial to enhance our knowledge of this exotic and invasive bird species at local scales in order to develop better control and/or eradication management practices.

Price, Catherine J.; Morris, Alan; Staines, Garon; Payne, Robert; Smith, Jane				Australian Zoologist	39	4		769-783	2018	2018				English	0	0	Long-term monitoring of threatened species often reveals processes undermining population recovery that may not be evident over shorter timeframes.When populations are small and isolated, normal behaviours such as dispersal may cause the loss of certain demographic stages if compensatory immigration no longer occurs. Social interactions that facilitate mate pairing can become rare, reducing the likelihood of successful breeding pairs establishing. Against a backdrop of habitat loss and degradation, these factors may make population recovery difficult to achieve. We present 15 years of monitoring data from the Central Coast of NSW targeting a small population of endangered Bush Stone-curlews Burhinus grallarius.The monitoring, undertaken by volunteers, collected breeding and banding observations between 2003 and 2018.Taken together, the data show that the number of breeding pairs fluctuates between 1 and 6, and can increase relatively quickly. However, juvenile dispersal south to highly urbanised and dangerous sites in Sydney has become a population 'sink', undermining population recovery. The long-term banding observations have been fundamental to understanding how juvenile dispersal affects Bush Stone-curlew population dynamics.We suggest translocating pairs to 'stepping stone' sites to the north of the population to exploit dispersal behaviours and enhance connectivity between the Central Coast population and breeding pairs around Port Stephens. We strongly urge the continuation of monitoring in conjunction with local habitat conservation and management to work towards sustainable and resilient Bush Stone-curlew populations.

The woodland and shrubland habitats had a higher proportion of resident and migratory species, respectively. Birds with stable population trends were more abundant in woodland, whereas the abundance of birds with decreasing trends were generally similar across most sites. Most of the birds with decreasing trends were migratory species. The dry season had a higher abundance and diversity of birds across different feeding guilds, residence status and population trend status than the wet season.Conclusion: Both woodland and shrubland in Dutse were important bird habitats, but migrant species preferentially used shrubland. The shrubland habitat and the dry season should be prioritized for conservation consideration, especially for migrant birds in Dutse.

Using point count method, we obtained first evidence of a coppice management effect acting as a stressor on the breeding bird assemblage structure. We observed a significant decrease in averaged species richness and abundance in coppiced areas before and after the coppicing practices, differently from the control area. Analogously, regression lines derived by species frequencies in diversity/dominance diagrams showed a different trends when comparing the coppiced areas before and after the cutting, indicating a stress in the latter. This pattern is supported by the H' diversity and evenness values that changed abruptly between years only in the coppiced area. These changes can be related to the significant reduction in tree plant density before and after cutting, especially for those with a diameter between 7.5 and 23 cm.

Perez-Granados, Cristian; Lopez-Iborra, German M.				Revista Catalana d'Ornitologia	34			33-54	2018	2018				Spanish	0	0	Dupont's Lark is one of the most emblematic steppe bird species in Spain. Here, we review advances in knowledge of its basic biology and ecology during the past decade, with special emphasis placed on studies carried out in a peripheral population located in Rincon de Ademuz (Valencia). In recent years, the species has undergone a severe decline (annual average 5-10%). Finnish line transects and point counts should not be used to survey this species; mapping methods based on four visits or line transects (with an inner belt of 500 m) are the most suitable counting methods. The best period for surveying the species is April-June. An analysis of habitat selection showed that birds choose flat areas without trees but with good low scrub cover (< 40 cm) at both micro- and macro-habitat scales. At larger scales, patch size seemed the only factor determining the probability of occurrence of the species. Our models of habitat selection successfully predicted species occurrence in different sites and years, which suggests that the conservation measures proposed for the populations in Rincon de Ademuz could be applied to larger geographical areas. We noted that the species almost became extinct in the Layna moorlands (Soria) during the first two years after a fire that burnt much of the scrub cover of this area. However, seven years after the fire, habitat structure and Dupont's Lark abundances had almost fully recovered. Our long-term monitoring of the Layna population suggests that fire should not be used as a management tool for reducing scrub cover. Dupont's Lark songs in Rincon de Ademuz were highly influenced by habitat fragmentation as we found poor repertoires and a number of dialects in each of the studied populations, as well as fewer songs shared by males over larger distances. These findings suggest that there is no exchange of adult males between populations and that the species might be suffering cultural erosion due to the heavy fragmentation of its populations. During our studies in Rincon de Ademuz and Layna, we found that the reproductive phenology (end of March to beginning of July) and parameters (clutches of 3-5 eggs, 12 days incubation, chicks fledge when they are eight-days old, up to three clutches per year) were similar to that previously reported for other Spanish populations. However, we found that 40-60% of nests produced fledglings. This fact suggests that population decline would not be driven by a poor reproductive success. We complete our review by providing some recommendations to improve management and conservation of this lark.

In this paper we compare the composition of the bird community in the Luzanky park in Brno among the years 1978, 2015 and 2016, and also within a year We counted birds on a belt transect throughout the whole year. In total, we found 72 species, of which 29 were probable/confirmed breeders. Over the study period the number of species increased The number of species varied also during the year, being highest in spring The mean community density revealed from year-round data was higher in 1978 than in 2015 and 2016; in 1978, it was highest in spring and winter while in 2015 and 2016 in summer. In contrast, the mean community density in the breeding period was lower in 1978 than in 2015 and 2016 We also evaluated changes of densities of particular species among the studied years. The revealed long-term changes are related to the revitalisation of the park - the diversification of habitats thanks to restoration of grasslands and of a brook while preserving old trees - and also to the general trend of urbanisation in some species.

Before its foundation, Trujillo was a carob forest, a situation that changed with the pass of the years. The obtaining of firewood and coal as an energy source, the change of land use for intensive agriculture and disorganized urbanism were the cause of its destruction, without considering the approach of sustainable cities over time. In order to assess the presence of wild birds associated with the flora and the urban environment, we conducted visits through thirty parks in the district of Trujillo and green areas of some public institutions. Using the method of sampling by points, in each green area, and according to the size, five observation points were defined by park, in which we stayed for 10 minutes, making the auditory and photographic record of the species; and of the flora related to the ornithofauna according to their way of life (herbs, shrubs, vines, climbers and trees). A total of 47 bird species were recorded, as well as 224 species of plants used as ornamentals, including 28 native ones, mainly herbs, shrubs and trees, which in one way or another, the birds find favorable conditions for feeding, resting and nesting. The varied existing flora allows the presence of birds from different communities, constituting a recreational attraction for people; we suggest to promote the planting of native species and their conservation.

Paxton, Eben H.; Yelenik, Stephanie G.; Borneman, Tracy E.; Rose, Eli T.; Camp, Richard J.; Kendall, Steve J.				Restoration Ecology	26	1		165-173	Jan 2018	2018				English	4	21	Deforestation of tropical forests has led to widespread loss and extirpation of forest bird species around the world, including the Hawaiian Islands which have experienced a dramatic loss of forests over the last 200-800 years. Given the important role birds play in forest ecosystem functions via seed dispersal and pollination, a bird community's response to forest restoration is an important measure of the success of such conservation actions. We evaluated the bird response to reforestation at an important bird sanctuary, Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hawaii Island, using 26 years of bird count data. We show that most species from within the diverse avian community increased significantly, but species colonized the restoration forest at different rates. Distance from intact forest and time since restoration were both important predictors of colonization rate, interacting such that for most species it took more time to colonize areas farther from the intact forest. In addition, both forest cover and understory diversity helped to explain bird densities, but the effect varied among species, suggesting that different habitat requirements may help drive variation in colonization rates. This article provides the first detailed evaluation of how a diverse community of birds has responded to one of the largest, ongoing reforestation projects in Hawaii.

Kosinski, Ziemowit; Pluta, Monika; Ulanowska, Anna; Walczak, Lukasz; Winiecki, Aleksander; Zarebski, Mateusz				Biodiversity and Conservation	27	1		123-145	Jan 2018	2018				English	1	17	Standing dead trees may be a limited resource for woodpeckers in managed forests, especially for species that rely on dead wood for their nest or roost cavity, and as foraging sites. Effective conservation strategies for woodpeckers require a detailed knowledge of species' responses to dead wood availability. To investigate the importance of standing dead wood (snags) for the abundance and nest-site use of the great spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos major and middle spotted woodpecker Leiopicus medius in mature riverine forests, we compared the responses of birds between two periods-before mass mortality, and during a pulse in standing dead trees. The density of standing dead trees available for cavity excavation by the great spotted woodpecker and the middle spotted woodpecker increased significantly during the study period: 37-fold and 4-fold, respectively. Temporal trends in the abundance of both woodpecker species from 2000 to 2015 were not significant. Great spotted woodpeckers were significantly more likely to use dead trees and places with wounds in species other than oak and ash during the outbreak period than in the pre-outbreak period. Middle spotted woodpeckers were significantly less likely to excavate cavities in tree species other than oak and ash in the outbreak period, but dead trees were more likely selected. An interspecific comparison suggests that the probability of a nest-hole having been excavated by a middle spotted woodpecker increased with a nest-hole sited in ash, in a dead tree, in a limb/branch, and decreased with a nest-hole in a closed forest. These findings suggest that woodpecker species, especially weak excavators, may benefit from an increase in dead wood availability leading to nest niche shifts into more favorable substrates for cavity excavation. However, a strong increase in dead wood availability does not modify the general pattern of niche partitioning between great spotted and middle spotted woodpeckers. Conservation plans for the specialized middle spotted woodpecker must consider the preference for dead and decaying trees. The decreasing number of large ashes and oaks, and the lack of natural regeneration of the latter species, may negatively affect the middle spotted woodpecker in the future.

Charchuk, Connor; Bayne, Erin M.				Forest Ecology and Management	407			9-15	Jan 1 2018	2018				English	6	26	Traditional harvesting in western boreal forests seeks to approximate natural disturbances, such as wildfire. In mixedwood forests, understory conifers such as white spruce are typically destroyed during natural disturbance harvest (NDH). Understory protection (UP) is a harvesting approach that seeks to protect understory conifers during hardwood harvesting in mixedwood forests. While understory protection harvesting has been implemented for over a decade in Alberta, Canada, there has been no assessment of its use by birds. We surveyed birds in UP and NDH harvest blocks, and the nearby unharvested forest, and evaluated differences in species richness and community composition between the three treatment types. We found NDH had significantly higher species richness than unharvested forests, but did not differ from UP. The three treatments all had significantly different avian community compositions, and NDH showed no convergence with the unharvested forest over 15 years post-harvest. However, UP represented an intermediary between NDH and unharvested forests. When comparing the oldest age class of UP with unharvested forest, we found no significant difference in the bird communities 12 years post-harvest. These results suggest that following understory protection harvest, the retained forest regenerates quickly, rapidly providing habitat to more mature forest species than NDH.

Parrish, Michael C.; Demarais, Steve; Wigley, T. Bently; Jones, Phillip D.; Ezell, Andrew W.; Riffell, Samuel K.				Forest Ecology and Management	406			112-124	Dec 15 2017	2017				English	3	14	Intensively managed pine (Pinus spp.) forests (IMPFs) in the southern U.S. are often harvested by clearcutting in conjunction with green tree retention (i.e., retention of unharvested or less-intensively harvested trees and other vegetation), which is thought to promote structural diversity and to benefit wildlife. Management units in IMPFs thus primarily consist of regenerating pineclearcuts (RCCs) plus retained cover in streamside management zones (SMZs: vegetative buffers along perennial and intermittent streams) and/or stringers (forested buffers along ephemeral drains). To understand relationships between retained structures and avian communities, we documented and compared species diversity of breeding bird species and avian guilds in three-year-old RCCs and associated SMZs and stringers on 60 IMPF management units within the South Central Plains ecoregion of the southeastern U.S. We detected 5617 individuals of 60 species. Eight species were considered "common birds in steep decline," one of which was frequently detected (Prairie Warbler, Setophaga discolor). Three of our 15 most frequently detected species were identified by Partners in Flight as "warranting management attention" for "moderate or high regional declines," and 19 other species were listed as "warranting management attention" but were uncommonly detected. Forty-two of 44 species documented in RCCs were also observed accessing retention cover areas. SMZs and stringers comprised an average of 17.4% of management unit area, but 27% of species were detected solely in retention cover types. There was an 84% species overlap between SMZs and stringers. Stringers augmented SMZ contributions to site avian diversity by hosting forest specialist guilds. Diversity of early-successional specialists was similar between stringers and RCCs, suggesting stringers also enhanced RCC contributions to site bird diversity. Furthermore, we detected several species only within stringers. Green tree retention land cover contributed to stand scale avian diversity disproportionately to its area, and in particular, stringer cover appeared to enhance the value to avifaunal species diversity of RCC and SMZ patches.

McFadden, Tyler N.; Herrera, Alejandro G.; Navedo, Juan G.				Journal for Nature Conservation	40			42-48	Dec 2017	2017				English	8	30	Participation in outdoor recreation can increase support for wildlife conservation, but may also disturb wildlife. We examined responses of wintering waterbirds to the regular passage of a small boat specifically dedicated to birdwatching tours in a coastal Ramsar site in northern Spain. Disturbances were measured during two separate periods: 2006-2008 and 2012-2015. Incidence and magnitude of disturbance events were compared by grouping species based on their interest to birders (target vs. non-target) and compared across sectors of the tour route. Flight-initiation distances (FID) were used to estimate species-specific buffer zones, which can be used to manage recreational disturbance to waterbirds. We further examined relationships between species-specific traits and FID, time flying, and distance flying following disturbance. A single boat tour disturbed on average 0.3% of non-target and 2.8% of target wintering bird populations within the wetland, with the effect being more pronounced on target species due to their smaller populations. Wing loading was positively associated with distance flying after disturbance. Based on measured FIDs, we calculated an overall buffer zone for all species of 100 m, and species-specific buffer zones ranging from 41 to 211 m. Disturbance incidence and the number of birds disturbed per tour were both greatest in narrow tidal channels (< 200 m), where boats were forced to pass within 100 m of waterbirds. We urge caution in allowing boat passage through tidal channels in which boat operators cannot effectively maintain recommended buffer zones between their boat and waterbirds.

Rajashekara, S.; Venkatesha, M.G.				Proceedings of the Zoological Society (Calcutta)	70	2		178-193	Dec 2017	2017				English	1	1	The present study deals with the species abundance, diversity and species richness of avian communities in the Bangalore University Campus (BUC), Bengaluru, India. One hundred and six species of birds belonging to 42 families under 68 genera were recorded. Shannon-Wiener's and Fisher's alpha diversities, species evenness, species richness of bird communities, number of bird species and percentage of population density of birds between various seasons in the BUC differed significantly between the study years. Of these bird species, the relative abundance (6.96 %) and species distribution ratio (0.070) of Psittacula krameri were highest, whereas relative abundance (0.04 %) and species distribution ratio (0.002) of Coracias benghalensis were lowest. The existing 32 species of flowering plants/trees belonging to 29 genera under 14 families in the campus are used for perching by birds. Moreover 29 species of flowering plants/trees belonging to 24 genera under 16 families depend on birds for pollination and/or seed dispersal. Occurrence of greater bird diversity and abundance of avian communities were recorded highest in the winter season in the BUC premises. In the different seasons, the BUC had varying community structure of birds between the study years. BUC suffers from numerous threats namely grass cutting, fire and grazing of domestic animals. Conservation methods needed for habitat management are restoration of vegetation and wetlands, and increase plant and tree diversity to protect the ecosystem of BUC habitat and to preserve its diversity of avifauna.

Ryan; Francis, Charles M.; Roy, Christian; Calvert, Anna M.				Avian Conservation and Ecology	12	2		10	Dec 2017	2017				English	4	21	Emulating natural disturbance has become a paradigm for biodiversity retention in forest management. This study evaluates the extent to which harvest management practices have created stands that emulate natural fire disturbance from the perspective of bird communities in Ontario, Canada. We compared the relative abundance of forest landbirds at the stand level in mature forest (> 80 years old) with that in early-regenerating (0-20 years) and midregenerating (21-80 years) forests originating from fire or timber harvest across the boreal forest of Ontario using over 7000 point counts. Our results indicate that forest harvest management practices in Ontario have created stands that only partially emulate natural fire disturbances in terms of the bird community composition. Total bird abundance and species richness were significantly lower postharvest than postfire in midregenerating forests, although they did not differ in early-regenerating stands. Species-level comparisons revealed several differences between postharvest and postfire stands, as well as among age classes. Although no species was completely missing from any stand type, 8% of species in early-and 34% in midregenerating stands were detected significantly less often in postharvest than postfire forests. Some other species were found significantly more often in postharvest stands, while the majority of species detected (84% and 71% in early-and midregenerating stands, respectively) showed no significant difference between disturbance types. Collectively, these results suggest that widespread replacement of fire with logging as the dominant disturbance type will shift the relative abundance of species within Ontario's boreal forest bird community. Quantifying the population-level implications of these shifts requires extrapolating these stand level effects to the landscape level, while considering the actual or anticipated abundance and distribution of forest age classes across the province under different forest management regimes.

Avian Conservation and Ecology	12	2		15	Dec 2017	2017				English	0	6	A major challenge for protected areas is providing wildlife with enough suitable habitat to cope with stochastic environment and increased pressure from the surrounding landscapes. In this study, we addressed changes in local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers (Campephilus magellanicus) occupying three national parks of central-southern Chile. We compared the breeding and postbreeding abundance of woodpeckers during the 1990s with the present (2016) abundance (n = 4 years), and assessed the extent to which abundance was explained by forest type and quality of foraging habitat (as quantified through the plant senescence reflectance index; PSRI). Results show a distinctive temporal variation in woodpecker abundance at each park, with local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers declining by 42.2% in Conguillio National Park, but increasing by 34.3% in Nahuelbuta National Park. Woodpeckers responded to forest conditions within each park such that their abundance increased with high quality of foraging habitat, i. e., large PSRI values, and the presence of old-growth Monkey puzzle (Araucaria araucana) -Nothofagus pumilio mixed forest. Anecdotal evidence suggests that populations of woodpeckers in Conguillio National Park might have responded negatively to large-scale disturbances from recent forest fires affecting part of the forest area within park. Because stochastic events seemed to strongly mediate population changes, our findings suggest that regional conservation of Magellanic Woodpeckers requires expanding the current conservation area network in central-southern Chile.

Conservation Biology	31	6		1418-1427	Dec 2017	2017				English	7	18	Many objectives motivate ecological restoration, including improving vegetation condition, increasing the range and abundance of threatened species, and improving species richness and diversity. Although models have been used to examine the outcomes of ecological restoration, few researchers have attempted to develop models to account for multiple, potentially competing objectives. We developed a combined state-and-transition, species-distribution model to predict the effects of restoration actions on vegetation condition and extent, bird diversity, and the distribution of several bird species in southeastern Australian woodlands. The actions reflected several management objectives. We then validated the models against an independent data set and investigated how the best management decision might change when objectives were valued differently. We also used model results to identify effective restoration options for vegetation and bird species under a constrained budget. In the examples we evaluated, no one action (improving vegetation condition and extent, increasing bird diversity, or increasing the probability of occurrence for threatened species) provided the best outcome across all objectives. In agricultural lands, the optimal management actions for promoting the occurrence of the Brown Treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus), an iconic threatened species, resulted in little improvement in the extent of the vegetation and a high probability of decreased vegetation condition. This result highlights that the best management action in any situation depends on how much the different objectives are valued. In our example scenario, no management or weed control were most likely to be the best management options to satisfy multiple restoration objectives. Our approach to exploring trade-offs in management outcomes through integrated modeling and structured decision-support approaches has wide application for situations in which trade-offs exist between competing conservation objectives.

While public lands have the potential to increase regional resilience of bird populations to these threats, long-term data are necessary to document species responses to changes in climate and habitat to better understand population vulnerabilities. We used generalized linear mixed models to determine the importance of stand-level characteristics, multi-scale land cover, and annual weather factors to the abundance of 61 bird species over a 20-year time frame in Chippewa National Forest, Minnesota, USA. Of the 61 species modeled, we were able to build final models with R-squared values that ranged from 26% to 69% for 37 species; the remaining 24 species models had issues with convergence or low explanatory power (R-squared < 20%). Models for the 37 species show that stand-level characteristics, land cover factors, and annual weather effects on species abundance were species-specific and varied within guilds. Forty-one percent of the final species models included stand-level characteristics, 92% included land cover variables at the 200 m scale, 51% included land cover variables at the 500 m scale, 46% included land cover variables at the 1000 m scale, and 38% included weather variables in best models. Three species models (8%) included significant weather and land cover interaction terms. Overall, models indicated that aboveground tree biomass and land cover variables drove changes in the majority of species. Of those species models including weather variables, more included annual variation in precipitation or drought than temperature. Annual weather variability was significantly more likely to impact abundance of species associated with deciduous forests and bird species that are considered climate sensitive. The long-term data and models we developed are particularly suited to informing science-based adaptive forest management plans that incorporate climate sensitivity, aim to conserve large areas of forest habitat, and maintain an historical mosaic of cover types for conserving a diverse and abundant avian assemblage.

Marshall, Craig; Riffell, Samuel K.; Miller, Darren A.; Hill, JoVonn G.; Evans, Kristine O.; Rush, Scott A.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	41	4		659-665	Dec 2017	2017				English	4	7	Global interest in alternative, renewable energy sources has led to the development of novel land-use practices and techniques aimed at maximizing energy production while also minimizing environmental, economic, and societal costs. One such novel practice is intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) within loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations. However, minimal knowledge currently exists regarding the influence of intercropping switchgrass on ecosystem functions and services and biological diversity of loblolly pine plantations. Therefore, we assessed the influence of intercropping switchgrass on breeding-bird species density and community composition during 2014-2015 in Mississippi, USA. We had 3,619 detections encompassing 39 species, with 10 species used in density analysis. Breeding-bird density estimates did not significantly differ for 8 out the 10 species modeled between control and intercrop treatments. However, white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) and indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) densities differed between intercrop and control, with white-eyed vireos having a greater density on control and indigo buntings having a greater density on intercrop. Treatment influenced breeding-bird community composition, with monocultures supporting an atypical species composition within a loblolly pine plantation, but species composition did not differ between control and intercrop treatments.

Jones, Sydney K.; Ripplinger, Julie; Collins, Scott L.				Ecology Letters	20	12		1556-1565	Dec 2017	2017				English	20	68	Determining how ecological communities will respond to global environmental change remains a challenging research problem. Recent meta-analyses concluded that most communities are undergoing compositional change despite no net change in local species richness. We explored how species richness and composition of co-occurring plant, grasshopper, breeding bird and small mammal communities in arid and mesic grasslands changed in response to increasing aridity and fire frequency. In the arid system, grassland and shrubland plant and breeding bird communities were undergoing directional change, whereas grasshopper and small mammal communities were stable. In the mesic system, all communities were undergoing directional change regardless of fire frequency. Despite directional change in composition in some communities, species richness of all communities did not change because compositional change resulted more from reordering of species abundances than turnover in species composition. Thus, species reordering, not changes in richness, explains long-term dynamics in these grass and shrub dominated communities.

Stephens, Jaime L.				Ecological Restoration	35	4		328-340	Dec 1 2017	2017				English	4	4	Both establishment and subsequent removal of dams inevitably alter river systems and may impact aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Despite both stated and implicit restoration goals of dam removal, relatively few studies have examined ecological response. Using a before-after-control-impact framework one year before and two years after, I evaluated the short-term effect of a dam removal on the Rogue River in southwestern Oregon on vegetation, bird community composition, and abundance of eight riparian-associated bird species. No differences were detected for tree and shrub strata cover after dam removal for either treatments or controls. Within the three treatment habitat types (mainstem, slough, wetland), shrub and ground cover declined only in wetland areas, likely as a result of post dam removal vegetation management. Significant changes in relative abundance were found for only one of eight focal bird species. Chamaea fasciata (Wrentit) abundance declined on treatment points following dam removal, possibly a response to the decrease in cover of the shrub and ground vegetative strata in the wetland. Bird community composition did not differ between controls and treatments either before or after dam removal. In combination, the similarities in bird community composition and lack of detectable change in abundance for seven riparian associated species are consistent with the results for vegetative cover, suggesting shrub and tree components of riparian habitat did not change substantially in the two years following dam removal. Results from this study have important management implications for maintaining or restoring riparian vegetation in conjunction with future dam removals.

Forest birds were sampled by means of line transect surveys in pairwise combinations of managed and unmanaged forest plots in seven forest areas in 2015. Surveys were conducted once around late April, mid May and early June using transects with a fixed width belt of 80 m in order to be able to calculate relative densities. Species richness and densities were higher in unmanaged forest parts although variation between forest plots was high due to small sample sizes. Species richness increased with increasing structural heterogeneity in the forest plots and with amount of dead wood and densities increased with average age of the forest plots. The results are consistent with a comparable survey carried out in 1993. In particular cavity-nesting bird species were significantly more common in unmanaged forests and widespread species like Jackdaw (Corvus monedula), Stock dove (Columba oenas), Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and Blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) were exclusively or almost exclusively confined to unmanaged forest parts. Structural diversity, age and amount of dead wood were key factors for a richer forest bird community.

Aldinger, Kyle R.; Wood, Petra B.; Johnson, Catherine M.				Condor	119	4		762-786	Nov 2017	2017				English	4	16	Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) populations in the Appalachian Mountains region of North America are imperiled, warranting species-specific conservation. However, management for Golden-winged Warblers can affect both early-successional and forest species, many of which are also declining in the region. We conducted point counts in sites representing a range of successional stages within the Golden-winged Warbler's breeding range in West Virginia, USA, during 2008-2015. We identified plausible models of Golden-winged Warbler density using covariates at 4 spatial scales representing annual dispersal (5-km radius), extraterritorial movement (1.5-km radius), intraterritorial movement (100-m radius), and local resource utilization (11.3-m radius). Golden-winged Warbler density peaked at an intermediate elevation at the 1.5-km radius scale, but was negatively associated with 100-m radius minimum elevation. Density was positively associated with 100-m radius shrubland cover. Southerly latitudes were associated with higher densities when modeled alone, but there was no association when controlling for other covariates. We then examined the relationship between covariates from these plausible models and avian community structure using canonical correspondence analysis to assess the value of Golden-winged Warbler conservation for the broader avian community. We identified 5 species likely to benefit from management for Golden-winged Warblers and 21 species likely to be affected positively or negatively to varying degrees depending on their affinity for early-successional vegetation communities. Golden-winged Warblers were plotted higher along the 100-m shrubland cover gradient than any other bird species, suggesting that they may be the most shrubland area-sensitive songbird in our study area. However, the species also requires heavily forested landscapes. Therefore, a species-specific conservation strategy that balances shrubland (patches of 9-13 ha in size, comprising 15% of the landscape) and contiguous forest area (>=75% of the landscape) could concurrently meet the needs of Golden-winged Warblers and the 26 other species identified.

Prowse, Thomas A.A.; Collard, Stuart J.; Blackwood, Alice; O'Connor, Patrick J.; Delean, Steven; Barnes, Megan; Cassey, Phillip; Possingham, Hugh P.				Biological Conservation	215			268-276	Nov 2017	2017				English	9	36	Prescribed burning is a commonly adopted fire-management strategy that attempts to protect human life and assets by removing accumulated, flammable biomass. Heterogeneous burning patterns are often favoured in an attempt to balance fuel-reduction and biodiversity goals under the 'pyrodiversity begets biodiversity' paradigm. Using comprehensive spatiotemporal monitoring data, we quantified the impacts of fire on bird assemblages in the peri-urban temperate woodlands of the Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia, where the frequency of prescribed burning is increasing. After accounting for regional trends and site effects, sites burnt 20 years previously accommodated 15% fewer birds than unburnt sites, while sites burnt in the preceding year had 22% fewer birds. Fire also modified bird assemblages, favouring generalists and ground-feeding species. Of 60 species considered, 37% were both declining and negatively impacted by recent burning, while burning reinforced increasing trends in 30% of species, particularly large, common birds (e.g., magpies, ravens, wattlebirds). Simulations of avian alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity under different fire-management scenarios predicted higher avian diversity for scenarios that retained unburnt woodlands relative to those that managed all sites. Relative to a no-fire scenario, for example, burning sites once every 10 years was simulated to reduce the abundance of woodland generalists by 7% and woodland specialists by 10%, while retaining some long-unburnt woodland ameliorated these effects. There is a trade-off between fuel-reduction burning and conservation goals; to maximise avian diversity and avert the replacement of woodland bird species with generalists, fire-management planning should preserve long-unburnt woodland habitat.

Wojton, Andrzej; Krason, Konrad				Sylwan	161	11		940-948	Nov 2017	2017				Polish	2	5	Woodpeckers are a very good indicators of forest naturalness. The fact that many species of these birds are in decline in central and western Europe resulted from changes in forest management (e.g. favouring coniferous forest, removal of dead trees). The aim of this research was to evaluate the importance of patches of deciduous species for the occurrence of some specialized woodpeckers in the conditions of Scots pine dominated stands. The study focused on species associated with deciduous forest, i.e. middle spotted woodpecker Leiopicas medius (L.), white-backed woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos (Bechstein) and grey-headed woodpecker Picas canus (Gmelin). Statistical analyses were performed for the woodpeckers, which occurred in more than 10 territories. The studies were performed in 2015-2017 in the southern part of the Sandomierz Basin in three study areas (52,6-59 km2). Two plots were dominated by black alder Alnus glutinosa and oak Ouercus sp., while the third one was characterized by the highest share of black alder, followed by silver birch Betula pendula and oak. Deciduous trees at the age over 80 years accounted for less than 2% of the total area of each plot. The most abundant bird species in patches of deciduous forest was the middle spotted woodpecker (25 territories), while the rarest was white-backed woodpecker (1 territory). Grey-headed woodpecker appeared in 12 territories. The density of woodpeckers in deciduous forest areas ranged from 0.45 territories/100 ha for grey-headed woodpecker to 1.54 territories/100 ha for the middle spotted woodpecker. In the alder patches we found all territories of grey-headed woodpecker, 24% territories of the middle spotted woodpecker and single territories of white-backed woodpecker. The patches dominated by oak accounted for about 76% of territories of middle spotted woodpecker. The average area of the patches with presence of middle spotted woodpecker and grey woodpecker was significantly higher than the patches where woodpeckers were absent. The middle spotted woodpecker occurred in the forest patches with the highest average age. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) demonstrated that the occurrence of middle spotted woodpecker was most strongly associated with the area of the patches over 10 ha, while the grey-headed woodpecker preferred mature forest stands of alder. These species abundance was negatively correlated with a patch area less than 10 ha.

Cardoso, Pedro; Crespo, Luis C.; Silva, Isamberto; Borges, Paulo A., V; Boieiro, Mario				Biodiversity Data Journal	5			e20810	Oct 18 2017	2017				English	0	0	Background The North Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and Selvagens present a unique biological diversity including, presently, 56 endemic spider species. Several recent projects provide valuable information on their distribution across most islands and habitats. To date, the only endemic spider assessed according to the IUCN Red List criteria is Hogna ingens. The objective of this paper is to assess all remaining endemic species and advise on possible future conservation actions critical for the survival of endangered species. New information Seven species were found to have a continuing decline in either range or population size. Their decline can be mostly attributed to habitat destruction or degradation, invasive plant species that reduce quality of habitat, forest fires at high mountain regions and possible competition for resources from invasive congeners. The tetragnathid M. barreti is considered as possibly extinct due to the suspected impact of a competing species. Although most endemic spiders from the Madeira and Selvagens archipelagos have relatively low extinction risk due to the good condition and protection of the laurisilva forests where many live, there are a number of species requiring urgent attention and protection measures. These include all cave and mountain-restricted species as well as those threatened by competing congeners or invasive plants. Extending current protected areas, restoring original habitats of threatened species and the control of invasive taxa should remain a priority for species survival.

Shea, Eddie L.; Schulte, Lisa A.; Palik, Brian J.				Forest Ecology and Management	402			272-284	Oct 15 2017	2017				English	2	22	Structural complexity is widely recognized as an inherent characteristic of unmanaged forests critical to their function and resilience, but often reduced in their managed counterparts. Variable retention harvesting (VRH) has been proposed as a way to restore or enhance structural complexity in managed forests, and thereby sustain attendant biodiversity and ecosystem function. Here we examined the decade-long response of diurnal breeding birds to a VRH experiment that, for the first time, incorporated both overstory and shrub layer treatments in red pine (Pines resinosa) dominated forests in Minnesota, USA. Overstory treatments included dispersed retention, aggregated retention achieved by cutting small (0.1 ha) gaps, aggregated retention achieved by cutting large (0.3 ha) gaps, and an uncut control. A shrub layer treatment of ambient or reduced shrub density was also implemented as a split-plot design in each harvest treatment. We found a consistent increase in bird species richness and abundance with all retention harvest treatments over time compared to the control; species richness was also significantly greater in the large gap-aggregated treatment compared to dispersed and small gap-aggregated retention harvests. Among guilds, foliage-gleaning and shrub- and tree-nesting birds exhibited the strongest positive response to retention harvesting. Species associated with early-successional habitat, forest edges, and shrubs responded most positively to VRH including Chestnut-sided Warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica) and American Restart (S. ruticilla), although late-successional species such as Blackburnian Warbler (S. fusca) and Black-throated Green Warbler (S. Wrens) also showed positive response. We found few differences due to shrub reduction, and only at the species level: Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and American Redstart were more abundant in the ambient shrub treatment, whereas Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Veery (Catharus fuscenscens), and Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina) were more abundant with a reduced density of shrubs. Results through the first 10 years following harvest revealed differences in bird response to both VRH and shrub treatment, suggesting that management can result in forested landscapes with bird communities that are species rich, diverse, and abundant.

Busek, Ondrej; Reif, Jiri				Acta Oecologica	84			34-40	Oct 2017	2017				English	2	9	European biodiversity has suffered from serious declines during the past few decades, with alterations of land use practices resulting in a loss of fine-scale habitat heterogeneity being a dominant driver. This heterogeneity was maintained by extensive landscape management, which has gradually been replaced by either intensive exploitation or land abandonment. It has been suggested that military training can generate habitat heterogeneity that may support the existence of species of conservation concern, but studies rigorously testing the real importance of military training areas for biodiversity are lacking. Here we address this issue by analyses of two datasets. First, we compared land cover classes between all large military training areas (MTAs) and surrounding control areas (CAs) of the same size in the Czech Republic using multivariate redundancy analysis. We found that the difference in land cover between MTAs and CAs was significant and represented the strongest gradient in land cover classes: from various farmland and artificial habitats typical for CAs to forest and scrubland-grassland mosaic typical for MTAs. Second, we selected one of these areas and compared bird species richness between the MTA and the nearby CA using generalized linear mixed effects models. We found that the number of species of conservation concern was significantly higher in the MTA than in the CA. With respect to habitats, bird species richness was significantly higher in the MTA than in the CA for open habitats, but not for forest habitats. Our results are thus consistent with the view that military training creates areas that are different from the surrounding landscape in terms of land cover, and that this difference translates to a suitability for species of conservation concern. It is remarkable that the positive influence of military training is confined to open habitats, which are subject to the most intensive military activities and also suffer the highest degree of deterioration in European landscapes.

Versluijs, Martijn; Eggers, Sonke; Hjalten, Joakim; Lofroth, Therese; Roberge, Jean-Michel				Forest Ecology and Management	401			75-88	Oct 1 2017	2017				English	7	65	Ecological restoration is increasingly recognised as a useful tool for biodiversity conservation in boreal forests. Most restoration methods in this environment aim to emulate natural disturbances, and thereby promote the development of key ecological structures. However, research about forest ecosystem restoration is still in its infancy and the responses of many boreal species groups remain to be described. We established a large-scale field experiment to evaluate the short-term effects of two restoration treatments - prescribed burning and gap cutting involving the creation of dead wood - on breeding bird assemblages in boreal Sweden. We censused breeding birds using territory mapping during two years in forest stands subjected to the two restoration treatments, in untreated controls and in old-growth references (nature reserves) (n = 10 per treatment). Averaged over the two census years, we found 1145 territories of 36 bird species. Total bird species richness and abundance did not differ among treatments. However, prescribed burning led to clear changes in the structure of the bird assemblages. When dividing species according to four functional categorizations (migration, foraging, nesting and successional stage), we found that the abundance of long-distance migrants, ground breeders, strong cavity excavators and species preferring early-successional habitat was higher in burned stands than in untreated controls and gap-cut stands, as was the species richness of bark feeders and strong cavity excavators. In contrast, abundance of off-ground breeders and species richness of crown feeders were lower following prescribed burning than in the controls. The gap cutting treatment did not have any significant effects on the bird assemblages. Ecological restoration through prescribed burning can be a useful tool for the conservation of boreal forest birds, including the ecologically important strong cavity excavators (i.e. woodpeckers (Picidae)). Forest managers should therefore be encouraged to use prescribed burning as a restoration tool to quickly provide habitat for bird species adapted to natural disturbances in boreal forest.

Hofmeister, Jenyk; Hosek, Jan; Brabec, Marek; Kocvara, Radim				Forest Ecology and Management	401			255-263	Oct 1 2017	2017				English	9	58	Species-rich communities of forest birds generally occupy larger rather than smaller forest fragments. However, the role of distance to the forest edge on the spatial distribution of bird communities within forest fragments remains largely unknown. In this study, we attempted to determine whether and how forest bird species distribution was related to distance from the forest edge or clearing (whichever was closer) taking into consideration effects of fragment size and vegetation. Based on data from a four year bird survey, we explored the spatial distribution of 29 common forest bird species within 24 forest fragments (0.1-255 ha) in relation to distance to the forest edge, fragment size and forest vegetation. For this purpose we used generalized additive models (GAMs) with spline components and demonstrated the distance frequency relationship for each bird species for whom it was relevant. Spatial distribution of the majority of common forest bird species was significantly affected by distance to the forest edge and/or fragment size and vegetation. The maximum frequency of species dependent on distance to the forest edge differed considerably along the line connecting forest edge to the centre of forest fragments. While frequency of the generalist species generally peaked somewhere close to the forest edge, frequency of sensitive forest resident species increased up to a distance of 150 m or more from the forest edge. The effect of forest fragment size was consistently accompanied with the effect of distance to the forest edge with the exception of only two generalist species. It appears that a substantial part of the effect traditionally attributed to forest fragment size may be related to distance to the forest edge. Spatial distribution of almost all of the common bird species were further modified by forest vegetation at the local scale, but only rarely by prevalent forest vegetation of the respective forest fragment. Populations of forest resident species, such as Dryocopus martius, may be threatened by management intervention in the forest interior that leads to the forming of "internal" forest edges (e.g. clearcutting). The results documented that forest management based on clear-cut timber harvesting may increase the negative effects of forest fragmentation on distribution of the sensitive forest bird species within forest fragments. This negative effect could be reduced by adoption of timber harvesting methods that avoid the creation of clearings (e.g. single-tree selection), preferably accompanied by exemptions of individuals or patches of old trees from logging.

Buchanan, Graeme M.; Pearce-Higgins, James W.; Douglas, David J.T.; Grant, Murray C.				Ibis	159	4		744-756	Oct 2017	2017				English	9	45	UK moorlands are semi-natural habitats managed for a mix of livestock, game shooting and forestry, among other activities. An assessment of the importance of characteristics that correlate with moorland bird populations of high conservation importance can inform appropriate management at appropriate locations. We use hierarchical partitioning to assess the absolute and relative importance of climate, topography, soil, landscape management (wider scale habitat configuration of forestry and agriculture) and site-based management (indices of predator control, and vegetation characteristics) in determining the abundance of a suite of upland birds in four regions of the UK. Unmeasured regionspecific effects often made the largest contribution to models. Physical characteristics (climate, topography, soil) were important and on average explained a similar amount of variation to site-based management. However, there was considerable interspecific variation in the importance of both. Landscape-scale variables were generally of low importance. An index of predator control was positively correlated with the abundance of Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica and two waders. Vegetation characteristics (composition and structure) were, together, strong correlates of the abundance of passerine species. Vegetation characteristics were as important as indices of predator control for waders and grouse. The importance of regional effects, physical characteristics and variables relating to management suggest targeting site-based management (such as predator control or vegetation management) to the areas where physical characteristics are most favourable. The most beneficial management will vary between species, necessitating a mosaic of management options across upland areas to benefit all species.

Hakkila, Matti; Le Tortorec, Eric; Brotons, Lluis; Rajasarkka, Ari; Tornberg, Risto; Monkkonen, Mikko				PLoS ONE	12	9		e0184792	Sep 26 2017	2017				English	8	29	Introduction A main goal of protected areas is to maintain species diversity and the integrity of biological assemblages. Intensifying land use in the matrix surrounding protected areas creates a challenge for biodiversity conservation. Earlier studies have mainly focused on taxonomic diversity within protected areas. However, functional and especially phylogenetic diversities are less studied phenomena, especially with respect to the impacts of the matrix that surrounds protected areas. Phylogenetic diversity refers to the range of evolutionary lineages, the maintenance of which ensures that future evolutionary potential is safeguarded. Functional diversity refers to the range of ecological roles that members of a community perform. For ecosystem functioning and long-term resilience, they are at least as important as taxonomic diversity. Aim We studied how the characteristics of protected areas and land use intensity in the surrounding matrix affect the diversity of bird communities in protected boreal forests. We used line-transect count and land-cover data from 91 forest reserves in Northern Finland, and land-cover data from buffer zones surrounding these reserves. We studied if habitat diversity and productivity inside protected areas, and intensity of forest management in the matrix have consistent effects on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversities, and community specialization. Results We found that habitat diversity and productivity inside protected areas have strong effects on all diversity metrics, but matrix effects were inconsistent. The proportion of old forest in the matrix, reflecting low intensity forest management, had positive effects on community specialization. Interestingly, functional diversity increased with increasing logging intensity in the matrix. Conclusions Our results indicate that boreal forest reserves are not able to maintain their species composition and abundances if embedded in a severely degraded matrix. Our study also highlights the importance of focusing on different aspects of biodiversity.

Gailly, Robin; Paquet, Jean-Yves; Titeux, Nicolas; Claessens, Hugues; Dufrene, Marc				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	247			91-97	Sep 1 2017	2017				English	2	19	Over the last decade, the conversion of annual-rotation based crops or grassland areas into non-food perennial crops has been increasingly prevalent in European farming systems. This shift is associated with major changes in management practices and has created new environmental conditions and resources for wildlife. Impacts on birds have been examined for bioenergy agricultural systems, such as miscanthus plantations and short-rotation willow coppice. However, they remain largely unknown for Christmas tree plantations (CTPs) that have recently increased considerably in some European countries. We examined the extent to which CTPs alter bird species assemblages in the farmland areas of southern Belgium, where they mainly replace intensive grassland. The abundance of birds was recorded during the breeding season in randomly selected sites located in grassland and in CTP. Results show that introduction of CTP into landscapes dominated by grassland with low hedge densities locally increases bird species richness and abundance without leading to biotic homogenization. Differences in species richness and abundance between grassland and CTP decrease with increasing hedge densities. A community analysis indicates that the plantation of Christmas trees enriches the bird assemblage of intensive grassland areas. In intensive grassland with few hedges, small-size CTPs could constitute an option to increase structural heterogeneity and provide new potential breeding conditions for some farmland birds. However, questions remain about the genuine quality of the resources available in CTP and further research is needed to examine the breeding success and survival of birds that settle in this type of habitat.

Raynor, Edward J.; Cable, Ted T.; Sandercock, Brett K.				Restoration Ecology	25	5		778-787	Sep 2017	2017				English	2	20	Invasion of riparian habitats by non-native plants is a global problem that requires an understanding of community-level responses by native plants and animals. In the Great Plains, resource managers have initiated efforts to control the eastward incursion of Tamarix as a non-native bottomland plant (Tamarix ramosissima) along the Cimarron River in southwestern Kansas, United States. To understand how native avifauna interact with non-native plants, we studied the effects of Tamarix removal on riparian bird communities. We compared avian site occupancy of three foraging guilds, abundance of four nesting guilds, and assessed community dynamics with dynamic, multiseason occupancy models across three replicated treatments. Community parameters were estimated for Tamarix-dominated sites (untreated), Tamarix-removal sites (treated), and reference sites with native cottonwood sites (Populus deltoides). Estimates of initial occupancy (2006) for the ground-to-shrub foraging guild tended to be highest at Tamarix-dominated sites, while initial occupancy of the upper-canopy foraging and mid-canopy foraging guilds were highest in the treated and reference sites, respectively. Estimates of relative abundance for four nesting guilds indicated that the reference habitat supported the highest relative abundance of birds overall, although the untreated habitat had higher abundance of shrub-nesters than treated or reference habitats. Riparian sites where invasive Tamarix is dominant in the Great Plains can provide nesting habitat for some native bird species, with avian abundance and diversity that are comparable to remnant riparian sites with native vegetation. Moreover, presence of some native vegetation in Tamarix-dominated and Tamarix-removal sites may increase abundance of riparian birds such as cavity-nesters. Overall, our study demonstrates that Tamarix may substitute for native flora in providing nesting habitat for riparian birds at the eastern edge of its North American range.

Rolo, Victor; Olivier, Pieter I.; van Aarde, Rudolph				Restoration Ecology	25	5		788-797	Sep 2017	2017				English	3	28	Functional diversity indicators are increasingly used to monitor forest function recovery because they connect biodiversity to ecosystem functions. However, identifying which functions deviate from a reference forest has not received much attention, despite its potential to inform restoration interventions. In this study, we used functional groups to assess the recovery of ecosystem functions in regenerating coastal dune forests. We surveyed birds and trees in forest of different ages and a reference old-growth forest in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We classified species into functional groups for each taxa based on functional traits or a priori defined categories (i.e. guilds) and quantified the number of species within functional groups as a proxy of function stability. Bird species density followed an asymptotic trajectory, reaching old-growth forest values after 25 years. Insectivores and granivores showed saturating trajectories, whereas small frugivores and generalists increased linearly. With the exception of large frugivores, relative abundances of bird functional groups progressed towards old-growth forest values as the forest aged. Tree species density increased linearly with forest age. In contrast to old-growth forests, large-canopy trees and understory shrubs were under-represented, while mid-canopy trees dominated regenerating forests. Our result suggests that most bird, but not tree, functions may have been restored. The trend in large frugivore numbers may warrant further investigation, as their low numbers may have hampered the recovery of tree functions. We conclude that functional group trajectories can track functions that deviate from a benchmark, and may therefore direct adaptive actions to recover the stability of regenerating forest.

Biological Conservation	213	A		225-233	Sep 2017	2017				English	7	70	The consequences of converting tropical rainforest to oil palm are well-documented, but the impacts of oil palm conversion on natural savanna landscapes remain little-known. Natural savannas in South America have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the Colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the Llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared.

Exo, Klaus-Michael; Wellbrock, Arndt H.J.; Sondermann, Julia; Maier, Martin				Bird Conservation International	27	3		440-453	Sep 2017	2017				English	3	11	Informed application of habitat management measures is crucial, especially in saltmarshes that function as last refuges for breeding waders in Europe. Despite a reduction in agricultural use of saltmarshes since the establishment of the Wadden Sea National Parks at the end of the 1980s, there remains controversy regarding management measures such as the timing of mowing. We modelled the proportion of nests and chicks that would be jeopardised by mowing at different dates, using long-term breeding data of the Common Redshank Tringa totanus - an endangered and widespread indicator species of saltmarshes - from four study sites in the German Wadden Sea. At two study sites in the western Jadebusen, the proportion of broods that were at risk of being killed when mowing began on 1 July ranged between 78% in early, to 96% in late, breeding years, averaging 87%. Although Common Redshanks in the eastern Jadebusen started breeding one week earlier, the model still predicted a loss of 73% of chicks; while 97% of broods were at risk on the island of Wangerooge. Postponement of mowing to 1 August reduced these proportions to 21%, 11% and 32%, respectively. This study is the first to model the positive effects of delayed mowing of saltmarshes on ground-nesting birds. By implementing adjusted mowing dates in addition to previously suggested reductions in artificial drainage, direct and indirect adverse effects caused by mowing and drainage, such as an increased predation risk, are likely to be reduced, such that a 'favourable conservation status' according to the EC Habitats Directive may be achieved.

Dwayne; Davis, Craig A.; Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.				Ecological Applications	27	6		1805-1814	Sep 2017	2017				English	8	41	Fire is a disturbance process that maintains the structure and function of grassland ecosystems while sustaining grassland biodiversity. Conversion of grasslands to other land uses coupled with altered disturbance regimes has greatly diminished the habitat available to many grassland-dependent species. These changes have been linked to declines in breeding bird populations, but may also be critical for migrating bird populations such as those shorebird species that depend on mesic grasslands during migration. We examined migratory shorebird use of burned grasslands in the southern Great Plains of North America using DISTANCE sampling to estimate and compare bird densities across recently burned and not recently burned landscapes (1-5 yr post fire). We conducted two surveys per week for 8-10 weeks along a 54-km route starting at the end of March and concluding in mid-May during 2014-2015. We encountered 2,509 total shorebirds in recently burned areas compared to 130 individuals in areas that were unburned. Fire was a major attractant for our three focal species with American Golden-plover (Pluvialis dominica), Upland Sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda), and Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) densities of 20.48, 11.09, and 26.09 birds/km2 in burned areas compared with 0.00, 1.27, and 0.92 birds/km2 in unburned areas, respectively. This research illustrates the importance of burned grassland for migrating shorebirds, a phenomenon that has largely gone unreported previously. Generally, these findings add to a body of knowledge that demonstrates the value of managing grasslands with historic disturbances that vary over space and time. The application of these findings should improve decision-making for shorebird conservation and provides evidence that prescribed fire planning should include consideration for breeding, transient, and non-breeding populations that vary in their temporal use of the landscape.

However, management systems suitable for one taxon, such as plants, can be detrimental to other taxa, such as insects, and vice versa. This study attempts to support conservation management planning by clarifying the effects of different grassland management practices on species richness and species composition of vascular plants, butterflies, moths, orthopterans and ground beetles, also taking into account the effects of climate and the landscape context. The study was performed in the White Carpathians Protected Landcape Area and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (Czech Republic), which is famous for its grasslands with the globally highest fine-scale plant species richness. Different management practices (mowing, grazing, abandonment and mixed management; the latter including the previous three) were applied for at least five consecutive years at 34 sites, where plants and different insect groups were subsequently sampled. Effects of management on species richness of different taxonomic groups were assessed using generalised linear models, whereas the effects on species composition were assessed using redundancy analysis. Management influenced plant, butterfly and moth species richness, but the effects of particular management practices on all species and species of regional conservation importance differed between these taxonomic groups. Plant and moth species richness increased with mowing, but moth species richness decreased with grazing. Mixed management favoured plant and butterfly richness. Plant species composition was infuenced by mowing, grazing and mixed management while that of moths by mowing and grazing. Orthopterans and ground beetles did not respond significantly to management. Our results indicate that conservation management should comprise the traditional practices that have historically contributed to the formation of the biological diversity of the semi-natural grasslands in the study area. In particular, grazing may not be optimal for traditional hay-meadows and mowing should be carried out similarly as in pre-intensive farmland, creating spatio-temporal heterogeneity rather than uniformly cutting large grassland areas during a short period. In general, the optimal management should be heterogeneous, applying different practices in a mosaic or at different times during the season.

Gallo, Travis; Stinson, Lani T.; Pejchar, Liba				Biological Conservation	212	A		39-47	Aug 2017	2017				English	3	18	Using habitat mitigation to minimize or offset negative impacts of land use change on biodiversity is increasingly common and widespread. For example, where natural disturbance is undesirable (e.g., wildfire in oil and gas fields), mechanical approaches are frequently used to replace natural disturbance and improve habitat for particular species. However, the consequences of such actions for diverse animal assemblages have gone largely unexamined. To assess whether mitigation targeting single species can emulate natural processes and improve habitat for multiple species, we investigated the short-term response of birds and mammals to mechanical tree reduction and natural wildfire in a landscape altered by energy development. We found that no mammal species responded positively to mitigation for energy development in our study region. In contrast, four mammal species were positively associated with fire, and only a single species responded negatively. Similarly, only a single species of bird responded positively to mitigation. Fire had a positive effect on the density of three bird species and a negative effect on six bird species. We show that habitat mitigation intended to emulate natural disturbances and mitigate the negative effects of energy development has mixed but largely negative short-term consequences for birds and mammals. To sustain biodiversity in places undergoing rapid land use change, mitigation should explicitly measure both intended and unintended effects on diverse taxa.

The essence of Minsmere was perhaps best captured by Simon Barnes: 'Minsmere has a quality of vividness. It is a place that opens your eyes and ears, your heart and mind to birds: and to everything else that lives as well. There is a quality about Minsmere that inspires delight in life, all kinds of life: wildlife of every sort and, as an added bonus, your own life as well.

Zimmerman, Guthrie S.; Sauer, John R.; Boomer, G. Scott; Devers, Patrick K.; Garrettson, Pamela R.				Condor	119	3		616-628	Aug 2017	2017				English	2	11	The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) uses data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to assist in monitoring and management of some migratory birds. However, BBS analyses provide indices of population change rather than estimates of population size, precluding their use in developing abundance-based objectives and limiting applicability to harvest management. Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa) are important harvested birds in the Atlantic Flyway (AF) that are difficult to detect during aerial surveys because they prefer forested habitat. We integrated Wood Duck count data from a ground-plot survey in the northeastern U. S. with AF-wide BBS, banding, parts collection, and harvest data to derive estimates of population size for the AF. Overlapping results between the smaller-scale intensive groundplot survey and the BBS in the northeastern U. S. provided a means for scaling BBS indices to the breeding population size estimates. We applied these scaling factors to BBS results for portions of the AF lacking intensive surveys. Banding data provided estimates of annual survival and harvest rates; the latter, when combined with parts-collection data, provided estimates of recruitment. We used the harvest data to estimate fall population size. Our estimates of breeding population size and variability from the integrated population model (N = 0.99 million, SD = 0.04) were similar to estimates of breeding population size based solely on data from the AF ground-plot surveys and the BBS (N = 1.01 million, SD = 0.04) from 1998 to 2015. Integrating BBS data with other data provided reliable population size estimates for Wood Ducks at a scale useful for harvest and habitat management in the AF, and allowed us to derive estimates of important demographic parameters (e.g., seasonal survival rates, sex ratio) that were not directly informed by data.

Yahya, Muhammad S.; Syafiq, Muhamad; Ashton-Butt, Adham; Ghazali, Amal; Asmah, Siti; Azhar, Badrul				Ecology and Evolution	7	16		6314-6325	Aug 2017	2017				English	10	42	Monoculture farming is pervasive in industrial oil palm agriculture, including those RSPO plantations certified as sustainably managed. This farming practice does not promote the maintenance of farmland biodiversity. However, little scientific attention has been given to polyculture farming in oil palm production landscapes. Polyculture farming is likely to increase the floristic diversity and stand structural complexity that underpins biodiversity. Mist nets were used to sample birds at 120 smallholdings in Peninsular Malaysia. At each site, 12 vegetation structure characteristics were measured. We compared bird species richness, abundance, and composition between monoculture and polyculture smallholdings and used predictive models to examine the effects of habitat quality on avian biodiversity. Bird species richness was significantly greater in polyculture than that of monoculture smallholdings. The number of fallen and standing, dead oil palms were also important positive predictors of species richness. Bird abundance was also strongly increased by standing and dead oil palms and decreased with oil palm stand height. Our results indicate that polyculture farming can improve bird species richness in oil palm production landscapes. In addition, key habitat variables that are closely associated with farming practices, such as the removal of dead trees, should and can be managed by oil palm growers in order to promote biodiversity. To increase the sustainability of oil palm agriculture, it is imperative that stakeholders modify the way oil palms are currently planted and managed. Our findings can guide policy makers and certification bodies to promote oil palm production landscapes that will function more sustainably and increase existing biodiversity of oil palm landscapes.

Lindbladh, Matts; Lindstrom, Ake; Hedwall, Per-Ola; Felton, Adam				Forest Ecology and Management	397			48-56	Aug 1 2017	2017				English	3	46	Forests used for timber production provide essential ecosystem services to society, as well as potential breeding habitat for bird communities. In southern Sweden, 90% of productive forest land is used for timber production and stands dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) constitute approximately 40% of the forested area. Due to their homogeneous structure, these spruce production forests are often regarded as depauperate. Despite this perception, knowledge about the biodiversity found in these stands is scarce. Here we synthesize the results of four separate bird surveys conducted within 35 spruce production stands of southern Sweden. The results are compared to recent population trends within the general study area. In total 49 bird species were recorded, with a strong difference in species composition between newly planted clear-cuts (forest age <15 years) and forests older than 15 years. The majority of species encountered in the older forest category were common forest birds, with a single red-listed species among the regularly occurring species. In contrast, three red-listed "farmland species" were frequently encountered in the newly planted forests, revealing the capacity of those birds preferring open and recently disturbed habitats to utilize clear-cuts. A higher diversity of tree sizes and the inclusion of even relatively small proportions (<15%) of broadleaved tree species had a positive effect on bird species richness. Several species encountered in spruce production forests are declining in numbers, but it is not clear whether these stands are acting as source or sink environments for their populations. However, our results indicate that relatively small adjustments to spruce forest management should improve the quality of this widespread habitat. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Zhao, Qing; Mason, Tom H.E.; Azeria, Ermias T.; Le Blanc, Melanie-Louise; Lemaitre, Jerome; Barnier, Florian; Bichet, Orphe; Fortin, Daniel				Forest Ecology and Management	397			108-116	Aug 1 2017	2017				English	1	20	Indicator species are widely used biodiversity surrogates that allow the assessment of biodiversity without the expensive and time-consuming construction of species inventories. The selection of indicator species often relies on species co-occurrence patterns, which may be altered by anthropogenic disturbance such as forest harvesting, imposing a unique challenge to their application in managed forest. Here, we studied boreal bird communities in natural forests originating from wildfire and managed forests originating from clearcutting. We aimed to (1) compare species co-occurrence patterns in natural and clearcut forest stands, (2) select indicator species based on species co-occurrence patterns to predict avian diversity, and (3) evaluate the predictive performance of indicator species under both natural and clearcutting disturbance regimes using the same training data set and an independent testing data set. We found that species co-occurrence patterns differ substantially between natural and clearcut stands, suggesting that forest harvesting alters species-environment relationships and/or interspecific interactions. Consequently, we selected different sets of species as indicators of avian diversity based on data from natural or clearcut stands. However, according to internal and external evaluation, selecting indicator species using data from both natural and clearcut stands produced surrogates that predicted avian diversity accurately and precisely in both types of forests. Our results suggest that, despite forest harvesting altering species co-occurrence patterns, a comprehensive understanding of species co-occurrence patterns across natural and managed forests can be used to develop robust biodiversity surrogates. Our study shows that small sets of indicator species can represent the biodiversity of a wide range of species in ecosystems undergoing anthropogenic disturbance, which has important implications for the application of biodiversity surrogates for conservation.

Animal Conservation	20	4		370-381	Aug 2017	2017				English	4	23	Land-use change is the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss in the tropics. Biodiversity models can be useful tools to inform policymakers and conservationists of the likely response of species to anthropogenic pressures, including land-use change. However, such models generalize biodiversity responses across wide areas and many taxa, potentially missing important characteristics of particular sites or clades. Comparisons of biodiversity models with independently collected field data can help us understand the local factors that mediate broad-scale responses. We collected independent bird occurrence and abundance data along two elevational transects in Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania and the Taita Hills, Kenya. We estimated the local response to land use and compared our estimates with modelled local responses based on a large database of many different taxa across Africa. To identify the local factors mediating responses to land use, we compared environmental and species assemblage information between sites in the independent and African-wide datasets. Bird species richness and abundance responses to land use in the independent data followed similar trends as suggested by the African-wide biodiversity model, however the land-use classification was too coarse to capture fully the variability introduced by local agricultural management practices. A comparison of assemblage characteristics showed that the sites on Kilimanjaro and the Taita Hills had higher proportions of forest specialists in croplands compared to the Africa-wide average. Local human population density, forest cover and vegetation greenness also differed significantly between the independent and Africa-wide datasets. Biodiversity models including those variables performed better, particularly in croplands, but still could not accurately predict the magnitude of local species responses to most land uses, probably because local features of the land management are still missed. Overall, our study demonstrates that local factors mediate biodiversity responses to land use and cautions against applying biodiversity models to local contexts without prior knowledge of which factors are locally relevant.

Ecosystems	20	5		872-884	Aug 2017	2017				English	1	45	Changes in fire frequency, extent, and intensity mean that understanding the effects of fire on plants and animals is a primary concern for ecologists and land managers. Given the potentially conflicting fire responses of species both within and across taxonomic groups, prescribing fire regimes based on the response of one or only a few species may have negative consequences for other species. Here, we integrate data collected from a series of independent but complementary studies spanning a 75 + year chronosequence in a semi-arid shrubland ecosystem in south-western Australia to consider how fire management can best promote biodiversity both within and across taxonomic groups (plants, birds, small mammals, and reptiles). Younger fire ages (6-14 years) contained sparse shrubs, large areas of bare ground, and lacked a distinct litter layer and canopy. The oldest vegetation (60-85 years) had a distinct canopy, a well-developed litter layer and cryptogamic crust, higher variability in patch width, and more woody debris. Plant species richness and diversity decreased with time since fire, whereas bird species richness and diversity increased with time since fire, and mammal and reptile species richness and diversity showed no trend. The composition of all four taxonomic groups varied according to time since fire and the presence of 11 species was confined above or below certain fire-age thresholds. Our results support the need to maintain a mix of both younger and older fire ages across the landscape to maximise species diversity, and highlight the particular importance of older fire ages for many species. Future fire management for biodiversity conservation will benefit from identifying and reconciling cross-taxa contrasts and complementarities.

Human disturbances, even at low levels, are likely to impact species during sensitive periods of the annual cycle. However, experimental studies during the putative sensitive period of territory establishment of birds which not only investigate low disturbance levels, but which also exclude the effect of habitat modification (e.g. walking trails) are lacking. Here, we experimentally disturbed birds in forest plots by walking through twice a day during territory establishment. Later we compared the breeding bird community of experimentally disturbed plots with that of undisturbed control plots. We discovered that the number of territories (-15.0%) and species richness (-15.2%) in disturbed plots were substantially reduced compared with control plots. Species most affected included those sensitive to human presence (assessed by flight-initiation distances), open-cup nesters and above-ground foragers. Long-distance migrants, however, were unaffected due to their arrival after experimental disturbance took place. These findings highlight how territory establishment is a sensitive period for birds, when even low levels of human recreation may be perceived as threatening, and alter settlement decisions. This can have important implications for the conservation of species, which might go unnoticed when focusing only on already established birds.

Landscape Ecology	32	7		1433-1446	Jul 2017	2017				English	5	29	Global temperatures are projected to increase and affect forests and wildlife populations. Forest management can potentially mitigate climate-induced changes through promoting carbon sequestration, forest resilience, and facilitated change. We modeled direct and indirect effects of climate change on avian abundance through changes in forest landscapes and assessed impacts on bird abundances of forest management strategies designed to mitigate climate change effects. We coupled a Bayesian hierarchical model with a spatially explicit landscape simulation model (LANDIS PRO) to predict avian relative abundance. We considered multiple climate scenarios and forest management scenarios focused on carbon sequestration, forest resilience, and facilitated change over 100 years. Management had a greater impact on avian abundance (almost 50% change under some scenarios) than climate (<3% change) and only early successional and coniferous forest showed significant change in percent cover across time. The northern bobwhite was the only species that changed in abundance due to climate-induced changes in vegetation. Northern bobwhite, prairie warbler, and blue-winged warbler generally increased in response to warming temperatures but prairie warbler exhibited a non-linear response and began to decline as summer maximum temperatures exceeded 36 [degree]C at the end of the century. Linking empirical models with process-based landscape change models can be an effective way to predict climate change and management impacts on wildlife, but time frames greater than 100 years may be required to see climate related effects. We suggest that future research carefully consider species-specific effects and interactions between management and climate.

American Midland Naturalist	178	1		47-63	Jul 2017	2017				English	2	21	Surrogate grasslands established through federal set-aside programs, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), provide important habitat for grassland birds. Warm season grass CRP fields as a group have the potential for providing a continuum of habitat structure for breeding birds, depending on how the fields are managed and their floristic composition. We studied the nesting activity of four obligate grassland bird species, Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and Henslow's Sparrow (A. henslowii), in relation to vegetative composition and fire management in warm season CRP fields in southwest Wisconsin during 2009-2011. Intraspecific variation in apparent nest density was related to the number of years since the field was burned. Apparent Grasshopper Sparrow nest density was highest in the breeding season immediately following spring burns, apparent Henslow's Sparrow nest density was highest 1 y post burn, and apparent Bobolink and Eastern Meadowlark nest densities were higher in post fire years one to three. Grasshopper Sparrow nest density was highest on sites with more diverse vegetation, specifically prairie forbs, and on sites with shorter less dense vegetation. Bobolink, Eastern Meadowlark, and Henslow's Sparrow apparent nest densities were higher on sites with deeper litter; litter was the vegetative component that was most affected by spring burns. Overall nest success was 0.487 for Bobolink (22 d nesting period), 0.478 for Eastern Meadowlark (25 d nesting period), 0.507 for Grasshopper Sparrow (22 d nesting period), and 0.151 for Henslow's Sparrow (21 d nesting period). The major nest predators were grassland-associated species: thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), milk snake (Lampropeltis triangulum), American badger (Taxidea taxus), and western fox snake (Elaphe vulpina).

Bett, Mark Cheruiyot; Muchai, Muchane; Waweru, Catherine				Scopus	37	2		24-31	Jul 2017	2017				English	3	3	Species-rich tropical forests are becoming increasingly fragmented, degraded and are declining due to human activities, threatening the survival of avian species that depend on them. We assessed the detrimental effects of human activities on birds and their habitats in and around North Nandi Forest. A semi-structured questionnaire survey was used to collect data on human activities affecting birds and their habitats among forest users and forest protectors in North Nandi Forest. Habitat destruction (70%) was the main detrimental human activity on avifaunal habitats, while hunting of birds for subsistence use (10%) only affected certain bird species. The age group between 20 and 40 years used the forest most frequently and most activities were undertaken in indigenous forest habitat. Significantly, men undertook timber extraction and livestock grazing, while women undertook collection of firewood and medicinal herbs. Illegal forest exploitation should be curbed in order to ensure future survival of avifaunal diversity in North Nandi Forest.

Vali, Ulo; Tuvi, Joosep; Sein, Gunnar				Journal of Ornithology	158	3		841-850	Jul 2017	2017				English	3	20	Anthropogenic loss of biodiversity is often indicated by the disappearance of top predators. However, some of them have adapted to man-made agricultural landscapes. Among raptors, one such example is the Lesser Spotted Eagle. We compiled an exhaustive data set on foraging habitat composition of this species by direct field mapping and detailed land cover maps to study the effect of various agricultural management practices on its occupancy of home ranges and productivity, as well as on its habitat utilization and hunting success. Home ranges of the Lesser Spotted Eagle contained more natural grasslands (7.6%) and other agricultural biotopes (29.9%) than expected by random, and they preferred to breed close to managed agricultural biotopes. They hunted preferably on grasslands, where they spent 86% of their time, especially on managed grasslands, but avoided arable fields. In total, 51% of the Lesser Spotted Eagle attacks were successful, and we detected no differences in hunting success among habitats. Nests of successfully breeding birds were surrounded by more crops/cultivated grassland on a rotational basis (19.0%), as well as by managed natural grassland (1.1%), than those of unsuccessful pairs (16 and 0.7%, respectively). We also detected a negative impact of oilseed rape fields and mowed cultivated grassland on the reproductive success of the Lesser Spotted Eagle, but these effects were not consistent over the years. Our results suggest that, although the Lesser Spotted Eagle is well adapted to foraging in traditional farmland, it is threatened by changes in agricultural practices and an increasing sown area of some crops, such as oilseed rape. Cultivation of various crops and retaining of grasslands, interspersed with set-aside and non-agricultural habitat patches, promoted by the European Union greening policy, would be favourable to the Lesser Spotted Eagle.

Murray, Bryan D.; Holland, Jeffrey D.; Summerville, Keith S.; Dunning, John B., Jr; Saunders, Michael R.; Jenkins, Michael A.				Ecological Applications	27	4		1064-1081	Jun 2017	2017				English	5	44	Contemporary forest management offers a trade-off between the potential positive effects of habitat heterogeneity on biodiversity, and the potential harm to mature forest communities caused by habitat loss and perforation of the forest canopy. While the response of taxonomic diversity to forest management has received a great deal of scrutiny, the response of functional diversity is largely unexplored. However, functional diversity may represent a more direct link between biodiversity and ecosystem function. To examine how forest management affects diversity at multiple spatial scales, we analyzed a long-term data set that captured changes in taxonomic and functional diversity of moths (Lepidoptera), longhorned beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), and breeding birds in response to contemporary silvicultural systems in oak-hickory hardwood forests. We used these data sets to address the following questions: how do even- and uneven-aged silvicultural systems affect taxonomic and functional diversity at the scale of managed landscapes compared to the individual harvested and unharvested forest patches that comprise the landscapes, and how do these silvicultural systems affect the functional similarity of assemblages at the scale of managed landscapes and patches? Due to increased heterogeneity within landscapes, we expected even-aged silviculture to increase and uneven-aged silviculture to decrease functional diversity at the landscape level regardless of impacts at the patch level. Functional diversity responses were taxon-specific with respect to the direction of change and time since harvest. Responses were also consistent across patch and landscape levels within each taxon. Moth assemblage species richness, functional richness, and functional divergence were negatively affected by harvesting, with stronger effects resulting from uneven-aged than even-aged management. Longhorned beetle assemblages exhibited a peak in species richness two years after harvesting, while functional diversity metrics did not differ between harvested and unharvested patches and managed landscapes. The species and functional richness of breeding bird assemblages increased in response to harvesting with more persistent effects in uneven- than in even-aged managed landscapes. For moth and bird assemblages, species turnover was driven by species with more extreme trait combinations. Our study highlights the variability of multi-taxon functional diversity in response to forest management across multiple spatial scales.

Farr, Cooper M.; Pejchar, Liba; Reed, Sarah E.				Ecological Applications	27	4		1236-1252	Jun 2017	2017				English	3	21	Developing effective tools for conservation on private lands is increasingly important for global biodiversity conservation; private lands are located in more productive and biologically diverse areas, and they face accelerated rates of land conversion. One strategy is conservation development (CD) subdivisions, which cluster houses in a small portion of a property and preserve the remaining land as protected open space. Despite widespread use, the characteristics that make CD more or less effective at achieving biodiversity conservation are not well understood. We investigated CD's ability to successfully protect animal populations by examining bird and mammal occurrences in 14 CD subdivisions and four undeveloped areas (range: 14-432 ha) in northern Colorado, USA. Using point count and camera trap data in an occupancy modeling framework, we evaluated the relative importance of nine subdivision design factors (e.g., housing density, proportion of CD protected) and 14 stewardship factors (e.g., presence of livestock, percent native vegetation cover) in influencing the overall community composition and the probability of use by 16 birds and six mammals. We found that habitat use by 75% of birds and 83% of mammals was associated with design characteristics that maximized the natural or undisturbed land area both within and near the development (e.g., proportion of CD protected, total area of protected open space, proportion of natural land cover in the surrounding landscape). These factors were also associated with an increasing dominance of human-sensitive bird species, larger-bodied mammals, and mammals with larger home ranges. Habitat use by birds was also influenced by local land use composition and quality, and use by several bird and mammal species decreased with increased localized disturbances. We found few differences in habitat use between sampling sites in undeveloped areas and in CD subdivisions. These similarities indicate that, if CDs are large enough or located within a matrix of undeveloped land, they can provide habitat that supports similar use patterns as protected areas without housing development. By incorporating characteristics that promote the persistence of sensitive birds and mammals on private lands, CDs have potential to preserve native biodiversity in areas threatened by expanding residential development.

To conserve urban biodiversity within these natural refugia, habitat restoration such as weed control and revegetation is often implemented. These actions are expected to benefit biodiversity, although species known to be affected by urbanization may not be interacting with restoration in the ways we anticipate. In this study, we use a case study to explore how urban restoration activities impact different bird species. Birds were grouped into urban sensitivity categories and species abundance, and richness was then calculated using a hierarchical species community model for individual species responses, with urban class used as the hierarchical parameter. We highlight variable responses of birds to revegetation and weed control based on their level of urban sensitivity. Revegetation of open grassy areas delivers significant bird conservation outcomes, but the effects of weed control are neutral or in some cases negative. Specifically, the species most reliant on remnant vegetation in cities seem to remain stable or decline in abundance in areas with weed control, which we suspect is the result of a simplification of the understorey. The literature reports mixed benefits of weed control between taxa and between locations. We recommend, in our case study site, that weed control be implemented in concert with replanting of native vegetation to provide the understory structure preferred by urban sensitive birds. Understanding the impacts of revegetation and weed control on different bird species is important information for practitioners to make restoration decisions about the allocation of funds for conservation action. This new knowledge can be used both for threatened species and invasive species management.

Dvorak, Michael; Nemeth, Erwin; Wendelin, Beate; Herrera, Patricio; Mosquera, Denis; Anchundia, David; Sevilla, Christian; Tebbich, Sabine; Fessl, Birgit				Journal of Field Ornithology	88	2		132-145	Jun 2017	2017				English	5	19	On Floreana, the smallest inhabited island in the Galapagos, populations of several species of birds have either been extirpated or, based on anecdotal evidence and small-scale surveys, are declining. Our objective, therefore, was to conduct a comprehensive survey of landbirds encompassing the entire island during three breeding seasons (2014-2016). We conducted surveys at 59 points in 2014, 257 in 2015, and 295 in 2016. Each survey point was sampled once. We detected 12 species during our surveys. Galapagos Flycatchers, Yellow Warblers, Small and Medium ground-finches, and Small Tree-Finches were widely distributed over the entire island. Common Cactus-Finches and Medium Tree-Finches had more restricted distributions in the lower or higher parts of the island. Few Dark-billed Cuckoos (Coccyzus melacoryphus), Paint-billed Crakes (Neocrex erythrops), Galapagos Doves (Zenaida galapagoensis), and Galapagos Short-eared Owls (Asio flammeus galapagoensis) were recorded. Small Ground-Finches and Small Tree-Finches were found at densities comparable to those on other Galapagos Islands, whereas densities of Galapagos Flycatchers and Yellow Warblers were higher on Floreana than on other islands. Endemic Medium Tree-Finches were confined to an area of 24 km2, mainly in the highlands, but were still widespread and common in their restricted habitat, with the number of territories estimated to be between 3900 and 4700. Of 22 originally occurring landbirds on Floreana, no fewer than 10 species have either been extirpated or are likely to have been extirpated since the arrival of the first human inhabitants. The combined effects of introduced mammals, large-scale habitat destruction, and direct human persecution were responsible for the extirpation of six species during the 19th century. Three additional species have been extirpated since 1960, likely due to the introduction of the parasitic fly Philornis downsi, and this fly remains a major threat for the remaining bird species. Developing strategies for reducing the impact of these flies on the birds of the Galapagos Islands must be a high priority. In addition, habitat management and restoration, including the control of invasive plants and promotion of native tree species, will be critically important in conserving landbird populations on Floreana.

Rega-Brodsky, Christine C.; Nilon, Charles H.				Urban Ecosystems	20	3		561-571	Jun 2017	2017				English	2	30	Urban vacant lots can vary considerably in their vegetation structure, from dense, shrubby habitats to wooded remnant fragments that may provide habitat for a variety of birds. By identifying which features promote diverse bird communities, we can determine at which scale management practices should focus and the necessary habitat structure and composition features. We surveyed 150 vacant lots throughout Baltimore, Maryland for their bird communities, lot vegetation, and landscape-level forest cover. An ordination of the bird community indicated a response to a gradient of canopy cover and canopy height at the vacant lot. We also found that forest cover within 100 m of the vacant lot was the most important predictor of abundance for five bird species of interest. Species richness was spatially autocorrelated among sites, indicating that bird communities may also be driven by species' dispersal and environmental gradients across the city. Overall, bird communities are responding to habitat features across multiple scales, from the vacant lot vegetation, to landscape-level forest cover, to city-wide dynamics. Thus, we recommend management practices to focus on increasing city-wide forest cover in order to increase species richness, yet with awareness regarding where the lot occurs within the city.

Bare, Matthew C.; Danner, Raymond M.				Ecological Restoration	35	2		102-111	Jun 2017	2017				English	1	1	Secondary forests have reclaimed one sixth of deforested land worldwide, and much of this revegetated forest lies in agricultural and increasingly semi-urban landscapes. While, many studies have described faunal populations such as birds across forest-agricultural landscapes, they generally note minor changes in total species richness and more significant changes in species composition. Few studies, however, consider faunal diversity among secondary forests of different management history, such as manual restoration or natural revegetation. In this study, we surveyed bird communities in three forest sites of varying restoration and natural revegetation treatments in a tropical urban-agricultural landscape in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Our sites include manually restored and naturally revegetating forest of 20-40 years since clearing. We found that a diverse assemblage of birds visit and occupy forest fragments within the urban-agricultural landscape, including two IUCN-listed near-threatened species. Bird species richness was similar across sites of different management history; species composition varied only slightly, but differences existed in presence and occupancy for forest-dependent groups, such as large frugivores and forest insectivores. In the manually restored site, bird diversity may have been limited by under-developed forest structure, but we were unable to isolate the effects of patch size and landscape matrix. We suggest that future restoration activities consider forest structure in addition to plant species diversity when attempting to restore faunal populations, and that future studies take heed of landscape and matrix parameters when evaluating restoration projects.

Smith, Max; Finch, Deborah M.				U S Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station General Technical Report RMRS-GTR	364			i-iii, 1-66	Jun 2017	2017				English	2	2	Aridland riparian ecosystems are limited, the climate is changing, and further hydrological change is likely in the American Southwest. To protect riparian ecosystems and organisms, we need to understand how they are affected by disturbance processes and stressors such as fire, drought, and non-native plant invasions. Riparian vegetation is critically important as foraging, resting, migrating, and breeding habitat to birds and other animal species in the southwestern United States. Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii), and other woody species provide birds with nesting sites and foraging opportunities, some of which are absent or rare in adjacent plant communities. The structurally diverse, species-rich vegetation along many southwestern streams supports high densities of territories and nest sites for a variety of birds including several species of high conservation priority. Survival and reproduction of woody riparian plants is largely determined by periodic floods and droughts. As in other regions, rivers and streams of the American Southwest have been heavily altered by human activity, resulting in significant changes to disturbance regimes. Hydrological models, incorporating greenhouse gas emission scenarios, project that these changes will be exacerbated by climate change. In this report, we review the ecohydrology of southwestern streams and share results from our study sites along the Middle Rio Grande to describe effects of hydrological changes, wildfire, and invasions on plant communities and riparian-nesting birds. We also examine climate change projections and output from population models to gauge the future of aridland riparian ecosystems in an increasingly arid Southwest.

Tropical Conservation Science	10			1-10	May 11 2017	2017				English	1	8	The Cross River State Government in Nigeria is proposing to construct a "Cross River Superhighway'' that would bisect critical remaining areas of tropical rainforest in south eastern Nigeria. We offer and evaluate two alternative routes to the superhighway that would be less damaging to forests, protected areas, and biological diversity. The first alternative we identified avoids intact forests entirely while seeking to benefit agriculture and existing settlements. The second alternative also avoids intact forests while incorporating existing paved and unpaved roads to limit construction costs. As currently proposed, the superhighway would be 260 km long, would intersect 115 km of intact forests or protected areas, and would cost an estimated [approximately]US$2.5 billion to construct. Alternative Routes 1 and 2 are only slightly longer ([approximately]290 and [approximately]353 km, respectively) and have markedly lower estimated construction costs ([approximately]US$0.92 billion). Furthermore, the alternative routes would have negligible impacts on forests and protected areas and would be better aligned to benefit local communities and agriculture. We argue that alternative routings such as those we examined here could markedly reduce the economic and environmental costs, and potentially increase the socioeconomic benefits, for the proposed Cross River Superhighway.

We tested whether biotic homogenization was occurring in resident forest bird communities in west-central Mexico. We conducted point-count surveys to assess biotic dissimilarity between resident bird communities in tropical deciduous and oak forests in the upper Balsas River basin across 3 levels of anthropogenic perturbation: primary forest, second-growth forest, and human settlements. We detected a reduction in species richness and taxonomic dissimilarity with increasing anthropogenic effects, due to a directional pattern in which lowland species expanded their elevational distributions up into oak forests. These results point to a need to change agricultural strategies to mitigate impacts on natural vegetation cover and biodiversity.

ECOSPHERE	8	5		e01799	May 2017	2017				English	1	16	As data about populations of indicator species become available, proactive strategies that improve representation of biological diversity within protected area networks should consider finer-scaled evaluations, especially in regions identified as important through course-scale analyses. We use density distribution models derived from a robust regional bird abundance dataset, coupled with habitat conservation plans, to evaluate a network of protected areas and to inform conservation and biodiversity planning in the greater Klamath Siskiyou Bioregion, an area recognized globally as a region of outstanding biological diversity. Our novel modeling approach allowed for comparisons of abundance of conservation focal species on federal vs. non-federal lands, federal lands that are protected to maintain natural habitats vs. federal lands managed for multiple uses, and seven protected areas of interest. Our comparisons highlight conservation opportunities for suites of species associated with coniferous forests, oak woodlands, and grasslands. Specifically, we found that species associated with oak woodland and grassland habitats, both habitats of conservation concern, were not well represented in the Bioregion's existing protected areas. These species would benefit from expanding the regional protected area network to include their associated at-risk habitats. In contrast, our results suggest that coniferous forests birds are well represented in the Bioregion's protected areas. We identify management opportunities specifically associated with the restoration of fire-adapted ecosystems that would benefit coniferous forest focal species on both federally protected areas and other multiple-use lands. Our analysis provides an example of how a finer-scaled evaluation of a regional protected area network adds value to course-scale evaluations of protected areas and biological diversity. Data and results from this research were used to inform science-based expansion of the Bioregion's network of protected areas.

ECOSPHERE	8	5		e01804	May 2017	2017				English	1	16	The impacts of invasive plant control on native animals are rarely evaluated. Using data from an eight-year study in southeastern Australia, we quantified the effects on native bird, mammal, and reptile species of (1) the abundance of the invasive Bitou Bush, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata, and (2) a Bitou Bush control program, which involved repeated herbicide spraying interspersed with prescribed burning. We found that overall species richness of birds, mammals, and reptiles and the majority of individual vertebrate species were unresponsive to Bitou Bush cover and the number of plants. Two species including the nationally endangered Eastern Bristlebird (Dasyurus brachypterus) responded positively to measures of native vegetation cover following the control of Bitou Bush. Analyses of the effects of different components of the treatment protocol employed to control Bitou Bush revealed (1) no negative effects of spraying on vertebrate species richness; (2) negative effects of spraying on only one individual species (Scarlet Honeyeater); and (3) lower bird species richness but higher reptile species richness after fire. The occupancy of most individual vertebrates species was unaffected by burning; four species responded negatively and one positively to fire. Our study indicated that actions to remove Bitou Bush generally have few negative impacts on native vertebrates. We therefore suggest that controlling this highly invasive exotic plant species has only very limited negative impacts on vertebrate biota.

River Research and Applications	33	4		495-504	May 2017	2017				English	3	9	River bird assemblages can serve as beacons of environmental change associated with restoration or degradation. River birds regularly rely on riverine resources at some point in their life cycle, vary in the scale of temporal and spatial of use and forage at multiple levels of the food web (e.g. fish, aquatic plants, aquatic or emergent insects). We present a novel river bird survey method that is more easily employed and less intrusive than riverbank transect or boat surveys and encompasses a wide suite of species and a year-round time frame. We evaluate the relative efficacy of different levels of survey duration (20, 15, 10 or 5min), number of surveys (every 2weeks in spring and fall and every 3weeks in summer and winter) and number of sites on the survey's ability to document species richness and bird abundance. We used two statistical approaches, species accumulation curves (for duration, number of surveys and number of sites) and first-order Jackknifes (for duration). We conclude that a biweekly or triweekly survey, 25 sites in the focal river, and a survey duration of at least 15min are sufficient to meet our objectives. This logistically efficient survey approach facilitates monitoring complex and long-term change such as that associated with river restoration and dam removal.

Iglay, Raymond B.; Buckingham, Bruce N.; Seamans, Thomas W.; Martin, James A.; Blackwell, Bradley F.; Belant, Jerrold L.; DeVault, Travis L.				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	242			34-42	May 1 2017	2017				English	1	12	Airport properties often include agricultural land cover that can attract wildlife species hazardous to aircraft, despite recommendations against row crops near air operations areas. However, few studies have directly quantified bird use of corn, wheat, and soybean fields relative to bird-aircraft collision (strike) hazard levels to support land cover recommendations. Therefore, we compared bird use among corn, wheat and soybean fields and predicted that corn and wheat would attract bird species recognized as hazardous to aviation. We also anticipated that soybeans would pose minimal attraction to such birds. Here, hazard ranking (low to extremely high) reflects the percentage of strikes involving a species that resulted in damage to aircraft. We investigated bird use among 22 corn, wheat, and soybean fields near Oak Harbor, OH, using approximately weekly point transects from 2013 to 2014. We used generalized distance sampling models and analysis of variance using distance matrices to determine bird abundance and community responses to row crop land coverages and crop height. We observed 4331 birds of 40 species, with most birds observed in wheat fields (n = 2555 birds) and standing stubble (n = 2409 birds). Large flocks occurred more in corn and wheat fields than soybean fields, but soybean fields harbored greater cumulative hazard scores than corn, likely due to consistent detections of small, non-flocking birds in soybean fields. Crop type and height had greater influence on medium- and high-hazard level bird species than other hazard levels. Density of medium- and high-hazard level birds increased with increasing crop height in soybean and wheat fields with wheat fields having slightly greater densities than soybeans. Corn fields also had the greatest bird densities in the tallest crop height categories. Categories of very and extremely high-hazard level bird species were rarely detected, but their abundance peaked in crops 0-15 cm, similar to low-hazard level bird species. However, model selection results included null models for very and extremely high-hazard level bird species suggesting minimal effects. Overall, our results suggest that all three crop types can harbor birds hazardous to aircraft, and crop height can enhance bird use. Although not directly tested in our study, land management surrounding airports may benefit most from alternative land covers (e.g., biofuel crops), but additional research is necessary.

Kroftova, Magdalena; Reif, Jiri				Forest Ecology and Management	391			330-337	May 1 2017	2017				English	2	19	Plant invasions are a serious threat for global biodiversity and various studies have reported their impacts on forest bird populations. However, a majority of these studies involved comparisons of sites covered solely by invaded or native forest habitats, whereas the real world is dominated by habitat gradients. To address this issue, we counted birds in central European forest stands differing in the coverage of an invasive woody plant, Robinia pseudoacacia L., a major global tree invader. This species significantly affects the vegetation composition in invaded habitats, resulting in shifts in bird community compositions toward a dominance of generalist species at the expense of specialists. Here we ask: (i) how the bird species richness changes with the increasing relative coverage of R. pseudoacacia, recognizing several bird groups represented by all species, habitat specialists, habitat generalists and forest specialists, (ii) to what extent the alteration of vegetation composition accounts for these changes. By employing conditional autoregressive models, and by taking forest stand area and distance to the forest edge into account, we found that the numbers of all bird species, habitat specialists and forest specialists were highest in stands with intermediate coverage of R. pseudoacacia. This result indicates that the non-native tree was not detrimental for bird biodiversity, and that birds indeed benefited from its presence in focal forest stands, but only if native and non-native trees were present in approximately equal proportions, which was particularly true for forest specialists. The effect of R. pseudoacacia on bird species richness was significant even after taking changes in vegetation composition into account, suggesting that this invasive species affects birds not only by altering structural components of the habitat, but also by some other factors that might include food supply for birds or nest-holes. Our sampling was quite limited, particularly with respect to the range of structures and management types typically encountered in native trees, and results must be treated accordingly. However, our results appear to suggest that eradication of R. pseudoacacia from forest within our study area may not be necessary for achieving bird conservation aims, because this species does not markedly depress bird species richness, including specialists. However, the generality of our findings require further testing across other forests affected by R. pseuadoacacia invasion, to examine whether retention of this non-native tree is more widely justified.

Cambios en la Avifauna de un relicto de bosque en la franja periurbana de Bogota a lo largo de catorce anos.	Rosselli, Loreta; De La Zerda, Susana; Candil, Jonathan				Acta Biologica Colombiana	22	2		181-190	May 2017	2017				Spanish	0	5	The native vegetation of the Sabana de Bogota's flat area has been replaced by agricultural lands, pastures and urbanizations over the years. The last relict of this native vegetation is a small forest (ca 10 ha) at Hacienda Las Mercedes, in the northern border of Bogota. The forest's small size and isolation from other areas of natural vegetation have resulted in the loss of many species. The problem was exacerbated by uncontrolled growth of invasive vegetation (vines and wild blackberry). However, in recent years restorative action including control of these vegetation has been undertaken and the forest is now immerse in a natural reserve where more restorative actions are being planned. Using point count stations the authors recorded all the birds seen and heard in 2001-2002 and in 2014 in order to evaluate the changes in the bird community and estimate the effects of the restorative actions. We recorded 27 forest species in the first census and 30 in the second. The relative abundance of at least 1/3 of the species also increased indicating a positive result in the forest restoration. The results highlight the capacity of degraded ecosystems to recover and the importance of continuing the restorative actions in the reserve area.

Smith, David A. Ehlers; Smith, Yvette C. Ehlers; Downs, Colleen T.				Forest Ecology and Management	390			157-165	Apr 15 2017	2017				English	0	13	The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest is extremely biodiverse but is threatened by anthropogenic land-use change. In South Africa, remnant forest patches are divided into highly restricted but protected indigenous forest (IF) and abundant but unprotected coastal thicket/dense bush (DB), which likely represents secondary/regenerating IF. We tested the hypothesis that DB had value for conserving forest dependent avian taxonomic and functional diversity, as (a) DB is situated with in the forestanthropogenic land-use mosaic and (b) birds maintain diverse ecosystem functions and are sensitive to environmental change given their varied biological traits. We conducted 149 and 112 fixed-radius point-count surveys of avian communities in 99, and 24, patches of DB and IF, respectively, at each location recording microhabitat vegetation structure. We compared vegetation characteristics and taxonomic species richness between vegetation classes, and tested the breadth of functional trait-space and for significant associations with vegetation structures at each survey location, using RLQ analysis. Vegetation classes differed significantly, but floral species overlap and vegetation structures in DB closely resembled regenerating IF habitat. Specialist ground-nesting and insect-gleaning species corresponded to taller, more diverse IF structures. Other biological traits and total species richness overlapped broadly across both classes, but IF had significantly higher mean species richness. Given the relatively high taxonomic and functional diversity of the avian community in the abundant DB, the scarcity of IF, and the proximity of DB to the anthropogenic land-use mosaic, we recommend allocating suitable DB patches to the Protected Area Network, which may simultaneously help preserve avian taxonomic and functional diversity, facilitate colonisation throughout the fragmented landscape and provide ecosystem services to anthropogenic land uses.

Puig-Girones, Roger; Brotons, Lluis; Pons, Pere				PLoS ONE	12	3		e0173599	Mar 29 2017	2017				English	2	23	Wildfires play a determining role in the composition and structure of many plant and animal communities. On the other hand, climate change is considered to be a major driver of current and future fire regime changes. Despite increases in drought in many areas of the world, the effects of aridity on post-fire colonization by animals have been rarely addressed. This study aims to analyse how a regional aridity gradient affects post-fire recovery of vegetation, bird species richness and the numbers of four early to middle-successional warbler species associated with the shrub cover. The database contains bird relative abundance and environmental variables from 3072 censuses in 695 transects located in 70 recently burnt areas (1 to 11 years after wildfire) in Catalonia (Spain), which were sampled between 2006 and 2013. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) showed that plant cover was affected by time since fire, aridity and forest management. However, only the highest vegetation height layer (>100 cm) recovered slower in arid areas after fire. Time since fire positively influenced bird species richness and the relative abundance of the four focal species. The post-fire recovery of Melodious (Hippolais polyglotta) and Subalpine warblers (Sylvia cantillans) was hampered by aridity. Although this was not demonstrated for Dartford (S. undata) and Sardinian warblers (S. melanocephala), their occurrence was low in the driest areas during the first three years after fire. Overall, this study suggests that future increases in aridity can affect plant regeneration after fire and slow down the recovery of animal populations that depend on understorey and shrublands. Given the recently highlighted increases in aridity and fire frequency in Mediterranean-climate regions, improved knowledge on how aridity affects ecological succession is especially necessary.

Several vegetation attributes (e.g. street tree density and diversity) have important effects on biodiversity and ecological processes. In this study, we evaluated the influences of urban vegetation-represented by characteristics of street trees (canopy size, proportion of native tree species and tree species richness)-and characteristics of the landscape (distance to parks and vegetation quantity), and human impacts (human population size and exposure to noise) on taxonomic data and functional diversity indices of the bird community inhabiting streets. The study area was the southern region of Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais, Brazil), a largely urbanized city in the understudied Neotropical region. Bird data were collected on 60 point count locations distributed across the streets of the landscape. We used a series of competing GLM models (using Akaike's information criterion for small sample sizes) to assess the relative contribution of the different sets of variables to explain the observed patterns. Seventy-three bird species were observed exploiting the streets: native species were the most abundant and frequent throughout this landscape. The bird community's functional richness and Rao's Quadratic Entropy presented values lower than 0.5. Therefore, this landscape was favoring few functional traits. Exposure to noise was the most limiting factor for this bird community. However, the average size of arboreal patches and, especially the characteristics of street trees, were able to reduce the negative effects of noise on the bird community. These results show the importance of adequately planning the urban afforestation process: increasing tree species richness, preserving large trees and planting more native trees species in the streets are management practices that will increase bird species richness, abundance and community functional aspects and consequently improve human wellbeing and quality of life.	de Castro Pena, Joao Carlos; Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil, Brazil.	joaocpena@gmail.com	Young, Robert/B-7356-2013; Castro Pena, Joao Carlos/S-6798-2016	Young, Robert/0000-0002-8407-2348; Castro Pena, Joao Carlos/0000-0003-1368-1805; Armitage, Richard/0000-0002-7569-425X			Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Reproductive Biology	1932-6203		Animals and man; Nutrition; Feeding behaviour; Reproduction; Ecology; Habitat; Man made habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Neotropical region; South America	Aves [Disturbance by man / Urbanization / ] [Diet /  / ] [Foraging /  / ] [Reproduction /  / ] [Community structure /  / ] [Population dynamics / Abundance / ] [Urban habitat /  / ] [Spatial environment / Vegetation characteristics / ] [Brazil / Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte / ].

Maphisa, David H.; Smit-Robinson, Hanneline; Underhill, Les G.; Altwegg, Res				Avian Research	8			5	Mar 3 2017	2017				English	0	26	Background: World-wide grassland birds are in decline due to habitat loss and degradation resulting from intensive agricultural practices. Understanding how key grassland habitat attributes determine grassland bird densities is required to make appropriate conservation decisions. We examine drivers of bird densities in a South African grassland area that has been managed for biodiversity conservation with reduced grazing pressure. Methods: We estimated the density of the eight most common grassland bird species encountered in our area to evaluate the effects of recent grassland management changes on the avifauna. We collected data on birds and habitat from the austral summers of 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2010/2011. We used hierarchical distance sampling methods to estimate density of birds relative to two main habitat variables, i.e., grass cover and height. In addition, we used regression splines within these distance sampling models as a more flexible description of suitable ranges of grass height and cover for each species. Results: For most species, density is related to grass height and cover as expected. The African Quailfinch (Ortygospiza atricollis) and Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix) preferred relatively short and open grass. The Yellow-breasted Pipit (Anthus chloris), African Pipit (Anthus cinnamomeus) and Red-capped Lark (Calandrella cinerea) preferred short and relatively dense grass, while the Wing-snapping Cisticola (Cisticola ayresii) preferred grass of intermediate height and cover. The Cape Longclaw (Macronyx capensis) and Zitting Cisticola (Cisticola juncidis) preferred tall and dense grass. Our results agree with previous studies that grass height combined with grass cover are the most important habitat features that managers should manipulate in order to increase the density of target species. The regression splines show that the effect of these two habitat variables on density is well described by linear relationships for most species. Conclusions: This study supports previous studies suggesting that grazing and fire are important tools for management to use in order to create a mosaic of grass height and cover that would support high densities of desired species. We suggest that conservation managers of these grasslands combine fire and grazing as management tools to create suitable habitats for grassland birds in general.

Based on monitoring data for the period 2005-2010, we studied the trends in abundance and species richness of common breeding birds in Bulgaria before and after the country joined the EU in 2007. We analysed the trends in birds of farmland, woodland and "other" habitats, and additionally, we tested whether indices of the commonest birds are representative of wider changes in bird populations. At species level (n = 32), significant declines were detected in 11 species (34%), and increases in just two (6%); 19 species (60%) had uncertain trends. There were mean declines of 15% in farmland birds, 5% in woodland birds and 24% in birds of other habitats. Both species richness and total abundance of common birds were higher before the accession of Bulgaria to the EU than after. These trends may be explained by two contrasting processes agricultural intensification in the plains, and land abandonment in agriculturally less productive mountainous and hilly areas. Conservation measures, delivered through policy governing the management of agricultural land, should be funded adequately and targeted appropriately to stop and reverse the decline in common and widespread birds in Bulgaria.

Wang, Min; Ye, Xin-Ping; Li, Yan-fang; Huo, Zhi-ping; Li, Xia; Yu, Xiao-ping				Restoration Ecology	25	2		261-268	Mar 2017	2017				English	5	27	Reintroduction projects aim to reestablish a self-sustaining population of an endangered species within its historical range. Adequate post-release monitoring by gathering demographic data is important to evaluate the success of a reintroduction. Survival and reproduction rates of a reintroduced population can be compared with a self-sustaining wild population to evaluate the success of a reintroduction. In early 2007, Nipponia nippon (Crested Ibis) was reintroduced into the Qinling Mountains (Shaanxi, Central China). In this study, we attempt to evaluate the demographic status of the reintroduced population. Age-specific survival rates of 56 released adults and 77 wild-born fledglings were estimated using mark-recapture data obtained from 2007 to 2014. Survival rates for the yearlings (0.599, with 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.467-0.719) were lower than the estimates from a wild population in Yangxian County, but the survival rates of the adults (0.678, with 95% CI: 0.603-0.745) were similar. The number of breeding pairs gradually increased since 2008, although breeding success (52.5%) was somewhat less than that of the wild population (67.6%). The stochastic estimation of population growth rate (1.084 with 95% CI: 1.069-1.098) and population size (5-fold increase) estimated from an age-classified Leslie matrix indicate that the reintroduced population of the Crested Ibis is more likely in regulation phase over the next 25 years. We conclude that the reintroduction of the Crested Ibis in Qinling Mountains has great promise, and progress toward a self-sustaining population has been made under some interventions. Governments, local communities, and scientists need to facilitate habitat restoration for the long-term survival of this endangered species.

Newton, Ian				British Birds	110	2		77-91	Feb 2017	2017				English	0	0	Hedgerows add interest and diversity to the British countryside, and their importance to birds and other wildlife is well established. In some landscapes, hedges offer the only places where some plant and animal species can persist. In the breeding season, birds (all species combined) have been typically found at densities of 5-14 pairs per kilometre of hedge length, and occasionally in much larger numbers. Overall, bird densities tend to increase with the cross-sectional area of the hedge (more birds in taller, wider hedges), with the number of tall trees in the hedge, and with the presence of other boundary features, such as wide grassy verges or ditches. Compared with newly laid hedges, old overgrown ones may hold up to three times as many bird species and five times as many individuals.Well-managed hedgerows, located so as to link woodland fragments, do much to maintain the matrix of habitat that characterises wildlife-rich countryside in lowland Britain. Across Britain as a whole, more than half of all the hedges present in the late 1940s have been removed, with a potential loss of up to five million pairs of breeding birds. However, the impact of that hedgerow loss on bird populations varies between species, between years, and also between different landscapes.VVhile some species are hedgerow specialists, others nest preferentially in woodland and occupy hedgerows as 'overspill' habitat. For some hedgerow species, particularly seed-eaters, the population declines of recent decades are more closely linked to food availability than to fewer hedgerow nesting sites.

This study attempts to evaluate the different stages of succession in terms of composition and structure of bird populations in Hyrcanian forests. Bird-habitat relationships were investigated by comparing vegetation characteristics in three successional stages including late, initial stage, and urban areas. Bird richness, diversity, and abundance were measured within a 25-m radius of each of the 120 sampling points in various stages of succession and urban areas from May to April (2014) in the Ziarat catchment. This study indicated that every stage of succession may support certain species. Based on bird-habitat associations along the various stages of succession, two groupswere distinguished. Conventional comparative analysis separated two groups of understory birds: interior specialists and edge specialists. The interior-specialist group was positively correlated with the number of dead trees, tall trees with high values of dbh and height and canopy cover. In contrast, edge specialists groups mainly included terrestrial insectivores and were positively correlated with open area and shrub cover, and percentage of shrub cover between 1 and 2 m in height. In summary, bird communities in Hyrcanian forests are highly dynamic in different vegetation covers suggesting that it is critical to increase diverse and abundant bird populations by conserving forests composed of mosaics of differently disturbed stands and mature forest patches.

Cadieux, Philippe; Drapeau, Pierre				Forest Ecology and Management	385			127-139	Feb 1 2017	2017				English	1	27	Old boreal forests are considered quality habitats for birds associated with decaying and dead trees. However, the quantity and quality of these structural attributes in old forest stands are likely to be influenced by important latitudinal changes in tree species composition and productivity from the southern boreal mixed to the northern coniferous forests. We measured habitat occupancy of cavity and bark nesting birds in old forests when the boreal forest landscape shifts from a mixed to a dominant coniferous matrix in the Clay Belt of Quebec and Ontario, a region where paludification dominates. Using playback calls, songs, and recent woodpeckers' foraging signs on trees, we measured the occurrence and foraging habitat use of 11 bird species associated with deadwood in 86 unmanaged forest stands along a forest age gradient in both mixed and coniferous stands. In coniferous stands dominated by black spruce, deadwood birds showed a modal distribution in response to the aging of black spruce forests that reached a peak in stands of 160 years and then declined. Unproductive paludified stands, which made up more than 40% of our study area, were associated with a significantly lower species richness of deadwood birds. At the opposite, although they represented less than 4% of the forest cover in our study area, old boreal mixedwood forests (>90 years) were highly utilized habitats by deadwood birds. Structural diversity of trees (diversity of degradation stages and diameter of trees) was the variable that best explained species richness of this functional group of birds whereas at the individual species level, the quantity and quality of dead trees (degradation and size) in stands best explained species occurrence and abundance of foraging signs. Conservation efforts for deadwood birds should focus on old productive stands of both mixed and coniferous composition. However, our study pinpoints old mixed wood stand as habitats of special concern given their disproportionate importance for deadwood birds in northern boreal forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A large-scale analysis from northern Europe.		Ram, Dafne; Axelsson, Anna-Lena; Green, Martin; Smith, Henrik G.; Lindstrom, Ake				Forest Ecology and Management	385			177-188	Feb 1 2017	2017				English	10	55	Changes in forestry practices and on-going climate change may both have large impacts on forest bird populations. However, large-scale analyses of the effects of temporal changes in forest structure on forest bird numbers are largely lacking. We compared temporal trends from two Swedish nationwide long-term monitoring schemes, the Swedish Bird Survey (1998-2015) and the Swedish National Forestry Inventory (1983-2014), giving representative values for both forest and bird changes over an area of 35 million ha. Since 1998 the total area of middle-aged and mature forest increased by 6.4%. In parallel, several forest structures potentially beneficial to birds (dead wood, retention trees on clear cuts, multi-layer forests, old forest and broadleaved forest) increased somewhat in abundance, most likely as a result of legislation changes and increasing areas under forest certification schemes. Summer temperatures also increased, with warm summers dominating since 2002. In 1998-2015, the population sizes of 58 forest bird species on average increased, as did the number of species observed per route, with no general difference between forest specialists (16 species) and generalists (42 species). However, from around 2005, the positive trends in bird numbers and many forest structures have levelled out. An analysis of species population trends in relation to a measure of climate sensitivity (Species Temperature Index, STI) suggested that forest birds, just like Swedish birds in general, have indeed been affected by a warming climate. But given their STI, forest birds on average had more positive trends than non-forest birds, suggesting that other factors than climate have affected them positively. Strong candidate factors are the documented changes in forest quality and quantity. Whereas our data and analyses are correlational, and no firm conclusions on causality therefore can be drawn, it is reasonable to assume that the recent increases in forest quantity, forest quality, and summer temperatures, all have contributed to the general increase in forest bird numbers in Sweden. But the relative contribution of these driving forces remains to be determined. When it comes to the potentially positive effects of improving forest quality in terms of increases in old forest, stratification, retention trees and dead wood, it is noteworthy that many of the positive trends in forest structures since the mid-1990s seem to have ceased recently.

Guyot, Claire; Arlettaz, Raphael; Korner, Pius; Jacot, Alain				PLoS ONE	12	2		e0170176	Feb 1 2017	2017				English	2	24	Vineyards are likely to be regionally important for wildlife, but we lack biodiversity studies in this agroecosystem which is undergoing a rapid management revolution. As vine cultivation is restricted to arid and warm climatic regions, biodiversity-friendly management would promote species typical of southern biomes. Vineyards are often intensively cultivated, mostly surrounded by few natural features and offering a fairly mineral appearance with little ground vegetation cover. Ground vegetation cover and composition may further strongly vary with respect to season, influencing patterns of habitat selection by ecological communities. We investigated season-specific bird-habitat associations to highlight the importance of semi-natural habitat features and vineyard ground vegetation cover throughout the year. Given that avian habitat selection varies according to taxa, guilds and spatial scale, we modelled bird-habitat associations in all months at two spatial scales using mixed effects regression models. At the landscape scale, birds were recorded along 10 1-km long transects in Southwestern Switzerland (February 2014-January 2015). At the field scale, we compared the characteristics of visited and unvisited vineyard fields (hereafter called parcels). Bird abundance in vineyards tripled in winter compared to summer. Vineyards surrounded by a greater amount of hedges and small woods harboured higher bird abundance, species richness and diversity, especially during the winter season. Regarding ground vegetation, birds showed a season-specific habitat selection pattern, notably a marked preference for ground-vegetated parcels in winter and for intermediate vegetation cover in spring and summer. These season-specific preferences might be related to species-specific life histories: more insectivorous, ground-foraging species occur during the breeding season whereas granivores predominate in winter. These results highlight the importance of investigating habitat selection at different spatial scales and all along the annual cycle in order to draw practical, season-specific management recommendations for promoting avian biodiversity in farmland.

Such negative effects may be mitigated through habitat management. To date scientific evidence regarding the impacts of these actions remains scarce. We studied guild specific abundances of breeding and staging birds in response to habitat management on 15 Finnish wetlands. In this study management actions comprised several means of vegetation removal to thwart overgrowth. Management cost efficiency was assessed by examining the association between site-specific costs and bird abundances. Several bird guilds exhibited positive connections with both habitat management as well as with invested funds. Most importantly, however, red-listed species and species with special conservation concern as outlined by the EU showed positive correlations with management actions, underlining the conservation value of wetland management. The results suggest that grazing was especially efficient in restoring overgrown wetlands. As a whole this study makes it clear that wetland habitat management constitutes a feasible conservation tool. The marked association between invested funds and bird abundance may prove to be a valuable tool for decision makers when balancing costs and impact of conservation measures against one another.

Stoeckli, Sibylle; Birrer, Simon; Zellweger-Fischer, Judith; Balmer, Oliver; Jenny, Markus; Pfiffner, Lukas				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	237			224-233	Jan 16 2017	2017				English	5	42	Despite the introduction of agri-environmental schemes, no general increase of farmland biodiversity in Europe has been observed. Farmers take decisions about the implementation of agri-environmental schemes at the farm scale, and it is thus highly relevant to assess the relationship between farm management and biodiversity at this scale to increase the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes. The present study quantifies to what extent and with which practices farmers can influence biodiversity on their farm and to what extent conditions outside farmers' control may mediate biodiversity. We grouped 27 variables into four variable sets: (1) ecological compensation (mainly semi-natural habitats), (2) in-field options (e.g. no growth regulator, insecticide and herbicide treatment), and (3) farm characteristics, which can be influenced by farmers (e.g. land-use types) as well as (4) farm settings, which cannot be influenced by farmers (e.g. altitude). As biodiversity metrics, plant, grasshopper, butterfly and bird richness and abundance of farmland target species were assessed on 133 farms of the Swiss Central Plateau from 2009 to 2011. Variance partitioning and generalised linear mixed models were used to analyse the impact of each variable set on farmland species diversity. Our results provide evidence that farmers can indeed positively influence biodiversity by ecological compensation and in-field options. The variables of the ecological compensation set explained the highest proportion in the variation of plant richness and butterfly abundance. We found a significant positive relationship between in-field options and plant abundance. Our study illustrated that the effects of biodiversity-related farming practices differ between species and biodiversity metrics. Conditions outside farmers' control explained a high variation in grasshopper and bird diversity. One variable within the set of farm settings, the degree of consolidation, had a significant negative impact on five out of eight biodiversity metrics (plant, butterfly and bird richness; plant and bird abundance). We demonstrate that farmers can substantially enhance biodiversity on their farms and provide knowledge on how such biodiversity improvements can be achieved by farmers. Further, we highlight the value of new biodiversity-related management practices such as in-field options. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Randy				Forest Ecology and Management	384			180-190	Jan 15 2017	2017				English	8	30	Managers of public conservation lands in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley have implemented forest management strategies to improve bottomland hardwood habitat for target wildlife species. Through implementation of various silvicultural practices, forest managers have sought to attain forest structural conditions (e.g., canopy cover, basal area, etc.) within values postulated to benefit wildlife. We evaluated data from point count surveys of breeding birds on 180 silviculturally treated stands (1049 counts) that ranged from 1 to 20 years post-treatment and 134 control stands (676 counts) that had not been harvested for >20 years. Birds detected during 10-min counts were recorded within four distance classes and three time intervals. Avian diversity was greater on treated stands than on unharvested stands. Of 42 commonly detected species, six species including Prothonotary Warbler (Prothonotaria citrea) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) were indicative of control stands. Similarly, six species including Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) and Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) were indicative of treated stands. Using a removal model to assess probability of detection, we evaluated occupancy of bottomland forests at two spatial scales (stands and points within occupied stands). Wildlife-forestry treatment improved predictive models of species occupancy for 18 species. We found years post treatment (range = 1-20), total basal area, and overstory canopy were important species-specific predictors of occupancy, whereas variability in basal area was not. In addition, we used a removal model to estimate species-specific probability of availability for detection, and a distance model to estimate effective detection radius. We used these two estimated parameters to derive species densities and 95% confidence intervals for treated and unharvested stands. Avian densities differed between treated and control stands for 16 species, but only Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) and Yellow-breasted Chat had greater densities on treated stands.

Forest Ecology and Management	384			389-399	Jan 15 2017	2017				English	3	36	Determining species occurrence in ecosystems of high conservation concern is especially important for recommending habitat management techniques and identifying suitable restoration sites. We investigated (1) how stand- and landscape-scale attributes affect occupancy of priority bird species associated with longleaf pine (Pines palutris) ecosystems, (2) if these priority birds can be used as indicator species for desired open pine forest structure, and (3) if these indicator species are positively correlated with greater avian richness. We compared priority bird occupancy among 12 stand types (habitat types) throughout the historic range of longleaf pine in Mississippi. We found stands resembling the historic longleaf pine ecosystem were positively associated with Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) and Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) occupancy probabilities, but were not significantly correlated with Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) or Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla) occupancy. Both of which were too generalized in their occurrence to be useful indicators. Red-cockaded Woodpecker and Bachman's Sparrow occupancy probabilities positively correlated with desired forest structure metrics of longleaf pine ecosystems such as low midstory density (<10%) and basal area (9.2-16.1 m2/ha) and 40-60% canopy cover suggesting they are effective indicators of historic longleaf pine conditions. Co-occurrence of Red-cockaded Woodpecker and Bachman's Sparrow was positively correlated with avian richness, indicating these species can be used in conjunction as effective indicators for desired open pine endpoints used for restoration and management. Inclusion of priority bird species in management efforts provides assurance that restored areas will incorporate desired forest structure endpoints that have been linked to open pine priority bird presence. Correlation between priority bird species and avian species richness ensures restored areas provide suitable habitat for local avian communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Scarton, Francesco; Baldin, Marco				Bollettino del Museo di Storia Naturale di Venezia	68			63-70	2017	2017				Italian	0	0	Between January 2013 and December 2015 three transects were surveyed biweekly in a littoral area in the Lido island, after the end of engineering works targeted to the reconstruction of small elevation dunes. The aim was monitoring the bird use and the short-term trend of basic community parameters (richness, abundance, diversity) in the new dunes area (about 1.8 ha in size) and the surrounding sites. Overall 98 species were observed, 67 of which in the new dune area: seven are included in the Annex I of the EC 147/2009 Birds Directive, and 13 listed as "Threatened" in the Italian Red List of breeding birds. Both the Chaol index and the rarefaction curves indicate that the field protocol has been effective in sampling a high fraction, about 90%, of the expected species richness. Trends of the community indicators were similar among the three years, with a peak between beginning of October-half of November and another less pronounced peak between half of March-half of April. The bird community in the new dune area was dominated by Passerines, mostly Fringillidae, which use it as a foraging and stopover site during the migrations. Chadriiformes were the second most abundant group, often observed along the beaches adjacent to the new dunes. The results show the new dune area was rapidly used by a rich and diversified bird community.

Kornan, Martin; Adamik, Peter				Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research	32	8		671-678	2017	2017				English	0	9	Bird-plant species associations can be an important component of habitat selection in forest birds. We assessed tree species preferences of foraging insectivorous birds in a primeval beech-fir forest in north-west Slovakia, hypothesizing that bird population densities are negatively associated with foraging specialization. We sampled foraging behaviour by random point observations from mid-May until the end of July during 1997-2003. Significant preference or avoidance patterns were found in 16 of 17 bird species. Based on the tree preference index, we distinguished four main foraging specializations: generalists, deciduous specialists, coniferous specialists, and dead wood specialists. Many bird species showed strong preferences for such rare and uncommon tree species as wych elm (Ulmus glabra), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), and Norway spruce (Picea abies). European beech (Fagus sylvatica), hazel (Corylus avellana), and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) were generally avoided. Birds with low densities tended to be most selective, but that effect was not statistically significant. Population variability was not significantly associated with foraging specialization. We hypothesize that impoverishment of tree species diversity within forest stands could lead to less diverse bird assemblages composed of species specialized on those tree species remaining and of generalist foragers able to adapt to a wide range of foraging substrates.

Awifauna nielegowa Jezior Koninskich - stan aktualny i zmiany	Mielczarek, Slawomir; Winiecki, Aleksander				Ornis Polonica	58	4		244-273	2017	2017				Polish	0	0	This paper describes non-breeding avifauna recorded in the area of five lakes and two artificial water bodies, including fish-ponds near Konin (central Poland). These water bodies, connected by canals, are used for cooling coal-fired power stations. The lakes have considerably elevated temperatures, and host many foreign and expansive plant and animal species, especially fishes and bivalves. The study was carried out from autumn 2010 to spring 2011. The results have been compared with unpublished data collected in the past during three seasons, including the data gathered at the turn of the 60s and 70s of the 20th century. Both present and past bird species richness result from the low depth of the lakes, high biomass of benthic fauna, and the absence of complete ice cover even during severe winters. These conditions attract high numbers of benthophagous (Coots Fulica atra and diving ducks Aythya sp.) and ichthyophagous bird species (herons Ardea sp., cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo, grebes Podiceps sp., mergansers Mergus sp.). The most important water bodies for these species are two the shallowest and constantly heated lakes Gosfawskie and P,Itnowskie. A significant decrease in the Coot numbers throughout the study years may result from the population fluctuations but also a decline of the breeding populations. The important increase in the numbers of fish-eating species, especially the Great Cormorant, is related to the species expansion, and locally to high food abundance. Large flocks of migrating and wintering gulls and geese have been formed as a result of global changes, the presence of advantageous roosting site (warm, unfrozen waters) and close proximity to good foraging sites (garbage dumps, fields and meadows).

Biodiversity	18	4		156-167	2017	2017				English	0	0	We analysed the avifauna of the Ramsar site 'Rio San Pedro-Meoqui' (RSPM) according to avifaunal richness, taxonomic distinctness and conservation. We recorded a total of 199 species constituting 41.11% of the species recorded from Chihuahua and 17.30% of the Mexican avifauna. Avifauna belongs to 137 genera and 49 families, where the most species-rich families were Anatidae (23 species) and Emberizidae (14 species). Taxonomic distinctness of the RSPM was compared with five other Ramsar sites and was above the funnel plot with a high average taxonomic distinctness ([DELTA]+ = 90.13). The pair of Ramsar sites with highest dissimilarity were Laguna San Juan de los Ahorcados (68 species) and Manantiales Geotermales de Julimes (81 species) with 48.52% dissimilarity. The data presented herein indicates that a reassessment of the ornithological value of northern Mexican wetlands is needed given that some areas are 'hotspots' for the region's bird species pool (the Chihuahuan Desert), under a taxonomic and phylogenetic perspective.

Continuously decreasing biological diversity of grasslands is leading to an increasing urgency to set up an appropriate management and introduce sufficient measures. There is also demand from conservationists for up-to-date information on impacts of management on ecosystems and their components. First, we discuss measures to protect grassland birds (mowing from centre to edges, late mowing or selection of suitable mowing machinery) and their impact on ecosystems. Furthermore we argue unmown and ungrazed patches as essential measures for many taxonomic groups since they create spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We also emphasize advantages of cyclic management creating dynamic mosaics of various successional stages, importance of bare soil, variation in the timing of disturbances or benefits of varying grazing intensity. Finally, in accordance with many previous works we conclude that there is the necessity of increasing spatial and temporal heterogeneity which can help to maintain high species richness in the landscape.

Schuetz, Claudia; Reckendorfer, Walter; Schulze, Christian H.				Journal of Urban Ecology	3	1		jux019	Jan 2017	2017				English	0	0	In urban landscapes, city parks represent strongholds of avian biodiversity. Hence, understanding which variables promote species richness of bird communities has major implications for urban planning in order to sustain high biodiversity in an increasingly urbanised environment. From a management perspective, three options are available: increase park area, increase habitat quality within parks and increase connectivity between parks. We used two woodpecker species, a generalist species (Great Spotted Woodpecker) and a habitat specialist (Middle Spotted Woodpecker), as indicators to identify key variables promoting biodiversity in the city parks of Vienna. Bird surveys were carried out during winter time between 2005 and 2015 in 29 urban parks. An information theoretic approach based on generalised linear models identified park area as the most relevant local variable, positively affecting the occurrence of both species. The variable was included in all best ranked models of the two woodpecker species (based on Akaike's information criterion corrected for small-sample sizes). Other local scale variables as well as the position of city parks within the urban matrix and their connectivity were of minor importance. Our results also provide some evidence that city parks may act as refuges for birds during cold winters. The park occupancy of the Great Spotted Woodpecker increased significantly with decreasing mean winter temperatures. The management of existing parks and the planning of new parks represent opportunities to improve the ecological conditions for nature development in addition to their principal function to provide recreational, cultural and aesthetic values.

Pacific Conservation Biology	23	4		359-371	2017	2017				English	0	0	Small patches of woodland were progressively established on degraded agricultural land near Gunnedah, northern New South Wales, on the heavily cleared Liverpool Plains. Birds were resurveyed in the plantings, and in agricultural fields (cropping and pasture) and remnant woodland, in 2011-12, 10 years after initial surveys in 2000-01. The plantings in the later survey were 60, 18, 16 and 13 years old, with a shrub layer included in the three youngest cohorts. The survey sites (total 14ha planted, all within 200m of remnant woodland) were paired 1-ha plots in each vegetation category. Birds were surveyed by 30-min area searches of each plot eight times over all seasons, using the same plots, procedure and observer as before. In all, 73 species were recorded in the later survey (versus 72 in the earlier survey), for a total of 87 species over both survey periods, with 58 species in 2011-12 (versus 54 in 2000-01) in the plantings; eight of 15 new species visited or colonised the maturing plantings. Avian species richness and abundance increased from the cleared agricultural plots through the progressively older plantings to resemble those in the remnant woodland. Between the first and second surveys, bird communities in the younger plantings converged with those in the older plantings and woodland. The nectar-feeding, foliage-feeding and ground-feeding insectivore guilds benefitted most, having increased in frequency in, or moved into, the younger cohorts of plantings (>13 years old), or both. Several threatened and other declining woodland birds visited, increased in or colonised the plantings. However, noisy miners (Manorina melanocephala) progressively occupied a few plots and excluded some other birds.

Muyemeki, Luckson; Burger, Roelof; Piketh, Stuart J.; Evans, Steven W.				Ostrich	88	3		253-259	2017	2017				English	1	5	The expansion of coal-fired power stations in South Africa has resulted in growing environmental concerns as they are the largest emitters of sulphur dioxide (SO2). Sulphur dioxide emissions from power plants pose a potential threat to avian populations. However, the effect of SO2 pollution on bird communities is poorly understood. Using point counts we investigated the relationships of bird species richness and species-specific density with SO2 concentrations around Matimba power station. Environmental parameters were derived from remotely sensed data and data reduction was performed using principal component analysis. Generalised linear mixed models were then used to infer the relationships of bird species richness and species-specific densities with SO2 concentrations and the environmental variables. Our results revealed that SO2-polluted air had no influence on bird species richness and densities in our study sites, but SO2 levels were below annual national ambient air quality standards. Vegetation productivity was found to have a greater influence on species densities than SO2 pollution. Monitoring of bird population changes around Matimba power station once neighbouring Medupi power station is fully operational is recommended, as SO2 content of the air will increase significantly, and species may be sensitive to this increase in SO2 levels.

Most reedbed are wet along the year due to tides, some others, less well known, are drying out in summer. How do both kind of reedbeds differ in migratory species number and abundance? In the Adour estuary (southern part of the French Atlantic coast), two sites were compared according to similar capture-ringing protocol during two years (August and September). Habitat surveys have mainly focused on reed parameters such as height, stem diameter, density and stratification. Results showed that the wet reedbeds attracted higher species-diversity and higher numbers of aquatic and transsaharian migratory species. Reeds are taller, thicker, less dense and have a weaker herbaceous stratum. The dry reedbeds harbour species tolerant to lower hydric conditions (Locustella naevia, Acrocephalus paludicola). In order to regulate the spreading of woody or exotic invasive plant species (Acer negundo, Baccharis...) and to attract more transsaharian migrants, we propose to maintain a constant water level in those reedbeds currently drying out in summer.

Aims: To assess the effects of a targeted AES on the abundance of a suite of farmland bird species over a 5-year period. Methods: We compare temporal changes in abundance of 12 farmland bird species of conservation concern on 33 AES and 22 control farms in County Down, Northern Ireland. Five of these species were designated targets for conservation action under the Countryside Management Scheme (CMS). Results: CMS management was associated with more positive changes in abundance for three of the five target species and more negative changes for one target species (albeit caused mainly by a large reduction at a single farm). CMS management had little influence on the abundance of nontarget species or on avian species richness. Farm-scale changes in abundance were generally unrelated to the extent of local CMS provision, the only exception involved House Sparrow and seed-rich winter habitats. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that generic AES land management can improve the population status of target farmland birds on farms with AES management.

Gungoroglu, Cumhur				Fresenius Environmental Bulletin	26	10		6217-6224	2017	2017				English	1	3	Turkey has an impressive richness in terms of fauna and flora. Nearly 28% of total country area of Turkey is covered by the forests. The aim of this research is to present the status, opportunities and challenges for forest biodiversity in Turkey according to EU Natura 2000 concept. This concept is a European ecological network which is occurred species and habitats designated by the EU Member States based on legally binding legislation. The importance of directives is emerging by designation of their special conservation areas under Natura 2000 sites. Designation of sites under those Directives takes some processes. SACs designed as sites to protect EU importance plants, animals and wildlife habitats which are assessed by the Habitats Directive. SPAs are sites of conservation value for rare and threatened European bird species which are designated under the Birds Directive. The species richness and habitat diversity of Turkey's forestry is a challenge for both Turkey and EU. Turkey includes species belonging to three different floristic regions. This opportunity is not common among EU countries. The forest types of Turkey have more structured importance according to diverse vulnerable species and biogeographically distribution of habitats than European countries. It should be thought that the number of Europe's forest habitat types could be considerably increase with Turkey's forest types. Before the selecting, designing and managing, the Natura 2000 sites in Turkey are needed some research to supply the assessment criteria for national assessment of species and habitats. The existing protected areas of Turkey and important endemic plant areas are available as potential Natura 2000 sites at national level. One of the most important deficiencies is lying in the inadequacy of data that will not supply some criteria to select and design the Special Areas for Conservation at European level.

Haffey, William; De Lea, Michael; Walker, Brian				Ornitologia Neotropical	28			209-212	2017	2017				English	1	1	We observed several individuals of a tropical fruiting tree, Topobea multiflora (Melastomataceae), to determine the diversity and prevalence of bird species that use this plant as a food source. Conducted on the south Pacific slope of Costa Rica, these observations are of interest because T. multiflora, though it grows in early successional habitat, attracts many bird species typically associated with mature forest. Most of these species are potential candidates for dispersing the small seeds of mature forest species as they leave the forest to feed on the fruit of T. multiflora. In this study, we recorded 477 observations of 24 species belonging to seven families feeding on T. multiflora fruit during ten count periods of observation. The family Thraupidae (tanagers) had both the highest proportion of feeding observations (65.8%) and the greatest diversity of all visiting taxa (13 species). The five species with the highest overall prevalence (prevalence >5%) were Silver-throated Tanager (Tangara icterocephala), Cherrie's Tanager (Ramphocelus costaricensis), Thick-billed Euphonia (Euphonia laniirostris), Common Bush-tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus), and Bay-headed Tanager (Tangara gyrola). Our results suggest that several species of Neotropical frugivores, because of their relationship to T. multiflora, may be considered indicator species of ongoing forest regeneration in southwestern Costa Rica.

In seasonal ecosystems, however, harsh environmental conditions during winter may force individuals to move from protected forests to unprotected degraded forests in lowlands. Aims: To examine how forest types and seasons affect avian diversity and habitat-use guilds in protected and unprotected forests. Methods: Habitat and seasonal avian surveys were conducted to test forest type and seasonal differences on avian species richness, relative abundances and relative abundance of habitat-use guilds. Results: Twenty-three avian species ([approximately]40% endemics) were recorded. Highland old growth forests showed the highest richness (4.1-4.9 species/point count). The lowest richness was recorded in mid-elevation secondary forests (3.1 species/point count). The highest relative abundances for habitat-specialist understorey users and large tree users were recorded in highland old growth forests. However, the abundance of large tree users was higher in secondary forests at low elevations during colder seasons. Conclusions: Some species and guilds may move to lower elevations outside protected areas during winter. Increasing degradation of unprotected areas will likely affect the suitability of 'winter habitat' for specialist guilds, and thus the ecological processes and source/sink dynamics occurring across boundaries of protected and unprotected areas.

Anonymous				Scottish Natural Heritage Commissioned Report	941			1-46	2017	2017				English	0	0	Background The corn bunting Emberiza calandra is a farmland bird of high conservation concern across much of Europe having undergone severe population declines and range contraction in recent decades. In Scotland, populations are now restricted to four core areas - Fife, Angus, the Western Isles and Aberdeenshire/Moray. Since the early 2000s, the species has been the focus of monitoring, research and advocacy by RSPB Scotland, supported by SNH and others. This work has shown that well-targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) measures tailored to the species' needs were capable of halting and reversing corn bunting population declines in eastern Scotland. This led to the development of a package of AES options within the Scottish Rural Development Programme (SRDP) 2007-13. The lack of Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) trend data for corn bunting in Scotland (the species is too rare), lack of adequate monitoring of SRDP and RSPB monitoring limited to just a few key sites since 2008-09 meant that the success of this package in halting/reversing the decline in the species' Scottish stronghold of Aberdeenshire/Moray was not known. In summer 2015 we undertook a re-survey of 48 farms in Aberdeenshire/Moray, most of which had not been surveyed since 2008-09. The main aims were to determine the population change of corn buntings since 2008-09 in relation to deployment of AES measures under SRDP 2007-13, and to provide a baseline for the new SRDP 2014-20, in which the main AES was not deployed until 2016. Main findings - There was no significant change in corn bunting population size across the 48 farms surveyed, with 246 territorial males in 2015 compared with 232 in 2008-09. - 34 of the 48 farms surveyed in 2015 held at least one territorial male corn bunting, the same farm occupancy rate (71%) as in 2008-09, but still well below the 94% farm occupancy rate recorded in 2003. -Population stability contrasts sharply with the severe long-term decline across Scotland in the 1970s-2000s, and declines across the same set of farms during 2003-08. - The current national population size was estimated to be 750-900 territorial males, which is 34-41% of the 2,200 territorial males estimated in 1993. - In contrast to previous years, corn bunting population trends did not differ between farms that had participated in agri-environment schemes and farms not in schemes, or between farms deploying the Mown Grassland for Corn Buntings option that delays mowing to protect nests, and options that only provided a food resource (e.g. Wild Bird Seed Mix/Unharvested Crop). Potential reasons for the lack of a further clear population effect of agri-environment schemes include poor targeting of key management options in the Rural Priorities scheme, or positive effects of the management spilling over into the wider landscape and helping to halt declines on non-scheme farms. - Uptake of some corn bunting options was lower than in previous schemes, notably Wild Bird Seed Mix/Unharvested Crop, Grass Margins, and Mown Grassland for Corn Buntings, although in 2015-16 at least 35-40% of the mainland Scotland corn bunting population was covered by agri-environment schemes with one or more options from the corn bunting package. - There were no significant changes in land use on the study farms between 2008-09 and 2015, but removal of boundary features to make larger fields was recorded on two-thirds of the farms, indicative of continuing agricultural intensification in Aberdeenshire.

Hartman, C. Alex; Ackerman, Joshua T.; Herzog, Mark P.; Strong, Cheryl; Trachtenbarg, David; Shore, Crystal A.				U S Geological Survey Open-File Report	1055			1-37	2017	2017				English	0	2	In order to address the 2008/10 and Supplemental 2014 NOAA Fisheries Biological Opinion for operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) developed and have begun implementation of Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia) management plans. This implementation includes redistribution of the Caspian terns in the Columbia River estuary and the mid-Columbia River region to reduce predation on salmonids listed under the Endangered Species Act. Key elements of the plans include (1) reducing nesting habitat for Caspian terns in the Columbia River estuary and the mid-Columbia River region, and (2) creating or modifying nesting habitat at alternative sites within the Caspian tern breeding range. USACE and Reclamation developed Caspian tern nesting habitat at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (DENWR), California, prior to the 2015 nesting season. Furthermore, to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts between nesting Caspian terns and threatened western snowy plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus), nesting habitat for snowy plovers also was developed. Seven recently constructed islands within two managed ponds (Ponds A16 and SF2) of DENWR were modified to provide habitat attractive to nesting Caspian terns (5 islands) and snowy plovers (2 islands). These 7 islands were a subset of 46 islands recently constructed in Ponds A16 and SF2 to provide waterbird nesting habitat as part of the South Bay Salt Pond (SBSP) Restoration Project. We used social attraction methods (decoys and electronic call systems) to attract Caspian terns and snowy plovers to these seven modified islands, and conducted surveys between March and September of 2015 and 2016 to evaluate nest numbers, nest density, and productivity. Results from the 2015 nesting season, the first year of the study, indicated that island modifications and social attraction measures were successful in establishing Caspian tern breeding colonies at Ponds A16 and SF2 of DENWR. The success of 2015 continued in 2016, the second year of the study. In 2016, Caspian terns nested on two of the five islands modified for Caspian terns (one island in Pond A16 and one island in Pond SF2). Caspian terns initiated at least 317 nests, fledged at least 158 chicks, and had a breeding success rate of 0.50 fledged chicks per breeding pair. This represents a 42 percent increase in nests initiated, a 9 percent decrease in the number of fledged chicks, and a 36 percent decrease in the number of chicks fledged per breeding pair in 2016 compared to 2015. Although overall productivity decreased from 2015, these results indicate that the Caspian tern breeding population on modified islands of the DENWR is increasing relative to 2015, the first year of the effort, and relative to years prior to 2015 when no breeding colonies of Caspian terns existed in Ponds A16 or SF2. These results indicate the effectiveness of social attraction measures in helping to establish tern nesting colonies in San Francisco Bay. Conversely, for the second year in a row, snowy plovers did not attempt to nest on any island in Ponds A16 and SF2. Social attraction measures similar to those used in this study, but targeting other colonial species such as Forster's terns (Sterna forsteri) and American avocets (Recurvirostra americana), may help to establish waterbird breeding colonies at wetlands enhanced as part of the SBSP Restoration Project.

San Francisco Estuary & Watershed Science	15	1		5	2017	2017				English	0	1	Riparian ecosystems provide important ecosystem services and recreational opportunities for people, and habitat for wildlife. In California's Central Valley, government agencies and private organizations are working together to protect and restore riparian ecosystems, and the Central Valley Joint Venture provides leadership in the formulation of goals and objectives for avian conservation in riparian ecosystems. We defined a long-term conservation goal as the establishment of riparian ecosystems that provide sufficient habitat to support genetically robust, self-sustaining, and resilient bird populations. To achieve this goal, we selected a suite of 12 breeding riparian landbird focal species as indicators of the state of riparian ecosystems in each of four major Central Valley planning regions. Using recent bird survey data, we estimated that over half of the regional focal species populations are currently small (< 10,000) and may be vulnerable to extirpation, and two species have steeply declining population trends. For each focal species in each region, we defined long-term (100-year) population objectives that are intended to be conservation endpoints that we expect to meet the goal of genetically robust, self-sustaining, and resilient populations. We then estimated the long-term species density and riparian restoration objectives required to achieve the long-term population objectives. To track progress toward the long-term objectives, we propose short-term 10-year) objectives, including the addition of 12,919 ha 31,923 ac) of riparian vegetation in the Central Valley by planning region: 3,390 ha in Sacramento, 2,390 ha in Yolo-Delta, 3,386 ha in San Joaquin, and 3,753 ha in Tulare). We expect that reaching these population, density, and habitat objectives through threat abatement, habitat restoration, and habitat enhancement will result in improvements to riparian ecosystem function and resilience that will benefit other wildlife populations and the people of the Central Valley and beyond.

Dwayne; Davis, Craig A.; Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.				Wildlife Biology				00315	2017	2017				English	0	0	Provision of artificial surface water has been suggested as a management practice that can benefit wildlife in arid and semi-arid regions. With unprecedented droughts predicted for many of these areas in North America in coming decades, understanding species response to the provision of artificial surface water should be evaluated. Moreover, a dearth of knowledge exists in the understanding of avian response to artificial surface water during the non-breeding season. To address this lack of knowledge, we sampled the avian community at varying distances from water sources in Beaver County, Oklahoma, USA from February-March 2013-2014. A total of 20 species were detected. We found no relationship to avian species richness and distance to water. Likewise, pooled data of detections across all species indicated no relationship in relation to artificial surface water. Analysis on individual species indicated that western meadowlarks Sturnella neglecta did not respond to water. However, American tree sparrows Spizella arborea (plateau model [beta] = 0.05, SE = 0.01) were attracted to surface water sources up to a distance of 100 m (SE = 40.19 m). Furthermore, white-crowned sparrows Zonotrichia leucophrys (linear [beta] = -0.01, SE = 0.006) were attracted to surface water sources up to distance of 250 m. Additionally, analysis indicated that used water sources by American tree sparrows had significantly more mixed shrub cover (%) when compared to unused water sources ([beta] = 6.04, SE = 2.64; p = 0.03) and that use of water sources by white-crowned sparrows was influenced by the amount of mixed shrub cover within 50 m of the water source ([beta] = 0.36, SE = 0.16; p = 0.02). Our results suggest that some overwintering sparrows will alter space use in response to the presence of artificial surface water, however, it is unknown whether provision of water influences overwinter survival of sparrows.

Walther, Bruno A.; Chen, Jane Ren-Jen; Lin, Hui-Shan; Sun, Yuan-Hsun				Zoological Studies	56			23	2017	2017				English	2	6	Montane birds are regularly exposed to extreme weather variations. Taiwan's subtropical montane avifauna has many endemic species which are regularly exposed to large weather fluctuations. From 2010 to 2013, we conducted monthly censuses to study the influence of monthly weather variations on species richness and bird density of a montane bird community (> 3000 m a.s.l.) in Shei-Pa National Park. Censuses were conducted along a trail which traverses four distinct habitats with increasing altitude: bush forest ecotone, post-fire grassland, conifer forest, and rocky bushland. The highly variable weather corresponded with large fluctuations in the bird community. We found that lower temperatures had a negative effect on species richness and bird density, and this effect was strongest in the highest elevation habitat, the rocky bushland. Rainfall was positively correlated with bird density, but only explained 15% of the variation, while the effects of wind speed were inconsistent and small. This is the first study to demonstrate such weather effects in Taiwan and probably East Asia. We briefly discuss adaptations to harsh weather conditions in birds, which might be a profitable future research field for montane birds in Taiwan.

However, the invasion of Spartina alterniflora had changed the community structure and function of the wetland. In 2011, an demonstration test area was constructed to eradicate S. alterniflora and protect bird habitat. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of removing S. alterniflora on the biodiversity in the Chongming Dongtan wetland, Shanghai City. (Method) The plant growth (Phragmites australis), plant community composition, and the species and quantity change of avian community (with another one-year survey after construction), and macrobenthos community were monitored in 8 treatment plots and 7 control plots, respectively. (Result)The removal of S. alterniflora did not affect the density and height of Ph. australis. The species enrichment and number of birds (including waterfowl) were higher in the treatment plots than in the control plots. (Conclusion) After engineering construction, the landscape and biodiversity of the demonstration test area changed greatly. Compared with the S. alterniflora community, the ecological service function of biodiversity conservation has been obviously restored, attracting different groups of birds resting here. Further monitoring is needed to check the recovery potential of the macro benthos community.

Marthy, William; Clough, Yann; Tscharntke, Teja				Raffles Bulletin of Zoology	65	1		35-48	2017	2017				English	2	9	Continuing disappearance and degradation of primary tropical rainforests in Indonesia, and the ongoing conversion of degraded forest to monoculture plantations, threaten many bird species with local extinction. Yet, information on bird populations from the Sundaic region, which covers western Indonesia, is generally lacking, limiting our understanding of species responses to disturbance, extinction risks, and potential ways to counteract local species extinction processes. On the Indonesian island of Sumatra, bird density information is only known from two studies ( on four hornbill species and one pheasant species). Here, we compare bird densities between less degraded and highly degraded forests within the Harapan Rainforest Ecosystem Restoration Concession in Sumatra. From a total of 148 bird species recorded, densities were calculated for 47 species with the highest encounter rate, 33 of which were recorded in forests of both disturbance levels, allowing comparisons to be made. We found five species with higher densities in the highly degraded forest and seven species with higher densities in the less degraded forest. While our species-specific results were generally consistent with previous biological insights, there were exceptions, such as a species previously considered to be sensitive to habitat degradation, the sooty-capped babbler Malacopteron affine, being more abundant in the highly degraded forest. Our study revealed that despite its condition, degraded forest retains much value for Sumatran lowland forest birds, providing a compelling argument for securing its important conservation status under improved management, rather than assigning it for clearance as typically happens.

Mcclure, Christopher J.W.; Pauli, Benjamin P.; Mutch, Brian; Juergens, Paul				Ibis	159	1		14-25	Jan 2017	2017				English	1	17	Habitat availability might be the most important determinant of success for a species reintroduction programme, making investigation of the quality and quantity of habitat needed to produce self-sustaining populations a research priority for reintroduction ecologists. We used a stochastic model of population dynamics to predict whether attempts to improve existing breeding territories using artificial nest platforms improved the population growth rate and persistence of a reintroduced population of Northern Aplomado Falcons Falco femoralis septentrionalis in South Texas. We further assessed whether the creation of new territories, i.e. conversion of entire areas to suitable habitat and not simply the erection of nest platforms, would lead to a subsequent increase in the nesting population. Our model was able to reproduce several characteristics of the wild population and predicted the number of breeding pairs per year strikingly well (R2 = 0.97). Simulations revealed that the addition of nest platforms improved productivity such that the population would decline to extinction without them but is stable since their installation. Moreover, the model predicted that the increase in productivity due to nest platforms would cause the population to saturate available breeding territories, at which point the population would contain a moderate proportion of non-territorial birds that could occupy territories if new ones become available. Population size would therefore be proportional to the increase in available territories. Our study demonstrates that artificial nest-sites can be an effective tool for the management of reintroduced species.

Rangeland Ecology & Management	70			87-94	Jan 2017	2017				English	3	24	We investigated bird abundance in response to western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) removal using a short-term chronosequence approach and generated estimates of density and responses to management for the most abundant species. Stands targeted for tree removal were primarily in the middle stages of juniper encroachment (Phase II, 7 851 ha). Trees were removed using hand felling combined with either lop and scatter, single tree burning, or jackpot burning, which were carried out to minimize loss of shrub cover. Brewer's sparrow(Spizella breweri) density was greater at treated versus untreated portions of the study area. At sites in the third year following tree removal, Brewer's sparrow density was 23.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.4-27.8) territories per km2 higher than locations that had not yet been treated. This equates to a net increase of 1 212-1 737 nesting pairs within the project area. Green-tailed towhee increased by 4.6 (95% CI: 3.1-6.1) territories per km2 for an estimated project-wide increase of 194-381 nesting pairs, and vesper sparrow (Poocetes gramineus) increased by 6.5 (95% CI: 4.6-8.4) territories per km2 corresponding to an estimated increase of 460-559 nesting pairs within the project area. Density of gray flycatcher (Empidonax wrighti) was lower in cut areas, and over the entire project area we estimate a net loss of 183-486 nesting pairs as a result of juniper tree removal. This study demonstrates that conifer removal projects designed to retain shrub cover and structure can have benefits to multiple species of ground and shrub nesting birds, including several species of conservation concern.

Rangeland Ecology & Management	70			95-105	Jan 2017	2017				English	4	28	Recent and unprecedented scale of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) conservation in the American West enables assessment of community-level benefits afforded to other sagebrush-obligate species. We use North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) count data and machine-learning to assess predictors influencing spatial distribution and abundance of three sagebrush-obligate songbirds (Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri), sagebrush sparrow (Artemisiospiza nevadensis), and sage thrasher (Oreoscoptes montanus)). We quantified co-occurrence of songbird abundance with sage-grouse lek distributions using point pattern analyses and evaluated the concurrence of songbird abundance within sage-grouse habitat restoration and landscape protection. Sagebrush land-cover predictors were positively associated with the abundance of each songbird species in models that explained 16-37% of variation in BBS route level counts. Individual songbird models identified an apparent 40% threshold in sagebrush land-cover, over which songbird abundances nearly doubled. Songbird abundances were positively associated with sage-grouse distributions (P < 0.01); range-wide, landscapes supporting > 50% of males on leks also harbored 13-19% higher densities of songbirds compared with range-wide mean densities. Eighty-five percent of the conifer removal conducted through the Sage Grouse Initiative coincided with high to moderate Brewer's sparrow abundance. Wyoming's landscape protection (i.e., "core area") strategy for sagegrouse encompasses half the high to moderate abundance sagebrush sparrow and sage thrasher populations. In the Great Basin half the high to moderate abundance sagebrush sparrow and sage thrasher populations coincide with sage-grouse Fire and Invasive Assessment Tool priorities, where conservation actions are being focused in an attempt to reduce the threat of wildfire and invasive plants.

Hniezdne zoskupenia vtakov v ochrannych dubovych lesoch sa mozu podobat zoskupeniam v prirodnych dubinach.	Pavlik, Stefan				Tichodroma	29			1-15	2017	2017				Slovak	0	0	Protection oak forests, preserving soils from erosion on steep rocky slopes, ridges and screes, could be important habitats for breeding bird assemblages similar to those in natural oak forests. In the paper, I compared the structure of breeding bird assemblages and woody vegetation in an 105 years old protection oak forest with those in an 190 years old natural oak forest and in a 60-80 years old production oak forest. A modified point census method was used to estimate breeding bird abundance during the breeding period in 2016. The breeding bird assemblages within the three study plots were similar with respect to bird species composition, abundance and diversity. However, both the species number of cavity nesters and their abundance per census point were statistically significantly higher in the natural and protection forests than in the production forest. The abundance of crown nesters per census point was statistically significantly higher in the production forest compared with the natural and protection forests. Statistically significant differences were found also in the structure of woody vegetation. In total, only Jour statistically significant differences in the structure of breeding bird assemblages and woody vegetation were found between the natural and protection forests, but 14 between the natural and production forests, and 12 between the protection and production forests. This suggests that the protection forest under study was much more similar to the natural forest in relation to the structure of breeding bird assemblage and woody vegetation than to the production forest. Protection oak forests thus have high biocoenological potential because of their relatively natural character, and they represent refuges for preserving bird biodiversity in surrounding intensively managed production forests.

Kellner, Kenneth F.; Ruhl, Patrick J.; Dunning, John B., Jr; Riegel, Jeffery K.; Swihart, Robert K.				Forest Ecology and Management	382			64-75	Dec 15 2016	2016				English	3	76	Forest managers frequently must balance timber production and wildlife conservation goals when choosing management approaches. We studied the response of the breeding bird community to silvicultural treatments at multiple spatial scales over a 10-year period in 60-90 year old oak-hickory forests of Indiana, USA. We conducted point count surveys in a 3603-ha study area both before (n = 3 years) and after (n = 6 years) application of silvicultural treatments. Bird responses were analyzed at two spatial scales: management units and individual harvests. At the multi-stand management unit scale, treatments were even-aged management, uneven-aged management, and a no-harvest control. We also analyzed the responses of birds at the spatial scale of individual timber harvests (clearcuts, patch cuts, shelterwood harvests, and single-tree selection). Multi-species N-mixture models were used to estimate bird species density and richness at both spatial scales. At the management unit scale, 4 species increased in density following even-aged management (relative to the control), while 1 species (Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus)) declined. A larger number of species responded both positively (n = 9) and negatively (n = 3) to uneven-aged management. Overall richness was significantly greater in the even-and uneven-aged treatments than in the control. At the harvest scale, only the clearcuts and patch cuts resulted in changes in the density of any species, but a larger number of species were impacted and effect sizes were generally larger in these harvests than at the management unit scale. In the clearcuts, 13 species increased in density relative to the no-harvest control, while 5 species declined. A larger number of species were impacted by patch cut harvests (18 species increasing and 6 decreasing). Overall richness was greatest in the clearcut harvests. At both scales, species that increased were generally those associated with early successional habitat, including the Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), while species that declined were typically associated with mature forest habitat (e.g., Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla)). Harvesting appeared to benefit several species of conservation concern in Indiana, including the Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea) and Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia). Both management treatments appear to be good options for simultaneously conserving bird species diversity (particularly of early-successional specialist species) while meeting other forest management goals. However, the impact of the next phases of the shelter wood harvests remains to be evaluated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Czeszczewik, Dorota; Walankiewicz, Wieslaw				Lesne Prace Badawcze	77	4		332-340	Dec 2016	2016				Polish	0	0	The aim of this study was to review the most important results from the last 40 years of intense ornithological research conducted in the Bialowieza Forest. Furthermore, we discuss the threats that may destroy the unique ecology and characteristics of this forest. Studying the avifauna of the Bialowieza Forest provides us with a good general knowledge about natural ecological conditions and relationships, which prevailed in temperate European forests in the past. The avifauna of the Bialowieza Forest is characterized by features associated with primeval habitats such as the stability of communities over time, high species richness, relatively low densities, high proportion of hole-nesting birds, very high predation pressure and weak, insignificant competition interactions. This emphasizes the importance of predation, excess of nesting sites for cavity nesting birds, high abundance of food, especially for insectivorous species and fluctuation of bird population size due to rodent outbreaks (pulsed resources). The most severe threats for the avifauna of the Bialowieza Forest are: rejuvenation of tree stands, removal of dead wood, fragmentation of old-growth stands, change of tree stand composition (reducing the proportion of some tree species). In order to expand our ecological knowledge about birds, we should keep the Bialowieza Forest fully protected for years to come. The main priority should be the maintenance of natural processes changing the forest's species composition.

It uses information on (1) factors that influence sagebrush ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to nonnative invasive annual grasses and (2) distribution and relative abundance of sage-grouse populations to address persistent ecosystem threats, such as invasive annual grasses and wildfire, and land use and development threats, such as oil and gas development and cropland conversion, to develop effective management strategies. A sage-grouse habitat matrix links relative resilience and resistance of sagebrush ecosystems with modeled sage-grouse breeding habitat probabilities to help decisionmakers assess risks and determine appropriate management strategies at both landscape and site scales. Areas for targeted management are assessed by overlaying matrix components with Greater sage-grouse Priority Areas for Conservation and Gunnison sage-grouse critical habitat and linkages, breeding bird concentration areas, and specific habitat threats. Decision tools are discussed for determining the suitability of target areas for management and the most appropriate management actions. A similar approach was developed for the Great Basin that was incorporated into the Federal land use plan amendments and served as the basis of a Bureau of Land Management Fire and Invasives Assessment Tool, which was used to prioritize sage-grouse habitat for targeted management activities.

Lindenmayer, David B.; MacGregor, Christopher; Wood, Jeff; Westgate, Martin J.; Ikin, Karen; Foster, Claire; Ford, Fred; Zentelis, Rick				Biological Conservation	204	B		276-283	Dec 2016	2016				English	3	28	Military training areas (MTAs) cover 6% of the earth's land surface, but the impact on biodiversity of weapons use in MTAs remains largely unknown. We quantified the effects of military training on vertebrates in a 5-year study at Beecroft Weapons Range in south-eastern Australia by contrasting the occurrence of birds, mammals and reptiles between 24 sites within an area subject to repeated weapons use and a matched set of non-impacted sites. Species richness of mammals and reptiles was similar within versus outside the impact area, although many-individual species responded to fire, which occurred more frequently in impacted sites. Bird species richness, the occurrence of larger-bodied and migratory bird species, and the occurrence of most individual bird species, was reduced within the impact area. Many bird species that displayed low prevalence in impacted sites also declined over time across the whole study area. Differences in biota between the impact and non-impact areas were detectable after controlling for the effects of recent fire, suggesting that weapons use impacted vertebrates through mechanisms additional to altered fire regimes. Overall, our data indicated that Beecroft Weapons Range maintained considerable biodiversity value despite prolonged military use. Hence, MTAs have the potential to make a substantial contribution to conservation outside the formal protected area network. However, managers of MTAs need to explicitly state their environmental objectives. This is because management practices may be different if the aim is to maximize species richness rather than to secure populations of particular species.

Faria, Nuno; Morales, Manuel B.; Rabaca, Joao E.				European Journal of Wildlife Research	62	6		663-671	Dec 2016	2016				English	4	16	In recent years, haying has extended to Iberian Mediterranean dry grasslands potentially impacting on grassland bird ecology. We evaluated the impact of haying on a grassland bird community of South Portugal. Our main goals were: (1) to investigate the exposure of different species to haying, (2) to investigate potential removal of nests and dead birds from hayed fields by haying machinery using the ratio (REC) between the expected number of records and the number of records collected and (3) to link clutch destruction and bird mortality with haying management practices. Hayed fields were surveyed for signs of breeding and birds censused prior to mowing. Linear models were computed, linking the REC with haying machinery and sward properties. GLMs and model averaging were used to obtain models linking clutch destruction, bird mortality and haying management variables. Only 4 % of records evidenced successful nesting attempts (N = 177). REC evaluation suggested high nest or dead bird removal by the machinery, particularly in fields with lower vegetation biomass prior to cutting. Sickle bar mowers and one-rotor rotary rakes returned higher REC but lower probability of found nests removed from the original nesting sites comparatively to discs mowers and wheel rakes. Higher probabilities of mortality events were found in fields mown earlier (but not in all years). On the other hand, lower mortality was found in fields raked with two-rotor rotary rakes. Delayed haying, silage production in temporary crops and the use haying machinery enabling simultaneously mowing and gathering hay in lines are discussed as management alternatives.

Broyer, Joel; Sukhanova, Olga; Mischenko, Alexander				Journal for Nature Conservation	34			118-125	Dec 2016	2016				English	7	12	Since the negative trends in bird populations breeding in intensified farming systems of western Europe could be difficult to reverse, this article highlights the importance of also considering conservation measures in key-sites for grassland birds in European Russia where farming abandonment is the prevailing threat. Non-passerine bird species frequency was studied in the period 2007-2009, within 193 count points in diversely managed meadows of 36 key-regions in Russia and compared to the outcomes of 492 count points in hay meadows of 25 key-regions in France. In Russia, five species were recorded in at least 35% of the plots, among which the Corncrake Crex crex in 75% of total sample. Pair density was defined in two hay meadow systems in Russia with the Territory Mapping method. Bird biomass density was not different when compared to the most favourable conditions recorded in France, but with a Corn-crake density of 2.1 calling males per 10 ha vs.1.0 in the major French stronghold. Experimental results of alternative management showed the limits of mowing postponement programmes in French grassland ecosystems and enabled us to explore the effects of rotational mowing for limiting habitat loss due to farming abandonment in Russia.

Blaschke, Markus; Hanusch, Sebastian				Ornithologischer Anzeiger	55	1		23-41	Dec 2016	2016				German	0	0	The "strict forest reserves" are not affected by commercial forestry and, being widely distributed across Bavaria, make an interesting basis for bird studies. In 39 of these reserves birds have been recorded on the basis of 1 hectare grid mapping. The results are investigated in this paper. These show that in particular wetland forests as well as the mountain-, mixed leaved- and oak forests contain high numbers of species. In pure beech forests, and also in oak-dominated forests, we found a wide variation in the number of species. In all reserves together, 117 bird species have been detected to date 56 of them alone in the strict forest reserve Wolfsee in southern Steigerwald. Similarity analysis of species compositions form a gradient of the avifauna stretching from the floodplain forests over the oak and beech forests to the mountain mixed forests. From the studies it can be deduced that a natural forest composition plays an important role in the protection of native birdlife. Many of the typical beech forests in Bavaria with older trees and few mixed species show an abundant bird life, as long as it is possible to retain an appropriate quantity of dead wood and safeguarded habitat trees in the forests.

These effects are mediated by changes to vegetation structure and composition that directly influence the availability of shelter, feeding and breeding resources. We investigated the response of a semi-arid shrubland bird community in Western Australia to the prevailing fire regime by examining the abundance, diversity and guild structure in relation to time since fire. We also examined vegetation structural attributes in relation to time since fire. We surveyed 32 sites ranging in age from 12 to 84 years since last fire. A total of 845 birds from 40 species were recorded. Vegetation structure varied with fire history with old and very old sites characterised by less bare ground, more leaf litter cover and greater canopy cover. Bird community composition varied with time since fire, driven by increased bird species richness and abundance of insectivores, granivores/frugivores, golden whistlers, grey shrike-thrush and red-capped robins with time since fire. Frequent, intense landscape-scale fires transform the landscape into homogeneous young shrublands, which may render vegetation unsuitable for several species and guilds.

Lozano-Cavazos, Eloy Alejandro; Brennan, Leonard A.; Kuvlesky, William P., Jr; Hernandez, Fidel; Harrell, Wade C.				Bulletin of the Texas Ornithological Society	49	1-2		1-32	Dec 2016	2016				English	0	0	Reversing the ongoing decline of grassland birds in North America will require effective and sustainable management strategies for restoring their habitats and populations. Traditional management methods such as roller-chopping and prescribed fire may be an option to restore and maintain habitats for grassland birds in mesic environments where brush has increased in the past 100 years such as the coastal prairies in southern Texas. We evaluated estimates of breeding and wintering land bird population abundance in relation to two approaches to brush reduction: a combined treatment based on the successive use of roller-chopping, followed with prescribed fire, and the application of herbicides to individual shrubs (combined treatment); and an application prescribed summer fire (summer fire treatment). These two treatments were compared between each other and against plots sampled on open grassland areas which served as comparative controls that represented open grassland vegetation with little or no brush cover. Land bird species richness on the combined and summer fire treatments was consistently greater than species richness on the control sites during the three winter and two summer seasons of the study. Land bird species richness decreased on both treatments during winter and summer seasons over the course of the study. Overall relative abundance of individual species was greater on both the combined and the summer fire treatment sites compared to the control sites. A rapid recovery of dense, herbaceous vegetation in response to above-average rainfall was apparently an influential factor that corresponded to sharp decreases in the abundance of many land bird species over the three years of the study. A range of between 10% and 30% of brush canopy cover scattered throughout the landscape should be considered for restoring vegetation in order to maximize bird species richness in a coastal prairie setting. Once any kind of treatment is applied to reduce brush cover for grassland bird management. further maintenance should be considered to maintain presence and heterogeneity of herbaceous vegetation.

Yao, Runzhi; Zhou, Zaibao; Yan, Guozeng; Tian, Zuobao; Wang, Shuo; Li, Kai				Acta Ecologica Sinica	36	22		7393-7400	Nov 2016	2016				Chinese	0	0	The spatial extent of plantation forests continued to increase after the Grain for Green Project (GGP) started in January 2002 in China, with more than 20 thousand km2 forests developed from 1999 to 2008 throughout the entire country. From 2012 to 2014, the purpose of Beijing's plain reforestation project was to increase the spatial extent of the forest area in the administrative sub-units that make up the city of Beijing with a plains habitat. In the GGP, one third of the farmland in this region has been replanted with trees to increase the extent of the green area and improve the environment. However, considerable controversy remains related to whether afforestation can effectively result in the conservation of biological diversity. The objective of this study is to explore the effects of afforestation on the ground-dwelling spider community and evaluate the effects of the GGP on the ecosystem and biodiversity during afforestation. From March to September 2014 and 2015, pitfall traps were used to collect ground-dwelling spiders every 10 days in habitats that had been returned to forests from farmland for 2 and 3 years, respectively, in Shunyi District, Beijing. Ground-dwelling spider communities were compared between two adjacent habitats, a former non-crop habitat and an afforested habitat. A total of 18 pitfall traps were placed in the same randomly selected pattern in both habitats. During the investigations, we collected a total of 1465 individuals from eight families, 18 genera and 32 species in 2014, and a total of 2186 individuals from 10 families, 25 genera and 45 species in 2015. Afforestation within the study sites had a positive effect on ground-dwelling spider diversity over the first 3 years. The species of ground-dwelling spiders present changed with afforestation; total species richness increased and some of the farmland spiders were not found in afforested habitats. In 2014, species richness and a diversity index of ground-dwelling spiders in former non-crop habitats were significantly higher than in afforested habitats (P<0.01). In 2015, the diversity index in former non-crop habitats was still significantly higher than in afforested habitats (P<0.01), while species richness in former non-crop habitats was significantly higher than in afforested habitats (P < 0.05). An evenness index in the two habitats was not significantly different in both 2014 and 2015. In the second year after afforestation, the peak of the ground-dwelling spider activity density in former non-crop habitats occurred in mid-June, which was 1 month earlier than that in the afforested habitat. In the third year after afforestation, the ground-dwelling spider activity density exhibited similar trends in both habitats; that is, in both habitats the peak of activity density occurred at the same time in early July. The results show that in the first years of habitat alteration, the ground-dwelling spider community in the afforested habitat was still in a stage of community reconstruction, and the community's stability increased year by year. Returning farmland to forests influenced the original farmland ecosystem through changes in the vegetation type, structure and management practices. As the forests mature, additional effects on spider species at the site are expected because of changes in light conditions, microclimate, vegetation and so on. Therefore, the effects of returning farmland to forests on the ground-dwelling spider community will need further study over time. The aim of this study is to determine whether afforestation contributed to enhancing biodiversity and conservation. Studying the process of change in biological communities after habitat alteration is of great theoretical significance.

Darracq, Andrea K.; Boone, Wesley W.; McCleery, Robert A.				Forest Ecology and Management	378			214-221	Oct 15 2016	2016				English	16	141	A clear understanding of how management influences vertebrate biodiversity is critical for the conservation of rare ecosystems, such as the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem in the southeastern United States: We used scientific literature to assess how vertebrate use of the longleaf pine ecosystem (High or low) differed in response to high (1-3 years), moderate (>3-5 years), and low (>5 years) burn frequencies. For all species combined, we found that the number of high use (HU) species associated with moderately burned forests (n = 140) was 22% and 33% greater than in high (n = 115) and low burn (n = 105) frequency forests, respectively. This pattern was most clear for Ayes and Reptilia. Specifically, the number of HU species associated with moderate burn frequencies (Aves - n = 69; Reptilia - n = 36) was 21% and 25% greater for Ayes and 56 and 63% greater for Reptilia than high (Ayes - n = 57; Reptilia - n = 23) and low burn frequencies (Ayes - n = 55; Reptilia - n = 22), respectively. We found no difference in the number of HU species across burn frequencies for Amphibia or Mammalia. For species considered longleaf pine specialists, across all vertebrate taxa the number of HU species was associated with areas of high and moderate burn frequencies. We posit that moderate burn frequencies had the greatest number of HU species because of requirements for multiple habitat types, structural diversity, and habitat components that are reduced in, or not provided by, areas with high burn frequencies. If conservation of specific longleaf pine specialists that rely on habitat created by high fire frequencies (e.g. Red-cockaded woodpeckers) is the objective, we suggest managing with high burn frequencies at the local scale. Conversely, if management objectives include maximizing wildlife diversity, managers should use a more variable fire regime across the landscape, from annual to less frequent 5 year burn intervals, to maintain localized patches of oaks and increase the compositional and structural diversity within the system.

Tingley, Morgan W.; Ruiz-Gutierrez, Viviana; Wilkerson, Robert L.; Howell, Christine A.; Siegel, Rodney B.				Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences Series B	283	1840		20161703	Oct 12 2016	2016				English	15	82	An emerging hypothesis in fire ecology is that pyrodiversity increases species diversity. We test whether pyrodiversity-defined as the standard deviation of fire severity-increases avian biodiversity at two spatial scales, and whether and how this relationship may change in the decade following fire. We use a dynamic Bayesian community model applied to a multi-year dataset of bird surveys at 1106 points sampled across 97 fires in montane California. Our results provide strong support for a positive relationship between pyrodiversity and bird diversity. This relationship interacts with time since fire, with pyrodiversity having a greater effect on biodiversity at 10 years post-fire than at 1 year post-fire. Immediately after fires, patches of differing burn severities hold similar bird communities, but over the ensuing decade, bird assemblages within patches of contrasting severities differentiate. When evaluated at the scale of individual fires, fires with a greater heterogeneity of burn severities hold substantially more species. High spatial heterogeneity in severity, sometimes called 'mixed-severity fire', is a natural part of wildfire regimes in western North America, but may be jeopardized by climate change and a legacy of fire suppression. Forest management that encourages mixed-severity fire may be critical for sustaining biodiversity across fire-prone landscapes.

Maphisa, David H.; Smit-Robinson, Hanneline; Underhill, Les G.; Altwegg, Res				PLoS ONE	11	10		e0162609	Oct 5 2016	2016				English	1	24	Moist high-altitude grasslands in South Africa are renowned for high avifaunal diversity and are priority areas for conservation. Conservation management of these areas conflicts with management for other uses, such as intensive livestock agriculture, which requires annual burning and leads to heavy grazing. Recently the area has become target for water storage schemes and renewable electricity energy projects. There is therefore an urgent need to investigate environmental factors and habitat factors that affect bird species richness in order to optimise management of those areas set aside for conservation. A particularly good opportunity to study these issues arose at Ingula in the eastern South African high-altitude grasslands. An area that had been subject to intense grazing was bought by the national power utility that constructed a pumped storage scheme on part of the land and set aside the rest for bird conservation. Since the new management took over in 2005 the area has been mostly annually burned with relatively little grazing. The new management seeks scientific advice on how to maintain avian species richness of the study area. We collected bird occurrence and vegetation data along random transects between 2006 and 2010 to monitor the impact of the new management, and to study the effect of the habitat changes on bird species richness. To achieve these, we convert bird transect data to presence only data to investigate how bird species richness were related to key transect vegetation attributes under this new grassland management. First we used generalised linear mixed models, to examine changes in vegetation grass height and cover and between burned and unburned habitats. Secondly, we examined how total bird species richness varied across seasons and years. And finally we investigated which habitat vegetation attributes were correlated with species richness of a group of grassland depended bird species only. Transects that were burned showed a larger decrease in vegetation cover compared to transects that were not burned. Grass height increased over time. Bird species richness was highest in summer compared to other seasons and increased over time. Overall bird species richness increased over the three summer surveys but species richness of birds that prefer heavily grazed habitat showed little change over the three years. Changes in bird species richness were best explained by the model with grass height for combined species richness of grassland depended birds but also for birds that prefer heavy grazing when treated alone. On one hand birds that prefer moderate grazing were best explained by a null model. However, overall bird species richness was better positively correlated to grass height than grass cover or dead grass. We conclude that frequent burning alone with relatively reduced grazing led to higher but less dense grass, which benefited some species and disadvantaged others. We suggest that management of this grassland use combination of fire and grazing and leave some areas unburned to accommodates birds of various habitat needs.

Davies, S.R.; Sayer, C.D.; Greaves, H.; Siriwardena, G.M.; Axmacher, J.C.				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	233			179-191	Oct 3 2016	2016				English	4	28	Biodiversity declines in agricultural landscapes represent a major conservation challenge. In the UK, some agricultural landscapes contain high pond densities, but many farmland ponds have become terrestrialised since the 1960s, with input of organic material resulting in a decrease in the size and depth of ponds that eventually transform into wet woodland habitats. Pond management, including removal of overhanging scrub and sediment, has proven highly effective in enhancing freshwater biodiversity. However, the implications of this management for farmland bird assemblages are unknown. Bird surveys were undertaken at recently managed, open, macrophyte-dominated and at highly terrestrialised, macrophyte-free ponds in the intensively cultivated farmland of North Norfolk, UK. The diversity, abundance and composition of bird assemblages visiting these ponds were compared to determine responses to pond management by tree and mud removal. Avian species richness, abundance and bird-visit frequencies were all higher at open farmland ponds. The observed patterns of bird occurrence were best explained by management-induced reductions in tree shading that resulted in aquatic macrophyte-dominance likely associated with high emergent invertebrate prey abundance. Moreover, we predict that open-canopy ponds offer greater habitat heterogeneity than overgrown ponds, allowing diversified bird use. Overgrown, terrestrialised ponds were preferred by some woodland bird species. Gamma diversity across the entire pondscape exceeded all individual pond alpha diversity measures by an order of magnitude, suggesting distinct variation in the bird assemblages visiting farmland ponds during different successional stages. Pond management that generates a mosaic of pond successional stages, including open-canopy, macrophyte-dominated ponds, could help to address the long-term decline of farmland birds. We strongly advocate increased agro-ecological research in this field, combined with greater emphasis on ponds and pond management options in agri-environment schemes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Due to over-urbanization and little regard for nature conservation, such cities are usually characterized by poor biodiversity. In contrast to central business district areas, suburbs may support greater levels of biodiversity through an increase in green areas. We examined urban bird species richness, abundance, and composition in Klang Valley, Peninsular Malaysia. We surveyed 141 points for passerines across 80 parks grouped into two different urban zones, namely central business districts and suburbs. Our results revealed that bird richness did not differ significantly (p = 0.994) between central business districts and the suburbs. We found that the abundances of birds were significantly greater in the suburbs than in central business districts. However, species composition was similar between the central business districts and suburbs. We also found that bird richness increased significantly with an increase in size of green areas and park areas, as well as the number of woody trees in both zones. Evidence from this study suggests that creating urban parks and gardens, coupled with tree planting in central business districts, is able to support greater biodiversity, at least for birds in cities similar to those found in the suburbs.

Ashbrook, Kate; Taylor, Andrew; Jane, Louise; Carter, Ian; Szekely, Tamas				Oryx	50	4		583-592	Oct 2016	2016				English	4	37	Reintroductions aim to re-establish species within their historical ranges through the release of wild- or captive-bred individuals following extirpation (or extinction) in the wild. There is no general agreement on what constitutes a successful reintroduction but the probability of the population achieving long-term persistence should be addressed. Here we review a 10-year trial reintroduction of the great bustard Otis tarda, a globally threatened bird species, to the UK and assess the long-term population viability. Despite changes in rearing and release strategy, initial post-release survival probability remained consistently low, with only 11.3% of bustards (n = 167) surviving from release to. year post-release. Nineteen breeding attempts were made by eight females; however, only one chick survived > 100 days after hatching, and no wild juveniles have recruited into the population. Using demographic rates from the UK population and wild populations elsewhere, and stochastic population modelling, we investigate the viability of this reintroduced population by predicting population size over the next 10 years. Under current demographic rates the population was predicted to decline rapidly. Self-sufficiency was predicted only using the highest estimates from the UK population for first-year and adult survival, and recruitment rates from wild populations elsewhere. Although changes have been made in rearing, release strategies, habitat management and release sites used, these changes appear to have a modest effect on long-term viability. Substantial improvements in survival rates and productivity are necessary to establish a viable great bustard population in the UK, and we consider this unlikely.

Lindenmayer, David B.; Candy, Steven G.; MacGregor, Christopher I.; Banks, Sam C.; Westgate, Martin; Ikin, Karen; Pierson, Jennifer; Tulloch, Ayesha; Barton, Philip				Ecological Applications	26	7		2267-2279	Oct 2016	2016				English	3	27	Fire is a major ecological process in ecosystems globally. Its impacts on fauna can be both direct (e.g., mortality) and indirect (e.g., altered habitat), resulting in population recovery being driven by several possible mechanisms. Separating direct from indirect impacts of fire on faunal population recovery can be valuable in guiding management of biodiversity in fire-prone environments. However, resolving the influence of direct and indirect processes remains a key challenge because many processes affecting fauna can change concomitantly with time since fire. We explore the mechanisms influencing bird response to fire by posing the question, can temporal changes in vegetation structure predict changes in bird occurrence on sites, and can these be separated from other temporal changes using the surrogate of time since fire? We conducted a 12-yr study of bird and vegetation responses to fire at 124 sites across six vegetation classes in Booderee National Park, Australia. Approximately half of these sites, established in 2002, were burned by a large (>3000 ha) wildfire in 2003. To disentangle collinear effects of temporal changes in vegetation and direct demographic effects on population recovery that are subsumed by time since fire, we incorporated both longitudinal and cross-sectional vegetation effects in addition to time since fire within logistic structural equation models. We identified temporal changes in vegetation structure and richness of plant and bird species that characterized burned and unburned sites in all vegetation classes. For nine bird species, a significant component of the year trend was driven by temporal trends in one of three vegetation variables (number of understory or midstory plant species, or midstory cover). By contrast, we could not separate temporal effects between time since fire and vegetation attributes for bird species richness, reporting rate, and the occurrence of 11 other bird species. Our findings help identify species for which indirect effects of vegetation dominate recovery and thus may benefit from vegetation management where conservation actions are required and, conversely, those species for which direct effects of time since fire drive recovery, where simply leaving a system to recover following the last disturbance will be sufficient.

Pakanen, Veli-Matti; Aikio, Sami; Luukkonen, Aappo; Koivula, Kari				Ecology and Evolution	6	20		7176-7187	Oct 2016	2016				English	1	10	The effect of habitat management is commonly evaluated by measuring population growth, which does not distinguish changes in reproductive success from changes in survival or the effects of immigration or emigration. Management has rarely been evaluated considering complete life cycle of the target organisms, including also possible negative impacts from management. We evaluated the effectiveness of cattle grazing in the restoration of coastal meadows as a breeding habitat for small and medium-sized ground-nesting birds by examining the size and demography of a southern dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii) breeding population. Using a stochastic renesting model that includes within-season variation in breeding parameters, we evaluated the effect of grazing time and stocking rates on reproduction. The census data indicated that the population was stable when nest trampling was prevented, but detailed demographic models showed that the population on managed meadows was a sink that persisted by attracting immigrants. Even small reductions in reproductive success caused by trampling were detrimental to long-term viability. We suggest that the best management strategy is to postpone grazing to after the 19th of June, which is about three weeks later than what is optimal from the farmer's point of view. The differing results from the two evaluation approaches warn against planning and evaluating management only based on census population size and highlight the need to consider target-specific life history characteristics and demography. Even though grazing management is crucial for creating and maintaining suitable habitats, we found that it was insufficient in maintaining a viable population without additional measures that increase nest success. In the presently studied case and in populations with similar breeding cycles, impacts from nest trampling can be avoided by starting grazing when about 70% of the breeding season has past.

Hawa, Ainil; Azhar, Badrul; Top, Marina Mohd; Zubaid, Akbar				Wetlands	36	5		899-908	Oct 2016	2016				English	5	38	Increased demand for oil palms has led to a massive expansion of logging and conversion of peat swamp forests in Southeast Asia. Although palm oil is a primary driver of economic growth, the unsustainable expansion of the oil palm industry has led to the widespread degradation of peat swamp forests. Birds have been studied to determine their responses to landscape changes in the North Selangor Peat Swamp Forest (NSPSF). We captured 1045 birds from 72 species of the NSPSF and 168 individual birds from 13 species in oil palm plantations using mist-netting. Our results show that peat swamp forest supports more bird species than the oil palm areas. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling revealed that both vegetation types had an influence on bird species composition. SIMPER analysis also showed that the percentage of the assemblage similarity within the oil palm areas was 51.30 %, while it was 31.32 % in the peat swamp. We found that the populations of frugivores, insectivores, and omnivores were significantly higher in the peat swamp forest, whereas there was no significant difference in the granivores between the two sites. To conserve peat swamp forests, stakeholders should implement habitat restoration, maintain landscape connectivity, and retain a forest area network.

The opposite alteration, flow augmentation, is less common and could reveal a mechanistic coordination between flow regime, channel form, and riparian ecosystems. The Little Bow River, a naturally intermittent prairie stream in Southern Alberta, has experienced flow augmentation since the late 1890s, and the Little Bow/Highwood Project of 2004 enabled a tripling of diversion flows from 2.9 to 8.5m3/s. We investigated the subsequent responses by assessing the channel form and riparian vegetation based on aerial photographs taken in 2000 versus 2010, and riparian birds were assessed between 2005 and 2013 to investigate associations with riparian vegetation. Following recent flow augmentation, the mean channel width increased from 12.2 to 13.5m, while sinuosity was relatively unchanged. Streamside zones with true willows (especially Salix exigua and Salix bebbiana) increased from 7 to 11% of the river corridor, and the facultative riparian wolf willow (Elaeagnus commutata) zones increased from 16 to 20%, while grassy zones decreased from 64 to 52%. Avian species richness and Shannon-Wiener index increased, while species evenness was relatively unaltered, suggesting an increase of rarer bird species in response to the increased habitat structure and diversity following the expansion of riparian shrubs and woodland. This study revealed responses to the recent flow augmentation over the first decade of implementation, and alterations following flow augmentation would likely continue for decades until the river and riparian zones adjust to the new flow regime.

We investigated whether it is possible to apply a complementarity-based approach to evaluate the extent to which an existing network of restoration plantings meets representation targets. Using a case study of woodland birds of conservation concern in southeastern Australia, we compared complementarity-based selections of plantings based on temporally dynamic species occurrences with selections based on static species occurrences and selections based on ranking plantings by species richness. The dynamic complementarity approach, which incorporated species occurrences over 5 years, resulted in higher species occurrences and proportion of targets met compared with the static complementarity approach, in which species occurrences were taken at a single point in time. For equivalent cost, the dynamic complementarity approach also always resulted in higher average minimum percent occurrence of species maintained through time and a higher proportion of the bird community meeting representation targets compared with the species-richness approach. Plantings selected under the complementarity approaches represented the full range of planting attributes, whereas those selected under the species-richness approach were larger in size. Our results suggest that future restoration policy should not attempt to achieve all conservation goals within individual plantings, but should instead capitalize on restoration opportunities as they arise to achieve collective value of multiple plantings across the landscape. Networks of restoration plantings with complementary attributes of age, size, vegetation structure, and landscape context lead to considerably better outcomes than conventional restoration objectives of site-scale species richness and are crucial for allocating restoration investment wisely to reach desired conservation goals. Evaluacion de Redes Complementarias de Plantaciones de Restauracion para la Ocurrencia a Escala de Paisaje de Especies Temporalmente Dinamicas Las inversiones multimillonarias de dolares en la restauracion de suelos hacen que los objetivos de conservacion se obtengan de manera rentable. Las estrategias desarrolladas para la planeacion estrategica de la conservacion ofrecen oportunidades para evaluar a escala de paisaje los resultados de biodiversidad temporalmente dinamica obtenidos de la restauracion y para mejorar las estrategias tradicionales que se enfocan en las plantaciones mas ricas en especies. Investigamos si es posible aplicar una estrategia basada en la complementariedad para evaluar la extension con la que una red de plantaciones de restauracion cumple con los objetivos de representacion. Con el uso de un estudio de caso de Aves de bosque de importancia para la conservacion en el sureste de Australia, comparamos las selecciones basadas en la complementariedad de las plantaciones basadas en la ocurrencia de especies dinamicas temporalmente con las selecciones basadas en la ocurrencia de especies estaticas y con las selecciones basadas en la clasificacion por riqueza de especies de las plantaciones. La estrategia de complementariedad dinamica, que incorporo la ocurrencia de especies durante cinco anos, resulto en una mayor ocurrencia de especies y en una mayor proporcion de objetivos alcanzados en comparacion con la estrategia de complementariedad estatica, en la que la ocurrencia de las especies fue tomada en un punto unico en el tiempo. En la equivalencia de costos, la estrategia de complementariedad dinamica tambien resulto siempre en un mayor porcentaje promedio minimo de ocurrencia de especies mantenido en el tiempo y en una proporcion mayor de la comunidad de Aves que cumplian con los objetivos de representacion en comparacion con la estrategia de riqueza de especies. Las plantaciones seleccionadas bajo las estrategias de complementariedad representaron la extension completa de atributos de plantacion, mientras que aquellas seleccionadas bajo la estrategia de riqueza de especies tuvieron un mayor tamano. Nuestros resultados sugieren que las futuras politicas de restauracion no deberian intentar alcanzar todos los objetivos de conservacion dentro de plantaciones individuales, sino que en su lugar, deberian capitalizar con las oportunidades de restauracion conforme surgen para obtener asi el valor colectivo de las plantaciones multiples a lo largo del paisaje. Las redes de plantaciones de restauracion con los atributos complementarios de edad, tamano, estructura de la vegetacion y contexto del paisaje llevan a resultados considerablemente mejores que los objetivos convencionales de restauracion de riqueza de especies a escala de sitio y son cruciales para asignar sabiamente las inversiones de restauracion para alcanzar los objetivos deseados de conservacion.

It is the most important single EU-Life+ Nature project with a total budget of 22,3 mio. [element]. In the course of nine years (2011-2020) the project aims to secure and optimize the habitat characteristics in twelve of the most important meadowbird habitats in Lower Saxony. To this end, population status, numbers and breeding success shall be ensured and improved. Before the start of the Life+-project numbers of breeding Black-tailed Godwit pairs from all study sites (nearly 72,000 ha) summed up to 1,174 territorial pairs (2009-2012). To evaluate the consequences of the project's management measures, a breeding success monitoring program on an annual basis was started. Between 2012 and 2014 the breeding success was measured in 11 to 13 study sites with 390 (2012) and 453 (2014) breeding pairs, respectively. Breeding success of Black-tailed Godwits was on average only in four out of 13 sites above 0.7 juveniles/pair/year, wich is the value for a stable population size. With one exception (Schneckenbruch") these areas are characterized by extensive agricultural usage and where wardening of the birds can be guaranteed. In areas with intensive grassland use, the reproduction rate was on average below 0.4 juveniles/breeding pair/year. In general, breeding success rates in whole Lower Saxony are currently not sufficient for a stable population size.

Sustainable forest management such as close-to-nature silviculture is needed. In this context forest management practices should be tested in regard to biodiversity. Therefore, we investigated the influence of gap formation and logging intensity on different functional groups in a close-to-nature managed fir-beech forest. Plots were selected in three areas in the Dinaric Mountains in Slovenia. In every area, nine plots were selected per area, of which three were established as control plots, three were treated with 50% logging and three with 100% logging. In every plot, the species of different functional groups were observed: ectomycorrhizal fungi, ferns, graminoids, forbs, hoverflies, carabid beetles and birds. For each of these groups, the species richness, species assemblage dissimilarity and indicator species were calculated for the different treatments. Ectomycorrhizal fungi and birds both responded to high logging intensity with a sharp decrease in the number of species; however, the results for ectomycorrhizal fungi were highly nested, while some additional bird species appeared. Graminoids and forbs were positively affected by logging intensity and saw increases in the number of species. Forbs had an almost completely new species assemblage compared to the forest species assemblages. Hoverflies were most favored by 50% logging, as these plots contained species from open areas and forest. Ferns and carabid beetles did not exhibit a response to different logging intensities. The number of indicator species was highly affected by the total number of species of the groups. However, which treatment they indicated was independent of the species richness but varied strongly per species group. The variability in responses shows that functional groups react differently to logging intensities, and the use of more functional groups improved the detection of changes due to logging. Fifty percent removal of the growing stock retained the diversity of most of the studied groups. The association of the group to vegetation structure, host species specificity or abiotic factors made them more responsive to the change associated with retention logging. The results are discussed in the context of forest management implications in regard to biodiversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Gonzalez Afanador, Edith; Kjelland, Michael E.; Ben Wu, X.; Wilkins, Neal; Grant, William E.				Environment Systems & Decisions	36	3		310-328	Sep 2016	2016				English	0	7	The present research focused on using spatial analysis to determine relationships among land ownership property sizes and landscape structure, with a focus on conservation management implications. Indices and metrics of ownership property sizes and landscape structure were calculated for 20 km buffer areas around 31 North American Breeding Bird Survey transects, 12 located within the Edwards Plateau ecoregion and 18 in contiguous ecoregions. The number of bird species observed at each transect provided a measure of avian species richness associated with land cover classes for each respective transect (Gonzalez in Urban influence on diversity of avifauna in the Edwards Plateau of Texas: effect of property sizes on rural landscape structure, Texas A&M University, 2005). Spatial correlations were calculated between each pair of the landscape indices. Spatial analysis identified a "threshold of habitat fragmentation'' for the 500 acre (ac) ownership property size. Significant spatial correlations among variables showed that property sizes lower than 500 ac produced habitat fragmentation represented by a decrease in mean patch size (MN) and proximity among habitat patches (Index PROX). Spatial analysis also made possible the prioritization of ecological sub-regions of the Edwards Plateau for conservation or restoration. The Live Oak-Mesquite Savannah showed the highest average ownership property size (7305 ac) and the highest values of patch richness. Based on the results, management in the Live Oak-Mesquite Savannah sub-region should focus on the conservation of land mosaic diversity to assure native avian species turnover (Whittaker 1972). In Balcones Canyon Lands, 64 % of land was covered by farms smaller than 500 ac and the overall average ownership property size was above the threshold of fragmentation (1440 ac), implying that management policies there should focus both on habitat conservation and on restoration. In contrast, 71 % of land in the Lampasas Cut Plains was covered by farms smaller than 500 ac, and average ownership property size was very close to the fragmentation threshold (625 ac). Consequently, the results indicate that management in the Lampasas Cut Plains sub-region should focus on habitat restoration (e.g., corridors that connect isolated habitat patches). In general, the threshold of ownership property size, 500 ac, is important for conservation planning because below that threshold of property size, habitat patch size begins to decrease and the distance between equivalent patches of habitat increases. Isolated patches act as islands within a sea of less suitable habitat which produce negative effects on biodiversity. Identifying the spatial characteristics indicative of habitat fragmentation, or the likelihood thereof, is an important issue for conservation planning in places with urban sprawl influence.

David; McIntyre, Peter B.				Ecological Applications	26	6		1785-1796	Sep 2016	2016				English	1	40	Most ecosystems are impacted by multiple local and long-distance stressors, many of which interact in complex ways. We present a framework for prioritizing ecological restoration efforts among sites in multi-stressor landscapes. Using a simple model, we show that both the economic and sociopolitical costs of restoration will typically be lower at sites with a relatively small number of severe problems than at sites with numerous lesser problems. Based on these results, we propose using cumulative stress and evenness of stressor impact as complementary indices that together reflect key challenges of restoring a site to improved condition. To illustrate this approach, we analyze stressor evenness across the world's rivers and the Laurentian Great Lakes. This exploration reveals that evenness and cumulative stress are decoupled, enabling selection of sites where remediating a modest number of high-intensity stressors could substantially reduce cumulative stress. Just as species richness and species evenness are fundamental axes of biological diversity, we argue that cumulative stress and stressor evenness constitute fundamental axes for identifying restoration opportunities in multi-stressor landscapes. Our results highlight opportunities to boost restoration efficiency through strategic use of multi-stressor datasets to identify sites that maximize ecological response per stressor remediated. This prioritization framework can also be expanded to account for the feasibility of remediation and the expected societal benefits of restoration projects.

Kajtoch, Lukasz; Wilk, Tomasz; Bobrek, Rafal; Matysek, Marcin				Bird Conservation International	26	3		350-365	Sep 2016	2016				English	3	16	The biodiversity and naturalness of forests that cover stream valleys in submontane areas have not been investigated as intensively as riparian forests along large lowland rivers. In this study we compared data on total bird assemblages and on selected indicator species detected in forests along submontane stream valleys ('Vall') with those detected in forests covering submontane slopes and tops in the foothills ('Hill') of the Western Carpathians, considering also environmental characteristics of the studied locations. The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis that forests along submontane stream valleys harbour significantly richer and more diverse bird communities and that they are an important habitat for rare and threatened species. We found that the species richness, abundance of birds and bird diversity were almost twice as high in 'Vall' than in 'Hill' locations and that indicator species mostly or exclusively inhabit 'Vall' locations. Moreover, species diversity was highly and positively correlated with higher tree species diversity and a higher amount of large trees and dead wood, but negatively correlated with logging intensity. The results of our study confirmed that forested river valleys in submontane areas play an important role as refugia both for rare and endangered bird species as well as for the whole bird assemblage. This study is the first to present an assessment of this type of habitat for birds in the Western Carpathians. Forests along submontane stream valleys, if protected or unmanaged, could be treated as reference areas for nature and biodiversity conservation.

Threlfall, Caragh G.; Williams, Nicholas S.G.; Hahs, Amy K.; Livesley, Stephen J.				Landscape and Urban Planning	153			28-39	Sep 2016	2016				English	10	224	To balance the needs of people and biodiversity in cities, local governments are increasingly incorporating green spaces and urban greening initiatives into urban planning frameworks. Despite this, there is little information on which vegetation features or management actions are most useful in supporting biodiversity within these green spaces. We assess the effect of three vegetation management approaches that are commonly suggested to improve outcomes for urban biodiversity, including: (1) increasing the proportion of native vegetation; (2) increasing the density of trees, and (3) increasing the volume or complexity of understorey vegetation. We use a network of 39 urban green spaces (including golf courses, public parks and residential neighbourhoods) to assess how these vegetation management approaches impact urban bird and bat communities. The richness of both birds and bats increased with an increase in the proportion of native plants, bird species richness increased with increasing volume of understorey vegetation, and increasing large tree density led to increased bat activity. Our study suggests that increasing native vegetation composition and understorey vegetation volume, and the retention of large trees are practical vegetation management approaches that improve outcomes for urban birds and bats. Our data also suggests that as urbanisation and infill development proceeds, retention of large green spaces (such as golf courses) will be critical for urban biodiversity conservation, as these areas supported a component of the bird and bat fauna which was not recorded in other green space types.

The value of topographical heterogeneity to avian diversity in a fire-prone landscape.		Robinson, Natasha M.; Leonard, Steve W.J.; Bennett, Andrew F.; Clarke, Michael F.				Biological Conservation	200			1-7	Aug 2016	2016				English	0	27	In forest ecosystems, uniformity in fire spread may be moderated by topography such that sheltered areas (e.g. gullies) escape fire. However, gullies are not immune to fire and, under extreme fire weather conditions, can burn. This may compromise their habitat value, and diminish differences in faunal communities across topographical gradients. We investigated the extent to which differences in avian communities persist when subjected to uniform fire severity and fire history across the gully and slope components of a forest site. We predicted that there would be less difference with increasing fire severity or long absence of fire. Birds were surveyed at 91 paired gully/slope sites in foothill eucalypt forests, two to three years after a large, severe wildfire in southeastern Australia. Sites were stratified in relation to four levels of fire severity (unburnt through to crown burnt) and two levels of fire history prior to the wildfire (burnt < 3 years, or > 20 years). Under similar conditions of fire severity and fire history, gullies maintained greater species richness and abundance than did slopes; averaging 13% greater species richness and 32% greater abundance, along with a distinct bird assemblage. However, contrary to predictions, topographical differences for most avian responses did not diminish with increasing fire severity or in the long absence of fire prior to the wildfire. This study highlights the value of forest gullies in maintaining or facilitating the recovery of distinct avian communities after wildfire, even when the gullies themselves have been burnt.

Aben, Job; Bocedi, Greta; Palmer, Stephen C.F.; Pellikka, Petri; Strubbe, Diederik; Hallmann, Caspar; Travis, Justin M.J.; Lens, Luc; Matthysen, Erik				Journal of Applied Ecology	53	4		1055-1065	Aug 2016	2016				English	1	52	As biodiversity hotspots are often characterized by high human population densities, implementation of conservation management practices that focus only on the protection and enlargement of pristine habitats is potentially unrealistic. An alternative approach to curb species extinction risk involves improving connectivity among existing habitat patches. However, evaluation of spatially explicit management strategies is challenging, as predictive models must account for the process of dispersal, which is difficult in terms of both empirical data collection and modelling. Here, we use a novel, individual-based modelling platform that couples demographic and mechanistic dispersal models to evaluate the effectiveness of realistic management scenarios tailored to conserve forest birds in a highly fragmented biodiversity hotspot. Scenario performance is evaluated based on the spatial population dynamics of a well-studied forest bird species. The largest population increase was predicted to occur under scenarios increasing habitat area. However, the effectiveness was sensitive to spatial planning. Compared to adding one large patch to the habitat network, adding several small patches yielded mixed benefits: although overall population sizes increased, specific newly created patches acted as dispersal sinks, which compromised population persistence in some existing patches. Increasing matrix connectivity by the creation of stepping stones is likely to result in enhanced dispersal success and occupancy of smaller patches.Synthesis and applications. We show that the effectiveness of spatial management is strongly driven by patterns of individual dispersal across landscapes. For species conservation planning, we advocate the use of models that incorporate adequate realism in demography and, particularly, in dispersal behaviours.

Carpio, Antonio J.; Hillstrom, Lars; Tortosa, Francisco S.				European Journal of Wildlife Research	62	4		423-430	Aug 2016	2016				English	5	39	The wild boar has, over the past few decades, undergone an expansion in Europe, which may have negatively affected ground-nesting bird populations and particularly those of wading birds. The aim of this study was to evaluate predation on waders' nests by wild boar in Sweden, where this species has been increasing since its reintroduction. This was done by placing artificial nests in seven different study areas. A comparison was then made of predation rates of the nests placed on control plots (areas in which no wild boar were present but other predators were) and plots containing different abundances of wild boar. Contrary to our expectations, the proportion of nests predated was significantly lower in those areas in which wild boar were present, with a predation rate of 54 %, whereas the predation rate was 87.5 % in the others. The wild boar was identified as the second most important nest predator in the plots in which it was present, accounting for 18 % of the predated nests. The main predator on both types of plots was the red fox, which was responsible for 28 and 38.5 % of the predated nests on plots with/without wild boar, respectively. Interestingly, predation by badgers occurred principally in areas in which the wild boar was absent (34.5 % of the predated nests), whereas only one nest was predated by this predator in areas containing wild boar. It is not, however, possible to state whether predation by badgers was lower because of the presence of wild boar or whether this was owing to the fact that badgers do not select those particular patches because of habitat features.

Thom, Dominik; Seidl, Rupert				Biological Reviews (Cambridge)	91	3		760-781	Aug 2016	2016				English	43	375	In many parts of the world forest disturbance regimes have intensified recently, and future climatic changes are expected to amplify this development further in the coming decades. These changes are increasingly challenging the main objectives of forest ecosystem management, which are to provide ecosystem services sustainably to society and maintain the biological diversity of forests. Yet a comprehensive understanding of how disturbances affect these primary goals of ecosystem management is still lacking. We conducted a global literature review on the impact of three of the most important disturbance agents (fire, wind, and bark beetles) on 13 different ecosystem services and three indicators of biodiversity in forests of the boreal, cool- and warm-temperate biomes. Our objectives were to (i) synthesize the effect of natural disturbances on a wide range of possible objectives of forest management, and (ii) investigate standardized effect sizes of disturbance for selected indicators via a quantitative meta-analysis. We screened a total of 1958 disturbance studies published between 1981 and 2013, and reviewed 478 in detail. We first investigated the overall effect of disturbances on individual ecosystem services and indicators of biodiversity by means of independence tests, and subsequently examined the effect size of disturbances on indicators of carbon storage and biodiversity by means of regression analysis. Additionally, we investigated the effect of commonly used approaches of disturbance management, i.e. salvage logging and prescribed burning. We found that disturbance impacts on ecosystem services are generally negative, an effect that was supported for all categories of ecosystem services, i.e. supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services (P < 0.001). Indicators of biodiversity, i.e. species richness, habitat quality and diversity indices, on the other hand were found to be influenced positively by disturbance (P < 0.001). Our analyses thus reveal a disturbance paradox', documenting that disturbances can put ecosystem services at risk while simultaneously facilitating biodiversity. A detailed investigation of disturbance effect sizes on carbon storage and biodiversity further underlined these divergent effects of disturbance. While a disturbance event on average causes a decrease in total ecosystem carbon by 38.5% (standardized coefficient for stand-replacing disturbance), it on average increases overall species richness by 35.6%. Disturbance-management approaches such as salvage logging and prescribed burning were neither found significantly to mitigate negative effects on ecosystem services nor to enhance positive effects on biodiversity, and thus were not found to alleviate the disturbance paradox. Considering that climate change is expected to intensify natural disturbance regimes, our results indicate that biodiversity will generally benefit from such changes while a sustainable provisioning of ecosystem services might come increasingly under pressure. This underlines that disturbance risk and resilience require increased attention in ecosystem management in the future, and that new approaches to addressing the disturbance paradox in management are needed.

Vander Yacht, Andrew L.; Keyser, Patrick D.; Buehler, David A.; Harper, Craig A.; Buckley, David S.; Applegate, Roger D.				Journal of Wildlife Management	80	6		1091-1105	Aug 2016	2016				English	6	55	Oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands and savannas throughout the Mid-South, USA have become closed-canopy forests through succession in the absence of fire, contributing to declines in disturbance-dependent avian species. Restoration could ameliorate these trends, but effects of such management practices on avian communities of the Mid-South are poorly understood. We implemented an experiment on the Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee with treatments involving fall (Oct) or spring (Mar) fire with woodland (14m2/ha) or savanna (7m2/ha) residual basal area and unmanaged control stands (20ha each). We conducted fixed-radius point counts 3 times annually (2010-2012) and analyzed trends in naive occupancy for 41 species. For 20 species with adequate data (10 early-, 10 late-successional), we performed multiple-season, robust-design occupancy modeling and accounted for detection bias. We then used mixed-model polynomial regression to define relationships between occupancy and measures of live and dead basal area, midstory density, and herbaceous groundcover. Restoration substantially altered forest structural characteristics but did not affect the occupancy of most late-successional species. In contrast, the presence of early-successional species increased as live basal area decreased and herbaceous groundcover increased. Only 3 of 41 species (hooded warbler (Setophaga citrina), ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), and worm-eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum)) exhibited reduced occupancy as woodland and savanna conditions were approached. The presence of all other species, including 13 regionally and 2 continentally declining, remained constant or increased as restoration progressed. Woodland conditions of 10m2/ha live basal area and 20% herbaceous groundcover maximized occupancy of early-successional species with little consequences for late-successional species. Proceeding further toward savanna conditions negatively affected species associated with lower strata of mature-forests but further increased the presence of some early-successional species. Midstory density and dead basal area were poor predictors of occupancy and thus may be necessary but not sufficient in promoting early-successional species. Our results suggest implementing oak woodland and savanna management in the Mid-South could benefit disturbance-dependent birds of high conservation priority with minimal negative impacts on the presence of late-successional species.

Restoration Ecology	24	4		441-448	Jul 2016	2016				English	3	29	Desertification and climate change are degrading large areas of arid and semiarid habitat in many regions. In response, many countries have implemented revegetation programs, commonly using Atriplex nummularia, native to Australia. Although not intrinsically targeted at habitat restoration, these programs aim to restore (stabilize) erosional processes and provide livestock forage (usually goats, sheep). Few investigators have assessed the utility of these novel habitats for native fauna. In a recent, extensive survey of small mammal communities in lands revegetated with A. nummularia in north-central Chile, we captured a single animal, the marsupial (Thylamys elegans). We also captured no birds in our live traps and saw numerous darkling beetles in traps. These striking results contrasted with data from a nearby ungrazed park with natural vegetation where 10 small mammal species are known with total abundances ranging from 15 to 80 animals in similar sampling efforts. These revegetated lands provide poor habitat for native mammals, and we argue that revegetation efforts should include proactive risk assessment and cost-benefit analyses in a structured decision-making framework. In addition, managers should target increased plant species diversity to support broader biological diversity in addition to the need to control erosion. Although our work has focused on revegetation with Atriplex, numerous other plant species have been intentionally introduced to arid lands, usually for economic reasons; many of these, like Atriplex, have unintended consequences for native biota.

Michael, Damian R.; Wood, Jeff T.; O'Loughlin, Thea; Lindenmayer, David B.				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	227			24-32	Jul 1 2016	2016				English	5	43	Native vegetation placed under an agri-environment scheme (AES) is purported to support greater biodiversity than vegetation managed for intensive livestock grazing, and conservation reserves are purported to support greater, biodiversity than land sharing under AES. These predictions underpin financial incentive delivery programs that enable landholders to adopt environmentally friendly agricultural practices. To evaluate these predictions, we established a biodiversity monitoring program in endangered temperate eucalypt woodland communities in southern Australia. We compared vegetation variables and vertebrate species richness and abundance among sites under different land management between 2010 and 2014. Our sites included: (1) woodland remnants on private property recently placed under an AES land management agreement (land sharing), (2) woodland remnants in State conservation reserves as reference areas (land sparing), and (3) woodland remnants used for intensive livestock production as controls. We used hierarchical generalized linear models to examine patterns of biodiversity among management classes and over time. We found conservation reserves were structurally more complex and floristically richer compared to production sites, and AES supported greater cover of native perennial grass. Reptile and amphibian species richness and abundance, and total bird species richness did not differ significantly among management classes, although AES and reference sites supported more birds of conservation concern. Arboreal marsupials were significantly more species rich in conservation reserves than AES. Temporal patterns in vertebrate species richness were related to post-drought climatic conditions. Our findings suggest that strategies involving land sharing under AES are as effective as land sparing (e.g. conservation reserves) for bird conservation, but alternative strategies may be required to enhance habitat for less mobile species such as frogs and reptiles, or species dependant on old growth vegetation such as arboreal marsupials.

Duchardt, Courtney J.; Miller, James R.; Debinski, Diane M.; Engle, David M.				Rangeland Ecology & Management	69	4		300-309	Jul 2016	2016				English	4	40	In North America, the loss of habitat heterogeneity resulting from homogeneous livestock grazing is one factor contributing to steep population declines of many grassland bird species. Patch-burn grazing is a management technique that uses historic grassland disturbance as a model to create heterogeneous grassland composition and structure, providing for the diverse habitat requirements of grassland birds. Though this management technique has been used successfully in relatively extensive grasslands, its utility on smaller grassland patches is less clear. We examined the efficacy of patch-burn grazing to restore habitat heterogeneity and increase grassland bird diversity in relatively small pastures (15-32 ha) in a grassland landscape fragmented by cultivation and tree encroachment. In 2006, we established 12 experimental pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of southern Iowa and northern Missouri, with 4 pastures in each of three treatments: 1) patch-burn graze, with spatially discrete fires and free access by cattle (the fire-grazing interaction), 2) graze-and-burn, with free access by cattle and a single burn of the entire pasture every third year, and 3) burn-only, with a single burn of the entire pasture every third year and no grazing. Patch-burn grazing in the first phase of the project (2007-2009) did not generate habitat heterogeneity or significant differences in bird diversity. From 2010 to 2013, stocking rates were reduced to increase residual vegetation in unburned patches at the end of the grazing season to increase heterogeneity. Habitat heterogeneity in patch-burn graze pastures subsequently increased relative to other treatments. Concomitantly, diversity of obligate grassland birds also increased in patch-burn graze pastures and was greatest in 2012 and 2013. We conclude that the fire-grazing interaction can be used to restore habitat heterogeneity and increase grassland bird diversity, even in relatively small grassland patches embedded in a highly fragmented landscape.

We quantified temporal changes in bird occurrence in restoration plantings of different ages and geometries, and compared observed patterns with a reference dataset from woodland remnants on the same farms as our plantings. Over time, bird species richness remained unchanged in spring but exhibited modest increases in winter. We found that wider plantings supported significantly greater bird species richness in spring and winter than narrow plantings. There was no evidence of a significant interaction between planting width and time. We recorded major temporal changes in the occurrence of a range of individual species that indicated a clear turnover of species as plantings matured. Our results further revealed marked differences in individual species occurrence between plantings and woodland remnants. Life-history attributes associated with temporal changes in the bird assemblage were most apparent in winter survey data, and included diet, foraging and nesting patterns, movement behaviour (e.g. migratory vs. dispersive), and body size. Differences in bird assemblages between plantings of different ages suggest that it is important that farms support a range of age classes of planted woodland, if the aim is to maximize the number of native bird species in restored areas. Our data also suggest that changes in the bird species occupying plantings of different ages can be anticipated in a broadly predictable way based on planting geometry (especially width) and key life-history attributes, particularly movement patterns and habitat and diet specialisation.

Sullivan, Martin J.P.; Newson, Stuart E.; Pearce-Higgins, James W.				Ibis	158	3		645-655	Jul 2016	2016				English	3	18	Generalist species are becoming increasingly dominant in European bird communities. This has been taken as evidence of biotic homogenization, whereby generalist winners' systematically replace specialist losers'. We test this pattern by relating changes in the average specialization of UK bird communities to changes in the density of species with different degrees of habitat specialization. Although we find the expected decline in community specialization, this was driven by a combination of a strong increase in the density of the most generalist quartile of species and declines in the density of moderately generalist species. Contrary to expectation, specialist species increased slightly over the 18-year study period but had little effect on the overall trend in community specialization. Our results indicate that the apparent homogenization of UK bird communities is not driven by the replacement of specialists by generalists, but instead by the changing fortunes of generalist species.

The area is very fire-prone with six major wildfires impacting it during the course of this study. The Bobtail population did not appear to be greatly affected by the first three fires but numbers declined steeply and have remained low since a widespread fire on 6 February 1994, As well as the effect of this fire, the possible roles of rainfall, tick load and the infectious disease URTI, are discussed. These results are compared with long-term data obtained from the same area for some avian species.	Brooker, Michael; POB 518, Kalamunda, WA, 6926, Australia, Australia.

Thorn, Simon; Werner, Sinja A.B.; Wohlfahrt, Juergen; Baessler, Claus; Seibold, Sebastian; Quillfeldt, Petra; Mueller, Joerg				Ecological Indicators	65			142-148	Jun 2016	2016				English	2	28	Natural disturbances, such as fire, windstorms and insect outbreaks, are important drivers of biodiversity in forest ecosystems, but at the same time cause large economic losses. Among the natural disturbances in Europe, windstorms cause the highest economic loss. After such storms, damaged forest stands are commonly salvage logged to restore economic value. However, such interventions could affect species assemblages of various taxonomic groups, including breeding birds. Despite these potential effects, investigations of the impacts of post-storm logging are largely lacking. We thus investigated assemblages of breeding birds in 21 logged and 21 unlogged windstorm-disturbed forest plots and 18 undisturbed, control forest plots using fixed-radius point-stop counts three, five and seven years after a windstorm within the Bavarian Forest National Park as part of the European Long-Term Ecosystem Research Network. We recorded 2100 bird individuals of 55 bird species. Bird assemblages were predominantly altered by the consequences of the windstorm and affected only to a minor degree by subsequent logging of storm felled trees. Nevertheless, bird species richness was significantly reduced by post-storm logging within the first season. In general, the windstorm led to a shift in bird assemblage composition from typical forest species towards open- and shrub-land species. Assemblages of logged and unlogged disturbed plots consisted mainly of long-distance migrants and ground-foraging bird species, whereas assemblages of undisturbed control plots consisted of resident species that forage within vegetation. Both unlogged and logged storm-felled coniferous forest stands were inhabited by endangered or declining bird species, such as Water Pipit (Anthus spinoletta) on logged plots and Eurasian Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) on unlogged plots. Indicator species analyses suggested that species of unlogged storm disturbed plots depended on storm-created legacies, such as pits and snags, for foraging and nesting. Hence, we recommend reducing post-storm logging of these legacies to support species restricted to unlogged disturbed forest. To increase the diversity of breeding birds on the landscape scale, diverse logged and unlogged post-disturbance stands should be provided, which could be gained by a partial benign neglect strategy of storm disturbed forest stands.

Kross, Sara M.; Kelsey, T. Rodd; McColl, Chris J.; Townsend, Jason M.				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	225			140-149	Jun 1 2016	2016				English	2	30	The relationship between on-farm avian conservation measures and the potential provisioning of pest control services by birds is poorly understood in intensive agricultural landscapes, especially in temperate regions. We used an exclusion experiment to test the effects of field- and landscape-scale habitat complexity on avian-provisioned pest-control services and assessed avian abundance and diversity across 32 conventional alfalfa (Medicago sativa) fields in winter and early spring in California. Alfalfa is a key forage crop around the world and is grown on approximately 30 million hectares globally each year. Bird foraging reduced the abundance of the most significant insect pests of alfalfa by over 33%. The presence of complex edge habitat (presence of at least two trees >1.5 m) led to higher avian abundance within fields, which in turn led to reduced pest insect populations at sampling points close to the field edge. Fields with complex edge habitat also harbored nearly three times as many bird species as those with simple edge habitat. The distance from the nearest riparian habitat, a measure of landscape diversity, did not affect bird abundance or diversity in winter alfalfa fields, which may be related to the homogenous landscape in which our study was based. Our results show that relatively simple conservation measures in intensively managed farming landscapes, such as planting small trees along a field edge, can result in increased abundance and diversity of over-wintering birds, with direct benefits to farmers through increased avian-mediated pest-control services.

Managers need additional scientific evidence to help them balance conservative and integrative management methods. In this study, the relative influence of management abandonment, stand structure and landscape features on bird and bat communities in 14 managed and unmanaged forests in France is evaluated. Total birds and bats richness, richness for forest and threatened birds and edge-specialized bats significantly increased with total deadwood quantities. Richness of generalist, omnivorous and cavity-nesting birds was higher in unmanaged stands and richness of gleaner bats was positively influenced by the density of standing deadwood. By contrast, landscape variables had little influence on the different ecological groups but did have effects on individual species. Though the effects showed relatively limited magnitude, this study supports the value of deadwood and the importance of management abandonment for forest vertebrates. This study confirms that for integrated conservation strategies to be fully efficient they must be complemented by designating strict forest reserves because some target species groups depend on structural features found only at sufficient levels in those areas.

Soler, Rosina M.; Schindler, Stefan; Lencinas, Maria V.; Peri, Pablo L.; Martinez Pastur, Guillermo				Forest Ecology and Management	369			161-169	Jun 1 2016	2016				English	1	42	Effects of forest harvesting on biodiversity can be varied and complex to understand. We provide a meta analysis of 553 studies plants, insects and birds to identify the general responses to Variable Retention harvesting (VR) 1-8 years post-harvest in Nothofagus pumilio forests of southern Patagonia. The analysis is focused on: (i) richness and abundance, (ii) origin and habitat (native forest specialist species, native species of other habitats, alien species), and (iii) temporal trends after harvesting. Our objective was to evaluate why biodiversity increases after variable retention harvesting, by assessing the effects on (i) species richness and abundance in general, (ii) native forest specialists, native generalist species and alien species, and (iii) the recovery of biodiversity toward original conditions. Forests managed with VR supported higher overall richness and abundance of plants, insects and birds in aggregate and dispersed retention than unmanaged stands, but with similar values each other. However, origin and habitat of species affected responses to VR. Aggregates support higher native forest specialist plant and lower plants of habitats other than dispersed retention. However, both retention treatments increased alien plants, although its richness and abundance was higher in dispersed retention. Native forest specialist insects were reduced in comparison to unmanaged forest, while insects of other habitats showed a positive response to both aggregate and dispersed retention as well as did for bird species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged forests. We found evidence for recovery of original conditions for native forest specialist plants and insects, and plants of other habitats. In contrast, alien plants and native insects of other habitats increased continuously in the studies included through those representing 8 years post-harvest. Major differences among both retention patterns included significantly higher richness and abundance of alien plants and native insects of other habitats in dispersed retention. Our synthesis shows recovery toward original conditions for some taxa, but demonstrates long-term establishment of alien plants as well as insect species not associated with native N. pumilio forests. These have emerged as a main potential threat to conservation of forests under VR prescription, at least at the stand level. Retention forestry could play a fundamental role for conservation in productive temperate forests, but the influence of retention pattern and aggregate size are still unclear. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Vestnik Zoologii	50	3		241-250	Jun 2016	2016				English	0	0	This research was carried out in Kyiv Polissya geobotanical province, in one of most common woods type - fresh and wet sudubravas. Its purpose is to determine ornithocenosis structure in different age groups of this type of forest. To achieve that, forest bird species lists were composed, their population density and that of ecological groups of birds were calculated. In the course of the research in the breeding periods of 2013-2014, two-time surveys were carried out on 12 survey routes of total length 33 km. For further analysis, forests were divided into age groups: 0-20 years, 20-40 years, 40-60 years, 60-80 years, 80-100 years and forests over 100 years. Altogether 53 bird species were found. Species lists were poorest in the forests of 0-20 years (18 species), and richest in the forests over 100 years (39 species). Minimal population density was 473 individuals per square kilometer in the youngest forest age group of 0-20 years, maximal - 2155 individuals per square kilometer in pine forests aged over 100 years. Analysis of different population densities of ecological groups reveals steadily growing numbers of hollow-nesting birds and tree-nesting birds in accordance with aging of the forests. In older forests hollow-nesting birds constitute an absolute majority. Population density of another ecological group shows no such direct tendency.

White, A.M.; Manley, P.N.; Tarbill, G.L.; Richardson, T.W.; Russell, R.E.; Safford, H.D.; Dobrowski, S.Z.				Animal Conservation	19	3		256-264	Jun 2016	2016				English	2	49	Fire is a natural process and the dominant disturbance shaping plant and animal communities in many coniferous forests of the western US. Given that fire size and severity are predicted to increase in the future, it has become increasingly important to understand how wildlife responds to fire and post-fire management. The Angora Fire burned 1243 hectares of mixed conifer forest in South Lake Tahoe, California. We conducted avian point counts for the first 3 years following the fire in burned and unburned areas to investigate which habitat characteristics are most important for re-establishing or maintaining the native avian community in post-fire landscapes. We used a multi-species occurrence model to estimate how avian species are influenced by the density of live and dead trees and shrub cover. While accounting for variations in the detectability of species, our approach estimated the occurrence probabilities of all species detected including those that were rare or observed infrequently. Although all species encountered in this study were detected in burned areas, species-specific modeling results predicted that some species were strongly associated with specific post-fire conditions, such as a high density of dead trees, open-canopy conditions or high levels of shrub cover that occur at particular burn severities or at a particular time following fire. These results indicate that prescribed fire or managed wildfire which burns at low to moderate severity without at least some high-severity effects is both unlikely to result in the species assemblages that are unique to post-fire areas or to provide habitat for burn specialists. Additionally, the probability of occurrence for many species was associated with high levels of standing dead trees indicating that intensive post-fire harvest of these structures could negatively impact habitat of a considerable proportion of the avian community.

Flesch, Aaron D.; Gonzalez Sanchez, Carlos; Valenzuela Amarillas, Javier				Journal of Field Ornithology	87	2		176-195	Jun 2016	2016				English	2	23	The Sierra Madre Occidental and neighboring Madrean Sky Islands span a large and biologically diverse region of northwest Mexico and portions of the southwestern United States. Little is known about the abundance and habitat use of breeding birds in this region of Mexico, but such information is important for guiding conservation and management. We assessed densities and habitat relationships of breeding birds across Sky Island mountain ranges in Mexico and adjacent portions of the Sierra Madre from 2009 to 2012. We estimated densities at multiple spatial scales, assessed variation in densities among all major montane vegetation communities, and identified and estimated the effects of important habitat attributes on local densities. Regional density estimates of 65% of 72 focal species varied significantly among eight montane vegetation communities that ranged from oak savannah and woodland at low elevations to pine and mixed-conifer forest at high elevations. Greater proportions of species occurred at peak densities or were relatively restricted to mixed-conifer forest and montane riparian vegetation likely because of higher levels of structural or floristic diversity in those communities, but those species were typically rare or uncommon in the Sky Islands. Fewer species had peak densities in oak and pine-oak woodland, and species associated with those communities were often more abundant across the region. Habitat models often included the effects of broadleaf deciduous vegetation cover (30% of species), which, together with tree density and fire severity, had positive effects on densities and suggest ways for managers to augment and conserve populations. Such patterns combined with greater threats to high-elevation conifer forest and riparian areas underscore their value for conservation. Significant populations of many breeding bird species, including some that are of concern or were not known to occur regionally or in mountain ranges we surveyed, highlight the importance of conservation efforts in this area of Mexico.

Saalfeld, David T.; Saalfeld, Sarah T.; Conway, Warren C.; Hartke, Kevin M.				Wilson Journal of Ornithology	128	2		290-305	Jun 2016	2016				English	4	36	Many migratory grassland passerines complete their annual life cycle within the United States and investigations into wintering ecology of these species are scarce, particularly in ecoregions where habitat quality is considered to be compromised, such as the coastal prairie of Texas. During 2008-2010, we investigated wintering grassland bird ecology as related to coastal prairie composition and management practices on the mid-upper Texas coast. To quantify grassland bird composition and density among management regimes, we performed 260 transect surveys on 40 different study site pastures deployed among 7 different management regimes, varying in plant community composition as well as frequency (or occurrence) of burning, grazing, and mowing from 29 October 2008-7 April 2009 and 17 November 2009-17 March 2010. A total of 79 bird species (48 species in 2008-2009 and 66 species in 2009-2010) were recorded during this study. Sites that were recently (<2 years prior) grazed, burned, or mowed tended to have the greatest species richness of obligate grassland bird species. Management regime and the resulting habitat characteristics also appeared to influence densities of Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis), and Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), with the former two species selecting areas that had not been recently burned, grazed, or mowed and were characterized by greater vertical vegetation density and litter depth, respectively. Conversely, Sprague's Pipit selected recently burned, grazed, or mowed prairies, characterized by less litter depth and percentage of shrubs nearby. More cosmopolitan species, such as Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) occurred equally among management regimes. Despite similar species richness in floristically disturbed sites, nonnative vegetation appeared to negatively influence species with specific habitat requirements such as Sprague's Pipit, Sedge Wren, and Le Conte's Sparrow. In order to increase wintering avian diversity, coastal prairie habitat conservation and management in Texas should focus on restoring management regimes (i.e., burning, mowing, and grazing) that create heterogeneous environments, while maintaining native vegetation communities.

Habitat traits and management practices shape avian communities in intensive vineyards.		Assandri, Giacomo; Bogliani, Giuseppe; Pedrini, Paolo; Brambilla, Mattia				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	223			250-260	May 1 2016	2016				English	3	38	Spreading of viticulture may pose serious threats to biodiversity and adequate policies targeted at decreasing its impact are urgently required. Current knowledge of viticulture effects on biodiversity is scarce and studies on bird communities in vineyards are even scarcer. We surveyed avian assemblages in Trentino vineyards (North-East Italy) in both breeding and wintering seasons to evaluate the effect of: i) landscape, ii) management and iii) topographic-climatic characteristics on birds and to derive implications for conservation. We calculated four community indexes (species richness, abundance, evenness and conservation index) and modelled their relative variation according to 18 environmental variables belonging to the three above-mentioned groups. Landscape models performed better than the others, except for winter evenness, for which management models were the most supported ones. Generally, models considering the three groups together explained more variation than models from an individual group. Landscape (and agricultural) heterogeneity, extent of marginal habitats, density of traditional elements (hedgerows, tree rows, isolated trees and rural buildings) all had positive effects, whereas vineyard cover had negative impact on the value of the four community indexes. Organic management had no apparent effect on avian communities. We detected a seasonal difference in the effects of environmental characteristics on bird communities, which suggested that local conservation efforts could be tuned according to the seasonal importance of vineyards in different regions. Key measures to promote biodiversity in vineyards include maintaining patches of residual habitats in the vineyard matrix and enhancing heterogeneity. Marginal features appeared particularly important in the homogeneous landscape of intensive vineyards to favour bird communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Latif, Quresh S.; Sanderlin, Jamie S.; Saab, Victoria A.; Block, William M.; Dudley, Jonathan G.				ECOSPHERE	7	5		e01346	May 2016	2016				English	3	30	Wildfire is a key factor influencing bird community composition in western North American forests. We need to understand species and community responses to wildfire and how responses vary regionally to effectively manage dry conifer forests for maintaining biodiversity. We compared avian relationships with wildfire burn severity between two dry forest locations of Arizona and Idaho. We predicted different responses to wildfire between locations due to regional differences in historical fire regime. We conducted point count surveys for 3 yr following wildfire (Arizona: 1997-1999; Idaho: 2008-2010) and used multispecies hierarchical models to analyze relationships of bird occupancy with burn severity. Consistent with our prediction for mixed-severity fire regimes characterizing the Idaho location, we observed proportionately more positive species occupancy relationships and, consequently, a positive species richness relationship with burn severity in Idaho. We also observed the opposite pattern in Arizona, which was congruent with our prediction for the low-severity fire regime characterizing that location. Cavity nesters and aerial insectivores occupied more severely burned sites following wildfire, corresponding with predicted increases in nesting substrate and foraging opportunities for these species. In contrast, canopy-nesting foliage gleaners and pine seed consumers exhibited negative relationships with burn severity. Our results were consistent with predictions based on species life histories and with patterns from the literature, suggesting generality of observed relationships and locational difference in relationships with wildfire. We therefore suggest that optimal management strategies for maintaining avian diversity could differ regionally. Specifically, intensive fuels management may be ecologically less appropriate for promoting biodiversity in areas such as the Idaho location where mixed-severity wildfires and dense forest stands were historically more common.

Journal for Nature Conservation	30			103-112	May 2016	2016				English	1	20	Agro-silvo-pastoral systems occupy much of the Mediterranean region. Promoting landscape heterogeneity in these systems is a potentially valuable management strategy to enhance woodland biodiversity. We evaluated the effects on birds of managing patches of olive groves and riparian galleries to promote heterogeneity of these systems in Portugal. For a large cork oak woodland we (i) used nesting season bird density estimates and habitat descriptors to generate suitability models for each studied species; (ii) identified areas suitable to establish new patches of riparian galleries and olive groves, and used this information to (iii) generate scenarios maps with different levels of cover of both habitats. Finally, (iv) the model of each bird species was applied over the future scenarios to estimate potential changes in its distribution and abundance. Future scenarios with greater availability of riparian vegetation resulted in major increases in projected populations of seven of the 21 studied species, but gains with increases of olive groves were predicted in just three species. Bird species predicted to increase the most with the recovery of riparian vegetation are presently among the least abundant in the region. Restoring riparian galleries would be highly beneficial for birds, whereas promoting traditional olive groves would have lower conservation implications. The methodology used proved helpful to select areas particularly appropriate for habitat management, generate simulated landscapes incorporating this management, and predict the population and spatial responses of species to these simulated scenarios, thus having a good potential to guide conservation management. Moreover, our results indicate that simple management measures should have substantial positive effects on the bird community of oak woodlands, without compromising the essential economic return of the system.

Tingley, Morgan W.; Wilkerson, Robert L.; Howell, Christine A.; Siegel, Rodney B.				Methods in Ecology and Evolution	7	5		508-517	May 2016	2016				English	1	28	1. It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes. 2. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory. 3. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires. 4. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal.

Basic and Applied Ecology	17	3		240-251	May 2016	2016				English	3	29	In Europe, monitoring indicates that farmland bird populations are declining. Numerous studies at different spatial scales have considered bird ecology in farmland, but viticulture has received little attention, We carried out bird surveys at two spatial scales over two years in western France. We assessed the contribution of vineyards to bird diversity at landscape scale and undertook plot-scale analyses of habitat selection in vineyards and their associated semi-natural habitats, We detected a strong negative relationship between vineyard cover and both abundance and species richness of birds. Only two species responded positively to vineyards: Woodlark Lullula arborea and Skylark Alauda arvensis. Of the 93 species detected at landscape scale, only 16 were frequent users of vine plots. The majority of these species were found to select semi-natural habitats adjacent to grapevines, in particular areas with trees. Only Woodlarks positively selected vineyards as opposed to semi-natural habitats but no consistent selection criteria between different vineyard habitat variables could be detected. Our study shows that, although wine-growing landscapes may he species-rich, fewer species use vineyards themselves, and at low levels of abundance. Planting or maintaining semi-natural woody vegetation are popular management approaches, which our data suggest may encourage generalist species without improving vineyard habitats for open farmland specialists.

Biological Conservation	197			69-79	May 2016	2016				English	3	26	There are many benefits of agricultural landscapes for wildlife. In California's Central Valley, post-harvest flooding of rice fields increases the decomposition of rice stubble and provides habitat for over 50 species of waterbirds. These fields are also flooded during planting, providing habitat for spring migrants and locally breeding birds. Because California has lost over 90% of its historic wetlands, flooded rice is critical wildlife habitat, providing 80% of the total flooded habitat in the Sacramento Valley. Flooding rice fields, however, contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Several rice field management practices may reduce methane emissions including reduced flooding in winter, removal of rice straw after harvest (baling), and drill seeding during planting. During the winters of 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, we compared waterbird use in four combinations of post-harvest practices: baled/flooded, baled/non-flooded, non-baled/flooded, and nonbaled/non-flooded. We found significantly higher dabbling duck and shorebird densities in the non-baled/flooded practice compared to the other three practices. During the spring of 2012 and 2013, we compared waterbird use of drill-seeded fields (reduced GHG) with flooded fly-on seeded fields (status quo GHG). We found no significant differences in mean density between the two seeding practices for waterbirds. Our study found evidence that some post-harvest practices (reduced winter flooding, baling) that reduce GHG emissions from rice also reduce use by waterbirds. While reducing GHG is globally necessary to minimizing the impacts of climate change, doing so in an area of hemispheric importance for waterbirds should be done with caution. (C) 2016 The Authors.

One such shortcut is the umbrella species approach, whereby conservation actions are geared toward one or a few key species, with the assumption that the entire community will benefit. However, fitness-habitat associations and resource use may vary across space and across management regimes, and so too may the utility of umbrella species as ecosystem surrogates. The federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) has been used as an umbrella species in the restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern US. Restoration efforts were based on early habitat selection information in largely degraded landscapes. We examined patterns of resource selection of 97 social groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers in a restored landscape in northwest Florida. Similar to previous studies in degraded landscapes, woodpecker groups selected forest stands containing higher densities of large pines and lower densities of small pines for foraging. However, we found no evidence for another aspect of habitat selection widely documented in degraded habitat, the avoidance of areas with substantial components of hardwoods. These results align with new woodpecker fitness-habitat associations within restored landscapes and lend support to previous findings that current ecosystem restoration efforts in the study area, namely prescribed burning, may have reduced hardwood densities to below those at which they have negative impacts. The red-cockaded woodpecker has served as an effective umbrella species in degraded longleaf ecosystems by promoting management, especially prescribed burning, that benefits many other species. Whether it will continue to do so in restored habitat is not yet clear, but its tolerance of a range of hardwood conditions provides reason for optimism.

Drapeau, Pierre; Villard, Marc-Andre; Leduc, Alain; Hannon, Susan J.				Diversity and Distributions	22	4		385-399	Apr 2016	2016				English	1	36	AimIn managed forest landscapes, the tolerance of species to contemporary alteration of forest cover is often assumed to reflect their resilience to natural disturbances. We tested this central tenet of ecosystem-based management by comparing the structure of forest bird assemblages among four regions with contrasting historical natural disturbance regimes. LocationCanada's boreal and northern hardwood forests. MethodsUsing point count data from four study regions across Canada, we first determined the relative sensitivity of individual bird species to the contemporary reduction of old forest cover at stand and landscape-context' (1-km radius) scales with log-linear models. The richness of species most sensitive to loss of old forest (hereafter sensitive species') was then modelled as a function of landscape-scale changes in old forest cover. Differences in the rate of decline in the richness of sensitive species with contemporary cover of old forest were compared among regions using ANCOVA. We then compared broken-stick regression models with linear models to detect thresholds, if present, in this relationship in each region. ResultsBird assemblages from regions with relatively infrequent natural disturbances hosted more species sensitive to contemporary reduction in old forest cover. Those species were also more abundant than in regions with frequent natural disturbances, and the rate of decline in their richness with the loss of old forest was steeper in regions with infrequent natural disturbances than in those where they were frequent. However, we did not detect thresholds in this rate of decline in any study region. Main conclusionsOur findings are consistent with the contention that historical natural disturbance regimes shape the response of biota to contemporary landscape alterations through evolutionary adaptation. We argue that forest management conducted within the natural range of variability in stand and landscape structure specific to a region is likely to be ecologically sustainable.

Zmihorski, Michal; Part, Tomas; Gustafson, Tomas; Berg, Ake				Journal of Applied Ecology	53	2		587-595	Apr 2016	2016				English	7	132	Nearly 60% of European wetlands have been lost to drainage or to the cessation of grassland management. Large amounts of resources are put into wetland restoration with the aim to recover biodiversity. However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated effects of management, wetness and flooding dynamics on biodiversity of restored wetlands such as seasonally flooded wet grasslands. We inventoried bird communities over 4years at 137 sites (each 31ha) within five restored wet grassland areas in Sweden to investigate whether species richness and occurrence of 12 common wet grassland species were related to (i) local conditions such as management (grazing, mowing and unmanaged areas), basic wetness and spring flooding dynamics. Further, we investigated whether (ii) the composition of the adjacent landscape (20ha) related to local bird diversity and (iii) species turnover (i.e. beta diversity) differed between sites characterized by their basic wetness, degree of flooding and predominant management regime. Local species richness was positively linked to degree of flooding and basic wetness of grasslands but not to type of grassland management. Species richness tended also to be negatively linked to proportion of forest at the landscape scale. Although variable, the same results were also true concerning the probability of the occurrence of a single species at the local scale. Species turnover between sites, and thus total species richness, was distinctly higher in (i) grazed as compared to mowed grasslands except in dry non-flooded grasslands and (ii) flooded as compared to non-flooded sites. Similar patterns held for the subset of 12 red-listed species. We suggest that the high beta diversity in grazed and flooded grasslands is driven by the heterogeneous vegetation structure, resulting in good conditions for foraging and nesting for several wet grassland bird species.Synthesis and applications. The selection of wetlands for conserving wet grassland birds should prioritize temporary flooded grasslands of moderate wetness, preferably far from forest edges. Restoration and management of wet grasslands should include water level management, removal of shrubs and trees, and low-intensity grazing, whereas mowing could be used in non-flooded grasslands of low basic wetness.

In total, 94 bird species (19 855 individuals) belonging to 40 families and 16 orders were recorded. Of the 94 species, two were classified as class ? national protected birds in China and four were class ? national protected birds. Summer residents and passing migrants were the dominant species, accounting for 77.7%. The recorded species were composed of Palaearctic, Oriental and cosmopolitan species, and Palaearctic were the dominant species, accounting for 74.5%. There was a wide variety of bird ecotypes in the survey areas, of which, 36.2% were songbirds. The bird community composition and diversity showed evident spatial variations. Birds were most abundant in the reservoir wetlands. The species richness was the highest in the wetland parks, and the bird composition included 26 water birds and 19 songbirds. The avian diversity was the highest in the forest ecological system, where the composition was dominated by songbirds, such as great tit (Parus major), and grey-capped greenfinch (Carduelis sinica). The diversity of birds was low in the sandy habitats, where only 17 species were recorded. In addition, we also found some significant ecological conservation issues in the areas with a high degree of human disturbance, severe ecological damages, and homogeneity of habitat types. We recommend that ecological conservation and management of damaged protected lands in Shenyang should be enhanced to provide more diverse and suitable habitats for birds.

Faria, Nuno; Morales, Manuel B.; Rabaca, Joao E.				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	220			193-201	Mar 15 2016	2016				English	0	13	In recent years, haying has extended to Iberian Mediterranean dry grasslands potentially threatening grassland birds. We evaluate the between and within-year effects of haying on grassland birds in Alentejo region, Portugal. Our main goals were: (1) to investigate variations on bird abundance and species richness in the fields hayed, with respect to past haying events occurred in a field and its surroundings and; (2) to investigate the shifts in bird abundance, species richness and spatial dynamics resulting from haying a field and its surrounding area in a given year. We conducted grassland bird censuses during the breeding season through point counts from 2012 to 2015. The relationship between bird abundance/richness and past haying events was investigated using Generalized Linear Models whereas within-year effects of haying were analysed using Generalized Additive Models. Bird abundance in a field was positively related with the surface hayed in the vicinity of that field in the previous year. However, contrasting yearly effects were found for non passerines. Also, some species prefer fields with less haying events or surface hayed, whereas others occur mostly in fields frequently managed for haying. Haying a field leads, in the short term, to its abandonment by birds, and thus to a decrease in bird abundance and, for some species, to spatial concentration in surrounding fields offering suitable habitat. We conclude that within-year effects of haying have higher impact on grassland birds than between-year effects. Maintaining haying at low levels by rotating haying yearly through the different fields in each farm and using partial haying may be an adequate way to ensure an effective management of grassland bird populations.

Lee, Alan T.K.; Barnard, Phoebe				Bird Conservation International	26	1		52-68	Mar 2016	2016				English	1	28	The South African Fynbos biome, a global biodiversity hotspot with high endemism and species richness, has six endemic bird species. These are important not only intrinsically, but also for ecological functioning and as flagships for South Africa's economically valuable avitourism sector. Little is known about population sizes or realised distribution ranges of these six species, but projected range modelling based on occurrence from the South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP) has suggested these species are vulnerable to climate change. We estimate global population sizes for these six endemics based on densities calculated from two intensive biome-wide point count surveys in 2012. We modelled regions of suitable climatic space, from which we established that mean annual temperature and the temperature of the warmest quarter of the year appear to limit Cape Rock-jumper Chaetops frenatus and Protea Canary Serinus leucopterus ranges. Both species have seen an apparent > 30% decrease in range and reporting rates (a proxy for abundance) in the twenty years between SABAP atlas periods (1987-1991 and 2007-ongoing). The Cape Rock-jumper result is unexpected: encounter rates are higher in shorter vegetation, dry slopes and habitats with more recent occurrence of fire - all proxies for proximate causes of climate change on the Fynbos. Although coastal plains are highly transformed, mountain Fynbos is the best protected of all the world's Mediterranean-climate habitats, with relatively little anthropogenic land transformation. Long term weather datasets from the Fynbos demonstrate significant warming since 1960. We conclude from these lines of evidence that these decreases are consistent with the loss of suitable climate space and inability of these species to adjust physiologically to increasing temperatures.

Le Roux, Darren S.; Ikin, Karen; Lindenmayer, David B.; Bistricer, Gideon; Manning, Adrian D.; Gibbons, Philip				Restoration Ecology	24	2		252-258	Mar 2016	2016				English	8	55	Large trees support unique habitat structures (e.g. hollows) that form over centuries and cannot be provided by small trees. Large trees are also declining in human-modified landscapes worldwide. One restoration strategy gaining popularity involves adding nest boxes to smaller trees to replicate natural hollows. However, limited empirical research has tested how hollow-nesting fauna responds to the presence of nest boxes. We asked: can the addition of nest boxes increase tree visitation by hollow-nesting birds? We conducted a before-after control-impact (BACI) experiment using 144 nest boxes and 96 sample trees comprised of three sizes (small (20-50 cm dbh), medium (51-80 cm), and large (>80 cm)) and located in four landscape contexts (reserves, pasture, urban parklands, and urban built-up areas). We recorded a significant increase in hollow-nesting bird abundance and richness at large trees after nest box additions. However, the same response was not observed at medium, small, or control trees. We also recorded nonsignificant increases in hollow-nesting bird abundance and richness at trees in modified landscapes after nest box additions compared to trees in reserves and control trees. Our results suggest that adding nest boxes to smaller-sized trees may not attract hollow-nesting birds. Therefore, nest box management strategies may require re-evaluation as it is often assumed that hollow supplementation will attract hollow-using fauna and sufficiently ameliorate the loss of large, hollow-bearing trees. We advocate that large tree retention remains crucial and should be prioritized. Large trees could be effective target structures for habitat restoration, especially in modified landscapes.

Ganey, Joseph L.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	40	1		192-201	Mar 2016	2016				English	1	13	Snags provide habitat for numerous species of wildlife. Several authors have provided recommendations for snag retention in southwestern mixed-conifer and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. Most recommendations were presented in terms of minimum snag density and/or size. I summarized the history of recommendations for snag retention in these forest types, and used data from a current study of snag populations (conducted within Coconino and Kaibab National Forests, north-central AZ, USA, 1997 through 2012) to assess congruence between existing snag populations and various recommendations. Most recommendations were based on studies of cavity-nesting birds; therefore, this analysis emphasized characteristics of snags containing excavated nest cavities. Proportions of plots that met minimum management targets varied among recommendations, ranging from 34% to 100% in mixed-conifer forest and from 7% to 95% in ponderosa pine forest. Failure to meet density targets often was caused by a shortage of snags that met minimum size criteria rather than by a shortage of snags. Many snags containing excavated nest cavities did not meet the minimum size criteria in some recommendations. It may be possible to reduce those minimum size criteria while still providing substrates for cavity-nesting birds. Studies explicitly linking snag size and density to demography of cavity-nesting birds are badly needed, however, as are studies documenting ecologically sustainable snag densities. Until such data are available, managers should continue to emphasize snag recruitment and retention, with the focus on larger snags, and to ensure that snags are well-distributed, but not uniformly distributed, across the landscape.

Loehmus, Asko; Nellis, Renno; Pullerits, Mirjam; Leivits, Meelis				Environmental Management	57	3		558-571	Mar 2016	2016				English	5	53	We assessed ecological sustainability of seminatural forestry by analyzing 80-year dynamics and the current distribution of all woodpecker species in Estonia. We found that, despite the clear-cutting-based forestry system, woodpeckers inhabited commercial seminatural forests in substantial numbers, including the species generally considered vulnerable to timber harvesting. The only negative trend, a drastic decline in the Green Woodpecker, paralleled the loss of seminatural, wooded grasslands and is mostly an issue for landscape planning and agricultural land use. Major silvicultural factors supporting other species in commercial forests include natural regeneration with multiple native tree species and deadwood abundance. In such context, the main role of protected areas is to provide ecological resilience; however, we estimated that the current strict reserves could further double their carrying capacities for woodpeckers through successional recovery and, perhaps, active restoration. The long time series used were instrumental in detecting unexpected dynamics and the impacts of climatically extreme years. We conclude that (1) seminatural forestry can serve as a basis for reconciling timber harvesting and biodiversity protection at the landscape scale, given appropriate attention to key structures and landscape zoning and (2) woodpeckers represent a biological indicator system for the sustainability of forest landscapes in Europe.

Burgess, Emma E.; Maron, Martine				Landscape Ecology	31	3		687-699	Mar 2016	2016				English	0	30	Context An increasing number of studies have investigated the impact of environmental heterogeneity on faunal assemblages when measured at multiple spatial scales. Few studies, however, have considered how the effects of heterogeneity on fauna vary with the spatial scale at which the response variable is characterised. Objectives We investigated the relationship between landscape properties in a region characterised by diverse fire mosaics, and the structure and composition of avian assemblages measured at both the site-(1 ha) and landscape-scale (100 ha). Methods We surveyed birds and calculated spatial landscape properties in sub-tropical woodlands of central Queensland, Australia. Results Environmental heterogeneity, as measured by topographic complexity, was consistently important for bird species richness and composition. However, the explanatory power of topographic complexity varied depending on the spatial scale and the component of diversity under investigation. We found different correlates of richness within particular foraging guilds depending on the scale at which richness was measured. Extent of long-unburnt habitat (( 10 years since fire) was the most important variable for the landscape-scale richness of frugivores, insectivores and canopy feeders, whereas environmental heterogeneity in the surrounding landscape was more important for site-scale richness of these foraging guilds. Conclusions The response of species richness to landscape characteristics varies among scales, and among components of diversity. Thus, depending on the scale at which a biodiversity conservation goal is conceptualised-maximising richness at a site, or across a landscape-different landscape management approaches may be preferred.

Reside, April E.; Vanderwal, Jeremy; Garnett, Stephen T.; Kutt, Alex S.				Austral Ecology	41	1		106-116	Feb 2016	2016				English	4	68	Assessments of species vulnerability to climate change should increase the effectiveness of interventions in the current decline in biodiversity. Species vulnerability to climate change is a consequence of their sensitivity and adaptive capacity, in combination with their exposure to climate change. We apply a vulnerability assessment framework to 243 bird species inhabiting the tropical savannas of northern Australia. We build on previous vulnerability studies by including detailed data for variables relating to species sensitivity to change (relative abundance, clutch size, sensitivity to fire and distribution area), species adaptive capacity (movement behaviour and dietary breadth) and proportional changes predicted for their geographic range (i.e. exposure to climate change). These are integrated to provide a ranking of vulnerability. Our analysis found that birds of Australian tropical savannas cluster together with high sensitivity, with a few wide-ranging increasing species with very low sensitivity. Australian tropical savanna birds have a range of adaptive capacities, and the impact of climate change on these species is predicted to be substantial. Two already endangered species are among the most vulnerable. Species largely restricted to Cape York Peninsula (a geographically distinct region) had the greatest overall vulnerability; these species were, in general, sensitive due to small distributions, sensitivity to fire frequency and had a lower capacity for dispersal. It will be important for the future of Australian tropical savanna birds to mitigate ecological threats and maintain extensive areas of suitable habitat to facilitate species dispersal.

Rose, Eli T.; Simons, Theodore R.				Condor	118	1		179-193	Feb 2016	2016				English	2	28	Fire suppression in southern Appalachian pine-oak forests during the past century dramatically altered the bird community. Fire return intervals decreased, resulting in local extirpation or population declines of many bird species adapted to post-fire plant communities. Within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, declines have been strongest for birds inhabiting xeric pine-oak forests that depend on frequent fire. The buildup of fuels after decades of fire suppression led to changes in the 1996 Great Smoky Mountains Fire Management Plan. Although fire return intervals remain well below historic levels, management changes have helped increase the amount of fire within the park over the past 20 years, providing an opportunity to study patterns of fire severity, time since burn, and bird occurrence. We combined avian point counts in burned and unburned areas with remote sensing indices of fire severity to infer temporal changes in bird occurrence for up to 28 years following fire. Using hierarchical linear models that account for the possibility of a species presence at a site when no individuals are detected, we developed occurrence models for 24 species: 13 occurred more frequently in burned areas, 2 occurred less frequently, and 9 showed no significant difference between burned and unburned areas. Within burned areas, the top models for each species included fire severity, time since burn, or both, suggesting that fire influenced patterns of species occurrence for all 24 species. Our findings suggest that no single fire management strategy will suit all species. To capture peak occupancy for the entire bird community within xeric pine-oak forests, at least 3 fire regimes may be necessary; one applying frequent low severity fire, another using infrequent low severity fire, and a third using infrequently applied high severity fire.

Aebischer, Nicholas J.; Bailey, Chris M.; Gibbons, David W.; Morris, Antony J.; Peach, Will J.; Stoate, Chris				Bird Study	63	1		10-30	Jan 2 2016	2016				English	5	54	Capsule At two demonstration farms, Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust's Loddington Farm in Leicestershire and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds's Hope Farm in Cambridgeshire, targeted management led to much faster increases in avian abundance than in the surrounding regions. Aims To compare changes in avian abundance at Loddington Farm since 1992 and Hope Farm since 2000, and relate these to regional trends in bird abundance and to the habitat and predator management conducted at the two sites. Methods Loddington Farm is a mixed arable 292-ha farm in a partially wooded landscape in Leicestershire. It was managed as a shoot from 1993 to 2002, combining habitat management with predator control (stopped in 2002) and winter grain provision (ceased in 2006). Hope Farm comprises a 181-ha mainly arable farm in an open landscape in Cambridgeshire, where habitat management for farmland birds has taken place since 2002. At both sites, breeding bird abundance has been monitored annually. Information on farm management was translated into three variables measuring annual provision of nesting cover, summer food and winter food. The number of Carrion Crow and Magpie territories was used as an index of predator abundance. Results Avian abundance increased at both farms much faster than within their respective regions. Recovery of priority species was positively correlated with the provision of summer foraging habitats and negatively correlated with the provision of supplementary grain during winter. The latter finding was counterintuitive and may reflect an increase in hedgerow provision that coincided with the cessation of grain provision at both farms. The increase in bird abundance was not sustained at Loddington Farm in the absence of predator control, although it was at Hope Farm where predator densities were markedly lower. Conclusion The data from Hope Farm suggest that where predator densities are relatively low (<3 Crow + Magpie pairs/km2 locally, <0.2 Foxes/km2 in spring regionally), recovery of farmland birds can be achieved through habitat management alone. Where predator densities are high (>5 corvid pairs/km2 and >1.1 foxes/km2), as at Loddington Farm, species recovery, particularly of open-cup nesting species, may require predator control as well as habitat management. Further study is needed to confirm this tentative conclusion from only two sites.

In the EU-Special Protection Area "Hellwegborde", several contractual nature conservation measures have been offered to improve habitat for farmland birds since 2001. For wintering birds, these include set asides, overwinter stubbles and small areas of uncropped winter wheat. Aim of this study is to investigate the effects of these measures on wintering farmland birds by comparing bird abundance associated with these measures to abundance on conventionally farmed field types. We also included catch crops, since these count as ecological priority areas within the greening of the common agricultural policy, but little is known about the significance of catch crops for wintering birds. We used two methods to estimate bird abundances; line transects counts on single study plots that were covered by foot (mean size 0.4 - 1.6 ha) and surveys of one large sample area (2,481 ha) covered by car to acquire data on larger, less abundant bird species (birds of prey and corvids) as well. The transect counts on single plots revealed that uncropped winter wheat, as well as set asides and cereal stubbles, supported the highest densities of various farmland bird species (especially seed eating passerines), while winter cereals held only low bird densities. Conventional catch crops (Sinapis) were used by a high number of species, but only one species (Meadow Pipit) reached a higher abundance on catch crops in comparison to other field types. The large-scale surveys by car confirmed the relatively low value of the by far most prevalent field types, winter cereals, rape and catch crops in contrast to the high value of less prevalent field types, especially of unmown set asides and grassland for wintering farmland birds. A comparison of land use in the study area from 2003 to 2016 showed that contractual conservation and ecological priority areas did not increase the surface area of habitat elements essential for farmland birds, like set asides or stubble fields. These field types constituted less than five percent of the area in 2016, whereas cultivation of catch crops increased considerably from 2009 to 2016. To obtain a sufficiently high proportion of appropriate habitat to stabilize farmland bird populations, increased efforts are necessary. These include adjustments within the framework of agri-environmental schemes and ecological priority areas with special regard to the efficiency of those, consultation of farmers and relevant authorities of conservation and agriculture, as well as expansion of organic farming.

Numbers of Marsh Harriers reached a maximum of 41 pairs in 1993 followed by a decrease to 17 breeding pairs in 1998. In 2014, 40 breeding pairs were counted. Montagu's Harriers peaked with 17 breeding pairs in 1975 and then decreased to two pairs in 1998. In 2014 there were 13 breeding pairs. Hen Harriers did not breed in the area continuously: two pairs in 1993, none in 1998 and one pair in 2014. Numbers of breeding pairs as well as breeding success were high in all three species in 2014 because common voles Microtus arvalis, the main prey, were numerous. Illegal persecution is suspected as a main cause for the declines up to 1998, especially for the Marsh Harrier. In 2014 there was no indication of persecution in the core areas of the distribution of the species during the breeding season. Disturbances are described and discussed. There was no indication that predators caused breeding failures, even though some Harrier pairs bred within view of successful Eagle Owl Bubo bubo nests. The only problems were nest destruction by mowing (four cases) and hunting activities in reed beds which prevented successful breeding. The use of protected reed beds is an illegal activity.

Remocion de matorrales semi-aridos en Magallanes: efectos sobre la composicion, estructura y rasgos funcionales de los ensambles de Aves.	Kusch, Alejandro; Vidal, Osvaldo; Marcos Henriquez, Juan				Anales del Instituto de la Patagonia	44	2		35-48	2016	2016				Spanish	1	1	Mechanical removal of shrublands is a recent management practice adopted in the semi-arid steppes of Magallanes. This involves partially removing the shrub cover in strips, in order to improve the access of sheep and facilitate the production of forage biomass. Although this procedure affects thousands of hectares, very little is known about the ecological effects that could determine changes in the vegetation and associated fauna. We studied the integrated effect of the motorized control of Romerillo (Chilliotrichum diffusum (G. Fort.) Kuntze) shrubland on composition, structure and functional diversity, by comparing different removal intensities: a) without shrub removal, b) intermediate removal, c) high removal of shrub coverage. We evaluated plant diversity by means of intercept-point transects, and bird abundance using point station census. The information was analyzed with univariate (KruskalWallis), and multivariate procedures (e. g. MRPP, Indval, RLQ, Fourth-Corner), in order to correlate habitat structure with the composition and functional traits of bird assemblages. Bird abundance and species richness decreased significantly when shrub removal was high, but not in the case of intermediate removal. We found species-specific responses, associated with all treatments, and loss of bird assemblage identity, after shrub removal. Four species were detected as indicators of natural shrublands (Austral Canastero, Patagonian Sierra Finch, House Wren, Austral Thrush), while only one was associated with removal (Correndera Pipit). Insectivore birds, Neotropical migrants and foliage nesting birds were positively associated with Romerillo coverage, while omnivores, ground nesting, ground feeders and resident birds were associated with graminoids plants when shrubs were removed. Romerillo shrubs seem to provide a key structure for a positive association with the functional traits of specialist birds, in contrast with removed shrub sites, where abundance of other open land specialists were greater.

Caprio, Enrico; Chamberlain, Dan; Rolando, Antonio				Bird Study	63	4		470-478	2016	2016				English	1	9	Capsule: Restoration of grasslands on ski-pistes caused a recovery in the bird community, but not to the extent that it was equivalent to a natural Alpine grassland community.Aim: To test whether revegetation of ski-pistes in open habitat areas results in bird community recovery.Methods: The bird communities in two ski resorts in the Italian Maritime Alps were surveyed using a standardized area count method in three different plot types: non-restored ski-pistes (newly constructed), restored ski-pistes and control plots in grassland far from ski-pistes.Results: In 49 independent plots, 32 species were recorded. Species richness and abundance of birds were significantly higher on restored than on non-restored ski-pistes, independently of the species group considered and the analyses carried out. Bird community parameters of restored ski-pistes were still lower than those of natural grassland, as shown by results of typical grassland species.Conclusion: Our results suggest that an apparently successful restoration of ski-pistes may be not enough to promote a complete recovery of bird communities. The complete recovery of local bird communities may be promoted only if an integral recovery of the original vegetal communities is achieved. We suggest the best conservation option is to adopt techniques to maintain as far as possible original grassland if construction of new ski-pistes is unavoidable.

Icelandic Agricultural Sciences	29			21-37	2016	2016				English	3	20	Degradation of ecosystems and introductions of invasive species pose a threat to global biodiversity. Ecosystem restoration and revegetation actions are important for amending habitat loss and for the protection of species of plants and animals. Iceland has the highest rate of soil erosion and desertification in Northern Europe and counteractions to erosion and revegetation measures have taken place for over a century. We studied the effect of revegetation on the density and composition of birds and invertebrate abundance in 26 survey areas comparing: a) unvegetated eroded areas, b) native heathlands restored on eroded land, and c) revegetation by the introduced and exotic Nootka lupin (Lupinus nootkatensis) on eroded land. Birds were counted on transects and invertebrates sampled with a sweep net. Both revegetation methods greatly increased the abundance of birds. The highest total numbers of invertebrates and birds were recorded on land revegetated with Nootka lupin. On average 31 birds km-2 were recorded on barren land, 337 on heathland and 627 in Nootka lupin. Bird species composition differed between the two revegetation methods. Restored heathland provided habitat for waders of internationally decreasing populations, whereas Nootka lupin stands harboured more common bird species. Golden Plover (Pluvialis apricaria) and Dunlin (Calidris alpina) were most common on restored heathland, while Snipe (Gallinago gallinago) and Meadow Pipit (Anthus pratensis) were most common in Nootka lupine. The abundance of birds was positively correlated with that of invertebrates. The abundance of different bird species differed by successional stage in each habitat. The study showed the generally positive effects of revegetation on animal biodiversity and also how different revegetation methods produce different trajectories of ecosystem development.

Meltofte, Hans; Clausen, Preben				Dansk Ornitologisk Forenings Tidsskrift	110	1		1-72	2016	2016				English	0	1	Numbers of staging as well as breeding waterbirds on Tipperne Reserve in west Jutland have been monitored since 1928. This has resulted in one of the world's longest time series for analyses of bird abundance and trends in relation to changes in the environmental conditions and the total flyway-populations. The occurrence of staging waders (shorebirds in American English) up to 1982 has been reviewed previously. In this paper we update these results up to 2014 with focus on numerical changes in the Reserve and in the flyway populations in general. During the first decades, the counts of staging birds in the Reserve were not very systematic. The observers recorded the numbers of waterbirds daily or at intervals of a few days. From 1973, however, censuses were organized by well-defined routines, which from 1978 focused on a census of birds in the entire Reserve once in every running five-day period year round. Since that time activities have been cut back several times: in 1998 counts in the winter months from December to February ended; from 2002 censuses were reduced to three per month in spring and two per month of autumn; and from 2012 censuses were further reduced to two per month even in spring. Data are presented in three ways. Changes during the entire study period 1929-2014 are shown as running nine-year medians of maximum numbers recorded within selected periods during spring and autumn migration. For the more systematically covered period 1973-2014, we have calculated bird-days for the same periods during spring and autumn migration and analysed trends in these using polynomial regression. Finally, we present phenological graphs where we compare the occurrences during the first 15 years of the systematically covered period with the last 15 years and the entire 1973-2014 period. The conditions for the birds in the Reserve are largely determined by regulation of the water level in the fjord by a sluice at Hvide Sande and by discharge of sediment and nutrients from the surrounding area, i.e. predominantly from the river Skjern A. Conditions are also influenced by management of the lands of the Reserve by grazing and mowing meadows and reed beds. The most notable changes in the occurrence of waders in the Reserve are associated with the draining of the Skjern [Angstrom] delta in the middle of the 1960s, which considerably increased sediment discharge. At the same time, discharge of nutrients also increased sharply due to increased use of fertilizers in agriculture in the catchment area of the rivers. This led to highly increased densities of benthic invertebrates on the shallow flats and strongly increasing numbers of waders that prefer muddy sediments such as Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago, Spotted Redshank Tringa erythropus, Common Greenshank Tringa nebularia and Common Redshank Tringa totanus. This is in marked contrast to the 'collapse' of the occurrence of herbivorous waterfowl that happened in the fjord around 1979 as a result of plant death caused by algal blooms. The main exception to generally positive long-term trends among waders on Tipperne was declining numbers of Bar-tailed Godwits Limosa lapponica up to around 1990. The reason for this may be a combination of higher water levels, reed and other plant overgrowth of the highest-lying flats, and depletion of ragworm stocks due to arrival of larger numbers of godwits and other waders early in the season. A decline in mowing and grazing of the Tipperne meadows from the late 1950s to the 1970s led to the meadows becoming overgrown resulting in reduced numbers of staging Eurasian Golden Plovers Pluvialis apricaria and Northern Lapwings Vanellus vanellus. With resumption of management of the meadows, numbers of these species recovered. Likewise, Common Snipes benefited from extensive mowing of reed beds etc. in the 1970s and 1980s. The picture becomes less positive for a number of species when we consider the short-term changes (15 years). This applies primarily to a number of breeding species which peaked with extremely large breeding populations during the early 1990s, but whose numbers have since fallen to much lower levels primarily due to increased predation. Furthermore, for a number of species, the greatly reduced census frequency since 2002 has reduced the chances to 'catch' the often narrow peaks in staging numbers, which are typical for wader migration. Decreasing benthos densities since the 1990s as a result of reduced eutrophication may also have contributed to this decline. There are few changes on Tipperne that can be related to the trends in the total flyway populations. The main reason is undoubtedly that bird numbers in a relatively small area like Tipperne are determined more by local conditions than by changes in the overall population sizes, which also often are very uncertain. We have therefore undertaken a critical review of the entries in the latest authoritative overviews from Wetlands International. Unfortunately, for the waders the results are often a plethora of conflicting statements based on partly different time periods. Our critical review suggests that while a number of the breeding 'meadow birds' in temperate western Europe have declined quite considerably (especially Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa and Ruff Calidris pugnax) due to agricultural intensification, most Arctic and boreal wader populations are thriving. Hence, among the 29 distinct wader populations considered here (predominantly on the East Atlantic flyway), 18-19 populations are either stable, possibly stable, fluctuating or increasing, while only four can definitely be said to be decreasing, and a further 6-7 possibly are decreasing. An indication of improved conditions for waders is that a number of species now arrive several weeks earlier in spring than they did 80 years ago and a few also begin egg laying earlier. This is probably a result of milder winters and springs and thus earlier availability of benthic invertebrates on shallow flats, which makes it possible for the birds to move to an area like Denmark much earlier than in the past. The few species whose numerical changes on Tipperne may at least partly be related to changes at the flyway level are Pied Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta, Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola, Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata and Curlew Sandpiper Calidris ferruginea in particular. The populations of the first three species were probably greatly reduced during the 19th and 20th centuries due to hunting and trapping either on the breeding grounds or along the flyway or both but have since recovered as a result of improved protection. In summary, our critical analysis of the wader population trends in focus here suggests that the often stated widespread population declines are hardly as general as postulated. This includes that we question the validity of the listing of Eurasian Curlew and maybe even Northern Lapwing as Near Threatened on IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species. Our recommendation is that we focus conservation efforts on the species and populations which have well-documented problems such as European farmland birds and especially waterbirds in East Asia, many of which have serious problems due to wetland reclamation, hunting and trapping.

In the Brazilian steppe savanna, this situation requires attention because habitats with higher economic value are underrepresented by the protected area system. Between 2009 and 2010, we surveyed 60 sites with differing landscapes such as plateaus, slopes, and lowlands in the Serra de Santana. At each site, we applied standardized bird survey methods and compared the observed and projected richness of each landscape. We recorded 189 species, with the highest species richness in the slope habitat, followed by plateaus, and then lowlands. In the slope habitat, there were more forest-dependent species, as well as more species with high and medium sensitivity to disturbance. Endemic species with high and medium sensitivity to disturbances were restricted to slopes and some fragments of the plateaus. Our results show that the region is an important area due to the high bird species richness and presence of endemic and threatened species. The slope areas were the richest due to more recent human occupation. As priority measures for Serra de Santana, we suggest the control of deforestation and the designation of a protected area that encompasses all the altitudinal variation in the region.

Serong, Merrilyn; Lill, Alan				Avian Biology Research	9	3		174-194	2016	2016				English	1	9	Some bird species cannot persist during early secondary succession after natural or anthropogenic disturbance of Australian Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forest, whilst others remain abundant throughout regeneration. To conserve bird species diversity optimally in such forests, we need to know, inter alia, exactly why the latter species can persist after disturbance. Using a chronosequence approach, we documented four facets of foraging in a suite of these persistent species effectively covering 100 years of succession in E. regnans forest disturbed by wildfire or timber harvesting, namely the foraging strata, locations, substrates and behaviours used. Most species showed plasticity in their use of foraging strata and locations during succession, but four exhibited some limited stereotypy in these facets. In contrast, use of foraging substrates and behaviours was largely invariant within species during secondary succession. We suggest that switching foraging strata and locations was probably critical to persistence of most of these bird species during secondary succession, given the marked variation in structural and floristic variables that characterises this regeneration process. Some plasticity in foraging behaviour repertoire and substrate use was probably possible, but not beneficial. Although some resident bird species' populations were severely reduced by disturbance in these forests, a substantial subset of species was sufficiently flexible in choosing foraging microhabitats to persist throughout secondary succession at pre-disturbance abundances.

Aribal, Lowell G.; Toledo-Bruno, Angela G.; Jumawid, Erne Cliff P.				AES Bioflux	8	2		157-164	2016	2016				English	0	0	Ficus is one of the most important plant groups in the tropical rainforest ecosystems chiefly considered as a major food source for frugivores. Ficus is the fifth most speciose genus in the Philippines comprising 104 species. In this paper, we emphasized the trophic relationship of the Ficus spp. and frugivores including the observed association with other plant species. The study was conducted in the three forest reserves of Central Mindanao University in Musuan, Bukidnon, Philippines. Ficus spp. were surveyed along the established grids. On every Ficus spp., a 10-meter circular plot was delineated. All plants within the plot were identified. Mist nets were established on Ficus spp. bearing ripe synconia to sample the frugivores. Results revealed twelve (12) species of Ficus within the forest reserves. Ficus balete was found to be the most abundant and widely distributed while F. crassiramea was the most visited by frugivores. Avian species under the family Sturnidae and Pynonotidae were frequently observed feeding on synconia. For volant mammals, only the species under Family Pteropodidae were recorded. The plant species found constantly associated to all surveyed Ficus spp. were Baccaurea tetrandra, Senna spectabilis, Melanolepis multiglandulosa and Myristica glomerata suggesting trophic preference by frugivores, hence their association and dispersal. In general, the number of frugivore species and Ficus spp. diversity is seemingly correlated as observed from the number of caught frugivores and the number of Ficus spp. recorded.

Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) are cooperative breeders that have specific reproductive habitat needs. We examined three separate sites in the southeastern United States to see how life history traits differed among isolated populations of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers from 1980 to 2013. We examined the life history traits group size, partial brood loss, number of fledglings, lay date, clutch size, and lifespan. Traits differed among sites, suggesting that populations were adapted to local conditions and different life history trade-offs were important under different environmental conditions at each site. At the two coastal sites in Florida and North Carolina, the family group sizes, lifespans, and partial brood loss were higher when compared to the inland site in North Carolina. Clutch size and number fledged were higher at the two northernmost sites when compared to the southern site. Identifying the differences in life history traits can allow more specific and effective management practices.

Brambilla, Mattia; Pedrini, Paolo				Ornis Fennica	93	2		88-99	2016	2016				English	0	8	We investigated habitat drivers of occurrence of five common forest bird species (Erithacus rubecula, Phylloscopus collybita, Sylvia atricapilla, Periparus ater, Fringilla coelebs) at the uppermargin of their range in the Alps. Our work aimed to i) identify methods to analyse species-habitat relationships at the margin of species distribution, ii) provide recommendations for conservation and management in this changing environment. We recorded species occurrence at 149 points in Trento province (Italy; 1,365-2,200 m a.s.l.), and related occurrence to elevation and cover of habitats in a 100-m radius. We estimated factors affecting occurrence by single-species and multi-response MARS models. We also evaluated factors driving the overall species richness at point counts by means of a glmmPQL approach. Multi-response models performed well (in general they performed better than single-species models) and suggested important effects of elevation (negative), conifer forest (not significant for P. collybita, positive up to a threshold for other species) and wood pasture (not significant for S. atricapilla, positive for other species). Conifer forest, wood pastures, shrubland and elevation affected the number of species at point counts (positive effect for all variables except for elevation). Multi-responsemodels may help elucidate ecological relationships for 'rare' species, including common species at the margin of their range. Wood pasture promoted the occurrence of common forest species and the number of species, even if scarcely represented, and thus could deserve more consideration in conservation and management planning, given that several species are of high conservation concern.

Araujo Santos Junior, Paulo Cesar; Marques, Fernanda Cristina; Lima, Marcos Robalinho; dos Anjos, Luiz				Natureza & Conservacao	14	1		1-7	Jan 2016	2016				English	0	14	In this study, we tested the potential of restored areas to maintain biodiversity in the scope of a recently proposed category of protected area called "Restoration Reserves". To accomplish this, we compared bird richness and functional group structure of two small forest fragments (<250 ha) with adjacent recently reforested areas (9 and 7 years of reforestation). Reforested areas had equal or higher bird richness and similar functional group structure. These results indicate that reforested areas are capable of maintaining current levels of biodiversity and reducing species extinction debt in small forest fragments, which is the main purpose of "Restoration Reserves". However, when we compared a large forest fragment with an old adjacent reforested area (20 years of reforestation), we found that it was of limited value for certain functional groups. Therefore, "Restoration Reserves" could provide essential additional habitat in highly fragmented landscapes that consists mainly of small forest fragments.

Berkut	25	1		27-39	2016	2016				Russian	0	0	In the course of long-term observations at the southern edge of the range (Kharkiv region, East Ukraine) in 1989-1995, 1997-2002, 2009, 2012-2013, and 2015 the social groups of the species were revealed, absolute and relative population density assessed. Beginning from late February and until the second ten-day of September the social structure of the Common Crane is represented in the study area by the following groups. I. Territorial pairs, arriving at the breeding grounds earlier that the other cranes, in the period between 26 February and 8 March in different seasons during the 10-year survey period. This group was heterogeneous and consisted of adult breeding birds (successfully breeding pairs with chicks left nesting sites only in the third five-day period of August and joined pre-migration aggregations) and active territorial birds, who built nests and protected the nesting site, but did not breed; they had adult plumage and probably arrived at the breeding grounds almost simultaneously with the breeding pairs. According to absolute estimate (the search of all nests) in 9 seasons, average proportions of these social groups were 68.6 and 31.4%, respectively. Relative population density in the last ten-day of March through 10July in 1990-1991 averaged, respectively, 0.94 and 0.46 ind./km2. These groups formed 70.7% of entire crane population; relative density of all social groups in April and May was 1.98 ind./km2. II. Groups (observed only once, on 9.03.1990) and, apparently, pairs and single spring migrants (in March); they stayed in open landscapes of floodplain. III. Groups of cranes that stayed in the area in summer (spring), observed from the second or third five-day of April till late May and never seen in June. They consisted of adult birds in worn plumage and yearlings. In 1990-1991, the groups of cranes staying in summer averaged 20.3 [plus or minus] 3.1 individuals (23 encounters) and accounted for 29.3% of all cranes in the vicinity of the field station (excluding spring migrants) in the period between the arrival dates and early June. Their relative density in April and May in the open landscapes of floodplain was 0.58 ind./km2. IV. The birds of pre-migration aggregations; they appeared from time to time in different years in the second or third ten-day periods of July. Starting from the end of the first and the beginning of the second ten-day periods of August the aggregations became stable in the roosting sites and existed until the beginning of the second tenday period of September, when all local cranes left the area. The state of habitats and abundance of the Common Crane on Izyum Luka considerably differ now from the << basic level >> of 1989-1991 due to the following reasons. 1. Water supply of formerly waterlogged alder groves (principal nesting habitat of cranes) has greatly deteriorated over the last decades due to fires and timber logging, gradual decrease of the level of surface waters, shrinkage (by more than 27%) of the area of planted pine forests on the first terrace above the floodplain, and climate warming. Large areas of alder forests have dried up, whereas the deeper parts of the shallows became available for nesting cranes, which caused great decline of the nesting sites and their re-distribution. 2. These processes were accompanied by colonization of the crane nesting sites by Beavers; they occupied 12 (27.3%) out of 44 nesting sites surveyed in three seasons (2012, 2013, and 2015). Beavers destroyed marginal vegetation around alder groves, thus preventing cranes from using former nesting sites. 3. Acclimatization of the Sika Deer in the Izyum forestry resulted in overpopulation of crane nesting sites with ungulates. The numbers of Raccoon Dogs introduced in Poltava and Dnipropetrovsk regions considerably increased in the study area by the 2000s; the Wolf and Elk became extinct there by 2000; the minimum number of Graylag Geese was recorded in 2001; no nests of the species were found there in subsequent years.

On the whole, these factors are the same as in the West Siberian and Central-Yakutsk plains, although there are some differences. Namely, only West Siberia is characterized by the communities living on upper swamps and low-inundated meadows in combination with the lowland swamps. In Central Siberia forest ornithocomplexes are the most diverse, mainly at the expense of the communities living in open forests and post-fire areas at different stages of regeneration. The ekoton ornithokomplex type was distinguished only for Central Yakutiya. In North Ural, forest cover percent and tree species composition are still significant for the formation of ornithocomplexes, but the impact of high-altitude zonation and the productivity of biocenoses and developing of shrubs in the habitats connected with it are also becoming important.

Trudy Karelskogo Nauchnogo Centra Rossiiskoi Akademii Nauk	1			21-44	2016	2016				Russian	0	0	Major trends have been identified in the alteration of the avifauna under the effect of old agrarian land use in boreal parts of Northwest Russia. The structure of habitats in a northern mosaic agrolandscape typical of the household-based agriculture era, includes open farmland, small villages, wooded pastures/corridors, secondary forests after slash-and-burn clearing, and forests replacing old arable land. The bird population composition is the most specific in open farmland and small villages, where the prevalent aspect is the 'follower' bird species associated with pastures, meadows and residential areas, originating from Neolithic agrarian civilizations of Western Asia and Near East, as well as medieval centres of horticulture in European forest-steppe regions. In the past, habitats in the periphery of a mosaic agrolandscape - wooded pastures and slash-and-burn forests, used to occupy 1.5-2 times as much space as open cultivated farmland or even more. Their contribution to the total effect of agrarian land use in boreal regions on avifauna transformation was the most significant. Logically, man-induced transformation of natural habitats by traditional agriculture affected primarily the fauna and population of forest-dwelling birds. A positive effect of slash-and-burn agriculture on the occurrence and abundance of birds has been observed for 40 species showing preference for early stages of forest succession and for boreonemoral communities. At the same time, the abundance of 19 native boreal species which prefer old-growth coniferous forest has declined considerably, sometimes up to extinction from wooded corridors. Wooded corridors and forests after slash-and-burn clearing, which occupy a substantial share of the present-day forest fund structure, still play an essential role in the current general fauna-shaping process in boreal regions of Northwest Russia.

Camprodon, Jordi; Faus, Jordi; Salvanya, Pep; Soler-Zurita, Jaume; Luis Romero, Jose				Acta Ornithologica (Warsaw)	50	2		157-169	Win 2015	2015				English	3	27	Monocultures of even-aged trees in short rotation are a forest system of low ecological complexity that has been described as unsuitable for the establishment of stable populations of forest birds. However, key habitat quality cues could make them attractive to forest specialists. This paper assesses the suitability of poplar plantations in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula for a forest specialist, the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor. Poplar stands occupy a small area of an agroforestry mosaic landscape where semi-natural Mediterranean woodland is predominant. Population size, nesting success, home ranges and habitat selection were studied by radio-tracking and monitoring during the breeding season and the winter. Poplar plantations were preferentially selected for breeding and foraging in the spring and the winter. Home ranges in the breeding season and the winter (32.4 and 438.5 ha, respectively) were similar to those observed in semi-natural woodlands that have been studied in Europe. However, population density (0.25 territories/100 ha) was lower than that described in most European semi-natural woodlands. Nesting success was low (0.54), due to strong competition with other cavity nesters, predation of nests by the Greater Spotted Woodpecker, and loss of one of the adults. Fifty per cent of the foraging activity during the breeding season took place in an area of 180 metres around the nest. The amount of standing dead wood in poplar stands was much higher than in the surrounding habitats and source areas. The moderate breeding success and the high rate of adult predation may suggest that poplar plantations act as an ecological trap, in which standing dead wood may be a habitat quality cue that attracts birds to this non-ideal habitat. Poplar plantations become even less suitable when most of the available habitat is felled at the same time. Suitable planning of poplar plantation rotations and recovery of riparian forest is the best way to ensure the survival of Lesser Spotted Woodpecker populations in the long term.

Mag, Zs.; Odor, P.				Community Ecology	16	2		156-166	Dec 2015	2015				English	0	18	The effects of stand structure, tree species composition, proportion of habitat types and land use history on breeding bird assemblages in temperate mixed forests in Western Hungary were studied. The species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole breeding bird assemblage and of some groups formed on the basis of nesting site and rarity were examined. Stand structural variables had the highest impact on the breeding bird assemblage, while tree species composition, the varying proportion of vegetation types and land use history had no significant effect. In the case of the species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole assemblage, the most important variables were the mean diameter of trees, the vegetation cover of the forest floor and the dead wood volume. The explained variance in the linear models of different groups varied between 20% and 60%, and the relative importance of these three variables also differed considerably. These results indicate that forest management may considerably influence the diversity and the composition of birds, as all the structural elements affecting birds deeply depend on it. Within the shelterwood management system, the elongation of the rotation and regeneration periods, and the relatively high proportion of retention tree groups after harvest could contribute to the conservation of forest birds. Our results also showed that for the forest bird communities, both the prevalence of big trees and the presence of a dense understory layer are important. Management regimes which apply continuous forest cover might be more appropriate for providing these structural elements simultaneously on small spatial scales, and for the maintenance of a more diverse bird community, thus healthier forest ecosystems.

Bell, David; Hjalten, Joakim; Nilsson, Christer; Jorgensen, Dolly; Johansson, Therese				ECOSPHERE	6	12		278	Dec 2015	2015				English	3	50	Umbrella species are often spatially demanding and have limited ability to adapt to environmental changes induced by human land-use. This makes them vulnerable to human encroachment. In Sweden, broadleaved trees are disadvantaged by forestry, and commercially managed forests are often deprived of dead wood. This has led to a situation where previously widespread top predators in saproxylic food webs, such as the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos), have become species of conservation concern. The white-backed woodpecker is generally considered an umbrella species, and it has been linked to forests with large volumes of dead wood from broadleaved trees. In recent years, forest stands have been restored for the white-backed woodpecker, but post-treatment evaluations have rarely included other species that also occur in broad-leaved forests (co-occurring species). Many co-occurring species are saproxylic beetles. In this study, we collected saproxylic beetles and environmental data in restored and commercially managed forests to evaluate if habitat restoration for the white-backed woodpecker also benefited other species with similar habitat associations. We found that volumes of coarse woody debris were higher in restored than in commercially managed forests, and that a majority of man-made snags and downed logs were created from birch trees (Betula spp.). Most spruce trees (Picea abies) were extracted during forest restoration, and this opened up the forest canopy, and created stands dominated by broadleaved trees. Many saproxylic beetles were more common in restored forests, and there were significant differences in species composition between treatments. These differences were largely explained by species traits. Effects of sun-exposure were particularly important, but many beneficiary species were also linked to dead wood from broadleaved trees. Red-listed saproxylic beetles showed a similar pattern with more species and individuals in restored sites. The white-backed woodpecker is still critically endangered in Sweden, but important prey species are already responding to forest restoration at the stand level. We recognize that landscape-level improvements will be required to bring the white-backed woodpecker back, but also that the umbrella species concept can provide a useful framework for successful forest restoration as many co-occurring saproxylic beetle species seemingly benefitted from restoration for the white-backed woodpecker.

Hartmann, Stefanie A.; Segelbacher, Gernot; Juina, Mery E.; Schaefer, H. Martin				Biological Conservation	192			154-160	Dec 2015	2015				English	1	29	Time and financial constraints often force conservationists to make ad hoc management decisions without sufficient knowledge to predict their effects. In particular, the effects of management on reproduction and survival are rarely evaluated and habitat dynamics are rarely taken into account. We evaluated the effects of three different forms of habitat alteration on the endangered Pale-headed Brushfinch (Atlapetes pallidiceps) in Ecuador during the phases of population increase and stabilization. More specifically, we monitored the effect of a natural experiment with three approaches (clearing, grazing and burning) to preserve the semi-open habitat of this species on the reproductive success of 220 breeding events over seven years and on the survival of 73 adults over three consecutive years. Habitat alteration had contrasting effects on reproduction and survival. All approaches increased the number of fledged chicks per breeding event while the population stabilized, but not while it increased. However, vegetation burning reduced survival probability of adult individuals. In addition, survival was strongly correlated to the presence of water in the territories. Overall, we revealed that the negative effects of vegetation burning on survival overrode the positive effects on reproduction, and could if implemented at a larger scale destroy the conservation aim of increasing the population size. Importantly, we show that the effectiveness of management differs depending on the actual population trend. Our study therefore shows that the a posteriori evaluation of ad hoc vegetation control can constitute an integral part of adaptive management and thereby also of long-term conservation planning of endangered species.

From this perspective, this study aimed to do an inventory of and analyze the assembly of birds of prey (Cathartiformes, Accipitriformes, Strigiformes, and Falconiformes) in the Perobas Biological Reserve, a conservation area of 8,716 ha, which represents one of the last remnants with signiicant extent of semideciduous seasonal forest in Parana. The counting method by fixed sites, as well as hearing sites and playback, was used to sample the bird of prey species in the reserve, from June 2009 to January 2012, with a total sampling effort of 210 h. Altogether 25 raptor species were surveyed, a value corresponding to 37% of the species richness known for Parana. Among the records, 3 species are worth highlighting, Spizaetus melanoleucus, Asio flammeus, and Strix virgata, listed in the current Red Book of Endangered Fauna in Parana and poorly documented in the region. About 70% of the observed species have habits associated with forest environments, while 30% are associated with open areas, such as pastures and farmland surrounding the forest. These results reaffirm the importance of this reserve for the conservation and preservation of many bird species, especially those rare and regionally endangered.

Fork, Susanne; Woolfolk, Andrea; Akhavan, Antonia; Van Dyke, Eric; Murphy, Shirley; Candilor, Bree; Newberry, Todd; Schreibman, Sondra; Salisbury, Joshua; Wasson, Kerstin				Ecological Applications	25	8		2306-2319	Dec 2015	2015				English	8	83	Woodlands comprised of planted, nonnative trees are increasing in extent globally, while native woodlands continue to decline due to human activities. The ecological impacts of planted woodlands may include changes to the communities of understory plants and animals found among these nonnative trees relative to native woodlands, as well as invasion of adjacent habitat areas through spread beyond the originally planted areas. Eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp.) are among the most widely planted trees worldwide, and are very common in California, USA. The goals of our investigation were to compare the biological communities of nonnative eucalypt woodlands to native oak woodlands in coastal central California, and to examine whether planted eucalypt groves have increased in size over the past decades. We assessed site and habitat attributes and characterized biological communities using understory plant, ground-dwelling arthropod, amphibian, and bird communities as indicators. Degree of difference between native and nonnative woodlands depended on the indicator used. Eucalypts had significantly greater canopy height and cover, and significantly lower cover by perennial plants and species richness of arthropods than oaks. Community composition of arthropods also differed significantly between eucalypts and oaks. Eucalypts had marginally significantly deeper litter depth, lower abundance of native plants with ranges limited to western North America, and lower abundance of amphibians. In contrast to these differences, eucalypt and oak groves had very similar bird community composition, species richness, and abundance. We found no evidence of "invasional meltdown," documenting similar abundance and richness of nonnatives in eucalypt vs. oak woodlands. Our time-series analysis revealed that planted eucalypt groves increased 271% in size, on average, over six decades, invading adjacent areas. Our results inform science-based management of California woodlands, revealing that while bird communities would probably not be affected by restoration of eucalypt to oak woodlands, such a restoration project would not only stop the spread of eucalypts into adjacent habitats but would also enhance cover by western North American native plants and perennials, enhance amphibian abundance, and increase arthropod richness.

Trathnigg, Heidi Kloeppel; Phillips, Fred O.				Ecological Restoration	33	4		395-407	Dec 1 2015	2015				English	0	7	The riparian and marsh habitats of the lower Colorado River, Yuma, Arizona have been degraded by flow regulation, agricultural development, and non-native species invasion. Degradation has caused a decline in birds and butterfly communities. To improve habitat, restoration efforts have occurred at the Yuma East Wetlands (YEW), Arizona. In this study, we evaluated the effect of on-going riparian and marsh restoration on the community characteristics of breeding birds, butterflies, and vegetation, including cover, nectar resources, and host plant abundance at the YEW. Results indicated that restored riparian sites had four-fold higher total resident bird density than control habitats; however no difference was detected in riparian bird richness. Restored marsh habitats had two-fold higher total resident bird richness than the control habitats and three-fold higher marsh bird abundance than control habitats. Butterfly species richness and abundance were higher in restored riparian sites. Butterfly richness was correlated with flowering plant richness and abundance, vegetation species diversity, and percent herbaceous plant cover. Restored riparian sites had four times more total forb richness and abundance and five times higher host plant abundance than control riparian sites. Restored marshes had higher percent herbaceous plant cover and lower percent open water than control sites. This study indicates the importance of planting diverse native grasses and herbaceous plants and shrubs in restoration projects to benefit wildlife species.

Bircak, Tomas; Reif, Jiri				Biologia (Bratislava)	70	11		1528-1536	Nov 2015	2015				English	3	24	Large areas of montane forests are commercially harvested, while some other parts remain unmanaged. These conditions provide an opportunity to study the response of bird communities to forest management. Here we focused on the effects of tree species composition and tree age on bird species richness. We counted birds in two types of montane forest (beech and mixed) replicated in three age classes (managed 55-65 years, managed 85-95 years, unmanaged over 200 years) in the Vtacnik Mountains, Slovakia. Number of bird species at individual study sites (local richness) was predicted solely by the tree age and not by the forest type. Specifically, the number of species was highest in the oldest stands, while the stands of 55-65 and 85-95 years did not differ from each other. By contrast, forest type seems important for total bird species richness (number of species recorded in all study sites of a given type) with more species recorded in mixed forests than in beech forests. The local richness seems thus limited by the amount resources available at a given site, which is highest in the oldest stands irrespective to forest type, probably due to largest amount of food, dead wood or tree cavities, being particularly suitable for habitat specialists. However, larger species pool in mixed forest, enriched by birds adapted to coniferous trees, increases the total number of species observed in this type. We thus recommend to shift the harvest to the highest possible age and to include some other tree species into parts of beech monocultures.

Since Africa's large mammal populations are restricted to protected areas, understanding how to manage parks for biological diversity is critically important to the sustainability of faunal populations into the future. To better understand the drivers of sable decline, we analyzed landscapes where herds persist in the Pretoriuskop region of Kruger - identified by GPS collar telemetry data from eight individuals in five herds remaining in this area, and compared them to landscapes where sable herds have recently disappeared. We mapped these landscapes with satellite-based spectral data on vegetation greenness and fire frequency and Carnegie Airborne Observatory LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data on 3-D vegetation structure. Within their home ranges, sable herds consistently selected areas with high fire frequency, high tree cover and low shrub cover. However, there were no consistent differences in habitat features between the home ranges of current sable herds and areas formerly supporting herds. Locally deteriorating habitat conditions were therefore not responsible for the decline in sables in this region of the park. Our study also illustrates how multi-sensor, 3-D mapping of ecosystems provides a means to assess causes and consequences of changing animal habitats over time.

Fuentes-Montemayor, Elisa; Peredo-Alvarez, Victor M.; Watts, Kevin; Park, Kirsty J.				Biodiversity and Conservation	24	12		3049-3070	Nov 2015	2015				English	2	34	Woodland, like many habitats throughout the world, has been severely affected by habitat loss and fragmentation. Woodland restoration programmes aimed at reversing habitat loss have been in place in many countries over the last 100 years. In particular, agri-environment schemes (AES) to increase the amount and quality of woodland on agricultural land have operated in Europe and Australia for decades (nearly 30 years in the United Kingdom). However, to date there has been very little assessment of their value to biodiversity. We assessed the potential benefits to biodiversity of woodlands planted during 1988-1991 under a woodland grant scheme (WGS in Scotland), according to local and landscape-level habitat characteristics. Specifically, we (1) performed a linear discriminant analysis to compare the characteristics of 24 WGS sites to those of more mature semi-natural woodlands (34 sites >60 years old), and (2) used existing information on the influence of woodland characteristics on a biologically diverse group (i.e. moths) to quantify the benefits of WGS sites to biodiversity. The creation of new WGS patches increased woodland extent and connectivity in the landscape; however, planting that took place adjacent to previously existing woodland did not usually increase connectivity. WGS sites were mainly composed by broadleaved native tree species, but non-native species were also present. In general, WGS sites had lower tree species richness, proportion of native trees, tree basal area and amount of understory, and higher tree densities and canopy cover than more mature semi-natural woodlands. Overall, WGS sites were predicted to have lower moth abundance and species richness than older semi-natural woodlands. However, the magnitude of these differences depended on the habitat specificity and dispersal abilities of different moth groups, suggesting that WGS sites are better at providing suitable resources for generalist species and for species less limited by dispersal. Our findings have important implications for the way in which current woodland creation and management schemes operate in many countries and suggest that: (1) the creation of new woodlands should focus on planting native species, (2) woodland creation schemes are likely to be more beneficial for biodiversity if certain management practices (e.g. thinning to enhance structural diversity and accelerate the transition to later successional stages) accompany the provision of these grants, and (3) spatially-targeted woodland creation would further increase the contribution of AES woodlands to enhance biodiversity.

This situation has led to a landscape mosaic consisting of dense thickets and agricultural plots. We assessed the occurrence of the Kenyan endemic riparian bird species HindesA' Babbler Turdoides hindei along three rivers in south-east Kenya. We analysed the landscape coverage within habitat circles of 220 m radius, which are occupied and unoccupied (the latter randomly selected along the rivers) by our targeted bird species. Based on these data we calculated habitat preferences and population structure of T. hindei. Our data reveal that its occurrence probability increased with coverage of thickets. Furthermore, geographic distances among local populations of T. hindei decreased with thicket coverage and vice versa. These data reveal the relevance of thicket coverage as a key factor for the occurrence of T. hindei, influencing its population structure. However, most of the thicket patches mapped along the three rivers are small and geographically isolated from each other. Further deforestation might lead to additional reduction of the population size and abundance of T. hindei, and may ultimately lead to local extinction of this, and other endangered species adapted on riparian thickets. This example underlines the need to extend nature conservation to areas being densely populated by humans-beyond prime areas of nature conservation in East Africa.

To effectively manage and protect these areas, it is important to have an understanding of the factors affecting their biodiversity. Previous research has shown that birds in tropical regions are severely affected by human-induced habitat conversion and disturbance. The effects, however, are often area and guild-specific and the underlying mechanisms are frequently unclear. In this study, we disentangle and quantify the direct and indirect effects of human population density, distance to forest edge, habitat disturbance, and vegetation structure and composition on the total abundance and species richness of birds in Kakamega Forest, Kenya. Specifically, we use structural equation modeling to develop and test path models, which reflect the potential causal relationships between the bird assemblages and the chosen explanatory factors. Relationships were tested on the overall bird community and on five different guilds, classified according to birds' forest specialization and feeding preferences (i.e. forest specialists, generalists and visitors, and frugivores and insectivores). Results showed that habitat disturbance, caused by logging, had a weak positive direct effect on the bird communities, but also had a strong detrimental indirect effect, particularly on the total abundance and species richness of forests specialists and insectivores. The negative effect was mediated through changes in the forest's vegetation structure and composition. Shorter distances to the forest edge also had a negative effect, on all bird categories except on forest visitors, which also benefited from higher levels of disturbance. Our study shows that although in some cases habitat disturbance may have no strong direct negative effects it can still negatively influence bird communities in an indirect way. In the case of Kakamega Forest, we suggest that to conserve bird communities it is important to maintain the forest's compositional and structural diversity by reducing human-induced habitat disturbance, such as illegal logging activities.

Aside from large-scale oil palm monoculture plantations, self-managed oil palm smallholdings are also becoming common in palm oil producing countries, but less is known about how management of the smallholdings affects faunal biodiversity. We argue that it is critically important to understand the role of habitat complexity at the local and landscape scales for maintaining faunal biodiversity in oil palm smallholdings. We used passive sampling methods to survey understory birds, fruit bats, and butterflies in oil palm smallholdings on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. We quantified the diversity in each taxon and measured in situ habitat quality and landscape metrics. We found that oil palm smallholdings located near rice fields supported fewer bird species. Proximity to roads can give rise to bird and fruit bat richness. Bird and fruit bat richness declined at sites with high crop density. Fruit bat richness declined, but butterfly richness increased, with the height of oil palm stands. Butterfly richness declined with distance from riparian habitats. Decreased coverage and height of ground vegetation also negatively affected butterfly species richness. We also found that the number of farm houses is positively related to bird, fruit bat, and butterfly species richness. Of the three taxa, only butterfly richness was positively influenced by crop diversity. We found that habitat complexity enables smallholdings to support a diverse community of birds and butterflies, but not fruit bats. These findings imply that oil palm smallholdings can be managed in a conservation agricultural matrix, as the smallholdings were able to maintain farmland biodiversity.

Both subspecies showed high interannual return rates to the Delta study area, but Greater Sandhill Cranes (G. c. tabida) showed stronger within-winter fidelity to landscapes in our study region and to roost complexes within landscapes than did Lesser Sandhill Cranes (G. c. canadensis). Foraging flights from roost sites were shorter for G. c. tabida than for G. c. canadensis (1.9 [plus or minus] 0.01 km vs. 4.5 [plus or minus] 0.01 km, respectively) and, consequently, the mean size of 95% fixed-kernel winter home ranges was an order of magnitude smaller for G. c. tabida than for G. c. canadensis (1.9 [plus or minus] 0.4 km2 vs. 21.9 [plus or minus] 1.9 km2, respectively). Strong site fidelity indicates that conservation planning to manage for adequate food resources around traditional roost sites can be effective for meeting the habitat needs of these cranes, but the scale of conservation efforts should differ by subspecies. Analysis of movement patterns suggests that conservation planners and managers should consider all habitats within 5 km of a known G. c. tabida roost and within 10 km of a G. c. canadensis roost when planning for habitat management, mitigation, acquisition, and easements.

Lorenz, Teresa J.; Vierling, Kerri T.; Kozma, Jeffrey M.; Millard, Janet E.; Raphael, Martin G.				Journal of Wildlife Management	79	8		1286-1297	Nov 2015	2015				English	2	51	White-headed woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) are important cavity excavators that recently have become the focus of much research because of concerns over population declines. Past studies have focused on nest site selection and survival but information is needed on factors influencing their space use when away from the nest. We examined space use by white-headed woodpeckers during the nesting (May-Jul) and post-nesting (Jul-Oct) periods and compared the role of environmental factors (e.g., landcover) and socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, breeding success) in home range size and selection of location. Average size of 99% kernel home ranges was 125ha (SD[plus or minus]59ha; n=19) in the nesting period and 137ha (SD[plus or minus]70ha; n=30) in the post-nesting period. Minimum convex polygons were generally comparable to or smaller than ranges reported from previous radio-telemetry studies with this species. Although bird weight and age best explained variation in home range size compared to other factors, neither parameter estimate was significant in our models. Thus, even though weight and age were the most-supported factors in our analysis, home range size was largely influenced by factors that we did not measure. We found that most woodpeckers selected home ranges within forest patches that had undergone a recent disturbance; these areas included forests that had recently been burned with prescribed fire by the United States Forest Service (82%) or subject to disease (16%). Most burned patches in our study were small (approx. 4.8ha) and occurred within otherwise live forest but had nearly complete mortality of adult trees. We suggest that recent forest disturbances, especially mixed-severity prescribed burns, may have been selected by white-headed woodpeckers because they created snags for nesting and future studies should explore this hypothesis. Because home range size was variable and not linked with productivity, it should not be used as an indication of habitat quality without more detailed studies on causal factors that affect space use in this species.

Rangeland Ecology & Management	68	6		470-475	Nov 2015	2015				English	2	46	Most remaining grasslands are used for livestock grazing; stocking rates could be managed to help stop declining songbird populations. We examined the effects of stocking rates on grassland songbirds in northern mixed-grass prairies using a beyond-Before-After-Control-Impact manipulative experiment in Canada's Grasslands National Park and adjacent community pastures. The study area consisted of nine 300-ha pastures grazed at a range of stocking rates starting in 2008. We conducted songbird surveys at six upland plots in each pasture from 2006-2010 and measured vegetation structure within each plot from 2008-2010 (n = 54). We evaluated the effects of stocking rates on habitat structure and songbird abundance using linear and generalized linear mixed models. Baird's sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) relative abundance declined with increasing stocking rates. Chestnut-collared longspur (Calcarius ornatus) relative abundance increased only at higher stocking rates, indicating a possible threshold effect. Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) relative abundance decreased with stocking rates above 0.4 AUM after a year of grazing. Sprague's pipit (Anthus spragueii) relative abundance declined with grazing, but the effect was weak and only significant in 1 year. Western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) abundance was unaffected by grazing. Stocking rates may be used to benefit grassland songbirds and may alter avian communities after as little as 1 month of livestock grazing. Applying a range of stocking rates regionally may provide habitat for many species. (C) 2015 Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Dendy, Julian; Cordell, Susan; Giardina, Christian P.; Hwang, Bernice; Polloi, Edwin; Rengulbai, Kashgar				Restoration Ecology	23	6		872-881	Nov 2015	2015				English	3	43	To be successful, prescriptions for tropical forest restoration should facilitate natural recovery while also being easy to implement and inexpensive. In the Lake Ngardok Nature Reserve, Palau, we monitored native forest patches (4-275 m2) over 3 years to assess the influence of several low-cost restoration methods on patch expansion, growth of naturally established tree saplings, density of naturally establishing tree seedlings, growth of planted tree seedlings, flower and fruit production, and bird and flying fox visitations. Treatments included fertilization, trimming of surrounding herbaceous vegetation, mulching of patch perimeters, and planting native tree seedlings. Fertilized patches expanded faster and were associated with higher growth rates of perimeter saplings, higher fruit and flower production and growth of adjacent planted Acacia auriculiformis trees. Trimming perimeter vegetation led to higher tree seedling densities and species diversity, but both trimming and fertilizer effects on patch perimeter measures decreased over time. Pterocarpus indicus, a high value native legume, was the fastest growing planted tree species. The most common visitors were small, omnivorous, predominately endemic bird species. Visitations to fertilized patches were more frequent than to non-fertilized patches. The strongest predictors of visitation frequency were patch area, mean number of total fruits, and mean height of nearest neighboring trees. We conclude that forest succession can be accelerated by applying small amounts of fertilizer (approximately 22.5 g/m2 per application) to enhance tree growth and increase visitation rates of native pollinators and dispersers.

PLoS ONE	10	10		e0139492	Oct 2 2015	2015				English	1	26	Land management intrinsically influences the distribution of animals and can consequently alter the potential for density-dependent processes to act within populations. For declining species, high densities of breeding territories are typically considered to represent productive populations. However, as density-dependent effects of food limitation or predator pressure may occur (especially when species are dependent upon separate nesting and foraging habitats), high territory density may limit per-capita productivity. Here, we use a declining but widespread European farmland bird, the yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella L., as a model system to test whether higher territory densities result in lower fledging success, parental provisioning rates or nestling growth rates compared to lower densities. Organic landscapes held higher territory densities, but nests on organic farms fledged fewer nestlings, translating to a 5 times higher rate of population shrinkage on organic farms compared to conventional. In addition, when parental provisioning behaviour was not restricted by predation risk (i.e., at times of low corvid activity), nestling provisioning rates were higher at lower territory densities, resulting in a much greater increase in nestling mass in low density areas, suggesting that food limitation occurred at high densities. These findings in turn suggest an ecological trap, whereby preferred nesting habitat does not provide sufficient food for rearing nestlings at high population density, creating a population sink. Habitat management for farmland birds should focus not simply on creating a high nesting density, but also on ensuring heterogeneous habitats to provide food resources in close proximity to nesting birds, even if this occurs through potentially restricting overall nest density but increasing population-level breeding success.

Mzendah, C.M.; Mashapa, C.; Magadza, C.H.D.; Gandiwa, E.; Kativu, S.				Journal of Animal and Plant Sciences	25	5		1322-1328	Oct 2015	2015				English	0	4	Bird species composition and abundance across a land disturbance gradient in southern Gonarezhou National Park and adjacent areas, Zimbabwe was assessed in April 2013. Three study strata based on land use category were delineated, namely protected Manyanda Pan inside Gonarezhou National Park, unprotected Manjinji Pan and cultivated lands around Manjinji Pan. Bird census points were randomly pegged across the three study strata where bird species and numbers were recorded. Habitat condition of the study strata was estimated using the Global Monitoring Framework method. The study recorded a total of 2706 birds belonging to 131 species and 60 families from the three sites. With its dense woodlands, Manjinji Pan recorded significantly higher bird species diversity (H' = 4) than either the degraded Manyanda Pan (H' = 2.3) or the cultivated lands (H' = 2.6). Bird species evenness was highest in Manjinji Pan (J' = 0.59), whereas, lowest species evenness (J' = 0.18) was recorded on cultivated lands. The results suggest that land use type and woodland status likely influence bird species diversity in the study area. The study recommended for conservation of the remaining forest and wetland fragments in southern Zimbabwe even in unprotected areas in order to maintain avifaunal diversity.

Sage, Rufus B.; Wilson, Sue; Powell, Tony				Ecological Indicators	57			376-383	Oct 2015	2015				English	3	36	A key aim of many European agri-environment schemes (AES) is to improve biodiversity on farmland. In recent years, several countries have been looking at long term trends in the spring adult population size of a target group of farmland birds as an indicator of this. The overall trend in these indicators is however not upwards. While this might suggest we need to look at the design and deployment of habitat management options within schemes, there is an increasing view that we also need to refine and improve our indicators, or the way we monitor them. Relating spring adult bird population size to AES options is problematic not least because of the time lag between the deployment of those designed to enhance bird breeding success in summer, and the spring surveys the following year. At the other end of the scale detailed studies of breeding success in farmland birds have practical/cost restraints. We argue that to understand the impact on farmland birds of particular summer options within AESs we need to be able to estimate the breeding success of local bird populations quickly and cheaply. This would enable us to relate particular AES options to the breeding performance of the birds actually using them. Complementing a previous study of woodland birds, we assess the likelihood of encountering fledged broods of hedgerow nesting bird species during transect surveys without finding nests, and then apply a simple mark-recapture analysis technique to provide an index of breeding success for those species. Following spring adult assessments, counts of fledged broods were undertaken four times a week during April, May, June and July, in four 2.5 km hedgerow transects, at four sites in southern England in 2010. Mean daily detection probabilities of fledged broods of 16 common hedgerow birds were calculated from these counts using the software Presence. For 15 out of these 16 species these detection probabilities were sufficiently high for a programme of fledged brood surveys, involving just two or three visits per week from mid-May to mid-July, to provide a useful estimate of breeding success. The survey technique and associated analyses make certain assumptions when providing estimates of breeding success and these are discussed. Little is known about initial dispersal in passerine fledglings and a study in hedgerows may be useful here. However our pilot study suggests that the method could have application as a relatively easily derived productivity index for hedgerow birds, and hence an additional method available to study the impact of certain AES options on indicator species, or for research studies.

He, Xiao-fang; Wu, Fa-qing; Zhou, Qiao-hong; Liu, Bi-yun; Zhang, Li-ping; Wu, Zhen-bin				Changjiang Liuyu Ziyuan Yu Huanjing	24	9		1499-1506	Sep 2015	2015				Chinese	0	2	During the investigation on water birds at Lake Chenhu Nature Reserve form 2010 to 2013, 67 birds species of 15 families of 7 orders were recorded, in all families, ducks, Ardeidae and snipe birds predominate, in which there were 11 species listed on Rank I and II National Protected Wildlife, and 4 Species of birds are listed in the appendix of the CITES convention. There were 43 winter migrant species, 15 summer migrant species, 5 resident species and 4 passengers In terms of geographical distribution type, there were 44 Palaearctic species, 9 Oriental species and 14 Cosmopolitan species. Eutrophication is a water pollution phenomenon which is caused by the accumulation of nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients, and it leads to the change of aquatic community structure, especially water birds communities that feed on aquatic organisms. In order to find the relationship of eutrophication and water birds community characteristics, we investigated water birds at Chenhu Lake Nature Reserve by season from January 2010 to January 2013. Bird diversity in the Chenhu Lake and Zhangjiadahu Lake showed obvious seasonal change. The species diversity index was the highest in winter (12.19 and 9.89), and was the lowest in summer and winter (7.53 and 2.45). By analying the two Lakes of Chenhu wetland, we found that the eutrophication's indices of the Chenhu Lake and the Zhangjiadahu Lake were 64 and 78, respectively. The water birds species, water quantity and diversity of the Chenhu Lake were higher than those of the Zhangjiadahu Lake, and lake eutrophication would affect diversity of water birds. The species diversity of water birds and environment condition were compared between the Chenhu Lake and the Zhangjiadahu Lake. The result showed that the water birds diversity correlated negatively with the water quality and the eutrophication status, and we found that surrounding facilities construction of lake had serious influences on the water birds. Thus the over development and encroachment of wetlands should be prohibited, and it is urgent to improve the water quality and habitat diversity.

In total, 35 species of birds, belonging to 10 orders and 21 families, were recorded in five habitats including residential area, farming land, mountain, forest, and river. The Shannon diversity index, distribution coefficient and importance value of different avian species in the five habitats were calculated. Furthermore, the bird strike risk index for each bird species was calculated by multiplying the importance value and risk index. Accordingly, four risk levels were clarified as severe, heavy, moderate and low. Severe risk species included Passer montanus, Ardea cinerea, Pica pica, Falco tinnunculus. Heavy risk species included Hirundo rustica, Nycticorax nycticorax, Parus major, Columba livia. 16 species (such as Circus cyaneus, Anas platyrhynchos, Dendrocopos major, Cyanopica cyana) were included in the moderate risk group, and 10 species (such as Turdus chrysolaus, Gallinago megala, Coturnix coturnix, Coccothraustes coccothraustes) in the low risk group.

Yet, our understanding of how it affects fauna, particularly birds, is still poor. A fire that originated on surrounding farmland burned approximately half of Kimboza Forest Reserve between 13 and 15 October 2010. To better understand how birds respond to fire, a short-term study of understorey bird diversity and abundance in this forest reserve was conducted by comparing burned and unburned sites twenty months post-fire. Capture rates were significantly higher at the unburned site compared to the burned site. Bird species diversity was also higher at the unburned site than at the burned site. Despite the brevity of the study, the results suggest that fire has negative effects on forest avifauna and forest fires need to be prevented at Kimboza Forest Reserve as they affect the distribution and diversity of understorey birds.

Zimmerman, Guthrie S.; Sauer, John R.; Fleming, Kathy; Link, William A.; Garrettson, Pamela R.				Journal of Wildlife Management	79	7		1051-1061	Sep 2015	2015				English	1	37	We combined data from the Atlantic Flyway Breeding Waterfowl Survey (AFBWS) and the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to estimate the number of wood ducks (Aix sponsa) in the United States portion of the Atlantic Flyway from 1993 to 2013. The AFBWS is a plot-based survey that covers most of the northern and central portions of the Flyway; when analyzed with adjustments for survey time of day effects, these data can be used to estimate population size. The BBS provides an index of wood duck abundance along roadside routes. Although factors influencing change in BBS counts over time can be controlled in BBS analysis, BBS indices alone cannot be used to derive population size estimates. We used AFBWS data to scale BBS indices for Bird Conservation Regions (BCR), basing the scaling factors on the ratio of estimated AFBWS population sizes to regional BBS indices for portions of BCRs that were common to both surveys. We summed scaled BBS results for portions of the Flyway not covered by the AFBWS with AFBWS population estimates to estimate a mean yearly total of 1,295,875 (mean 95% CI: 1,013,9401,727,922) wood ducks. Scaling factors varied among BCRs from 16.7 to 148.0; the mean scaling factor was 68.9 (mean 95% CI: 53.5-90.9). Flyway-wide, population estimates from the combined analysis were consistent with alternative estimates derived from harvest data, and also provide population estimates within states and BCRs. We recommend their use in harvest and habitat management within the Atlantic Flyway. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

Brown, Donald J.; Ferrato, Jacqueline R.; White, Clayton J.; Mali, Ivana; Forstner, Michael R.J.; Simpson, Thomas R.				Forest Ecology and Management	350			13-21	Aug 15 2015	2015				English	1	58	High severity forest fires are increasing in large areas of the southern and western United States as the climate becomes warmer and drier. Given their strong roles in ecosystem dynamics, documenting the response of bird communities to wildfires is important for improving our understanding and management of post-wildfire ecosystems. However, because wildfires are unplanned events, relatively few studies have been conducted to assess local-scale impacts on forest bird communities. In this study, we had the opportunity to use a before-after, control-impact (BACI) approach to assess the response of resident birds to high severity wildfires that occurred in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas in September and October 2011. We replicated a previous study using point count surveys to assess summer and winter bird community changes ca. 1 year after the wildfires. We found that total number of detected individuals did not change following the wildfires, but winter bird species richness increased in burned habitat. Changes were apparent at the foraging guild-level for the winter bird community, with an increase in aerial insectivores and decrease in bark insectivores. Summer and winter bird community composition changes were apparent at the species-level and generally agreed with species-specific habitat preferences. For example, species such as eastern bluebirds and chipping sparrows that prefer open woodlands were positively associated with burned habitat. Our results provide quantitative evidence that high severity forest fires increased habitat suitability for many resident bird species. At the landscape-scale, fire-induced increases in habitat heterogeneity could result in higher bird diversity in the Lost Pines ecoregion. We expect bird community composition will be dynamic in the Lost Pines ecoregion over the next few decades as the burned habitat continues to change through successional processes and post-fire management actions.

Stephens, Jaime L.; Ausprey, Ian J.; Seavy, Nathaniel E.; Alexander, John D.				Condor	117	3		430-446	Aug 2015	2015				English	3	38	Wildfire is an important disturbance regime that can structure wildlife communities and their habitats for many years. Using a before-after-control-impact framework, we evaluated the effect of the Quartz Fire on a mixed broadleaf-conifer forest and associated bird community in southwestern Oregon, USA, over 10 yr. To assess whether fire severity explained changes better than simply whether an area was burned, we used a tiered sampling approach by comparing unburned control points with either all burned points combined (burned) or those same points partitioned by severity level (low, moderate, high). As expected, overall tree cover decreased while cover of shrubs increased in response to greater fire severity. This pattern was most pronounced in high-severity areas, where tree cover declined by 40% and remained depressed, but shrub cover recovered from 10% the year following fire to 75% by year 6. Ordinations of bird species density showed turnover in community composition in all burned areas combined, as well as in moderate-severity areas, shifting to a shrub-associated community 9 yr postfire. For individual species, annual density variations were best explained by fire for 14 of 37 species, with fire severity providing the best-fitting model for 7 species. Of those 7 species, 3 declined and 4 increased with greater severity. When grouped into guilds, flycatching foragers and shrub nesters increased with greater fire severity. Our results illustrate the importance of mixed-severity wildfire in creating diverse vegetation structure and composition that supports distinct bird communities for at least a decade following fire.

Forcey, Greg M.; Thogmartin, Wayne E.; Linz, George M.; Mckann, Patrick C.; Crimmins, Shawn M.				Journal of Wildlife Management	79	6		1022-1033	Aug 2015	2015				English	1	26	Knowledge of factors influencing animal abundance is important to wildlife biologists developing management plans. This is especially true for economically important species such as blackbirds (Icteridae), which cause more than $100 million in crop damages annually in the United States. Using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, the National Land Cover Dataset, and the National Climatic Data Center, we modeled effects of regional environmental variables on relative abundance of 3 blackbird species (red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus; yellow-headed blackbird, Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus; common grackle, Quiscalus quiscula) in the Prairie Pothole Region of the central United States. We evaluated landscape covariates at 3 logarithmically related spatial scales (1,000ha, 10,000ha, and 100,000ha) and modeled weather variables at the 100,000-ha scale. We constructed models a priori using information from published habitat associations. We fit models with WinBUGS using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Both landscape and weather variables contributed strongly to predicting blackbird relative abundance (95% credibility interval did not overlap 0). Variables with the strongest associations with blackbird relative abundance were the percentage of wetland area and precipitation amount from the year before bird surveys were conducted. The influence of spatial scale appeared smallmodels with the same variables expressed at different scales were often in the best model subset. This large-scale study elucidated regional effects of weather and landscape variables, suggesting that management strategies aimed at reducing damages caused by these species should consider the broader landscape, including weather effects, because such factors may outweigh the influence of localized conditions or site-specific management actions. The regional species distributional models we developed for blackbirds provide a tool for understanding these broader landscape effects and guiding wildlife management practices to areas that are optimally beneficial.

Biological Conservation	188			32-40	Aug 2015	2015				English	3	27	Patterns of habitat specialization can be used to infer conservation risks for species whose habitats are being degraded or lost due to anthropogenic activity. We assigned levels of forest type specialization to birds based on their occurrence and local abundance in three basic types of Atlantic rainforest in southern Brazil: seasonal semi-deciduous forest, mixed rainforest, and dense rainforest. We hypothesized that forest types would contain birds characterized by different levels of specialization. Specifically, we predicted that the dense forest would contain more specialists due to its higher plant species richness. Our study focused on a major clade of the suboscine Passeriformes (Thamnophilidae-Furnariidae), the majority of which are understory insectivorous species. We used field data from 16 locations including 35 sites spanning the major forest types in southern Brazil. We found (1) substantial variation in abundance among sampling locations for a single bird species within and between forest types; (2) species-specific associations with forest types; and (3) spatial aggregation among species that share similar levels of specialization. Using our method of qualitative scoring of forest type specialization, three species were considered habitat specialists (Xenops minutus, Leptasthenura setaria, and Cranioleuca pallida), twelve species were moderate specialists, sixteen were generalists, five were complete generalists, and twelve species were too rare to be included in the analysis. Contrary to our hypothesis, both mixed and dense forests were equally dominated by specialists. We discuss the implications of our approaches for conservation assessment and planning, both at the single-species level and for aggregate species in assemblages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Richmond, Sonya; Jenkins, Eva; Couturier, Andrew; Cadman, Mike				Landscape Ecology	30	7		1273-1290	Aug 2015	2015				English	4	60	Identification of threshold values in avian responses to habitat loss provides science-based guidelines on how to best manage anthropogenically altered landscapes for wildlife preservation. Our objectives were to test for thresholds in species richness of forest-breeding birds in relation to deciduous, coniferous, mixed, and total forest cover in two landscapes varying in the amount of forest present, and to determine whether thresholds for each forest type were coincident within and among landscapes, and across two spatial scales. We used Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas data to calculate species richness of forest-breeding birds. Percent deciduous, coniferous, mixed, and total forest cover were determined in 250 m radius circles around survey locations (local scale) and for 10 x 10 km squares (landscape scale) in the fragmented, sparsely forested Mixedwood Plains ecozone and in the more continuously forested Ontario Shield ecozone. Best-fit models explaining variation in species richness were selected from candidate sets of models that included 1-6 variables in addition to segmented or linear terms for forest cover. Threshold models had support at the local and landscape scales, and for all forest types. Thresholds ranged from 4 to 45 % cover, being slightly higher in the more continuously forested landscape, and for more prevalent forest types. Thresholds can provide useful targets for conservation efforts, but it is crucial to recognize that habitat levels should be maintained above threshold values to avoid ecological degradation, and to address the habitat requirements of species with occupancy thresholds above those of the assemblage.

Kentie, Rosemarie; Both, Christiaan; Hooijmeijer, Jos C.E.W.; Piersma, Theunis				Ibis	157	3		614-625	Jul 2015	2015				English	1	61	Effective conservation of endangered species requires a solid understanding of the demographic causes of population change. Bird populations breeding on agricultural grasslands have declined because their preferred habitat of herb-rich meadows has been replaced by grassland monocultures. The timing of agricultural activities in these monocultural grasslands is critical, as they often coincide with the nesting phase of breeding birds. Here, we aim to identify the effect of habitat management and targeted nest protection on nest survival of Black-tailed Godwits Limosa limosa in the Netherlands, a population that has shown a 70% reduction in breeding population size since the 1970s. To protect nests in monocultures from destruction, farmers are paid to either delay mowing or leave a patch of unmown grass around the nest, a patch which in practice varied in size. In herb-rich meadows, which are typically managed for bird conservation purposes, mowing occurs after hatching. Nest survival declined as the season advanced, more steeply on monocultures than on meadows. Targeted nest protection was only partially successful, as nest predation was considerably higher on mown grassland monocultures with small unmown patches around the nest than in mown monocultures with large unmown patches and in unmown fields. Increased predator densities over the years have been suggested as an important cause of the trend towards lower nest survival, but here we show that nest survival was higher on herb-rich meadows than on monocultures, and similar to the 1980s. It thus seems that increased predator densities are an increased threat during the egg stage only if habitat quality is low. High-quality habitat in the form of herb-rich meadows therefore provides a degree of protection against predators.

Lopez-Pomares, A.; Lopez-Iborra, G.M.; Martin-Cantarino, C.				Journal of Arid Environments	118			28-36	Jul 2015	2015				English	2	59	Traditional water supply systems in semi-arid agrarian ecosystems, mainly irrigation canals, contribute to the diversity of the landscape and influence the composition of species. To evaluate their effect on bird communities in the breeding season, we selected a rural area in southeastern Spain, where an intricate and extensive network of irrigation canals and cultivated areas is located between two wetlands declared as Natural Parks. Birds were counted at representative points distributed throughout the canal network at which we recorded several variables related to the physical features, the vertical and horizontal structure of associated vegetation, reed development (Phragmites australis) and land use in the neighboring areas. We detected 37 bird species, most of which were also breeding in the wetlands nearby. We used Hierarchical Partitioning analyses to identify the variables most strongly related to the probability of the presence of selected species and species richness. Vegetation cover and height close to the canals, together with reed development, were the most important types of variables explaining species presence and richness. We found that current management practices for reeds in canals are not well-suited for biodiversity conservation. We therefore propose alternatives that could be implemented in the area in cooperation with stakeholders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mero, Thomas Oliver; Lontay, Laszlo; Lengyel, Szabolcs				Journal of Ornithology	156	3		579-590	Jul 2015	2015				English	5	83	Freshwater wetlands and marshes with extensive reed beds are important hotspots of biological diversity, but in the absence of proper management, they are subject to biotic homogenisation. We assessed the impact of spatiotemporally variable management by cattle grazing (for 4 years) and late-summer burning (1 or 3 years before the study) on both songbirds and non-passerines in a previously homogeneous reed bed. We surveyed birds using a combination of line transects and point counts in a quasi-experimental design comprising six treatment levels. Management increased both the diversity of marsh habitats and the diversity of bird species. The species richness and abundance of non-passerines (ducks and geese, wading birds, gulls and terns, rails, coots and grebes) was higher in recently burned than in unburned or old-burned patches. Species richness of farmland songbirds was higher in grazed than in non-grazed patches, and the richness and abundance of reed songbirds was higher in unburned, old-burned, and grazed patches than in recently burned patches. Total Shannon diversity and evenness of birds was lowest in areas with the most intensive treatment (patches grazed and twice-burned), whereas Simpson diversity was highest in these areas. Non-managed patches had fewer species and individuals of all groups except reed songbirds. The proportion of old reed was low in recently burned and grazed patches, and was similarly high in all other treatment areas. No other property of reed stands was influenced by management, and both the allocation and the effect of management were independent of water level. Spatiotemporally variable management by cattle grazing and late-summer burning may thus simultaneously benefit several groups of birds. The effect of burning alone disappeared in 3 years, even in the presence of grazing; thus it must be repeated every 2-3 years. We conclude that both management actions are necessary to establish and maintain highly diverse habitats for marshland bird communities.

Rodewald, Amanda D.; Rohr, Rudolf P.; Fortuna, Miguel A.; Bascompte, Jordi				Biological Invasions	17	7		2139-2146	Jul 2015	2015				English	3	120	Anthropogenic disturbance can alter the structure of ecological networks in ways that have population consequences. For example, bird-plant networks in forests surrounded by urban land were more likely to be dominated by strong interactions (i.e., less even in strength) than networks in rural landscapes, and these asymmetric interactions depressed avian nest survival. Based on this prior research, we hypothesized that invasion of urban habitats by exotic plants was the underlying mechanism driving changes in network structure. We tested this hypothesis using an in situ experiment where exotic Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) was removed from replicated 2-ha forest plots and compared bird-plant networks among urban removal forests, urban control forests dominated by honeysuckle, and rural forests with little honeysuckle. From 2005 to 2011, we surveyed densities of understory-nesting birds and nest predators, recorded information about nest location, and monitored nest survival. For each year and site network, we calculated evenness of interaction strengths. Despite post-removal vegetation resembling that in rural forests, removal of exotic honeysuckle did not restore network structure. Evenness of interactions between birds and plants was greatest in rural forests and least in urban control plots. Nest survival increased with evenness across all sites, but the relationship was strongest within urban removal plots, which had the lowest overall nest survival rates. Even though invasion by honeysuckle was a plausible driver of urban-associated network shifts in previous studies, the experimental removal suggested that factors other than invasion were responsible for network changes or that our system experienced hysteresis or time lags. Our study suggests that restoration of ecological networks may be more challenging than anticipated.

Quality and quantity occurrence of rare Accipitriformes birds of prey species and black stork Ciconia nigra was assessed, and the nests were searched to protect breeding sites. The occurrence of six Accipitriformes was observed: European honey buzzard Pernis apivorus (4 home ranges), northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis (1 observation), Eurasian sparrowhawk A. nisus (5 eyries), common buzzard Buteo buteo (35 breeding home ranges, including 6 with nests), lesser spotted eagle Clanga pomarina (4 home ranges with nests) and golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos (nesting was not confirmed). The black stork occupied 3-4 home ranges, including one nest with a clutch. The density of breeding pairs of the lesser spotted eagle was 1.7 pairs per 100 km2 of the national park area, with 66.7% of the breeding success. Only a few breeding species of Accipitriformes occur in Bieszczady National Park, and their density is low, except for common buzzard (12 pairs per 100 km2). The early meadow mowing (June) is recommended to increase the prey base of Accipitriformes, because late mowing (August September) hampers the birds' preying in a high meadow and could have a negative influence on their breeding success. For better protection of the whole populations of rare Accipitriformes species (golden eagle, lesser spotted eagle) in the Western Bieszczady Mountains, the extension of the BdNP area is suggested, with Cisniansko-Wetlinski and San Valley Landscape Parks incorporated.

Global Ecology and Conservation	4			658-665	Jul 2015	2015				English	0	1	Disturbance-dependent habitats such as grasslands and shrublands are declining in many regions. To mitigate these declines, government agencies are using anthropogenic disturbances like logging and mowing to mimic natural ones. Because these programs can be costly or controversial, measuring their effectiveness is important. Here, we evaluate the conservation effectiveness of shrubland management for 15 bird species in Massachusetts, USA. Because shrublands are constantly changing in extent and location, we suggest that the key measure of conservation effectiveness should be how managed areas contribute to habitat availability. We used remotely-sensed data to assess the total area of shrublands in Massachusetts and consulted managers and a timber-harvest database to determine contributions of management by government agencies and non-governmental conservation organizations. We calculated species-specific habitat availability based on the habitat relationships of individual bird species. The area of potential habitat for shrubland birds in Massachusetts averaged 35,000 [plus or minus] SD of 11,300 ha. Of this total, an average of 20% [plus or minus] 15% exists because of management by government and NGOs. Management was most important for birds that nest primarily in uplands and avoid wetlands. We conclude that active management by government agencies and NGOs provides a substantial proportion of shrubland habitat in Massachusetts. With habitat on private property being lost to development or succession, active management will be even more important in the future. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Sameera				Journal of Asia-Pacific Biodiversity	8	2		121-132	Jun 30 2015	2015				English	0	0	A survey was randomly conducted in the marginal areas of Maduruoya National Park, Sri Lanka for a period of > 7 years. These study sites are located within the dry zone and the intermediate zone. The main vegetation type of the area is dry mixed evergreen forest. We recorded 196 bird species belonging to 66 families, and they included 161 breeding residents, 25 purely migrants, nine both resident and migrants, one vagrant, 14 nationally threatened, three globally threatened, and 10 endemic species. We also report the first-ever records of Chestnut-backed Owlet, Red-faced Malkoha, and Spot-winged Thrush from this dry area. However, these precious habitats and its species are threatened because of irresponsible human activities such as forest fires, land filings, hunting, road kills, encroachments, garbage dumping, agrochemicals, granite-rock blasting, logging, and road constructions. Therefore, we recommend that relevant authorities take immediate conservation action to increase the protection of these marginal areas or buffer zone in the near future.

Little, Ian T.; Hockey, Philip A.R.; Jansen, Raymond				Biodiversity and Conservation	24	6		1443-1471	Jun 2015	2015				English	3	43	The South African grassland system is home to over 3,300 plant species, 15 of the country's 34 endemic mammal species, 12 of the 40 endemic bird species (four of which are globally threatened) and five RAMSAR wetland sites. To assess and address the ecological integrity of farmed grasslands we used process-oriented techniques, including nesting success and field metabolic rates (FMR) of birds, and an adaptation of the multi-taxon biodiversity intactness index (BII) using plant, arthropod and bird diversity data which is a comprehensive tool for assessing ecological integrity using multiple taxonomic groups. Current pastoral management practices have a significant detrimental effect on avian abundance, species richness, nest density and fledgling output. Overall energy turnover and BII values confirm the importance of conserved areas for birds in moist highland grassland systems and support the need for further conservation efforts in grassland systems by both private landowners and reserve managers. Findings based on both avian FMRs and the BII in this study were found to be comparable, lending support to the use of FMR as a rapid assessment technique for assessing ecosystem integrity for future studies of this nature. Scenarios of potential biodiversity improvement with changes in fire management regimes are also presented.

Biodiversity and Conservation	24	6		1507-1529	Jun 2015	2015				English	2	78	Lower abundance of forest birds near high traffic roads is usually attributed to traffic noise, but the potential role of traffic mortality has not been adequately tested. We tested for the effect of traffic mortality independent of traffic noise, by sampling forest birds at sites with similar traffic volume (and noise levels), that varied in the likelihood of traffic collisions. Collision rates should be higher at forest sites next to roads where there is forest directly across the road, since forest birds are more likely to attempt to cross a small forest gap than a large one. We predicted that if traffic collisions play a significant role in the road effect on birds then in sites where there is a higher risk of traffic collision (small gap sites), there should be a stronger decline through the season in the number of forest birds close to roads, than in sites where there is a lower risk of collision (large gap sites). We compared relative abundance of forest birds, at four distances from high traffic roads, at 10 sites where the birds were more likely to cross the road (small-gap sites, with forest on the other side) versus at 10 sites where they were less likely to cross the road (large-gap sites with open field on the other side). Our prediction was supported; the slope of the relationship between abundance and distance from the road (the negative road effect) became stronger as the season progressed at the small-gap sites but not at the large-gap sites. Our results support the notion that traffic mortality is an important component of the negative road effect, and that mitigation of road effects on birds should include mitigation for traffic mortality.

Crosby, Andrew D.; Elmore, R. Dwayne; Leslie, David M., Jr; Will, Rodney E.				Biological Conservation	186			233-240	Jun 2015	2015				English	6	69	Changes in land use and land cover throughout the eastern half of North America have caused substantial declines in populations of birds that rely on grassland and shrubland vegetation types, including socially and economically important game birds such as the Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhites). As much attention is focused on habitat management and restoration for bobwhites, they may act as an umbrella species for other bird species with similar habitat requirements. We quantified the relationship of bobwhites to the overall bird community and evaluated the potential for bobwhites to act as an umbrella species for grassland and shrubland birds. We monitored bobwhite presence and bird community composition within 31 sample units on selected private lands in the south-central United States from 2009 to 2011. Bobwhites were strongly associated with other grassland and shrubland birds and were a significant positive predictor for 9 species. Seven of these, including Bell's Vireo (Vireo bell), Dicksissel (Spiza americana), and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), are listed as species of conservation concern. Species richness and occupancy probability of grassland and shrubland birds were higher relative to the overall bird community in sample units occupied by bobwhites. Our results show that bobwhites can act as an umbrella species for grassland and shrubland birds, although the specific species in any given situation will depend on region and management objectives. These results suggest that efficiency in conservation funding can be increased by using public interest in popular game species to leverage resources to meet multiple conservation objectives.

For the purpose of making up reasonable forest management strategies, a clear baseline data were needed on the status of wildlife. By using transect lines and point sampling methodology, the bird species diversity was surveyed at Xishan Experiment Forest Unit from July 2013 to May 2014 in Beijing. There were 12 orders, 32 families and 101 bird species were recorded during the study period. The Avifauna was composed of 68.3% Palearctic realm species and 16.8% Oriental realm species. Among these birds, the Imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca) is listed as the first-grade State Key Protected Wildlife, and 26 birds are listed as the second-grade State Key Protected Wildlife. There were other 9 and 40 birds are listed as the first and the second grade Beijing Municipality Protected Wildlife, respectively. There were 5 raptor species with the number over 300 during autumn migratory period, which showed the studied area is one of the major raptor migration corridors in Beijing. Thus, the forest management strategies to promote habitat recovery for raptors and their prey will be the central work in regional ecological environment reconstruction in the Xishan area.

Calladine, John; Bray, James; Broome, Alice; Fuller, Robert J.				Forest Ecology and Management	344			20-29	May 15 2015	2015				English	3	62	Continuous cover systems are increasingly advocated for stand management but the implications for bio-diversity in European forests, and specifically in plantations of non-native trees, are poorly understood. Timed point counts were used to quantify differences in species richness and abundance of breeding birds supported by conifer plantations (with major Sitka spruce components) under two contrasting management systems in upland Britain: continuous cover forestry (CCF) and clearfelling with replanting (CFR). Each CCF study area was paired with a comparable CFR study area. Sample points within CCF areas were divided into areas with extensive regenerating understorey and areas with none; sample points within CFR study areas were placed within young thicket and pre-thicket stands (trees < 10 years old) and older stands (15-30 years old). Poisson GLMMs were used to identify differences in bird species richness and abundance between the four treatments testing the predictions: (a) CCF can support an enhanced assemblage of forest birds relative to CFR (including mature CFR); and (b) CFR can support a broader range of open habitat and shrubland species relative to CCF (including those with a regenerating understorey). Ranking forest types in descending order of species richness gave: CCF with shrub understorey > CCF without shrubs > young pre-thicket CFR > mature CFR. Many 'mature forest birds' were more abundant, or recorded only, within CCF (e.g. blackcap, wood warbler, redstart and hawfinch). A small number of species associated with young-growth ('shrubland' and 'shrub-layer' species) were most abundant in pre-thicket CFR but a CCF understorey supported some species at densities approaching those found in pre-thicket CFR. Simulations of the effect of increasing the proportion of plantation under CCF indicated for example that a plantation managed exclusively as CCF could support as few as 53% of the willow warblers as one managed exclusively as CFR. A plantation managed exclusively as CCF could support as few as 70% of the lesser redpolls as one managed as CFR, but could support twice as many blackcaps. CCF could be of greater conservation value to many forest birds than CFR. However, CCF may not support such high densities of some species (e.g. dunnock, willow warbler and lesser redpoll) as those found in young growth stage CFR. Forest management that includes some young growth areas alongside CCF could prove to be a strategy that maximises the capacity of a forested landscape to support a greater diversity of bird species.

Tahmasebi, Samane; Ghassemi, Farangis; Tayefeh, Farhad Hosseini				CIBTech Journal of Zoology	4	2		10-15	May 2015	2015				English	0	0	Wetlands by providing specific environmental conditions and having a rich source of genetic resources are important agents in the protection of biodiversity. For this purpose, present study was conducted in the Marine National Park (Mond) in Golf Persian, southern of Iran, with an area of about 46,000 hectares in January and September 2014. Research region is divided into 4 sites such as 1) Tahmadon and Harra forests, 2) Mond river inlet, 3) Khan Island, and 4) Khor bay. Navigation area, species identification and their enumeration were carried in collaboration with Department of Environment of Bushehr personnel. Bird counting was carried with total count method and nest count method. Laying area was determined with a cloth meter and GPS, and then estimation of the average number of nests per square meter was done. Birds were visited by using binoculars and telescopes and were photographed. Then Tern species were identified according to their morphological characters and behavior using taxonomic keys. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and graphs were plotted using Excel software. Diversity and richness of the identified species were determined and relationship between sampling stations and bird species were analyzed using chi-square test in P<0.01. A total 78,771 individuals of Terns belonging to 7 Sterna genus were observed. Sterna bengalensis with 42,315 individuals recorded with the highest population (53.7%) and Sterna albifrons with 4 individuals was the lowest of them. The highest and lowest population density and diversity was seen respectively in Hara forests and Khan bay. According to the obtained findings, research area is a suitable habitat for Terns and the protection of this area is necessary for bird conservation.

Annals of Forest Science	72	3		335-348	May 2015	2015				English	2	26	Key message We forecasted the effects of climate change and forest conversion options on common forest bird species by employing nation-wide high-resolution models. The results give details on how, where, and for which species forest conversion can mitigate climate change effects. Context To mitigate effects of climate change on forests, alterations are required to convert forests into less vulnerable forest types. Coniferous forest that has been cultivated extensively outside its natural range has been identified as being more vulnerable to climate change effects than deciduous forest. Aims The aim is to evaluate the effect of climate change mitigation measures on biodiversity due to forest conversion. Methods We generated five forest scenarios for Germany in which we systematically replaced coniferous with deciduous forest types. We forecasted the effects of climate change and forest conversion options on 25 forest bird species by employing high-resolution models to predict their current and future ranges and population size. Results Our simulations and modeling approach clearly predicted that climate change has a stronger impact on populations compared to distribution areas of common forest bird species. Forest conversion was predicted to amplify (15 species) and to weaken (10 species) the predicted gains and losses of species' population size due to climate change. Using the total bird population size to evaluate the mitigation effect of the different forest scenarios, forest conversion below an elevation of 500 m a. s. l. was predicted to mitigate climate change effects by 0.3 million breeding pairs (-0 %). The relatively weak mitigation effect was mainly due to few generalist species that inhabit coniferous forests in large abundances and did not profit from a conversion to deciduous forests. Conclusion The results of the study give details on how, where, and for which species forest conversion can mitigate the anticipated effects of climate change.

Rota, Christopher T.; Rumble, Mark A.; Lehman, Chad P.; Kesler, Dylan C.; Millspaugh, Joshua J.				Condor	117	2		178-191	May 2015	2015				English	0	23	Dramatic fluctuations in food resources are a key feature of many habitats, and many species have evolved a movement strategy to exploit food resources that are unpredictable in space and time. The availability of food resources may be a particularly strong determinant of habitat quality for irruptive bird species. We studied the apparent foraging success of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), an irruptive species that responds opportunistically to pulsed food resources in burned forests and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations. Prior investigations revealed that the highest population growth rates of Black-backed Woodpeckers occurred in habitat created by summer wildfire, with intermediate population growth rates in MPB infestations, and the lowest population growth rates in habitats created by prescribed fire in fall. We tested whether apparent foraging success was associated with known habitat quality in order to assess the potential for food availability to regulate population growth. We counted the number of successfully captured wood-boring beetle larvae and "small'' prey on each tree that a Black-backed Woodpecker used for foraging and modeled these counts as a function of habitat, tree diameter, number of years postfire, and tree disturbance category. Total apparent foraging success (the sum of observed captures of wood-boring beetle larvae and small prey per tree) did not vary across habitats, but woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by summer wildfire were expected to capture 2.2 and 2.0 times more wood-boring beetles than woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations, respectively. These results suggest that the availability of food resources may contribute to population regulation in this irruptive species. Furthermore, population growth in irruptive species may be highly sensitive to the availability of preferred food resources. Forests recently burned by summer wildfires provide relatively abundant food resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers and represent high-quality habitat for this species of conservation concern.

Lee, Alan T.K.; Barnard, Phoebe; Hockey, Philip A.R.				Ostrich	86	1-2		179-187	May 2015	2015				English	2	17	Estimates of bird numbers through quantification of density and range sizes are necessary for decisions regarding conservation status, yet counts of birds are often confounded by uncertainty of detection. The status of the endemic birds of the Fynbos biome is of interest due to their conservation value in a global biodiversity hotspot, the ecological services they provide, and their importance for the avitourism industry. We conducted an extensive repeated point-count survey across the Fynbos biome, South Africa, to determine probability of detection and covariates of site occupancy for 27 bird species. Detection of most species was influenced by time of day, temperature or vegetation height. Important covariates influencing site occupancy were vegetation height, altitude, time since fire and habitat type. Site occupancy for four fynbos-endemic species was positively associated with increasing altitude. We further conducted point counts and mist-netting in eastern regions of the Fynbos biome to calculate local density and standardised capture rates. A linear regression analysis showed that capture rates were a function of bird densities, but that several species were captured at higher rates than expected, notably nectarivorous species. During mist-netting a relative abundance count was conducted. We expected deviation of the fit of the regression of capture rates on relative abundance to correlate with detection probability, because we expect this index to underestimate skulking and cryptic species, but there was no correlation. Estimated species richness indices were highest for the biome-wide survey, and lowest for mist-netting due to the body size limit imposed by the capture technique. Overall, we showed that point counts are an effective method for surveying birds in the fynbos and that mist-netting can be used to create an index of relative abundance for smaller species, but can be significantly affected by net placement.

In southern Europe, the conservation of many grassland bird communities largely depends on low-intensity mountain farming. In this study, we analysed the effects of the main farming practices promoting grassland maintenance, i.e. grazing and mowing, on species richness of a Prealpine grassland bird community and on the breeding densities of the two commonest grassland species, the skylark (Alauda arvensis Linnaeus, 1758) and the tree pipit (Anthus trivialis Linnaeus, 1758). The two study sites were located between 1100 and 2000m above sea level in the Italian central Prealps. Grassland species richness was positively affected by grazing, and increased with increasing distance from the nearest woodland. Skylark density was positively influenced by mowing, grassland cover extent and distance from woodland, with the latter effect occurring only at a single study site. Finally, tree pipit density was positively affected by grazing. Our findings suggest that, in order to maintain open grasslands below the natural treeline and enhance the biodiversity of grassland bird communities, grazing should be preferred over mowing. Moreover, woodland edge effects may have a negative impact on mountain grassland bird communities. Advancing woodlands and abandonment of low-intensity farming and grazing practices may therefore constitute a serious threat for open-habitat specialist bird species of the Alpine region.

Conservation Biology	29	2		473-481	Apr 2015	2015				English	5	112	Fire is used as a management tool for biodiversity conservation worldwide. A common objective is to avoid population extinctions due to inappropriate fire regimes. However, in many ecosystems, it is unclear what mix of fire histories will achieve this goal. We determined the optimal fire history of a given area for biological conservation with a method that links tools from 3 fields of research: species distribution modeling, composite indices of biodiversity, and decision science. We based our case study on extensive field surveys of birds, reptiles, and mammals in fire-prone semi-arid Australia. First, we developed statistical models of species' responses to fire history. Second, we determined the optimal allocation of successional states in a given area, based on the geometric mean of species relative abundance. Finally, we showed how conservation targets based on this index can be incorporated into a decision-making framework for fire management. Pyrodiversity per se did not necessarily promote vertebrate biodiversity. Maximizing pyrodiversity by having an even allocation of successional states did not maximize the geometric mean abundance of bird species. Older vegetation was disproportionately important for the conservation of birds, reptiles, and small mammals. Because our method defines fire management objectives based on the habitat requirements of multiple species in the community, it could be used widely to maximize biodiversity in fire-prone ecosystems.

Schaeckermann, Jessica; Mandelik, Yael; Weiss, Noam; von Wehrden, Henrik; Klein, Alexandra-Maria				Journal of Applied Ecology	52	2		291-299	Apr 2015	2015				English	3	70	1. Spillover of beneficial organisms from natural habitats to croplands can improve agro-ecosystem services, but wildlife can also negatively influence agricultural production. When managing agricultural landscapes to conserve biodiversity, we need to understand whether the availability of natural habitats increases ecosystem dis-services such as vertebrate seed predation to avoid risking higher costs than benefits. 2. We studied whether vertebrates and their impact in crop seed predation are related to the percentage of natural (chaparral) and semi-natural habitat (planted forest with native and exotic trees) in an agricultural landscape of Israel. We selected 20 almond and 20 sunflower study sites within a landscape with varying percentages of natural (0-61%) and semi-natural (0-70%) habitats within a 1000 m radius of their surroundings. We observed birds, trapped rodents (in almond), counted seeds and noted feeding marks to obtain seed predation rates, at each site. Within the almond crops, we physically excluded birds, rodents and both to determine their relative and combined influence on seed predation. 3. Neither vertebrate abundance nor species richness was influenced by the percentage of natural habitat. However, bird species richness increased with increasing percentage of semi-natural habitat. 4. Seed predation across both crops was not influenced by natural or semi-natural habitat but increased significantly with increasing abundance and species richness of birds. This was also reflected by the exclusions of birds, vertebrates and both to the almond crop, leading to lowest seed predation when both groups were excluded. 5. Synthesis and applications. Natural or semi-natural habitat did not influence the agro-ecosystem dis-service of seed predation by birds and rodents. Policymakers should consider promoting agri-environment schemes that include the conservation of natural habitats and the management of semi-natural habitats adjacent to cropland to enhance agro-ecosystem services meditated by beneficial organisms such as natural pest enemies and pollinators without fearing increased vertebrate seed predation. In order to provide more detailed management recommendations tackling the reduction of vertebrate dis-services, their feeding behaviour, metabolic needs, behaviour patterns and local abundances should be taken into account.

Jayathilake, Manjari Bhagya; Chandrasekara, Withanage Upali				Journal of Asia-Pacific Biodiversity	8	1		72-82	Mar 30 2015	2015				English	0	0	We assessed variation in avifaunal diversity at some selected habitats around the Negombo estuary in Sri Lanka in relation to land-use modifications. During the study period, we observed 48 bird species of which 47 species are residents to Sri Lanka. The avian species richness, evenness, and heterogeneity were found to be the highest at undisturbed habitats. Further, these diversity measures were negatively correlated with the intensity of anthropogenic land-use activities. Total abundance of birds increased at highly disturbed habitats due to the presence of the house crow, as it is the most abundant of all birds observed at these habitats. This study highlights the need for habitat management around estuaries, giving due consideration to existing ecological theories to conserve avifaunal diversity. It also highlights the negative impacts of the house crow on diversity of other resident avian fauna in these habitats.

The results showed that: 11 kinds of birds were recorded, belonging to 5 orders and 8 families, where the dominant species was sparrow (Passer montanus), short-toed braun (Calandrella cheleensis) and magpies (Pica pica). Compared with the fire area, no fire area had the highest density of birds, Shannon-Weiner index value (H') and Pielou index value (E). The fire significantly reduced the density of bird community, species diversity and evenness degree (P<0.05), and bird density increased with the degree of fire reduced. But the fire did not significantly change the number of species of bird community (P>0.05). There was more similarity in bird species composition between fire area and no fire area.

Evans, Darren M.; Villar, Nacho; Littlewood, Nick A.; Pakeman, Robin J.; Evans, Sharon A.; Dennis, Peter; Skartveit, John; Redpath, Steve M.				ECOSPHERE	6	3		42	Mar 2015	2015				English	5	91	Livestock grazing is a major driver of land-use change, causing significant biodiversity loss globally. Although the short-term effects of livestock grazing on individual species are well studied, a mechanistic understanding of the long-term, cascading impacts is lacking. We manipulated livestock densities using a unique, replicated upland experiment over a 10-year period and found significant effects of grazing treatment on plant and arthropod biomass; the number of Anthus pratensis breeding bird territories; the amplitude of Microtus agrestis population cycles and the activity of a top predator, Vulpes vulpes. Lower plant biomass as a result of higher stocking densities led to cascades across trophic levels, with fewer arthropods and small mammals, the latter affecting predator activity. Breeding bird territories were a function of arthropod abundance and vegetation structure heterogeneity. Our results provide a novel food-web analysis in a grazing experiment to provide a mechanistic understanding of how food-webs in upland ecosystems respond to long-term livestock grazing pressure, with consequences for management.

Falcao, Jessica C.F.; Dattilo, Wesley; Izzo, Thiago J.				Forest Ecology and Management	339			105-111	Mar 1 2015	2015				English	3	60	In tropical forests, several reforestation programs have been created to recover biological diversity in deforested environments. However, most of these studies have focused on the loss of species and ignored the loss of ecological interactions and ecosystem services that these species provide in their natural environment. Here, we assess how reforestation (including both native and exotic species) and the distance from the forest matrix could recover the following parameters: richness, composition, and ant-plant interactions in the southern Brazilian Amazon. For this, we collected data in five different agroforestry landscapes: primary and secondary forests, reforestations of teak and fig, and pasture. In general, we observed that the distance from the forest matrix was not an important factor for the recovery of ant-plant interactions at the scale of this study. Ant plant interactions were more specialized in the pasture, possibly due to the low richness and high dominance in pastures, which generates a high ant-plant dependency. Moreover, none of the strategies employed for the recovery of diversity (teak and fig reforestation) increased the recovery rate of the studied parameters: richness, composition, and the patterns of ant plant interactions, when compared to primary forests. These results indicate that regardless of species richness and composition, secondary forests and reforestation lands are functionally different from pastures. In conclusion, our results represent a valuable tool to conservation planners, mainly because we show that secondary forests created by natural regeneration can be an efficient and economical method for restoring the disruption of ant plant interactions in tropical forests.

Stirnemann, Ingrid A.; Ikin, Karen; Gibbons, Philip; Blanchard, Wade; Lindenmayer, David B.				Oecologia (Berlin)	177	3		733-746	Mar 2015	2015				English	1	71	Fine-scale vegetation cover is a common variable used to explain animal occurrence, but we know less about the effects of fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity. Theoretically, fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity is an important driver of biodiversity because it captures the range of resources available in a given area. In this study we investigated how bird species richness and birds grouped by various ecological traits responded to vegetation cover and heterogeneity. We found that both fine-scale vegetation cover (of tall trees, medium-sized trees and shrubs) and heterogeneity (of tall trees, and shrubs) were important predictors of bird richness, but the direction of the response of bird richness to shrub heterogeneity differed between sites with different proportions of tall tree cover. For example, bird richness increased with shrub heterogeneity in sites with high levels of tall tree cover, but declined in sites with low levels of tall tree cover. Our findings indicated that an increase in vegetation heterogeneity will not always result in an increase in resources and niches, and associated higher species richness. We also found birds grouped by traits responded in a predictable way to vegetation heterogeneity. For example, we found small birds benefited from increased shrub heterogeneity supporting the textual discontinuity hypothesis and non-arboreal (ground or shrub) nesting species were associated with high vegetation cover (low heterogeneity). Our results indicated that focusing solely on increasing vegetation cover (e.g. through restoration) may be detrimental to particular animal groups. Findings from this investigation can help guide habitat management for different functional groups of birds.

Di Santo, Maria Paola; Carpaneto, Giuseppe M.; Battisti, Corrado				Lakes & Reservoirs Research and Management	20	1		33-41	Mar 2015	2015				English	0	2	This study reports on the patterns of species occurrence, abundance and richness of a wintering water-related bird assemblage in an archipelago' of 70 small artificial urban ponds (AUPs) embedded in a metropolitan landscape (Rome, central Italy). A total of 20 species in 26 AUPs were sampled. Only the largest AUPs (>0.1ha) contained all these species, except for Gallinula chloropus. The highest total mean species abundance was observed in the largest ponds, with statistically significant differences evident among size classes. Two significant spatial thresholds in species abundance and richness were observed (between 0.01 and 0.1ha; between 0.1 and 1ha in size). The abundance of single species was correlated with their frequency of occurrence. Ponds in urban areas must be larger than 0.1ha to host a rich winter assemblage of birds, with a further increase in richness noted with a surface area larger than 1ha. The highest number of species was observed in the larger ponds (>1ha). The species richness of each AUP is directly correlated to their size (log-transformed species-area relationship: log S=3.515+0.497 log A; R2=0.76). Further research should be conducted to confirm these patterns and to implement information useful for planning and management of artificial ponds in urban areas for this purpose.

Journal of Threatened Taxa	7	2		6878-6890	Feb 26 2015	2015				English	0	3	A survey on birds was conducted at St. Coombs Tea Estate, Talawakelle, Sri Lanka with the objective of assessing the avifaunal diversity of a given tea plantation ecosystem. Bird populations were sampled in man-made habitats such as home garden, wetland, tea plantation, Eucalyptus plantation and small scale reservoir. Hundred-and-twenty counts were made for each habitat and in addition, activities of birds, feeding habits and food recourses were also observed. A total of 87 species, including 11 endemic and 11 migrant species of birds, was recorded, which included one globally threatened species, Kashmir Flycatcher Ficedula subrubra and 16 nationally threatened species. A majority of the bird species were observed in home gardens (75%), followed by reservoirs (57%), wetlands (48%), tea plantations (43%) and in Eucalyptus plantations (23%). Home gardens support bird diversity while the species richness of endemic bird species increases thereby enabling these findings to be used as guidelines in long term conservational practices. Several conservation measures such as increasing plant diversity, introduction of shade trees and prevention of fire are recommended to conserve and enhance avifaunal diversity in tea plantations.

PLoS ONE	10	2		e0116735	Feb 25 2015	2015				English	2	16	We used publically available data on duck breeding distribution and recently compiled geospatial data on upland habitat and environmental conditions to develop a spatially explicit model of breeding duck populations across the entire Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). Our spatial population models were able to identify key areas for duck conservation across the PPR and predict between 62.1 - 79.1% (68.4% avg.) of the variation in duck counts by year from 2002 - 2010. The median difference in observed vs. predicted duck counts at a transect segment level was 4.6 ducks. Our models are the first seamless spatially explicit models of waterfowl abundance across the entire PPR and represent an initial step toward joint conservation planning between Prairie Pothole and Prairie Habitat Joint Ventures. Our work demonstrates that when spatial and temporal variation for highly mobile birds is incorporated into conservation planning it will likely increase the habitat area required to support defined population goals. A major goal of the current North American Waterfowl Management Plan and subsequent action plan is the linking of harvest and habitat management. We contend incorporation of spatial aspects will increase the likelihood of coherent joint harvest and habitat management decisions. Our results show at a minimum, it is possible to produce spatially explicit waterfowl abundance models that when summed across survey strata will produce similar strata level population estimates as the design-based Waterfowl Breeding Pair and Habitat Survey (r2 = 0.977). This is important because these design-based population estimates are currently used to set duck harvest regulations and to set duck population and habitat goals for the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. We hope this effort generates discussion on the important linkages between spatial and temporal variation in population size, and distribution relative to habitat quantity and quality when linking habitat and population goals across this important region.

Journal of Natural History	49	5-8		301-325	Feb 24 2015	2015				English	3	77	The role of breeding birds as indicators of sustainable management in olive groves was investigated. The data revealed significantly higher alpha diversity in organic and abandoned olive groves and maquis than in conventional ones. The highest beta diversity was found between the following pairs: organic olive groves-maquis, and abandoned olive groves-maquis. Breeding bird diversity, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera and Coleoptera densities positively influenced bird species richness in organic olive groves and maquis, and additionally, manure application positively influenced bird species richness in organic ones. Bird species richness was negatively influenced by pesticide and inorganic fertilizer application in conventional ones. Moreover, isopod density was unimportant in explaining breeding bird richness in organic olive groves. Finally, our study suggests a difference in bird communities of various olive groves as a result of different management and practices, and concludes that birds might serve as indicators of overall olive grove health. Furthermore, these findings could be used as a tool for prediction of breeding bird species richness probability in different olive grove management systems and maquis. Finally, the results of the present study may contribute to highlighting some aspects of the effect of different farming practices on the dynamics of Mediterranean bird communities.

Wes, Jr; Riffell, Sam				Open Ornithology Journal	8			1-9	Feb 2 2015	2015				English	2	4	Conservation Reserve Program Conservation Practice 33 (CP33: Conservation Buffers for Upland Birds) provides habitat for grassland birds in agriculture-dominated landscapes. However, landscape context and adjacency of other land covers may influence colonization, occupancy, and reproductive performance of breeding grassland birds in buffers. Our objective was to determine how edge effects influence diversity and density of breeding grassland birds in CP33 buffers. Data collected during transect surveys in CP33 buffers at a privately-owned farm in Clay County, Mississippi, USA during the 2007 2009 breeding seasons indicated that buffers with a woody edge had the least diversity and density of grassland and facultative grassland birds. Dickcissels (Spiza americana), the most abundant grassland bird species detected in buffers, had a lower density in woodland-bordered buffers than in grassland-bordered buffers. Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) had a lower density in buffers adjacent to woodlands than buffers adjacent to developed areas and those bordered on both sides by crop fields. Conversely, Indigo Buntings, (Passerina cyanea) a woodland edge species, had the greatest density in woodland-bordered buffers when compared to buffers adjacent to grassland and developed areas. These results demonstrate that adjacency influences colonization processes and conservation design should explicitly incorporate local landscape context in field and farm-scale conservation plans. Where conservation of obligate grassland birds is a primary objective of native grass conservation buffers, avoidance of buffer establishment adjacent to woodlands may maximize environmental services as measured by grassland bird diversity and density.

We assessed convergence of birds, plants, and habitat structures in aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands harvested with structural retention by Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc. (Al-Pac) 15 years ago with similar aged fire area, and examined a chronosequence of younger and older burned aspen stands from Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) sites. Most habitat structures and many bird and plant species in the 15 year harvest areas were at levels similar to 20-40 year or >40 year fire areas. Snags, moss, and lichen cover, and a few groups of species were at lower levels in the harvest areas than comparable aged fire areas or older stands. Agglomerative clustering showed the plant community to be most similar to >40 year burned stands, with the bird community intermediate between >20 year and <20 year fire areas. A novel likelihood-based analysis of species estimated the 15 year harvest areas to have a community similar to forest sites with 36.8% human footprint, indicating substantial recovery of the harvest areas. Harvesting aspen stands with structural retention appears to be effective at allowing most biodiversity components to recover rapidly.

Wiacek, Jaroslaw; Polak, Marcin; Kucharczyk, Marek; Bohatkiewicz, Janusz				Landscape and Urban Planning	134			76-82	Feb 2015	2015				English	3	92	The main objective of this study was to assess disturbance to birds at stopover sites in the vicinity of roads. We attempted to determine the influence of a busy road on birds during the autumn migration period. To our knowledge this is the first study in Europe carried out during this part of a bird's annual cycle in the context of road noise impact. Individuals were counted using the point method at 36 observation points located at three distances (60 m, 310 m, 560 m) from the road. At each point we determined the habitat parameters and the intensity of noise. In total, 648 individuals from 25 species were recorded on the study plot. The number of birds per point was higher on the second line of points but lower on the last line from the road. Species diversity was lower near the road. The density of the following common species increased with distance from the road: Eurasian jay, great spotted woodpecker, siskin, mistle thrush and nuthatch. Only great tits preferred the proximity of the road. The number and species diversity of birds were correlated with road noise propagation across our study area. Noise levels below 49 dB did not significantly influence the number of birds or species richness. Our results showed that species foraging on invertebrates preferred the neighbourhood of the road. These data may be helpful in planning and managing road environments in the context of bird conservation and protection against road noise. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bergner, Adam; Avci, Mustafa; Eryigit, Hasan; Jansson, Nicklas; Niklasson, Mats; Westerberg, Lars; Milberg, Per				Forest Ecology and Management	336			137-147	Jan 15 2015	2015				English	1	37	The Mediterranean basin exhibits a multitude of forest habitats affected by former and current exploitation and management. Recent afforestation programs have resulted in an increase in the proportion of coniferous trees, while oak stands, formerly utilized for coppicing and grazing, are abandoned or converted into coniferous plantations. The loss of oak stands might negatively affect birds dependent upon broadleaved forests. Studies confirming or rejecting that statement are scarce, particularly in the eastern part of the region. Using a study area in southwestern Turkey we applied a guild-based approach to investigate how pine and oak stands across a chronosequence differ in their capacity to support forest bird assemblages. Variables describing the vegetation were sampled to characterize the stands and relate bird assemblages to stand structure. Bird abundance and species richness was positively associated with age for both stand types. Richness and diversity was highest in oak stands, while there were no differences in bird abundance between the two forest types. Pine stands supported a different bird species composition compared to oak stands of the same age. Stand age and structure, rather than forest type, held the highest explanatory powers for bird assembly structure. Primary cavity-nesters and ground-nesters were more abundant in oak stands, possibly reflecting differences in stand structure and resource distribution. To support these birds with suitable habitats, oaks stands need conservation. Management practices in pine stands should strive for increasing the amount of old trees and retain vegetation in the understory to benefit breeding birds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

STATUS IN VARSTVO BELOHRBTEGA DETLA Dendrocopos leucotos V SLOVENIJI.	Denac, Katarina; Mihelic, Tomas				Acrocephalus (Ljubljana)	36	164-16		5-20	2015	2015				Slovenian	0	0	The paper summarizes current knowledge on the population size, habitat,. conservation status and conservation measures for the White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos in Slovenia. The species is an extremely rare forest specialist species. It inhabits mostly Dinaric beech Fagus sylvatica forests from Trnovski gozd, Nanos, Javorniki Mrs and Mt Sneznik to the Kocevsko region and Gorjanci Mts. The species is also present in the Zasavje region and Mt Boc. The majority of the population (w80%) inhabits the altitudinal belt between 700 and 1400 m a.s.l. The size of the Slovenian breeding population is currently estimated at 100-150 breeding pairs. Using the new survey playback method, we expect to find the species at additional sites. The highest densities were recorded on Mt Sneznik (0.7 breeding pairs/km2 in the Zatrep - Planinc forest reserve, 0.6 breeding pairs/km2 at Gomance) and in the Gorjanci Mts (0.6-0.9 breeding pairs/km2 in the Kobile forest reserve). The species inhabits beech and mixed forests with an important percentage of dead trees. The volume of dead trees was measured only at few sites inhabited by the species and ranged from 42 to 283 m3/ha. Signs of foraging were detected mainly on beech snags and stumps; all nests were found in upright beech snags. In Slovenia, the species is threatened by the low percentage of dead deciduous trees in forests, the construction of new forest roads, the increased annual timber harvest and a weak network of forest reserves. The proposed conservation measures include increasing the amount of dead deciduous trees in managed forests, increasing the area of forest reserves and halting the construction of new forest roads.

Kloskowski, J.; Nieoczym, M.				Knowledge and Management of Aquatic Ecosystems	416			34, 1-15	2015	2015				English	0	0	We examined correlates of amphibian and waterbird diversity related to management practices, with a focus on timing of flooding, at shallow ponds used for common carp Cyprinus carpio culture in Eastern Poland. The age of the stocked fish was a strong predictor of amphibian diversity, with higher scores obtained in ponds with young-of-the-year carp compared to ponds containing older (and larger) fish. Pond cover by emergent vegetation was positively related to diversity of both taxonomic groups. The timing of filling affected the taxonomic richness of the ponds; in contrast to ponds filled in early spring (March-early April), early breeding amphibian species were not recorded in ponds filled later (early May). However, amphibian diversity did not differ between earlyand late-flooded ponds. Early availability of filled ponds favored waterbird species richness and diversity, and the hydroperiod effect overcame the effect of fish age/size. Dissimilar responses to hydroperiod onset may reflect differences between amphibian and bird communities in the nature and strength of interactions with fish. Timing of flooding, which appears to be a neglected determinant of biodiversity in anthropogenic wetlands, should consider the breeding and migration phenology of wildlife species and the presence and population structure of fish.

The study investigated the species richness and the composition of trophic guilds using mist-netting on eight transects (four in burned plots and four in control plots in the same forest fragments). Eight plots (0.12 ha) were also established parallel to each transect to record the number of live trees (DBH >= 10cm), palms, and dead trees. Bamboo stems were quantified in 0.024 ha subplots. No significant difference was found between burned and control plots in the species richness or abundance of birds, nor was any significant pattern found in the NMDS ordination of the composition of the communities or guilds. The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) found that the burned plots were physiognomically distinct, due principally to the number of bamboo stems and dead trees. Multiple regressions based on the PCA scores and bird species richness and abundance found no significant trends. The findings of the present study indicate that the understory bird assemblage of the areas affected by a single wildfire in 2005 had almost totally recuperated eight years after this event.	da Silva, Tatiana Lemos; Acre Fed Univ, Grad Program Ecol & Management Nat Resources, Rio Branco, AC, BR-69915900 BC, Brazil, Brazil.	tatianalemoss@gmail.com	Marques, Antonio Cardoso/D-2235-2011	Marques, Antonio Cardoso/0000-0002-9906-3874			Zoology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry	1687-9708; 1687-9716		Nutrition; Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Neotropical region; South America	Aves [Feeding behaviour / Feeding guilds / comparative study] [Community structure /  / ] [Forest and woodland / Forest / ] [Fire / Wildfire / ] [Brazil / Acre, east / ].

Andersen, Line H.; Sunde, Peter; Loeschcke, Volker; Pertoldi, Cino				Ornis Fennica	92	3		123-143	2015	2015				English	0	37	When a bird population is facing extinction, ecologically artificial conservation actions such as feeding and captive breeding may be considered as temporary efforts to rescue the population remains until environmental conditions for a self-sustaining population have been restored. Population viability analysis can be used to evaluate different management options for endangered bird populations. Here we use the program VORTEX to explore different management strategies using the Danish population of Little Owl (Athene noctua) as a model species. The Little Owl is declining in several countries, including Denmark, where lack of food during the breeding season has been identified as the main reason for the decline. Four scenarios were run, simulating 25 years of population dynamics: (1) "do nothing" scenario, (2) captive breeding scenario where individuals are supplemented to the population, (3) food supplementation or habitat improvement scenario and (4) scenario combining captive breeding and food supplementation/habitat improvements. In scenarios where no management actions were taken the population went extinct within 12 years. When supplementing individuals continuously the population remained extant but the population size remained small. Food supplementation/habitat improvements can restore the population, though there must be capacity to secure food/habitat for a minimum of 100 individuals to minimize genetic losses. By combining food supplementation and the release of captive bred individuals, the population has a chance of being restored and become independent of human aid. This study exemplifies how management scenarios can be used to guide managers to make informed decisions.

Agra, Manuel; Bilenca, David; Codesido, Mariano				Emu	115	3		270-276	2015	2015				English	0	3	The Flooding Pampas is the most important livestock region of Argentina, but is a region where replacement of originally natural, perennial tussock grasses by pasture species is changing the heterogeneity of the grassland system. We evaluated the response of grassland bird assemblages of the Flooding Pampas to planting of Lotus tenuis (Lotus) pasture, which mainly modifies vegetation structure by reducing vertical heterogeneity. Species richness and abundance of birds were compared between fields of Lotus pasture and semi-natural grasslands. Avian species richness and abundance were both greater in semi-natural grassland than in Lotus pasture. When grouped by nesting habits (grassland specialists, generalists), species richness and abundance of grassland specialists was greater in semi-natural grassland, whereas richness and abundance of generalist species was greater in Lotus pasture. An indicator-species analysis showed that five grassland birds were closely linked to semi-natural grassland vegetation, with two of those species - Hudson's Canastero (Asthenes hudsoni) and Bay-capped Wren-Spinetail (Spartonoica maluroides) of conservation concern. 1 In contrast, generalist species, such as Southern Lapwings (Vanellus chilensis) and Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia), were associated with Lotus pasture. Planting of Lotus pasture has negative effects on species that naturally occur in tussock grassland. Grassland management methods, such as intercropping and rotational grazing, could help reconcile the effects of livestock production and the conservation grassland bird conservation in the Flooding Pampas.

Augusto Cardoni, Daniel; Pablo Isacch, Juan; Iribarne, Oscar				Emu	115	1		12-19	2015	2015				English	0	17	Saltmarshes of Spartina densiflora in south-eastern South America have been modified by anthropogenic activities, mainly production of livestock. We examined the effect of the intensity of cattle production on the structure of saltmarsh vegetation and the effect of these changes to vegetation on the richness, composition and size of the avian populations and the abundance of nests. The levels of cattle production were based on the combined intensity of prescribed burning and cattle grazing, classed as: (1) High grazing - High burning (HH), (2) Low grazing - Low burning (LL) and (3) No grazing - No burning (NN). Cattle production altered the vegetation structure of saltmarshes and indirectly modified the richness, composition and size of their avian populations and the abundance of nests. Saltmarshes with either LL or NN production levels were inhabited by tall grassland specialists and generalists and by species specialised to live in a mosaic of short and tall grassland patches. Conversely, saltmarshes with HH production levels were inhabited by short-grassland specialists. That avian species diversity does not differ between S. densiflora saltmarsh subject to low or no human impacts has several potential interpretations, which are discussed. These findings have implications for management of grasslands to maintain avian diversity.

Manipulative studies allow for strong inference on effects and confirmation of patterns from observational studies. We estimated bird-territory density within forest stands (2.89-62ha) for 19 years of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP), a 100-year experiment designed to study the effects of even-age and uneven-age management on wildlife. We spot-mapped territories of 15 species in 228 stands for 5 years before treatment and 14 years after treatment to assess the effects of stand-level silvicultural treatments (clearcut, select cut, thin, and no-harvest) applied within even-age, uneven-age, or no-harvest (control) management sites and year on avian territory density. We used 2 a priori contrasts to compare pre-treatment bird densities with densities during early (3-5 yr) and late (12-14 yr) post-treatment periods. The interaction of silvicultural treatment and year had significant effects on the densities of all 15 species. Densities of hooded warbler (Setophaga citrina), indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea), prairie warbler (Setophaga discolor), and yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) increased significantly 3-5 years post-treatment with the greatest changes in clearcuts, but densities 12-14 years post-treatment did not differ from pre-treatment densities. Densities of Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and especially ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) had significant decreases in clearcut stands after treatment and lesser decreases in select cut or thin stands post-treatment. Densities of black-and-white warbler (Mniotilta varia), eastern wood-pewee (Contopus virens), and Kentucky warbler (Geothlypis formosa) increased in clearcut, thin, and select cut stands, but these increases were short-lived and sporadic by year after treatment. Densities of Acadian flycatcher and ovenbird remained lower in clearcut stands than no-harvest stands 13 years post-treatment. The results of this manipulative experiment were mostly consistent with our predictions of bird response to common silvicultural treatments in these forests. Managers can use these species-specific responses to silvicultural treatment to guide management decisions for target species or to balance management practices in a landscape to meet the needs of multiple species.

Maya-Elizarraras, Elisa; Schondube, Jorge E.				Forest Ecology and Management	335			118-128	Jan 1 2015	2015				English	0	21	Oak forests around the world have been widely used to obtain firewood and produce charcoal and like other habitats have been affected by the increasing development of livestock activities. Oak forests from western Mexico are one of the five priority habitats for the conservation of birds at a continental level and are the repository of the highest number of endemic bird species in this megadiverse country. We studied how charcoal extraction and the use of oak forest for cattle grazing affect bird communities. We focused our work on oak forest patches with four different management units that include three successional stages that occur after most of the trees have been removed for charcoal production and cattle-grazing is conducted, and mature oak forest patches with little wood extraction and no cattle-grazing. We used unlimited radius point counts to survey avian communities, and compared their richness, composition, density, structure and similarity among the different management units. We found that resident bird species, summer migrants and Neotropical migrant bird species used the four management units differently. Resident bird species used all habitat units similarly. Winter migrants as a group were present in the different management units, however while some species used habitats with cattle, other species used habitats with no cattle-grazing. Finally, summer migrants used habitat units with tall trees and high values of tree and shrub richness, and tended to avoid the early successional unit. Both charcoal extraction and cattle grazing worked in synergy decreasing the species richness and the equity of the bird communities. Management strategies should include active conservation of undisturbed oak forest areas because they play an essential role to-maintain resident bird species in the landscape. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Jungers, Jacob M.; Arnold, Todd W.; Lehman, Clarence				American Midland Naturalist	173	1		122-132	Jan 2015	2015				English	1	39	Grasslands enrolled in conservation programs provide important habitat for nesting game birds and waterfowl, but conservation grasslands have been targeted as a source of biomass for bioenergy and this could impact nesting birds. We studied the effects of biomass harvest on nest success and density using 109 blue-winged teal (Anas discors), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) nests found in southwestern Minnesota during 2009 (pretreatment) and 2010 (posttreatment). Grassland biomass was harvested in late autumn of 2009 with production-scale machinery. Harvest treatments included controls (0% biomass removal), partial harvest (50 or 75% biomass removal), and full harvest (100% biomass removal) from 8 ha plots. Nest success averaged 31% and was not influenced by biomass harvest. Daily survival rates were greater for nests located closer to wetlands. Estimated total nest density (0.42 nests ha 21; corrected for survivorship) was similar across harvest treatments, but within-plot analysis revealed nest density was greater in unharvested refuge regions. Estimated nest density was positively correlated with vegetation height and the spatial extent of wetlands surrounding each plot. Harvesting relatively small-scale patches of conservation grasslands in late autumn does not appear to be detrimental to nesting ducks and pheasants the following spring, but managers should consider leaving unharvested refuges near wetlands when harvesting large continuous tracts.

They hold high numbers of organisms of high nature conservation values. Due to changes in agricultural practices, wet grasslands and their typical inhabitants are threatened. In a project called "Action Plan for Wet Grasslands and Meadow Birds", which was supported by the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt we tried to aid decisions on how and where resources for the protection of wet grasslands can be used in the most effective way. For this we evaluated (by a literature review and by interviews) the existing experience in the protection and the management of wet grasslands. In this paper, I investigate factors that probably influence the success of management measures: time since implementation of measures, size and geographical isolation of the meadow bird population. In addition I test correlations of population trends of different species. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of protection measures and habitat management at wet grassland sites, 90 cases from different European countries were assembled. Protection approaches included agri-environment schemes, the p urchase of land, measures on state-owned land and special brood protection schemes. Habitat management included several restrictions on farming activities and several alternations of the water regime. On average, positive effects of management measures on meadow bird populations occurred mainly in the years immediately following the measures. Later, populations declined at most sites. Long-term positive effects were only visible in Curlew populations. In Curlews, but also in other species effects were stronger at sites with small populations. In Black-tailed Godwits there was no evidence for an impact of geographical isolation on the success of measures. Possible reasons for the population declines several years after the implementation of management measure include food shortage (due to flooding and/or lack of nutrients), unintended habitat deterioration (growth of higher plants due to lack of farming), and activity of nest and brood predators. Predators might have been attracted by high densities of meadow bird nests, and they might have learnt to exploit this food resource. It can be supposed that meadow bird populations need to move from such sites to sites with a lower predation risk from time to time. The conclusion for the management of meadow bird populations would be that it is necessary to offer "spare" sites for breeding in order to allow meadow birds to get (temporarily) rid of too high predation rates.

Boletin del Instituto Oceanografico de Venezuela Universidad de Oriente	54	1		43-55	2015	2015				Spanish	0	0	In last decades, populations and habitats of aquatic birds inhabiting coastal lagoons have declined dramatically, because to several anthropic factors affecting their ecological dynamic. We evaluated an avian community associated to two lagoonlets sited to western Cumana: El Estadio (EE) and Aeropuerto Viejo (AV), using transects fixed distance, during nine (EE) and five (Av) months, respectively. We calculated several seasonal community indexes, i.e., Relative Abundance (RA), Richness (# spp.), Simpson Diversity (l), Evenness (J'), Occurrence (C), Similarity (SJ) and Specific Importance (SI). We identified 31 species, belonging to 13 families. Scolopacidae (10 spp.), Charadriidae (5 spp.) and Laridae (4 spp.) showed the highest species number. In all, fourteen was migrating Nearctic birds, six resident birds and eleven intratropical migrating birds. Richness was gently higher in AV than EE (24 spp. vs. 22 spp.). The l mean was higher in AV than EE but no significant differences. Species index SJ between lagoonlets resulted 41,66%. The flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber) and small shorebirds belonging to genus Calidris spp. showed the higher RE in EE and AV, respectively. These results would be revealing the importance of small wetlands for migrating and resident aquatic birds, particularly the flamingo; the presence of this species in these suburban wetlands would be showing the successful conservation initiatives.

Suwanrat, Saranphat; Ngoprasert, Dusit; Sutherland, Christopher; Suwanwaree, Pongthep; Savini, Tommaso				Global Ecology and Conservation	3			596-606	Jan 2015	2015				English	3	5	Tropical Asian Galliformes are secretive and difficult to survey. Many of these species are considered "at risk'' due to habitat degradation although reliable density estimates are lacking. Using camera trapping and distance sampling data collected on the Siamese Fireback (Lophura diardi) in northeastern Thailand, we compared density estimates for pristine and degraded lowland forest. Density was poorly estimated using distance sampling, likely due to small sample size arising from poor visibility in dense vegetation and bird's sensitivity to observers. We analysed camera trap data using both count-based and presence/absence-based methods. Those density estimates had narrower confidence intervals than those obtained using distance sampling. Estimated density was higher in dry evergreen forest (5.6 birds km-2), than in old forest plantations (0.2 birds km-2), perhaps because dense forest habitats provide Firebacks with more resources and refuge from predation. Our results suggest that camera trap data can be used for estimating density of cryptic terrestrial bird species inhabiting tropical forest that lack unique identification markings. However, this technique requires that the effective sampling area is known and thus requires knowledge of the animal home range size. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Broedvogels van Noord-Friesland Buitendijks en de invloed van verkweldering op hun aantallen.	Bos, Daan; Engelmoer, Meinte; Feddema, Jaap; Koffijberg, Kees				Limosa	88	1		31-42	2015	2015				Dutch	0	0	The population of breeding birds on the salt marshes along the Frisian coast (NFB) has been studied for over more than 20 years. Within this period many factors have changed, affecting both vegetation and bird densities. One of these is the restoration of salt marsh habitat by managed or 'accidental' realignment of dykes. In this paper we evaluate the development of the breeding bird community on NFB and focus on four different parts that were restored to salt marsh in 2001, 1992 and 1990 and 1975 respectively. Since 1991, 60 species of breeding birds have been recorded on nfb, mostly colonial species and meadow birds. Both on the salt marsh area and in the summer polders (separated from the salt marsh by a low dyke and flooded only during exceptionally high tides), the number of breeding bird species has increased. A crash of colonial species (mainly Black-headed Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus and Pied Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta) after 2000 is assumed to be mainly driven by increased predation (presumably by Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes). Today, highest densities of breeding birds occur in the summer polders. The de-embanked salt marshes generally show declining densities of primary meadow birds, towards densities that are typical of salt marshes. With the restoration into salt marsh, the risk of inundation of nests and drowning of fledglings has increased, reinforced by an increased frequency of storm surges during the breeding season. Also vegetation has changed, to a large extent in interaction with grazing. Although the confounding effects of ditching, predation, local grazing management and regional food availability are relevant when considering the observed trends, a negative effect of restoration on primary meadow birds was nonetheless detected. The strong decrease of colonial species however is not associated with the restoration of salt marsh habitat and has occurred nearly simultaneously in salt marshes along the neighbouring Groningen coast.

Werema, Chacha				Scopus	34			40-46	Jan 2015	2015				English	0	0	In July 2010 an assessment of abundance and diversity of understorey birds was undertaken in Mangala Forest using mist netting. However, in October 2010 a non-intentional fire burned the entire forest and this event provided a good opportunity to assess the extent to which birds were affected. Assessment, using mist netting, was carried out one week, three months and eight months after the fire, and comparisons made with data obtained before the forest was burned. In total, 28 species were recorded. Of these, the number recorded before the fire, one week post-fire, three months post-fire and eight months post-fire was 22, 3, 3 and 11 species respectively. The understorey bird species diversity before the forest was burned was substantially higher than diversities found afterwards. The results confirm that forest burning can have a severe negative impact on bird abundance and species richness and should be halted. Because fires start from the surrounding farmland, there is a need to construct and maintain fire breaks around entire forests.

Amy; Whelan, Christopher J.; Minor, Emily S.				Ecological Applications	24	8		2132-2143	Dec 2014	2014				English	10	185	Residential yards comprise a substantial portion of urban landscapes, and the collective effects of the management of many individual yards may scale up to affect urban biodiversity. We conducted bird surveys and social surveys in Chicago-area (Illinois, USA) residential neighborhoods to identify the relative importance of yard design and management activities for native birds. We found that groups of neighboring yards, in the aggregate, were more important for native bird species richness than environmental characteristics at the neighborhood or landscape scale. The ratio of evergreen to deciduous trees in yards and the percentage of yards with trees and plants with fruits or berries were positively associated with native bird species richness, whereas the number of outdoor cats had a negative association. The number of birdfeeders was not an important predictor for native species richness. We also found that migratory birds were observed on transects with more wildlife-friendly features in yards, and nonnative birds were observed on transects with greater numbers of outdoor cats and dogs. Our results highlight the potential importance of residential matrix management as a conservation strategy in urban areas.	Belaire, J.

Sanabria, Catalina; Lavelle, Patrick; Fonte, Steven J.				Applied Soil Ecology	84			24-30	Dec 2014	2014				English	1	101	Ants represent a widespread and functionally diverse taxonomic group that are both sensitive to land management and serve as important regulators of key soil processes. Building upon this idea, we sought to understand the impacts of agricultural management on ant communities in the Orinoco River Basin of eastern Colombia and to identify species that could be used as indicators of soil-based ecosystem services. Ants were collected and identified from the soil and litter layer within 75 fields (nine TSBF subsamples along a transect in each field) divided among five common agricultural land uses in the region: 1) annual crops (maize, soy and rice), 2) rubber plantations, 3) oil palm plantations, 4) improved pastures (based on Brachiaria spp.), and 5) semi-natural savannas. As expected, land management was found to greatly influence ant communities. Improved pastures showed the highest species richness (6.9 species per transect) and semi-natural savanna the greatest abundance of ants (145 individuals per transect). Within each of these fields a suite of soil and agroecosystem characteristics were measured and combined into synthetic indicators of five soil-based ecosystem services: 1) nutrient provision, 2) water storage and regulation, 3) maintenance of soil structure, 4) climate regulation services and 5) soil biodiversity and biological activity. Ant species were then associated with these synthetic indicators using the IndVal method to identify indicator species for each of the five consolidated ecosystem services measured. In total, 14 indicator species were identified and found to be significantly associated with either the high or low provision of each of the five services. The development of such bioindicators offers a rapid and relatively inexpensive tool to facilitate land management and policy decisions in this biologically diverse and rapidly changing region of Colombia.

Mohren, Sean R.; Rumble, Mark A.; Anderson, Stanley H.				Prairie Naturalist	46	2		62-69	Dec 2014	2014				English	0	0	Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are usually associated with forest disturbance resulting in recently killed trees. While black-backed woodpeckers are attracted to areas affected by these disturbances, in the Black Hills they exist during interim disturbance periods in largely undisturbed forests. In 2012, a petition for listing black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills as a distinct population segment identified current population size and the population size necessary to minimize risk of extinction as key components of the decision process. Our objective was to estimate the population size of black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills National Forest of South Dakota and Wyoming during a period of relatively low disturbance (e.g., 2000-2001). The estimated population was 641 (95% CI = 405-990) and 456 (95% CI = 293-705) breeding pairs in 2000 and 2001, respectively. The average density of 0.12/km2 (95% CI = 0.07-0.18) was similar to densities in other undisturbed forests. This population estimate provides a starting point for population viability analyses during periods of relatively low disturbance by fire or insects.

Patton, David R.; Hofstetter, Richard W.; Bailey, John D.; Benoit, Mary Ann				U S Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station General Technical Report RMRS-GTR	332			i-iii, 1-44	Dec 2014	2014				English	0	0	Species richness (SR) is a tool that managers can use to include diversity in planning and decision-making and is a convenient and useful way to characterize the first level of biological diversity. A richness list derived from existing inventories enhances a manager's understanding of the complexity of the plant and animal communities they manage. Without a list of species, resource management decisions may have negative or unknown effects on all species occupying a forest type. Without abundance data, a common quantitative index for species diversity cannot be determined. However, SR data can include life history information from published literature to enhance the SR value. This report provides an example of how inventory information can characterize the complexity of biological diversity in the ponderosa pine forest type in Arizona. The SR process broadly categorizes the number of plant and animal life forms to arrive at a composite species richness value. Common sense dictates that plants and animals exist in a biotic community because that community has sufficient resources to sustain life. A mixture of forest attributes maintained in time and space fundamentally supports a certain level of diversity as indicated by a richness value. As a management guideline, it is a reasonable assumption that the variety among plant communities and structures increases the potential for maintaining diverse kinds of animal habitats and resultant populations.

Long, Ashley M.; Jensen, William E.; Matlack, Raymond S.				Western North American Naturalist	74	4		396-404	Dec 2014	2014				English	2	17	Encroachment of woody plants is widespread in semiarid grasslands of the southwestern United States. Wildlife responses to shrub removal techniques in the region are relatively unknown. In 2008 and 2009, we examined avian responses to prescribed burning of ungrazed shortgrass prairie within a study area (4811 ha) near Amarillo, Texas, that is heavily encroached by honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and cholla (Opuntia spp.). Specifically, we compared relative abundance, species richness, and species diversity of breeding birds across large, spatially replicated experimental plots burned every 2 or 4 years since 2002 and unburned controls. We found no significant differences in the mean relative abundance of most species across the treatments. However, Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), Cassin's Sparrow (Peucaea cassinii), and Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) were more abundant in less frequently burned plots and unburned controls. We found no differences in species richness or diversity across the treatments. Limited variation in avian responses across the treatments likely reflects the uniform pattern of vegetation structure we found across the plots, despite repeated application of prescribed fire at 2- and 4-year intervals over a 7-year period. Differences in bird species assemblages among the burn treatments might be more prominent in future years as prescribed burning continues.

A large population of gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) is present, and we documented the gopher frog (Lithobates capito), American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus), eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), and Florida pine snake (Pituophis melanoleucus). We recorded 68 families of Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) totaling 157 individuals and three active clusters of red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis). The easement and adjacent lands had 16 possible previous nest sites of Florida sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), seven Audubon's crested caracara (Caracara cheriway) territories, five southern bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nests, and six swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus) nests. We observed signs of Florida black bear (Ursus americanus), and a male Florida panther (Puma concolor) moved onto the property and died of unknown causes. More intensive surveys would be necessary to document additional wildlife species and to determine population levels. We recommend the timely use of prescribed fire as a management tool to maintain or restore dry prairie, scrubby flatwoods, and scrub habitats for wildlife, cattle, and biological diversity.

Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences Series B	281	1795		20141742	Nov 22 2014	2014				English	4	109	Road building can lead to significant deleterious impacts on biodiversity, varying from direct road-kill mortality and direct habitat loss associated with road construction, to more subtle indirect impacts from edge effects and fragmentation. However, little work has been done to evaluate the specific effects of road networks and biodiversity loss beyond the more generalized effects of habitat loss. Here, we compared forest bird species richness and composition in the municipalities of Santarem and Belterra in Para state, eastern Brazilian Amazon, with a road network metric called 'roadless volume (RV)' at the scale of small hydrological catchments (averaging 3721 ha). We found a significant positive relationship between RV and both forest bird richness and the average number of unique species (species represented by a single record) recorded at each site. Forest bird community composition was also significantly affected by RV. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between RV and forest cover, suggesting that road networks may impact biodiversity independently of changes in forest cover. However, variance partitioning analysis indicated that RV has partially independent and therefore additive effects, suggesting that RV and forest cover are best used in a complementary manner to investigate changes in biodiversity. Road impacts on avian species richness and composition independent of habitat loss may result from road-dependent habitat disturbance and fragmentation effects that are not captured by total percentage habitat cover, such as selective logging, fire, hunting, traffic disturbance, edge effects and road-induced fragmentation.

Cullinane-Anthony, Bridget L.; Seefelt, Nancy E.; Corace, R. Gregory, III; Kashian, Daniel M.; Gehring, Thomas M.				Forest Ecology and Management	331			93-103	Nov 1 2014	2014				English	2	59	Stand-replacing fires are part of the natural disturbance regime that maintain jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) forests of northern Lower Michigan. Currently, the occurrence and extent of wildfire is much reduced relative to the past and young jack pine plantations specifically managed for Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii Baird) are a prominent feature on the landscape. Stringers, or patches of residual prefire forest, are a unique feature left behind after wildfires which are not often accounted for in plantation management. In this study, we examined the ecological value of stringers from an avian biodiversity perspective by comparing bird assemblages found within stringers to those in the surrounding forest (non-stringers). Our objective was to answer two research questions: (I) do stringers have unique bird communities relative to the surrounding vegetation (forest or plantation)?; and (2) how much of the variation in bird communities can be explained by differences in vegetation structure and composition between stringers and non-stringers? We conducted breeding and non-breeding season point counts and used abundance data to compare bird species found within stringers and non-stringers at seven sites grouped by time since disturbance. Species richness was significantly higher (P = 0.01) in the stringers when the non-stringers were 30-40 years old, with 32 species discovered in the stringers and 29 species in the non-stringers. During the breeding season, bird assemblages differed between stringers and non-stringers when the non-stringers were <12 years old (multi-response permutation procedures; T = -10.11, A = 0.07, P = <0.00), but no differences were observed when non-stringers were 30-40 years old or >40 years old. Non-breeding bird communities differed between stringers and non-stringers only when the non-stringer was a recently planted (<5 years old) plantation (T = -2.15, A = 0.09, P = 0.02). Differences in bird assemblages appear to be driven by the vegetation structure of stringers and non-stringers where fires were recent, but increasing similarity in vegetation structure occurs with time since fire; over time the importance of stringers for avian biodiversity is reduced. Our results suggest that stringers are important for bird communities, especially in recently disturbed areas, and that these biological legacies should be considered where jack pine management attempts to emulate natural patterns and processes.

Frick, Karen M.; Ritchie, Alison L.; Krauss, Siegfried L.				Restoration Ecology	22	6		832-840	Nov 2014	2014				English	1	55	Ecosystem functionality is an increasingly important objective of ecological restoration. Despite this, a few studies have rigorously assessed reproductive functionality within restored plant populations, and it is largely assumed that pollinators follow restoration of plant communitiesbuild it and they will come. Here, we applied an ecological genetic approach to determine the impact of spatial separation on mating in Banksia menziesii (Proteaceae), a dominant bird-pollinated species of Banksia woodlands of Western Australia. All plants at three post-mining restored sites (n = 72 (13 years old), n = 21 (8 years old), and n = 20 (9 years old)), as well as a sample from an adjacent natural reference site (n = 42), were genotyped at nine microsatellite loci. Seed set, mating system parameters, realized pollen dispersal through the assignment of paternity to seed, and avian pollinator species composition, abundance and behavior, were assessed. All patches displayed equivalent heterozygosity (He = 0.53-0.59) and very weak genetic divergence (FST 0.01). Seed of plants within restored sites showed complete outcrossing and relatively high seed set, 26% of which were sired by pollen donors located beyond the local patch. Similar abundance and movement of nectar-feeding birds was observed in restored and natural sites, despite lower bird species diversity in the restored site, where a smaller, less aggressive species was dominant. Our results demonstrate the restitution of wide outcrossing in these restored Banksia patches within an active mine-site, and suggest that restored bird-pollinated Banksia populations are resilient to human impacts, due largely to their generalist pollinator requirements and highly-mobile avian pollinators.

Peterson, Stephen L.; Rockwell, Robert F.; Witte, Christopher R.; Koons, David N.				Condor	116	4		527-537	Nov 2014	2014				English	4	48	Increased growth of the midcontinental population of Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) has led to overgrazing and habitat degradation at their Arctic and sub-Arctic breeding grounds. This habitat degradation has been shown to induce a trophic cascade that negatively affects plant, insect, and other avian species that share these habitats. In conjunction with a long-term study of the impacts of Lesser Snow Geese on habitat, we examined the dual influences of climate and long-term habitat change on the nesting occurrence of Savannah Sparrows near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Using multistate occupancy models, we found that variability in early-summer temperature and precipitation modulated year-to-year variability in nesting occurrence and detection probabilities. Extreme warm and wet conditions in early summer can benefit breeding Savannah Sparrows across the landscape. However, such events have not been prevalent enough to override the [approximately]80% decline in Savannah Sparrow nesting occurrence over 36 yr. This dramatic decline can be attributed to the legacy of Lesser Snow Goose foraging, which has led to an 84% reduction in preferred shrub habitat for nesting Savannah Sparrows. Management actions targeted at reducing Lesser Snow Goose abundance and habitat restoration will be needed to allow sympatric Savannah Sparrows and functionally similar species to recover.

Harris, Linda; Nel, Ronel; Holness, Stephen; Sink, Kerry; Schoeman, David				Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science	150	A		45-57	Oct 5 2014	2014				English	1	51	Representative and adequate reserve networks are key to conserving biodiversity. This begs the question, how much of which features need to be placed in protected areas? Setting specifically-derived conservation targets for most ecosystems is common practice; however, this has never been done for sandy beaches. The aims of this paper, therefore, are to propose a methodology for setting conservation targets for sandy beach ecosystems; and to pilot the proposed method using data describing biodiversity patterns and processes from microtidal beaches in South Africa. First, a classification scheme of valued features of beaches is constructed, including: biodiversity features; unique features; and important processes. Second, methodologies for setting targets for each feature under different data-availability scenarios are described. From this framework, targets are set for features characteristic of microtidal beaches in South Africa, as follows. 1) Targets for dune vegetation types were adopted from a previous assessment, and ranged 19-100%. 2) Targets for beach morphodynamic types (habitats) were set using species area relationships (SARs). These SARs were derived from species richness data from 142 sampling events around the South African coast (extrapolated to total theoretical species richness estimates using previously-established species accumulation curve relationships), plotted against the area of the beach (calculated from Google Earth imagery). The species-accumulation factor (z) was 0.22, suggesting a baseline habitat target of 27% is required to protect 75% of the species. This baseline target was modified by heuristic principles, based on habitat rarity and threat status, with final values ranging 27-40%. 3) Species targets were fixed at 20%, modified using heuristic principles based on endemism, threat status, and whether or not beaches play an important role in the species' life history, with targets ranging 20 -100%. 4) Targets for processes and 5) important assemblages were set at 50%, following other studies. 6) Finally, a target for an outstanding feature (the Alexandria dunefield) was set at 80% because of its national, international and ecological importance. The greatest shortfall in the current target-setting process is in the lack of empirical models describing the key beach processes, from which robust ecological thresholds can be derived. As for many other studies, our results illustrate that the conservation target of 10% for coastal and marine systems proposed by the Convention on Biological Diversity is too low to conserve sandy beaches and their biota.

Aims In areas important for biodiversity there is an urgent need to assess large-scale variation in the biodiversity value of habitats to inform management. We carried out a large-scale survey to assess the conservation value of sub-arctic, Icelandic bird habitats. Methods Bird counts were carried out on 200 transects in the five most common vegetated habitat types in South Iceland. Based on these counts, breeding bird density and diversity were compared between habitats and total population sizes of common species in these habitats were calculated. Results Overall, eight species (seven waders and Meadow Pipit) composed over 95% of all birds counted. The combined density of those species exceeded 275 birds/km2 in all habitats. The two wettest habitat types had the highest density of birds. Conclusion Wet habitats in lowland South Iceland held particularly high densities of breeding birds, notably waders, which constitute populations of international importance. Wet habitat types are generally of higher value for more species, than dryer ones.

Livestock grazing is being increasingly used to promote native species diversity at both the pasture and landscape scales. Several federally and state-listed vertebrates and insects respond positively to grazing to improve habitat by opening and lowering grassland vegetation.

Natural Areas Journal	34	4		409-422	Oct 2014	2014				English	1	28	Population declines of several successional-scrub bird species are partly associated with decreased habitat availability as abandoned farmlands return to forest and recently harvested forests regrow. Restoration of mixed-oak (Quercus spp.) forest is also a concern because of widespread oak regeneration failure, especially on moist, productive sites where competition from faster-growing tree species is fierce following stand-replacing disturbances. Several silvicultural methods are proposed to promote oak regeneration but many are not experimentally tested, especially on productive sites. We surveyed birds in 19 stands to assess response to initial application of three proposed oak regeneration treatments on productive sites: prescribed burning (B); oak shelterwood by midstory herbicide (OSW); shelterwood harvests (SW); and controls (C), for one breeding season before, and two breeding seasons after, implementation. Relative density of successional-scrub species Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), Eastern Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), and Chestnut-sided Warblers (Setophaga pensylvanica) increased, while Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) decreased within 11 to 18 months after SW harvests; understory disturbance treatments B or OSW had no effect. Our results indicated that partial harvests created habitat for breeding birds associated with both young and mature forests, whereas understory treatments had little effect. Additionally, we show that even small patches of young forest habitat are used by more individuals and more species of breeding birds than surrounding closed-canopy forest, and may benefit successional-scrub species by enabling their occurrence in an otherwise forested landscape. Absence of several lower-elevation successional-scrub bird species in our mid-elevation SW harvests suggests that comprehensive conservation in the southern Appalachians necessitates creating and maintaining young forest habitats across elevation gradients.

Agri-environment schemes (AES) were introduced in the late 1980s in European Union countries as a solution to combat biodiversity decline. We examined the effectiveness of AES in enhancing biodiversity in a new EU member country (Estonia) over the period of 2010-2012. We compared species numbers and abundance of bumblebees and birds, plus cover of flowers, between three farming systems in two regions of Estonia. Farm types included conventional and two under AES (organic and a less strict environmentally friendly management agreement). Environmentally friendly management practices in Estonia include diversified crop rotations, at least 15% of arable land (including rotational grasslands) under legumes, permanent grassland strips, protection of landscape elements, reduced applications of agrochemicals, etc. The two selected regions (North and South) differed in landscape structure, soil types and crop yields. Flower cover and bird species richness and abundance without the dominant species (skylark) were higher on organic farms. Bumblebee species richness was significantly higher under both types of AES than under conventional farming. Flower cover, abundance and species richness of bumblebees and birds were significantly higher in the more heterogeneous landscapes of Southern Estonia. Environmentally friendly management may be a viable alternative to organic farming for a widely accepted, simple but large-scale greening of agricultural landscapes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we use an example to show that restoration ecologists can evaluate the risk of creating ecological traps. We reviewed the literature and synthesized data to evaluate the risk that restored riparian forests create ecological traps for riparian birds by attracting dense populations of the brood parasite, Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater; hereafter cowbird) in the Central Valley of California, U.S. We found that most riparian bird populations are not highly vulnerable to cowbird parasitism, that there were no differences in cowbird density or parasitism rates between restored and remnant riparian forests, and that the riparian bird community responded positively to restoration. We concluded that riparian restoration in California's Central Valley has a low risk of creating ecological traps through cowbird parasitism. We recommend that restoration ecologists consider the potential for creating an ecological trap early and throughout the restoration design and implementation process, and include plans to monitor species responses to restoration, both in restored areas and in source populations nearby, as well as any specific conditions associated with a potential trap.

Timothy; Bell, Douglas A.				Ecological Applications	24	6		1251-1257	Sep 2014	2014				English	2	103	Population viability analysis (PVA) has been an important tool for evaluating species extinction risk and alternative management strategies, but there is little information on how well PVA predicts population trajectories following changes in management actions. We tested previously published predictions from a stage-structured PVA of Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) in California, USA (Wootton and Bell 1992), against population trajectories following the 1992 termination of statewide, active management (population supplementation of captive-reared young). In the absence of extensive post-management monitoring, we developed surrogate estimates of breeding population size by calibrating several citizen science data sets (Christmas Bird Count, CBC; and North American Breeding Bird Survey, BBS) to intensive population surveys taken primarily during the active management period. CBC abundance data standardized by observer effort exhibited a strong relationship to intensive survey data (r2 = 0.971), indicated significantly reduced annual population growth rates after management was terminated ([lambda] = 0.023 [plus or minus] 0.013 SE) than when supplementation occurred ([lambda] = 0.089 [plus or minus] 0.023 SE), and demonstrated an increasing population as predicted by the PVA. The population trajectory fell within the 95% CI of stochastic simulations of the model either with or without density dependence and assuming either measurement error or process error, but models with process error were most strongly supported by the data. These results indicate that PVA can quantitatively anticipate population trajectories following changes in management, highlight the importance of post-management monitoring of species of concern, and illustrate the benefits of using management changes as large-scale experiments to more rigorously test PVA.

Segura, Amalia; Castano-Santamaria, Javier; Laiolo, Paola; Ramon Obeso, Jose				Ecological Research	29	5		925-936	Sep 2014	2014				English	0	55	Bio-indicators are often proposed to set conservation priorities in forest habitat owing to the difficulties of determining forest intrinsic ecological value. Here, we tested the efficacy of a number of potential bird indicator groups in monitoring beech Fagus sylvatica forest status by analyzing their associations with the spatial and structural variables of forest vegetation that indicate key ecological patterns and processes. The density of cavity nesting birds, indicating the presence of limited forest resources (resource-limited indicators), was influenced by tree species diversity, vertical species mingling and diameter, parameters reflecting maturity, gap-dynamic processes, as well as resource and shelter availability. Heterogeneity in shrub species composition, another parameter depending on forest dynamics, was positively associated with the occurrence of Capercaillie, a "flagship" species for forest conservation. The presence of woodpeckers, a "keystone" group that provides shelter and foraging substrate to other organisms, was positively affected by the basal area of standing dead trees that is indirectly associated with natural nutrient availability. These findings suggest that single indicators fail to provide a complete assessment of forest status, and their use in monitoring or managing forest ecosystem need to be contextualized to specific ecological patterns. The combined use of several indicators, representing various taxa, functions and life histories, appears to be preferable, and is logistically feasible if these can be surveyed together. Several indicators would likely display a wider range of sensitivities to the modification of natural processes and permit more comprehensive tracking of forest dynamics than single flagship, keystone or resource-limited indicators.

Restoration Ecology	22	5		616-624	Sep 2014	2014				English	3	17	Using mechanical treatments to mimic natural disturbances is becoming a standard management and restoration approach. In the Sierra Nevada, as throughout much of western North America, much of aspen habitat is in poor health. Because of the high ecological value of healthy aspen, and its limited extent on the landscape, restoration to reverse the decline and improve stand health has become a management priority in the region. To evaluate the ecological effects of mechanically removing competing conifers to restore aspen in the Sierra Nevada, we compared vegetation characteristics and bird abundance in treated and untreated aspen stands on the Lassen National Forest before and up to 13 years after mechanical conifer removal. Treatments reduced total canopy cover and increased herbaceous cover and the number of aspen stems, while shrub and overstory aspen covers were unchanged. Of 10 aspen focal bird species, 7 increased in abundance following treatment relative to controls, including all species associated with early seral aspen habitat and cavity nesting species; none declined. In contrast, of the six conifer focal species, the four associated with denser conifer habitat declined as a result of the treatments. The two species associated with conifer edges and understory cover increased. Our results demonstrate mechanical conifer removal treatments can provide ecologically meaningful changes in habitat for the avian community and are an effective tool for restoring ecological values of degraded aspen habitat for birds in the Sierra Nevada.

Ecology (Washington D C)	95	9		2537-2547	Sep 2014	2014				English	4	53	Census-based studies document changes in population size of animal species in response to wildfires, but mechanisms involving behavior of individuals and the effects on reproductive success are usually unknown. I developed a conceptual model explaining the persistence of cavity-nesting birds on the landscape after fires depending on carrying capacity (food supply) of the habitat and the philopatry and territoriality of the species. The breeding density, nest site characteristics, and reproductive success of Northern Flickers Colaptes auratus was studied before and after low-to moderate-severity fires on replicated plots. The density and spatial distribution of nests did not change in a consistent way after fires, but the rates of cavity excavation increased and characteristics of nest sites changed as such decay class of the tree. Laying dates were delayed and clutches were smaller in freshly excavated vs. reused cavities on the burned sites. Breeding philopatry caused a shift to older age classes in the population. Depredation of nests by small mammals increased during the first three years after fires, reducing the number of young produced per nest attempt on burned plots. The study shows that, even when fire does not reduce the density of breeding pairs, there may be detrimental effects detected only by monitoring the behavior and reproduction of individuals.

As other animal communities, avifauna may be a good representative of habitat alterations, both as the species and functional levels. In order to attend the initiative of Mesoamerican Biological Corridor initiative (CBM) in the state of Tabasco, we studied the diversity of birds in two silvopastoral systems: scattered trees in pastures (ADP), and trees in boundary-hedgerows (AL). For this, we applied the fixed radius counting point method in three priority sites in Tabasco's CBM during the dry and wet season of 2011, and a total of 56, 60 and 62 points were evaluated in Huimanguillo, Tenosique and Tacotalpa, respectively. We observed 2 084 individuals of 154 species (79-89% of expected diversity) and 36 bird families. We detected 92, 87 and 85 species in Huimanguillo, Tenosique and Tacotalpa, respectively, including 35 protected species, of which 23, 19 and 16 in each locality, respectively. All sites showed high diversity (H'>=3.20), low species dominance (D>=0.08) and high equitability (J>=0.77). Species composition showed differences between sites, being most similar Tacotalpa and Tenosique. Ten species were considered characteristic for sites. Although the silvopastoral system did contain protected species, the low diversity and the early successional character of the arboreal components were not attractive to frugivorous bird species. Diversification with native trees can improve the systems to create a complementary habitat and to increase landscape connectivity. The management of silvopastoral practices on cattle dominated landscapes in Tabasco could improve its ecological quality, and thus achieve the CBM's objectives of biodiversity conservation combined-with human economic activities.

Newson, Stuart E.; Oliver, Tom H.; Gillings, Simon; Crick, Humphrey Q.P.; Morecroft, Michael D.; Duffield, Simon J.; Macgregor, Nicholas A.; Pearce-Higgins, James W.				Ecography	37	9		872-882	Sep 2014	2014				English	0	49	Projected impacts of climate change on the populations and distributions of species pose a challenge for conservationists. In response, a number of adaptation strategies to enable species to persist in a changing climate have been proposed. Management to maximise the quality of habitat at existing sites may reduce the magnitude or frequency of climate-driven population declines. In addition large-scale management of landscapes could potentially improve the resilience of populations by facilitating inter-population movements. A reduction in the obstacles to species' range expansion, may also allow species to track changing conditions better through shifts to new locations, either regionally or locally. However, despite a strong theoretical base, there is limited empirical evidence to support these management interventions. This makes it difficult for conservationists to decide on the most appropriate strategy for different circumstances. Here extensive data from long-term monitoring of woodland birds at individual sites are used to examine the two-way interactions between habitat and both weather and population count in the previous year. This tests the extent to which site-scale and landscape-scale habitat attributes may buff er populations against variation in winter weather (a key driver of woodland bird population size) and facilitate subsequent population growth. Our results provide some support for the prediction that landscape-scale attributes (patch isolation and area of woodland habitat) may influence the ability of some woodland bird species to withstand weather-mediated population declines. These effects were most apparent among generalist woodland species. There was also evidence that several, primarily specialist, woodland species are more likely to increase following population decline where there is more woodland at both site and landscape scales. These results provide empirical support for the concept that landscape-scale conservation efforts may make the populations of some woodland bird species more resilient to climate change. However in isolation, management is unlikely to provide a universal benefit to all species.

Hutto, Richard L.; Flesch, Aaron D.; Fylling, Megan A.				Forest Ecology and Management	327			1-9	Sep 1 2014	2014				English	4	50	To understand the ecological effects of forest restoration treatments on several old-growth forest stands in the Flathead National Forest of western Montana, USA, we surveyed birds at 72 points in treatment and control stands, and at more than 50 points in each of five potential reference stand conditions. We used a Before-After/Control-Impact design to assess treatment effects based on data collected 3 years before and 2 years after treatment. We also examined the similarity in bird community composition among all stand types by using a nonmetric multidimensional scaling approach. Relative abundances of only a few bird species changed significantly as a result of restoration treatments, and these changes were characterized largely by declines in the abundances of a few species associated with more mesic, dense-forest conditions, and not by increases in the abundances of species associated with more xeric, old-growth reference stand conditions. Thus, bird communities in treated stands were more similar to those in untreated stands of the same forest type than to those found in any of the potential old-growth reference stands. Although more time may be required for some bird species to respond to treatments, our results suggest that treatment plot sizes were either too small to affect bird communities or that the forest type selected for treatment was not within the range of forest types that are well suited for this type of forest restoration.

Zhang Yao; Xie Han-Bin; Zeng Wei-Bin; Tang Chen-Dong; Niu Dong-Liang; Wang Tian-Hou				Chinese Journal of Zoology	49	4		490-504	Aug 20 2014	2014				Chinese	2	10	Chongming Dongtan Naiional Nature Reserve is one of the most important over-stop sites for migrantory waterbirds in Asian-Pacific Flyway, due to its unique geographical position in the Yangtze River Mouth and extensive salt marsh and mud tidal flat. However it is also one of the key regions which were enclosed by the construction of seawall, and the mud tidal flat after the reclamation was used for agricultural or industrial development, which altered the composition of the local plant community and the topography of the marsh and hence resulted in the dramatic decline of bird biodiversity. In the last few years, the local wetland management authority took the conservation measures to recover and optimize the wetland in the coastal area. Due to the wetland restoration project, a part of natural reserve was transformed into artificial wetland. In this study, we focused on the relationship between the waterbird community structure and habitat type in the artificial wetland which can be classified into four types according to biodiversity restoration stages: A. the wetland has been restored for two years, named the area of the first project; B. the wetland is being restored, named the area of the second project; C. the wetland reclaimed for rice paddy, named the Yaoquan Farmland; D. the wetland reclaimed for fish raising, named the aquacultural pond. The study lasted from the end of March to the beginning of May, 2013 that duration covered the flood tide period and the neap season period. Bird census were carried five times in the study area and eight habitat factors were recorded in the meantime from the four type wetlands to analyze the main factors which affect the waterbird community structure. Bird survey was conducted by the point count method, totally 2 357 waterbird, subordinated in 6 orders 11 families and 45 species, were counted. Among them, 25 species are the dominant species including Anas poecilorhyncha, Gallinula chloropus, Charadrius dubius, C. alexandrines, Bubulcus ibis, Tringa erythropus and T. glareola. The bird species and individuals were counted then species richness, bird density, Shannon-Wiener index (H') and evenness (J') were calculated by each artificial wetland types. The non-parametric test Kruskal-Wallis H analysis indicated that there were significant differences in bird species, density and diversity index between the four artificial wetlands. The area A kept the highest value in biodiversity and bird density. The correlation analysis was undertaken between habitat factors and of bird community characteristics by the non-parametric test Kruskal-Wallis H. The bare muddy area, size of water surface and the number of small habitat island in the water are the key factors which affected the waterbird distribution. The detailed management recommendations were then raised for further optimizing the artificial wetlands in Dongtan coasts in the consideration of waterbird conservation.

Clay, Robert P.; Lesterhuis, Arne J.; Schulte, Shiloh; Brown, Stephen; Reynolds, Debra; Simons, Theodore R.				International Wader Studies	20			62-82	August 2014	2014				English	0	8	The American Oystercatcher Haematopus palliatus is the most widely distributed of the four oystercatcher species in the Western Hemisphere. Its range covers almost the entire Atlantic Coast from northeastern United States to southern Argentina; on the Pacific Coast it is found from northern Mexico to central Chile. This assessment covers the entire range of the species, and is not intended to serve as a substitute or update for conservation plans that cover the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coast populations. Readers are advised to refer to those plans, available at www.whsrn.org, for more detailed information about U.S. populations. The subspecific taxonomy of H. palliatus is far from clear, but five races are recognized in this assessment, primarily to facilitate reference to specific populations (Fig. 1). These are nominate H. p. palliatus (coasts of eastern and southern United States; eastern Mexico; Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Central America; the Caribbean; and northern and eastern South America); H. p. frazari (Gulf of California and western Mexico); H. p. pitanay (coast of western South America); H. p. durnfordi (coast of southeast South America) and H. p. galapagensis (Galapagos Islands). The Galapagos race may deserve species status. Based on a review of existing population estimates and an extrapolation of data from quantitative surveys throughout its range, revised estimates are given for the populations of all five subspecies, and a total population of about 43,000 individuals. The nominate race is the most abundant with an estimated population size of about 20,000 individuals, while the least abundant is H. p. galapagensis, with just 300 individuals estimated. Biogeographic population estimates were used to determine 1% threshold levels and identify sites of regional and global conservation importance. A total of 20 sites have been identified for H. p. palliatus, 5 for H. p. frazari, 10 for H. p. pitanay and 10 for H. p. durnfordi. No key sites were identified for H. p. galapagensis as it is found in low density scattered throughout the islands. Of these 45 sites, 14 have counts that surpass the 1% level of the global population, and are thus of global conservation significance for the species. Because the species is a dispersed breeder, the 1% threshold is of limited value in identifying key breeding sites. For the time being, these have been defined as sites holding 20 or more breeding pairs; 17 such sites have been identified, with all but four in the United States. It is hoped that a more rigorous approach for identifying key breeding sites can be developed in the future. As an obligate coastal species, American Oystercatcher is at risk from widespread habitat loss due to coastal development, and recreational activities that lead to nest disturbance and increased predation. This is exacerbated by the species' low population size and low reproductive success. Climate change also poses a significant future threat, especially with regard to sea-level rise. To address these threats, conservation actions are proposed that focus on increased legal protection for the species and on the conservation of key sites and important habitats. Conservation could include implementing beneficial management practices, such as restoration of nest and roost sites, controlling predation, and reducing disturbance. Education and outreach programs are needed throughout the species' range, especially for beach users and urban planners. Training programs will be necessary to ensure successful implementation of many of the priority conservation actions. Finally, a key first step in conserving this species across its range is the creation of a H. palliatus Working Group. Modelled after the U.S. American Oystercatcher Working Group this organization could unite researchers, conservationists, and educators from across the hemisphere to foster coordinated research, conservation action, and monitoring as outlined in this assessment.

Comparison was made by relating the population density of passerine birds with reference to flora of 3 old and 3 new sites in and around Lahore. The results of the study revealed that the changing habitat of Lahore due to human disturbance and non-availability of breeding sites for birds was the main reason behind the loss of passerine avian diversity. Secondly, the trend of planting decorative or ornamental plants such as Eucalyptus in Lahore was the key factor forcing birds to migrate. Relative abundance of native trees and density of observed passerine bird species was higher in old reference sites rather than in newly established parks of Lahore city because new parks in the city have highly disturbed habitat and more exotic tree varieties. Results of the present study revealed that one of the new parks, woodland wildlife park outside the city is still providing the natural habitat to birds due to less human disturbance. So there is dire need to build such parks which have more natural environment. Conservation of passerine avian diversity within city area can be progressed by managing the urban green space and plantation of native flora. After completion of study, it was recommended that only ecological restoration of damaged habitat at Lahore can turn back the tide of biodiversity loss.

Acta Oecologica	59			72-83	Aug 2014	2014				English	3	60	Ecological niche theory implies that more heterogeneous habitats have the potential to support greater biodiversity. Positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships have been found for most studies investigating animal taxa, although negative relationships also occur and the scale dependence of heterogeneity-diversity relationships is little known. We investigated multi-scale, heterogeneity-diversity relationships for bird communities in a semi-arid riparian landscape, using airborne LiDAR data to derive key measures of structural habitat complexity. Habitat heterogeneity-diversity relationships were generally positive, although the overall strength of relationships varied across avian life history guilds (R2 range: 0.03-0.41). Best predicted were the species richness indices of cavity nesters, habitat generalists, woodland specialists, and foliage foragers. Heterogeneity-diversity relationships were also strongly scale-dependent, with strongest associations at the 200-m scale (4 ha) and weakest associations at the 50-m scale (0.25 ha). Our results underscore the value of LiDAR data for fine-grained quantification of habitat structure, as well as the need for biodiversity studies to incorporate variation among life-history guilds and to simultaneously consider multiple guild functional types (e.g. nesting, foraging, habitat). Results suggest that certain life-history guilds (foliage foragers, cavity nesters, woodland specialists) are more susceptible than others (ground foragers, ground nesters, low nesters) to experiencing declines in local species richness if functional elements of habitat heterogeneity are lost. Positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships imply that riparian conservation efforts need to not only provide high-quality riparian habitat locally, but also to provide habitat heterogeneity across multiple scales.

Condor	116	3		303-315	Aug 2014	2014				English	3	40	In North America, grassland bird abundances have declined, likely as a result of loss and degradation of prairie habitat. Given the expense and limited opportunity to procure new grasslands, managers are increasingly focusing on ways to improve existing habitat for grassland birds, using techniques such as tree removal. To examine the potential for tree removal to benefit grassland birds, we conducted 446 point counts on 35 grassland habitat patches in the highly fragmented landscape of west-central Minnesota during 2009-2011. We modeled density of four grassland bird species in relation to habitat composition at multiple scales, focusing on covariates that described grass, woody vegetation (trees and large shrubs), or combinations of grass and woody vegetation. The best-supported models for all four grassland bird species incorporated variables measured at multiple scales, including local features such as grass height, litter depth, and local tree abundance, as well as landscape-level measures of grass and tree cover. Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), Sedge Wrens (Cistothorus platensis), and Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) responded consistently and negatively to woody vegetation, but response to litter depth, grass height, and grassland extent were mixed among species. Our results suggest that reducing shrub and tree cover is more likely to increase the density of grassland birds than are attempts to improve grass quality or quantity. In particular, tree removal is more likely to increase density of Savannah Sparrows and Sedge Wrens than any reasonable changes in grass quality or quantity. Yet tree removal may not result in increased abundance of grassland birds if habitat composition is not considered at multiple scales. Managers will need to either manage at large scales (80-300 ha) or focus their efforts on removing trees in landscapes that contain some grasslands but few nearby wooded areas.

Condor	116	3		325-340	Aug 2014	2014				English	3	52	The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a species of conservation concern that is strongly associated with recently burned forests. Black-backed Woodpeckers are known to have variable home-range sizes, yet the ecological factors related to this variation have not been adequately explored and may hold insights into the natural history of the species and the management of its habitat. During 2011 and 2012, we radio-tracked Black-backed Woodpeckers nesting in 3 forested areas of California that burned between 2 and 5 years before the initiation of tracking. Among 15 individuals with robust tracking data, we found that home-range size varied by an order of magnitude, from 24.1 to 304.1 ha, as measured by movement-based kernel estimation. Using an information-theoretic approach, we evaluated the functional relationship between snag basal area an a priori key resource and home-range size, additionally controlling for sex, age, and years since fire as covariates. We found that snag basal area alone best predicted home-range size, explaining 54-62% of observed variation. As snag basal area increased, home-range sizes exponentially decreased. This relationship held true both with and without the inclusion of 3 individuals that nested in burned forest yet foraged predominantly outside the fire perimeter in unburned forest. Snag basal area, unlike other potential influences on home-range size, is an attribute that forest managers can directly influence. We describe a quantitative relationship between home-range size and snag basal area that forest managers can use to predict Black-backed Woodpecker pair density in burned forests and assess the likely population consequences of specific harvest treatments.

Condor	116	3		459-471	Aug 2014	2014				English	8	106	Proliferation of invasive plants in forest understories throughout North America has prompted restoration efforts focused on removal of invasive vegetation. Although the negative impacts of invasives on native plant communities are well documented, effects on forest bird communities remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we examined the response of avian communities to invasive plants in forest fragments across 4 counties in northeastern Illinois, a region characterized by extensive urbanization. We surveyed breeding bird communities in 46 forest plots representing a gradient in abundance of invasive woody plants. We quantified vegetation structure and composition within plots, as well as landscape context. Exotic trees and shrubs were present on all but 3 plots. Although native trees were common, native species represented <7% of total stem density of shrubs. Measures of invasion were weakly correlated with those representing urbanization, yet broad-scale measures of urbanization such as building density and urban cover were strongly associated with avian community structure. At finer scales, measures of invasion were important predictors of the relative abundance of birds in several nesting and foraging guilds. Shrub nesters showed a positive response to invasive vegetation, whereas the relative abundance of aerial salliers and ground nesters decreased with increased proportions of invasive trees. Because restoration strategies aimed at the complete removal of invasive shrubs could diminish habitat quality for some species, thinning of understory vegetation or the removal of invasive trees may confer the greatest benefits to avian communities when few native understory plants are present.

Carrillo-Rubio, Eduardo; Kery, Marc; Morreale, Stephen J.; Sullivan, Patrick J.; Gardner, Beth; Cooch, Evan G.; Lassoie, James P.				Conservation Biology	28	4		1034-1044	Aug 2014	2014				English	2	88	Forest degradation is arguably the greatest threat to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and rural livelihoods. Therefore, increasing understanding of how organisms respond to degradation is essential for management and conservation planning. We were motivated by the need for rapid and practical analytical tools to assess the influence of management and degradation on biodiversity and system state in areas subject to rapid environmental change. We compared bird community composition and size in managed (ejido, i.e., communally owned lands) and unmanaged (national park) forests in the Sierra Tarahumara region, Mexico, using multispecies occupancy models and data from a 2-year breeding bird survey. Unmanaged sites had on average higher species occupancy and richness than managed sites. Most species were present in low numbers as indicated by lower values of detection and occupancy associated with logging-induced degradation. Less than 10% of species had occupancy probabilities >0.5, and degradation had no positive effects on occupancy. The estimated metacommunity size of 125 exceeded previous estimates for the region, and sites with mature trees and uneven-aged forest stand characteristics contained the highest species richness. Higher estimation uncertainty and decreases in richness and occupancy for all species, including habitat generalists, were associated with degraded young, even-aged stands. Our findings show that multispecies occupancy methods provide tractable measures of biodiversity and system state and valuable decision support for landholders and managers. These techniques can be used to rapidly address gaps in biodiversity information, threats to biodiversity, and vulnerabilities of species of interest on a landscape level, even in degraded or fast-changing environments. Moreover, such tools may be particularly relevant in the assessment of species richness and distribution in a wide array of habitats.

Management strategies aimed at conserving biodiversity need to be informed by the actual impacts of highly abundant species, whether native or introduced. In this study we examined characteristics of two bird species, introduced common mynas and native noisy miners, both of which are highly abundant in urbanised areas along the East coast of Australia. Current managerial practices have a strong focus on eradication of common mynas, while noisy miners are largely ignored. However, in this study noisy miners were found in a broader range of habitats, and in greater abundance, than common mynas; displayed more aggressive behaviour; and were linked to a decline in the diversity and abundance of other species where common mynas were not. We suggest that the adaptability of a species and the variety of habitats it can colonise may be a better predictor of its potential impact, than whether it is native or introduced.

Dittmar, Erika M.; Cimprich, David A.; Sperry, Jinelle H.; Weatherhead, Patrick J.				Journal of Wildlife Management	78	6		1005-1011	Aug 2014	2014				English	2	49	If differences in ecological requirements result in juvenile birds using different habitats from breeding birds, then habitat management to protect those birds must protect both breeding and post-breeding habitats. We examined habitat selection by juvenile black-capped vireos (Vireo atricapilla) following their independence from parental care, in 2010-2013 on Fort Hood Military Reservation in central Texas, USA. The black-capped vireo is a federally endangered species that nests almost exclusively in shrub vegetation, but previous anecdotal observations indicate that juveniles may prefer riparian vegetation. We used mist-net capture rates and radio-telemetry to determine relative abundance of juvenile vireos across habitats, to quantify movement patterns and habitat selection, and to investigate how vegetation density and arthropod abundance influenced habitat selection. We captured juveniles at similar rates in shrub and riparian vegetation. Radio telemetry data indicated that juveniles selected riparian vegetation over most other available vegetation types, and tended to stay in riparian vegetation upon arrival. Juveniles selected areas characterized by more canopy cover, denser foliage, and more arthropods. Riparian vegetation provides this combination of features more than other vegetation types, indicating that cover and food are the basis for habitat selection by juveniles. Our results indicate that habitat conservation strategies for black-capped vireos should include protection of riparian vegetation near breeding areas, and more generally, that avian conservation strategies that focus only on breeding areas may potentially overlook other key habitats.

Advances in Environmental Biology	8	13		473-479	Aug 2014	2014				English	0	0	The problem of creating the systems of specially protected natural areas (PA) adequately representing the geographical diversity of different territories has been acute. Creation of the territory nature protection systems always requires comprehensive assessment of the representativeness of the existing PA network. In Perm region the only such research was carried out at the end of the last century. Since then, the region borders, structure and PA network size, as well as the structure of natural resource use have significantly changed. In this paper we assess the representativeness of the PA network of Perm region. For this purpose the representation of the PA network on landscape and biodiversity was analyzed. The study identified the endowment of natural areas and the representation of wetlands in the PA network in the region. Protected species of plants and animals which need development of measures for the territorial protection were identified. The size of the PAs necessary to develop the nature protection network was calculated. (C) 2014 AENSI Publisher All rights reserved.	Sannikov, P.

Forest fragments survive within plantations, but their conservation value in highly deforested landscapes in Southeast Asia is poorly understood. In this study, we compared bird assemblages in acacia plantations and fragmented forests in South Sumatra to evaluate each habitat's potential conservation value. To clarify the impact of habitat change, we also analyzed the response of feeding guild composition. Five habitat types were studied: large logged forest (LLF), burnt logged forest (BLF), remnant logged forest (RLF), 4-year-old acacia plantation (AP4), and 1-year-old acacia plantation (AP1). Estimated species richness (Chao 2) was highest in LLF then AP4 and BLF, while AP1 and RLF had lower estimated species richness. Community composition was roughly divided into two groups by non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination: acacia plantation and logged forest. Sallying substrate-gleaning insectivores, such as drongos, broadbills, and some flycatchers, were restricted to LLF, whereas acacia plantation hosted many terrestrial frugivores, such as doves. Although fragmented forests in our study site lacked several common tropical forest species, these fragments provide an important habitat for some sallying and terrestrial insectivores. A network of small riparian remnant forests could be a complementary habitat for some species, while the conservation value of burnt forest might be low. In conclusion, the highly fragmented forests in plantations are suboptimal habitats for birds but are still very important, because large primary forest blocks have been nearly lost in the surrounding landscape.

Holcomb, Elizabeth D.; Davis, Craig A.; Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.				Journal of Wildlife Management	78	5		848-856	Jul 2014	2014				English	4	70	Rangeland birds in the Southern High Plains, USA evolved within a context of fire and grazing (i.e., pyric herbivory), a disturbance regime that played a dominant role in shaping rangelands in this region but has been absent since the 1880s. A management technique known as patch-burn grazing was used to mimic the heterogeneity in vegetation created by the historical disturbance regime of fire and grazing in sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia) rangelands. We compared nest survival of Cassin's sparrows (Peucaea cassinii), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), and lark sparrows (Chondestes grammacus); species richness; and densities of 11 bird species between rangelands managed with patch-burn grazing and rangelands managed with traditional management (i.e., seasonal grazing) in Oklahoma from 2006 to 2008. Estimates of nest survival were similar between patch-burn and traditional pastures (Cassin's sparrows: 51% and 57%; field sparrows: 18% and 22%; and lark sparrows: 14% and 12%, patch-burn and traditional, respectively). Species richness was higher in patch-burn pastures compared to traditionally managed pastures. Densities of the majority of avian species (73%) were similar between treatments; however, lark sparrow densities were 5 times more abundant in patch-burn pastures and grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were >3 times more abundant on traditional pastures. Our results suggest that introducing patch-burn grazing management to sand sagebrush rangelands is not detrimental to nesting shrubland birds, and the creation of heterogeneity through patch-burn grazing can increase avian species diversity. Furthermore, some species such as lark sparrows may benefit from patch-burn grazing. Patch-burn management may be an important tool to assist in the recovery of biodiversity in this ecosystem.

Dahal, Bhagawan R.; McAlpine, Clive A.; Maron, Martine				Forest Ecology and Management	323			28-38	Jul 1 2014	2014				English	0	17	Although protected areas are central to global biodiversity conservation, off-reserve forests are increasingly recognized as potentially important for the long term conservation of biota, particularly in less-developed countries where communities rely directly on resources from natural areas. We assessed the conservation value of differently managed forests for birds in lowland tropical forests of Nepal. In particular, we explored whether their conservation value was additional or complementary to those of formal protected areas. Using data collected from 112 sites in protected areas (n = 31), state managed forests (n = 37) and community managed forests (n = 44), we assessed how bird species richness, abundance, diversity and community composition varied among tenures. Although sites in protected areas had the greatest species diversity, community managed forests supported a complementary assemblage. Of 124 species recorded, only 45% were common to all management tenures. Overall, the distinctiveness and richness of species in sites in forests outside of protected areas contributed substantially to regional avifaunal diversity. These results highlight the potentially critical role of appropriately managed community forests. The maintenance of diverse bird assemblages in forest regions depends on complementary management of forests both outside and inside the established protected areas. [copyright] 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Pramanik, Alok Kumar; Santra, Kalyan Brata; Manna, Chanchal Kumar				Asian Journal of Conservation Biology	3	1		28-37	Jul 2014	2014				English	0	0	The Open-billed stork, Anastomus oscitans in the Raiganj wildlife sanctuary, preferred the core region than buffer region of the sanctuary for nesting as though core region was relatively undisturbed and rich in food for stork. In two breeding seasons, the fledgling success was greater at the nests that were located in the core region than in the buffer region of the sanctuary. The availability of food in the nearby areas and protection from the predators were the main factors for rising storks' population. The Open-billed stork built more nest in the year 2008 than in the year 2007. They selected 599 trees for nesting of which 249 trees were Lagerstroemia spaciosa in the year 2007 which increased to 615 trees for nesting of which 280 trees were Lagerstroemia speciosa in the year 2008. The percentage of unhatched eggs, damaged eggs by predation, storm and heavy rain was higher in the year 2007 than in the year 2008. The nestlings death mainly caused by storm and heavy rain, by dropping during first flight and by predation. The main natural predators of the species in the sanctuary were House crow (Corvus splendens) and Bengal monitor (Varanus bengalensis). The overall hatching success and fledging success were 91.71% and 83.96% in the year 2007 which increased to 94.86% and 87.95% in the year 2008 respectively. The breeding behavior of Open-billed stork was disturbed by visitors and villagers activities and by vehicles during breeding season in the sanctuary. The villagers also invaded to collect fire wood into the buffer region as well as core region of the sanctuary during breeding season. As though the Open-billed stork can tolerate this type of disturbances, so they can breed in the sanctuary. But disturbed birds may show increased failure rates despite their lack of immediate behavioural responses to human pressure. The number of stork population was increased from 44816 to 58920 in the year 2007 and 2008 in the Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary. It may be due to the availability of nesting trees, nesting materials, availability of safe nesting zone and availability of food of this particular bird species. But proper management should be taken to increase their successful breeding.

Law, Bradley S.; Chidel, Mark; Brassil, Traecey; Turner, Graham; Kathuria, Amrit				Forest Ecology and Management	322			58-68	Jun 15 2014	2014				English	5	47	Large-scale plantations established for timber production or for carbon sequestration can dramatically transform landscapes, however little is known about the response of biodiversity. We report on trends in bird diversity during a 12 year longitudinal study on three large-scale plantations of locally indigenous eucalypts in northern New South Wales, Australia. The study began in a farmland mosaic and has continued to follow bird occupancy rates after the establishment of eucalypt plantations within the paddock areas. Bird surveys were undertaken at focal trees located in different classes of remnant vegetation, which became embedded within the plantations as well as in the plantation matrix itself. Reference sites were also located in adjacent blocks of forest. We found that species richness increased over time in the plantation matrix, as well as remnant vegetation embedded within the plantation (isolated trees, tree patches and remnants, but not riparian locations). When birds were classified as forest-dependent, forest-associated or mosaic generalist, the species richness of forest-associated birds increased and mosaic generalists decreased over time at selected remnant categories. Richness of forest-dependent birds did not change over time. After plantation establishment, bird composition at remnant locations gradually shifted towards that of forest, although all locations remained distinct from forest even after 11 years of plantation growth. The response of 36 individual species was assessed with 47% percent of species increasing over the 11 years and 31% of species declining. Notably the noisy miner, a hyper-aggressive species, decreased over time. We suggest a reduction in the occurrence of this species could be an important contributor to the increase in the diversity of smaller bird species. These include species of regional concern, such as the eastern yellow robin and the rufous whistler, which increased over the study period. Our results suggest that large-scale plantations of locally indigenous species contribute to ecological restoration of cleared landscapes. However, the plantation matrix after 11 years provided less suitable habitat than nearby forest as it supported fewer species, especially for birds that are characteristic of forest. Retention of remnant vegetation at the time of plantation establishment, including large isolated paddock trees, contributed considerably to the biodiversity present in the plantations and is likely to provide key refuge areas during any subsequent harvesting. Continued collection of longitudinal data are needed to describe changes through the full plantation rotation and harvest, while the extent to which other taxa respond to eucalypt plantation establishment also requires documentation.

We found breeding evidence of six of the eight sedentary woodpecker species from Romania: Grey-headed-(Picus calms), Green- (Picus viridis), Great Spotted- (Dendrocopos major), Middle Spotted- (Dendrocopos medius), White-backed- (Dendrocopos leucotos) and Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius). The most abundant was the Middle Spotted Woodpecker. Middle Spotted-, Green- and Great Spotted Woodpeckers excavated nest-holes most commonly in oak (Quercus petraea), Black Woodpeckers in beech (Fagus sylvatica), Grey-headed Woodpeckers in aspen (Populus tremula). White-backed Woodpeckers used only oaks as nest-trees. Weak excavators selected large trees, dead trees or soft woods for nesting, but most of the species used primarily live trees for excavation. The average diameter of nesting tree, tree height, nest height and relative nest height did not increase with the body size of the woodpecker species. Nearest neighbor analysis indicated that the local distribution of woodpecker species in most forest fragments differs from randomness. Great Spotted Woodpeckers and Black Woodpeckers presented uniform distributions, while Middle Spotted Woodpeckers aggregated distribution. Tree diameter and diversity, relative abundance of oak and aspen but also altitude affected woodpecker abundance. Black Woodpecker and Middle Spotted Woodpecker presence depends on large trees and diversity of trees. The results will contribute to forest restoration operations.

Sheehan, James; Wood, Petra Bohall; Buehler, David A.; Keyser, Patrick D.; Larkin, Jeffrey L.; Rodewald, Amanda D.; Wigley, T. Bently; Boves, Than J.; George, Gregory A.; Bakermans, Marja H.; Beachy, Tiffany A.; Evans, Andrea; McDermott, Molly E.; Newell, Felicity L.; Perkins, Kelly A.; White, Matthew				Forest Ecology and Management	321			5-18	Jun 1 2014	2014				English	4	62	Timber harvesting has been proposed as a management tool to enhance breeding habitat for the Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea), a declining Neotropical-Nearctic migratory songbird that nests in the canopy of mature eastern deciduous forests. To evaluate how this single-species management focus might fit within an ecologically based management approach for multiple forest birds, we performed a manipulative experiment using four treatments (three intensities of timber harvests and an unharvested control) at each of seven study areas within the core Cerulean Warbler breeding range. We collected pre-harvest (one year) and post-harvest (four years) data on the territory density of Cerulean Warblers and six additional focal species, avian community relative abundance, and several key habitat variables. We evaluated the avian and habitat responses across the 3-32 m2 ha-1 residual basal area (RBA) range of the treatments. Cerulean Warbler territory density peaked with medium RBA ([approximately]16 m2 ha-1). In contrast, territory densities of the other focal species were negatively related to RBA (e.g., Hooded Warbler (Setophaga citrina)), were positively related to RBA (e.g., Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla)), or were not sensitive to this measure (Scarlet Tanager (Piranga olivacea)). Some species (e.g., Hooded Warbler) increased with time post-treatment and were likely tied to a developing understory, whereas declines (e.g., Ovenbird) were immediate. Relative abundance responses of additional species were consistent with the territory density responses of the focal species. Across the RBA gradient, greatest separation in the avian community was between early successional forest species (e.g., Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens)) and closed-canopy mature forest species (e.g., Ovenbird), with the Cerulean Warbler and other species located intermediate to these two extremes. Overall, our results suggest that harvests within 10-20 m2 ha-1 RBA yield the largest increases in Cerulean Warblers, benefit additional disturbance-dependent species, and may retain closed-canopy species but at reduced levels. Harvests outside the optimum RBA range for Cerulean Warblers can support bird assemblages specifically associated with early or late (closed-canopy) successional stages. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Ferenc, Michal; Sedlacek, Ondrej; Fuchs, Roman				Urban Ecosystems	17	2		625-640	Jun 2014	2014				English	4	148	Wooded habitats represent hotspots of urban biodiversity, however, urban development imposes pressure on biota in these refuges. Identification of the most influential habitat attributes and the role of local urban characteristics is crucial for proper decisions on management practices supporting biodiversity. We aimed to identify well manageable fine-scale habitat attributes to suggest specific, feasible and affordable management recommendations for green space in cities. We analysed species richness of woodland-associated bird communities and incidence of individual species at 290 sites in a wide variety of green areas scattered across the city of Prague, Czech Republic. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and regression tree analyses were used to identify site-scale (100 m radius sampling sites) and local-scale (200 m and 500 m radius plots) habitat attributes shaping the bird communities at individual sites. Logistic regression was used to assess the responses of individual species to habitat characteristics. Our results imply that at the site scale, management practices should focus on maintenance and promoting species-diverse and older tree stands, with a mixture of coniferous and deciduous trees. Water-bodies and accompanying riparian habitats should be maintained and carefully managed to preserve high-quality remnants of natural vegetation. Presence of a few old trees (about 12 % of tree cover with DBH > 50 cm) or small urban standing water and watercourses enrich the bird community by at least two species. Species richness of woodland avifauna at particular sites is further supported by the total amount of tree cover in the surroundings, including scattered greenery of public spaces and private gardens. We conclude that proper management at site scale has the potential to increase biodiversity of the urban environment.

Here, we compare two measures derived from unclassified remotely sensed data, a measure of habitat heterogeneity and a measure of habitat composition, for explaining bird species richness and the spatial distribution of 10 species in a semi-arid landscape of New Mexico. We surveyed bird abundance from 1996 to 1998 at 42 plots located in the McGregor Range of Fort Bliss Army Reserve. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values of two May 1997 Landsat scenes were the basis for among-pixel habitat heterogeneity (image texture), and we used the raw imagery to decompose each pixel into different habitat components (spectral mixture analysis). We used model averaging to relate measures of avian biodiversity to measures of image texture and spectral mixture analysis fractions. Measures of habitat heterogeneity, particularly angular second moment and standard deviation, provide higher explanatory power for bird species richness and the abundance of most species than measures of habitat composition. Using image texture, alone or in combination with other classified imagery-based approaches, for monitoring statuses and trends in biological diversity can greatly improve conservation efforts and habitat management.

Braunisch, Veronika; Coppes, Joy; Arlettaz, Raphael; Suchant, Rudi; Zellweger, Florian; Bollmann, Kurt				PLoS ONE	9	5		e97718	May 13 2014	2014				English	3	87	Species adapted to cold-climatic mountain environments are expected to face a high risk of range contractions, if not local extinctions under climate change. Yet, the populations of many endothermic species may not be primarily affected by physiological constraints, but indirectly by climate-induced changes of habitat characteristics. In mountain forests, where vertebrate species largely depend on vegetation composition and structure, deteriorating habitat suitability may thus be mitigated or even compensated by habitat management aiming at compositional and structural enhancement. We tested this possibility using four cold-adapted bird species with complementary habitat requirements as model organisms. Based on species data and environmental information collected in 300 1-km2 grid cells distributed across four mountain ranges in central Europe, we investigated (1) how species' occurrence is explained by climate, landscape, and vegetation, (2) to what extent climate change and climate-induced vegetation changes will affect habitat suitability, and (3) whether these changes could be compensated by adaptive habitat management. Species presence was modelled as a function of climate, landscape and vegetation variables under current climate; moreover, vegetation-climate relationships were assessed. The models were extrapolated to the climatic conditions of 2050, assuming the moderate IPCC-scenario A1B, and changes in species' occurrence probability were quantified. Finally, we assessed the maximum increase in occurrence probability that could be achieved by modifying one or multiple vegetation variables under altered climate conditions. Climate variables contributed significantly to explaining species occurrence, and expected climatic changes, as well as climate-induced vegetation trends, decreased the occurrence probability of all four species, particularly at the low-altitudinal margins of their distribution. These effects could be partly compensated by modifying single vegetation factors, but full compensation would only be achieved if several factors were changed in concert. The results illustrate the possibilities and limitations of adaptive species conservation management under climate change.

Hovick, Torre J.; Elmore, R. Dwayne; Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.				ECOSPHERE	5	5		62	May 2014	2014				English	2	79	Grassland birds have experienced greater population declines than any other guild of birds in North America, and yet we know little about habitat use and the affects of management during their non-breeding period on wintering grounds. The paucity of information on wintering grassland birds limits our ability to develop effective conservation strategies. We investigated habitat use by the winter bird community in grasslands with restored heterogeneity resulting from the interactive effects of fire and grazing. We used 500 m line transects distributed across patches (i.e., <13, 13-24, and >24 months post disturbance) resulting from spring burning with growing season grazing (April-Sept) and quantified avian relative abundance, community structure, and probability of patch occupancy while accounting for imperfect detection. Grassland structure that resulted from the fire-grazing interaction created heterogeneity among patches that influenced avian habitat use during winter. Generalist birds such as the Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) were relatively common in all patch types while more specialized species such as the Smith's Longspur (Calcarius pictus) and Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii) reached greatest abundance and probability of occupancy in the patches with the least and greatest time post disturbance, respectively. This research provides novel information on the response of wintering birds to restored ecological processes in grasslands and can improve efforts to create effective conservation strategies. Our findings add to a growing body of literature supporting the use of fire and grazing to create a shifting grassland mosaic that increases vegetation structural and compositional heterogeneity and maximizes native biodiversity within rangeland ecosystems through the conservation of natural patterns and processes.

Here, we quantify the potential impact of an increase in maize fields on the diversity of farmland birds by means of high resolution (25x25m) land-use scenarios. We generated scenarios in which the area of maize production in Germany increases from presently 2.6 to 2.9, 3.6 and 4.3millionha, corresponding to the energy crop production targets of the German Renewable Energy Act for the years 2020, 2035 and 2050. To test the mitigating potential of conservation measures, each scenario was generated in a standard version and a landscape protection version, with the latter excluding valuable farmland areas from being converted into maize fields. Nine species of farmland birds belonging to the governmental indicator scheme for sustainable land-use in Germany were modelled for the six nation-wide scenarios. The models predicted that only the Northern Lapwing and the Little Owl might profit from extended maize production. Despite this, the total number of breeding pairs of the indicator species was predicted to decline by about 0.4 million breeding pairs in the most intensive scenario. Protection of valuable farmland did not mitigate these negative effects in the models. Our findings suggest that increased production of energy crops conflicts with conservation of biological diversity.

Restoration Ecology	22	3		336-344	May 2014	2014				English	1	26	Woody plant encroachment into grasslands is a global concern. Efforts to restore grasslands often assume that removal of woody plants benefits biodiversity but assumptions are rarely tested. In the Chihuahuan Desert of the Southwestern United States, we tested whether abundances of grassland specialist bird species would be greater in plant communities resulting from treatment with herbicides to remove encroaching shrubs compared with untreated shrub-dominated areas that represented pre-treatment conditions. In 2010, we surveyed breeding birds and vegetation at 16 treated-untreated pairs. In 2011, we expanded the survey effort to 21 treated-untreated pairs, seven unpaired treatment areas, and five reference grassland areas. Vegetation in treatment areas had higher perennial grass foliar and basal cover and lower shrub foliar cover compared with untreated areas. Several regionally declining grassland specialists exhibited higher occurrence and relative abundance in treated areas. A shrubland specialist, however, was associated with untreated areas and may be negatively impacted by shrub removal. Bird community composition differed between treated and untreated areas in both years. Our results indicate that shrub removal can have positive effects on grassland specialist bird species, but that a mosaic of treated and untreated areas might be most beneficial for regional biodiversity.

Sitters, Holly; Christie, Fiona J.; Di Stefano, Julian; Swan, Matthew; Penman, Trent; Collins, Peter C.; York, Alan				Forest Ecology and Management	318			13-20	Apr 15 2014	2014				English	2	58	In many regions, planned burns are implemented to reduce fuel loads and mitigate wildfire risk; increasingly, they are also used to achieve conservation outcomes. However, there is uncertainty regarding how best to apply fire to landscapes in order to enhance biodiversity. The assumption that variable fire regimes are conducive to biodiversity conservation is appealing given its basis in landscape ecological theory, which predicts that spatially complex landscapes sustain greater biodiversity. This supposition is often used as a basis for fire management but has rarely been tested in the context of fire. We sought to test predicted positive relationships between bird diversity and both landscape diversity and configuration in the fire-prone Otway Ranges, southeast Australia, where vegetation transitions from treeless heath to tall open eucalypt forest across a rainfall gradient. We used a whole-of-landscape sampling approach, and mapped fire age classes and vegetation types separately within thirty-six 300 ha landscape sampling units. Bird surveys were undertaken at sub-sampling locations during two successive years, and presence-absence data were used to generate landscape-level estimates of species richness and turnover. Generalized linear mixed models, model selection and model averaging were used to investigate how birds responded to landscape diversity and configuration across the rainfall gradient. Species richness was positively associated with age class diversity, age class configuration and vegetation type diversity. Species turnover was positively associated with age class diversity in areas of lower rainfall but exhibited a negative response in areas of higher rainfall. Neither response variable was associated with vegetation type configuration. This study is one of few landscape scale analyses to provide empirical support for the widely held assumption that spatially variable fire regimes can increase the diversity of faunal assemblages. Further, our results demonstrated consistency in responses of species richness to fire-mediated landscape complexity across a rainfall gradient. Managers can potentially increase bird species richness by increasing both the diversity of fire age classes, and the complexity of age class configuration, within relatively small (300 ha) areas.

Robinson, Natasha M.; Leonard, Steven W.J.; Bennett, Andrew F.; Clarke, Michael F.				Forest Ecology and Management	318			110-121	Apr 15 2014	2014				English	0	54	Unburnt patches within a fire boundary may act as refuges for fauna, facilitating their survival and persistence within fire-prone landscapes. Unburnt patches can arise due to various processes, including topographic variation, fire behaviour, and fuel reduction from recent burning. However, the value of unburnt patches of differing characteristics to the post-fire persistence of faunal communities has rarely been examined. In this study, we examined the relative importance of fire history and severity in predicting the occurrence of birds in a burnt forest landscape. We conducted surveys in mixed eucalypt forest of south-east Australia, 2-3 years after a high intensity, landscape-scale wildfire (>200,000 ha). Sites (n = 91) were selected to encompass fire severity ranging from unburnt patches to stands of crown-burnt forest. Fire history prior to the wildfire was defined as short (<3 years) or long (>20 years) time-since-fire. Unburnt patches of long time-since-fire were important avian refuges, harbouring 20-40% more species, up to 56% more individuals and an assemblage that was distinct from that at all sites burnt by the wildfire, including low severity ground fire. No difference in species richness or composition was detected between sites in unburnt patches of short or long time-since-fire; but bird abundance was 20% lower in patches of short time-since-fire. Unburnt and ground-burnt patches of short time-since-fire provided habitat for more species and had distinct assemblages from that of severely burnt sites. For sites severely burnt in the wildfire, there was no difference in avifaunal richness, abundance or composition between those burnt twice in rapid succession and those not burnt for >20 years. Together, these results highlight: (1) the particular importance of unburnt vegetation remaining within fire-affected areas as faunal refuges, and (2) the potential for recent planned burns to contribute to refuge habitat if it avoids severe burning in a subsequent wildfire.

Oppel, Steffen; Marczakiewicz, Piotr; Lachmann, Lars; Grzywaczewski, Grzegorz				PLoS ONE	9	4		e94406	Apr 8 2014	2014				English	1	30	Monitoring programs designed to assess changes in population size over time need to account for imperfect detection and provide estimates of precision around annual abundance estimates. Especially for species dependent on conservation management, robust monitoring is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of management. Many bird species of temperate grasslands depend on specific conservation management to maintain suitable breeding habitat. One such species is the Aquatic Warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola), which breeds in open fen mires in Central Europe. Aquatic Warbler populations have so far been assessed using a complete survey that aims to enumerate all singing males over a large area. Because this approach provides no estimate of precision and does not account for observation error, detecting moderate population changes is challenging. From 2011 to 2013 we trialled a new line transect sampling monitoring design in the Biebrza valley, Poland, to estimate abundance of singing male Aquatic Warblers. We surveyed Aquatic Warblers repeatedly along 50 randomly placed 1-km transects, and used binomial mixture models to estimate abundances per transect. The repeated line transect sampling required 150 observer days, and thus less effort than the traditional 'full count' approach (175 observer days). Aquatic Warbler abundance was highest at intermediate water levels, and detection probability varied between years and was influenced by vegetation height. A power analysis indicated that our line transect sampling design had a power of 68% to detect a 20% population change over 10 years, whereas raw count data had a 9% power to detect the same trend. Thus, by accounting for imperfect detection we increased the power to detect population changes. We recommend to adopt the repeated line transect sampling approach for monitoring Aquatic Warblers in Poland and in other important breeding areas to monitor changes in population size and the effects of habitat management.

Norvell, Russell E.; Edwards, Thomas C., Jr; Howe, Frank P.				Journal of Wildlife Management	78	3		456-462	Apr 2014	2014				English	0	30	Management by surrogate species assumes that management prescriptions for the surrogate (target) species have no net negative impacts on non-target species with similar life history characteristics. We examined the effects of mechanical manipulations of sagebrush-steppe designed to reduce cover and improve greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) (here, the target surrogate species) habitat quality on 9 non-target, sagebrush-associated bird species for up to 4 years after the treatment manipulations. Two specific presumptions of management by surrogacy were evaluated: 1) no loss (here, local extirpation) of any non-target species is expected in the management area given similar life history characteristics of the target and non-target species; and 2) change in non-target populations characteristics (here, abundance) should mirror those expected for the target species, which typically implies at best an increase or at worst a neutral response to the management treatment. We grouped the 9 non-target species for analysis into 3 categories based on strength of their respective habitat associations with sagebrush (sagebrush-steppe obligate, sagebrush-associated, and steppe associated). The first category was composed of species that met surrogacy criteria for greater sage-grouse, the second were intermediate, and the third did not meet the criteria. We surveyed for birds in treated and reference areas for presence-absence and estimated abundances using distance sampling. We estimated treatment effects using a conditional generalized linear mixed modeling approach; the first model examined local extirpation likelihoods and the second modeled change in abundance conditioned on the species being present post-treatment. Sagebrush treatments had no effect on probabilities of local extirpation 1-4 years post-treatment (P = 0.99). Models fit to abundance data indicated a small but significant (P = 0.031) reduction in overall abundance in treated areas. Abundance responses for species within groupings (e. g., sagebrush-steppe obligate) lacked consistency, indicating benefits to nontarget species are best evaluated at the species rather than group level.

Kalyn; Davis, Stephen K.				Journal of Wildlife Management	78	3		471-482	Apr 2014	2014				English	0	47	Cultivation of native prairie was likely the primary cause of historical declines of grassland bird populations in North America, but the increase in natural gas development may be exacerbating those declines through habitat loss and degradation. We quantified the abundance of grassland songbirds and vegetation structure across a gradient of natural gas well densities to determine the extent to which density and proximity of gas wells influence songbird abundance. In 2008 and 2009, we conducted 1,258 point counts on 105 native grassland parcels (1.6 km2 /parcel) at varying distances from natural gas wells and with varying gas well densities (0-25 per 1.6 km2). We found that vegetation structure influenced bird abundance more strongly than natural gas well proximity or density for all but 1 species and that the response of grassland songbirds to natural gas well density and proximity varied among species and regions. Sprague's pipit (Anthus spragueii) and Baird's sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) abundance was not influenced by natural gas well proximity or density. Grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), McCown's longspur (Rhynchophanes mccownii), and chestnut-collared longspur (Calcarius ornatus) abundance was lower near gas wells, but both longspur species were also more abundant in areas with greater densities of gas wells. Horned lark (Eremophilus alpestris) abundance increased with well density in our northern study site. Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) abundance was higher near gas wells, but only in areas where well density was <=9 wells/1.6 km2. We suggest that land managers and industry implement remediation activities that encourage vegetative re-growth, thus reducing the potential interactive relationship between natural gas development and changes in vegetation structure.

Lindenmayer, David B.; Blanchard, Wade; McBurney, Lachlan; Blair, David; Banks, Sam C.; Driscoll, Don A.; Smith, Annabel L.; Gill, A.M.				Diversity and Distributions	20	4		467-477	Apr 2014	2014				English	2	55	AimTo quantify bird responses to a large unplanned fire, taking into consideration landscape-level fire severity and extent, pre-fire site detection frequency and environmental gradients. LocationSouth-eastern Australia. MethodsA major wildfire in 2009 coincided with a long-term study of birds and provided a rare opportunity to quantify bird responses to wildfire. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we modelled bird species richness and the detection frequency of individual species in response to a suite of explanatory variables, including (1) landscape-level fire severity and extent (2) pre-fire detection frequency, (3) site-level vegetation density and (4) environmental variables (e.g. elevation and topography). ResultsLandscape-level fire severity had strong effects on bird species richness and the detection frequency of the majority of bird species. These effects varied markedly between species; most responded negatively to amount of severely burned forest in the landscape, one negatively to the amount of moderately burned forest and one responded negatively to the total area of burned forest. Only one species - the Flame Robin - responded positively to the amount of burned forest. Relationships with landscape-scale fire extent changed over time for one species - the Brown Thornbill - with initially depressed rates of detection recovering after just 2years. The majority of species were significantly more likely to be detected in burned areas if they have been recorded there prior to the fire. Main conclusionsBirds responded strongly to the severity and spatial extent of fire. They also exhibited strong site fidelity even after severe wildfire which causes profound changes in vegetation cover - a response likely influenced by environmental features such as elevation and topography.

Smallbone, Lisa T.; Matthews, Alison; Lunt, Ian D.				Landscape and Urban Planning	124			43-52	Apr 2014	2014				English	1	43	Farmland abandonment often leads to an increase in vegetation cover in formerly cleared landscapes. In regions where forests and woodlands were cleared for agriculture, regrowth could be an effective way to increase species diversity by re-constructing a variegated landscape. Our study investigated the conservation outcomes for birds across a regenerating agricultural landscape. We compared bird composition across a range of land use and gradient of vegetation cover from cleared pasture, through regrowth sites of varying structure, to remnant forests. Bird community composition differed significantly among vegetation classes, with regrowth providing habitat for a complementary group of high conservation value species, rather than simply providing extra habitat for species that were otherwise well represented in the region. Variations in bird community composition were best explained by site variables that contributed to vegetation structure and internal patch variation. Regrowth had a higher diversity of cover than forest or pasture, and this created habitat for many woodland bird species. Regrowth vegetation may be slower to proceed, but it has the potential to complement active revegetation activities in adjacent production areas and enhance connectivity between remnant forest patches. While the benefits of regrowth are context specific, where regrowth improves landscape heterogeneity, there is great potential for conservation gains for birds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Barton, Philip S.; Ikin, Karen; Smith, Annabel L.; MacGregor, Christopher; Lindenmayer, David B.				Landscape Ecology	29	4		703-714	Apr 2014	2014				English	2	73	Ecological theory predicting the impact of fire on ecological communities is typically focused on post-disturbance recovery processes or on disturbance-diversity dynamics. Yet the established relationship between vegetation structure and animal diversity could provide a foundation to predict the short-term effects of fire on biodiversity, but has rarely been explored. We tested the hypothesis that fire effects on bird assemblages would be moderated by increasing vegetation structure. We examined bird assemblages in burnt and unburnt sites at 1 and 6 years after a wildfire, and compared richness and composition responses among and within three structurally distinct vegetation types in the same landscape: heath, woodland and forest. We found that short-term changes in bird assemblage composition were largest in simple heath vegetation and smallest in complex forest vegetation. The short-term change in species richness was larger in forest than in heath. We also found that among-site assemblage variability was greater shortly after fire in heath and woodland vegetation compared with forest vegetation. Our results indicate that complexity in vegetation structure, particularly overstorey cover, can act as an important moderator of fire effects on bird assemblages. Mechanisms for this response include a greater loss of structure in vegetation characterised by a single low stratum, and a proportionally greater change in bird species composition despite a smaller absolute change in species richness. We discuss our results in the context of a new conceptual model that predicts contrasting richness and composition responses of bird assemblages following disturbance along a gradient of increasing vegetation structure. This model brings a different perspective to current theories of disturbance, and has implications for understanding and managing the effects of fire on biodiversity in heterogeneous landscapes.

Journal of Avian Biology	45	2		187-196	Mar 2014	2014				English	3	39	Anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation affect populations worldwide. For example, many bird populations of boreal forests have declined due to intensive forestry. To target conservation actions for such species, determining the key factors that affect their habitat selection is essential. Remote sensing methods provide highly potential means to measure habitat variables over large areas. We aim at identifying the key-features of habitats by utilizing remote sensing data. As a case example, we study the nest site selection of a primary hole-nesting passerine, the willow tit Poecile montanus, in a managed forest landscape. Using presence-absence data, we determine the most important habitat characteristics of the nest sites for three spatial scales by generalized linear mixed effect models. Our results highlight the importance of the availability of nesting sites - standing decaying deciduous trees - in the nest site selection of P. montanus. It seems to prefer moist habitats with high densities of deciduous trees and to avoid open areas, but does not require mature or intact habitats. Most of the nest site selection seems to occur within small scales. In this case, remote sensing data alone was insufficient for producing reliable models, but adding information of an ecologically important feature from direct field surveys greatly improved model performances. For the conservation and maintenance of dead wood dependent species, changes in forestry practices are necessary to keep the key characteristics of the habitat. Most importantly, continuous availability of standing decaying wood should be secured.

Lafage, Denis; Petillon, Julien				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	185			1-8	Mar 1 2014	2014				English	1	34	The impact of different cutting dates on two dominant groups of ground-dwelling arthropods (carabids and spiders) was assessed. Short-term impacts were assessed by comparing them before and after cutting. Arthropods were collected by pitfall traps located in three plots with different cutting dates between June and August and one uncut control plot. Trapping was performed during a 4-month period in the spring and summer 2011. In total, 26,392 spiders and 12,278 carabids, representing 56 and 82 species respectively, were collected. Overall, the effects of cutting were negative and mostly visible in the long term for carabids, with reduced abundances and species richness in cut plots, and in the short-term for spiders; several parameters (proportion of predators and polyphagous species, and body length) decreased after cutting while remaining stable in the control. Long-term cutting effects revealed almost no differences between plots cut at different dates whereas the short-term effects decreased slightly over time, with respect to the overall phenology of both groups. In conclusion, this study underlines the fact that cutting has drastic effects on ground-dwelling arthropods, and even late dates, which are supposedly positive for other animals like breeding birds, are deleterious for highly diverse and species-rich grassland groups.

Kilgo, John C.; Vukovich, Mark A.				Biological Conservation	171			21-28	Mar 2014	2014				English	1	37	Thresholds in response by cavity-nesting bird populations to variations in the snag resource are poorly understood. In addition, limited information exists on the value of artificially created snags for cavitynesting birds. Therefore, uncertainty exists in whether artificially created snags can yield a positive population response among snag-dependent birds. We used an experimental approach to assess the abundance and territory dynamics of a primary cavity nester, the red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), in response to three snag density treatments over an 8-year period following treatment installation in 2001. Treatments included snag removal, an unmanipulated control, and a snag pulse (snags experimentally created at 14 times control density). During the first two years post-treatment, abundance of red-headed woodpeckers did not differ among treatments. In 2004, woodpecker abundance in snag pulse plots surpassed that of other treatments and continued to increase until it peaked in 2007 (at nearly 6 times than on control plots), after which it declined but remained greater than on control plots through 2009. Increased woodpecker abundance in high snag density areas was facilitated primarily by a decrease in home range size. Because the red-headed woodpecker is negatively affected by very low snag densities, yet is capable of exploiting pulses in the snag resource by dramatically increasing its abundance, we conclude that snag density regulates populations of this primary cavity nesting species and that snag creation can be an important tool in its conservation.

Although this could suggest a conflict between agricultural expansion and biodiversity conservation, these crops are normally grown in shade plantationsa more biodiversity-friendly agroforestry system. Using SAo Tome Island as a case study, we examined if shade plantation can benefit biodiversity by protecting extinction-prone island endemic species. We found that shade plantations held rich assemblages, even in comparison with forest: we estimated 30 bird and 74 tree species occurring in plantations compared to 24 bird and 108 tree species in forests. However, the structure of the assemblages was significantly different between ecosystems, with an average dissimilarity of 33.8 percent and 87.9 percent for birds and trees, respectively. Shade plantations had consistently less endemic species than the forest; we estimated a drop from 17 to 13 in birds and from 17 to 3 in trees. We also found that despite marked differences in the response of bird species to the vegetation characteristics of shade plantations, there was a strong positive link between aboveground tree biomass and endemic species richness and abundance. These results show that shade plantations hold assemblages impoverished in endemic species, but that management can improve their value for the conservation of these species. Finally, we suggest that biodiversity-friendly certification and carbon markets are used to implement and guarantee the long-term economical sustainability of practices that favor the endemic species in SAo Tome's shade plantations.	de Lima, Ricardo F.; Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, LA1 4YQ, United Kingdom, United Kingdom.	rfaustinol@gmail.com	Barlow, Jos/E-7861-2014; Atkinson, Philip/B-8975-2009	F. de Lima, Ricardo/0000-0002-0184-3945; Dallimer, Martin/0000-0001-8120-3309			Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology	0006-3606		Conservation; Conservation measures; Ecology; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Oceanic islands; Atlantic Ocean islands	Aves [Habitat management /  / ] [Community structure /  / ] [Spatial environment / Landscape structure / ] [Sao Tome and Principe / Sao Tome / ].

Within a grid square (n = 216) of 2 x 2 km, the square kilometre with the highest Skylark occupancy potential was selected and three 1-hour surveys were conducted in order to map the breeding territories of the six species. 156 grid squares without potential breeding habitat for the Skylark (dominated by forest or settlements) were excluded. Skylarks were found in 38 % of the examined grid squares and were most abundant in the Jura Mountains in the northern part and in some open areas in the South of the canton. Occupancy and densities of crop areas and ecological compensation measures were also higher than the average. Mean densities in occupied squares were 2.5 territories/km2 (range between 1 and 14). Compared to surveys in the 1990s, the distribution range decreased by 30 % and the mean density by about 50 %. Red Kite, Eurasian Kestrel and Yellowhammer are widespread in the canton of Aargau, while Common Quail and Red-backed Shrike are rare breeding birds. We conclude that the ecological quality of the remaining breeding areas of Skylarks should be enhanced by extensifying the agricultural production. This includes suitable ecological compensation measures as well as low-input options. Other species with similar requirements would also benefit from habitat improvements.

A case study of the impact of the common myna (Acridotheres tristis) on Australian bird species.		Grarock, Kate; Tidemann, Christopher R.; Wood, Jeffrey T.; Lindenmayer, David B.				Austral Ecology	39	1		106-114	Feb 2014	2014				English	3	116	Habitat modification and invasive species are significant drivers of biodiversity decline. However, distinguishing between the impacts of these two drivers on native species can be difficult. For example, habitat modification may reduce native species abundance, while an invasive species may take advantage of the new environment. This scenario has been described as the driver-passenger model, with passengers' taking advantage of habitat modification and drivers' causing native species decline. Therefore, research must incorporate both habitat modification and invasive species impact to successfully investigate native species decline. In this paper, we used the common myna (Acridotheres tristis) as a case study to investigate the driver-passenger model. We investigated changes in bird abundance, over 2 years, in relation to different habitat types and common myna abundance. We hypothesized that the common myna is both a passenger of habitat change and a driver of some bird species decline. Our results indicated that the abundance of many native species is greater in high tree density nature reserves, while the common myna was uncommon in these areas. Common myna abundance was almost three times higher in urban areas than nature reserves and declined rapidly as tree density in nature reserves increased. Our findings indicated that the common myna is primarily a passenger of habitat change. However, we also observed negative associations between common myna abundance and some bird species. We stress the importance of simultaneously investigating both invasive species impact and habitat modification. We suggest habitat restoration could be a useful tool for both native species recovery and invasive species control. Understanding the drivers of native species decline will help inform impact mitigation and direct further research.

MacKay, Allison; Allard, Maxime; Villard, Marc-Andre				Biological Conservation	170			110-119	Feb 2014	2014				English	0	40	Conifer plantations are thought to provide lower-quality habitat for many old forest specialists because of their simplified stand structure and relative paucity of habitat elements such as dead wood. However, at the landscape scale, plantations may have a positive influence on biodiversity, e.g. through landscape supplementation. Here, we test the quality of older spruce plantations as breeding habitat for forest birds at local and landscape levels. We compared bird species assemblages of 40-50 year-old native spruce plantations with those of mature, naturally-regenerated conifer forests using a Bayesian hierarchical model, which accounts for imperfect detection of species. Median species richness was higher in naturally-regenerated conifer stands than in spruce plantations (29.2 vs. 24.4; 95% probability interval = 3.9-5.7), which probably reflects the absence of primary cavity nesters from many stations within plantations. In contrast, more species of canopy nesters were detected in plantations. The proportion of naturally-regenerated conifer forest in the landscape was a predictor of species occurrence for five ground nesters, four primary cavity nesters, and two weak excavators. Older spruce plantations did not provide suitable habitat for some species, mainly cavity nesters. Snag densities in plantations were lower than the estimated threshold requirements for several cavity-nesting birds. Hence, mature, naturally-regenerated forest patches are essential components of intensively-managed forest landscapes to maintain rich forest bird assemblages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Howe, Kristy B.; Coates, Peter S.; Delehanty, David J.				Condor	116	1		35-49	Feb 2014	2014				English	0	45	Common Raven (Corvus corax) numbers and distribution are increasing throughout the sagebrush steppe, influencing avian communities in complex ways. Anthropogenic structures are thought to increase raven populations by providing food and nesting subsidies, which is cause for concern because ravens are important nest predators of sensitive species, including Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). During 2007-2009, we located raven nests in southeastern Idaho and conducted a resource selection analysis. We measured variables at multiple spatial scales for 72 unique nest locations, including landscape-level vegetation characteristics and anthropogenic structures. Using generalized linear mixed models and an information-theoretic approach, we found a 31% decrease in the odds of nesting by ravens for every 1 km increase in distance away from a transmission line. Furthermore, a 100-m increase in distance away from the edge of two different land cover types decreased the odds of nesting by 20%, and an increase in the amount of edge by 1 km within an area of 102.1 ha centered on the nest increased the odds of nesting by 49%. A post hoc analysis revealed that ravens were most likely to nest near edges of adjoining big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and land cover types that were associated with direct human disturbance or fire. These findings contribute to our understanding of raven expansion into rural environments and could be used to make better-informed conservation decisions, especially in the face of increasing renewable energy development.

Reidy, Jennifer L.; Thompson, Frank R., III; Kendrick, Sarah W.				Forest Ecology and Management	313			34-46	Feb 1 2014	2014				English	7	96	Savanna and woodland were once common in the Midwest, but land use changes have led to increasing scarcity of these communities. These transitional habitats are being restored across the Midwest, but few studies have evaluated the response of wildlife to restoration or the vegetative gradient created by management. We conducted point counts for 25 songbirds at sites undergoing savanna or woodland restoration and nearby non-managed forest sites across the Ozark Highlands of Missouri during the 2009-2011 breeding seasons; these sites represented a gradient of canopy cover and tree density from savanna to woodland to forest. We estimated density of 17 species with >=50 detections using distance-based models, which adjust estimates by the detection probability. Bird densities were more strongly related to habitat structure, fire history, and landscape composition than simply whether a site was managed or non-managed. Mature forest species such as Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), Northen Parula (Setophaga americana), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceous), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum) were generally more abundant at points with more trees, higher canopy cover, lower shrub density, and less frequent or no fire in the 20 years prior to surveys. Woodland generalists such as Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens), Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus), Summer Tanager (Piranga rubra), and Yellow-billed Cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus) were generally more abundant at points with less landscape forest cover (10-km scale), more large and fewer small trees, intermediate to high canopy cover, lower shrub density, and recent or frequent fire. Early-successional species such as Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa), Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor), White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus) and Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) were generally more abundant at points with lower canopy cover, recent or frequent fire, and higher shrub density. Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were more abundant at points with intermediate landscape forest cover and lower canopy cover. Restored sites provided breeding habitat for woodland generalists and early-successional species of conservation concern; however, managed landscapes with more open canopy and herbaceous ground cover may be required for species more indicative of open savannas.

Rota, Christopher T.; Rumble, Mark A.; Millspaugh, Joshua J.; Lehman, Chadwick P.; Kesler, Dylan C.				Forest Ecology and Management	313			161-168	Feb 1 2014	2014				English	1	36	Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a disturbance-dependent species that occupy recently burned forest and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of disturbed forest may lead to habitat loss for Black-backed Woodpeckers, which have recently been petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act. We studied home range size and resource selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers occupying habitat created by summer wildfire, fall prescribed fire, and MPB infestations in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We studied home range size and resource selection by attaching radio-transmitters to adult Black-backed Woodpeckers. We estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n = 28 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 19 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian framework (n = 5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 16 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 8 in habitat created by MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat (mean home range size = 79 ha) and 2-year post fall prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size = 143 ha). Home range size was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size = 307 ha) and was greatest in 3-4 year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home range size = 430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size = 460 ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200 ha by exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in summer wildfires <200 ha and retaining at least 50% of summer wildfires >400 ha. Ideally, recently burned forest patches should be composed of >=27 m2 basal area/ha of trees that burned at moderate or high severity, with at least 40% of the basal area composed of trees >=27 cm DBH.

Albanesi, Sebastian; Dardanelli, Sebastian; Bellis, Laura M.				Journal of Forest Research	19	1		105-114	Feb 2014	2014				English	0	29	In central Argentina, Serrano forest has a long history of fire disturbance; however, the impact of fire on avifauna remains unknown. We compared the avian-habitat relationships in forest patches with low, moderate, and high fire regimes using a community-level (species richness, abundance, ordination and guilds) and species-level (indicator species analysis) approach. In patches under each fire condition, we recorded bird community composition, richness and abundance, and different vegetation structure variables. The site under high-severity fire regime was structurally poor and had been converted from original forest to dense grassland. There, diversity of bird community was low, retaining approximately 30 % of the species present in the least impacted site. Avian assemblage was dominated by generalist and open area birds. Guilds were underrepresented, showing an important reduction of foliage granivorous, nectarivorous, omnivores, and foliage and bark insectivorous, and absence of fly-catchers. Moreover, low abundance of forest understory, midstory, and canopy species and of birds belonging to open and closed nesting guilds was detected. By contrast, under low and moderate-severity fire regimes highest bird diversity as well as highest representativeness of most guilds was observed. Forest bird species were strongly associated with low fire disturbance, whereas moderate fire disturbance was characterized by the presence of forest and generalist species. Given the critical conservation status of Serrano forest in Crdoba, Argentina, habitat restoration and protection of forest relicts could be suitable measures to promote avifauna preservation.

Smetzer, Jennifer R.; King, David I.; Schlossberg, Scott				Journal of Wildlife Management	78	2		314-324	Feb 2014	2014				English	0	21	Population declines of birds that breed in early-successional shrubland habitat are of great concern to conservationists throughout the northeastern United States. To help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of efforts to conserve these species and their habitats, we studied birds in temporary forest openings created through even-aged timber harvest, and permanent wildlife openings maintained through mechanical treatment and prescribed burning in the Northern Appalachians, USA in 2010 and 2011. We assessed the effects of treatment method, time since last treatment, and retained tree cover on shrubland bird abundance and habitat conditions. Burned and mechanically treated wildlife openings differed only in grass and fern cover. Both types of wildlife openings had more grasses and forbs, and less bare ground than silvicultural openings. Six out of 8 focal bird species were less abundant in silvicultural openings than in wildlife openings. In contrast, abundance of only 1 species differed between burned and mechanically treated wildlife openings. Silvicultural openings supported the same species as wildlife openings, indicating that this management option could be used in place of more costly wildlife opening management. However, because birds were more abundant in wildlife openings, maintaining the current population size of shrubland birds under a management strategy based entirely on silviculture would require a 50-300% increase in the area of silvicultural openings, depending on the species. Individual species peaked in abundance at different times post treatment, indicating that managers must maintain a range of early-successional conditions across the landscape to provide habitat for the entire suite of shrubland birds. Six species exhibited a negative relationship with the basal area of retained conifer cover, and 7 species with deciduous tree cover, indicating that the retention of overstory trees in openings reduced their utility to early-successional birds.

Sanchez-Oliver, J.S.; Rey Benayas, J.M.; Carrascal, L.M.				European Journal of Wildlife Research	60	1		135-143	Feb 2014	2014				English	4	32	We investigated the effects of local habitat structure and surrounding landscape characteristics (proportion of land use types and connectedness) on species density and composition of bird communities inhabiting the interior of young tree plantations on former cropland in central Spain, which were motivated by the Common Agrarian Policy. Variation of species density (number of species/0.78 ha) among tree plantations showed different environmental associations across seasons: local habitat was more important than landscape characteristics during winter, whereas they were similarly important during spring. Species density increased with the development of the tree layer in winter and with the presence of urban areas around tree plantations and cover of the herbaceous layer within them in the breeding season. We identified 15 species that exhibit high relative abundance in woodland habitats within the Mesomediterranean region of Central Spain that were absent in both seasons in the studied tree plantations, which were an attractive habitat for urban exploiter species but an unfavorable habitat for the regional forest species pool except for forest generalist species. Composition of bird assemblages was more related to local habitat structure than to landscape characteristics around tree plantations and was rather similar in winter and spring seasons. The very different effects of local habitat and landscape characteristics on bird communities make difficult suggesting management practices with positive effects for all avifauna species during the entire year. We conclude that the small size and low maturity of the studied tree plantations do not contribute to enhancing the bird diversity value of current CAP aids to afforest former cropland with pines in the Mediterranean region.

Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies	2	1 A		1-5	Feb 2014	2014				English	0	0	The lac insect, Kerria lacca Kerr (Coccoidea: Homoptera) is well known for its valuable resin. It thrives on host plants like Palas, Kusum and Ber. An attempt has been made to study culture of lac in non-conventional method of cultivation in peripheral and buffer zones of Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR) where farmers are practicing in a conventional way. The initial density of settlement of larva ranged between 92.58-126.74 no. /cm2 and 93.12-109.62 no. /cm2 in Kusmi strain on Kusum and Ber trees, respectively. For Rangeeni strain it was 82.67-118.32 no. /cm2. The sex ratio (male: female) was found to be 1: 3 for all the crops, strains and host plants. The range of resin output per cell was 17.00-21.40 mg for winter crop and 19.00-25.60 mg for summer crop of Kusmi strain on Kusum and Ber plants. For Rangeeni strain on Palas plant it was 05.30-11.20 mg for rainy crop and 18.72 -23.00 mg for summer crop. Moreover, the temperature influenced the life cycle, life span and resin output of this insect. Pruning of trees meet the firewood requirement as fuel and also for household uses, also prevents deforestation and conserve the forest ecosystem. Lac insect has some vertebrate predators like monkeys, squirrels, rats, lizards, woodpeckers, birds and insect predators are Lepidopterans (Eublemma amabilis, Pseudohypatopa pulverea) and Neuropterans (Chrysopa madestes, C. lacciperda). So directly or indirectly lac cultivation helps in conservation of biodiversity.

Forest Ecology and Management	312			28-39	Jan 15 2014	2014				English	1	36	Assessing the feasibility of proposed Bird Conservation Region (BCR) population objectives requires comparing expected future population size estimates to proposed population objectives. Linking statistical bird habitat models with landscape simulation models can provide a direct method for assessing the ecological and economic implications of alternative land and resource scenarios within a BCR or BCR sub-region. We demonstrate our approach for analyses of future habitat supply and population size for a suite of priority landbird species using the ALCES[registered trademark] landscape simulation model and empirical bird habitat models within a multi-use landscape located in northeast Alberta, Canada and BCR 6-Boreal Taiga Plains. We used ALCES[registered trademark]to simulate future landscape condition over a 100 year time period under three scenarios: business as usual, protected areas, and climate change. Shortfalls between simulated population size estimates at year 30 and proposed population objectives existed for each of the four priority bird species examined suggesting that expected future landscape condition will not support proposed population objectives for these species. Boreal species strongly associated with mature and old forest habitats exhibited population declines over the 100 year simulation period. One habitat generalist, a species associated with both early and late seral stages, appeared to benefit from the range of land use scenarios examined. Our approach improves upon current static approaches used to step down BCR scale population objectives to sub-regional scale habitat objectives by utilizing statistical bird population response models to estimate density and a dynamic landscape simulation model to estimate expected future habitat condition.

Etude de la selection des habitats forestiers par le Murin de Bechstein en foret domaniale de Gresigne (81, Tarn, France).	Bouny, Gaelle; Tillon, Laurent				Vespere	4			287-296	2014	2014				French	1	1	A newly established Natura 2000 contract on the site of the forest of Gresigne (No. FR7300951) requires for the manager to ensure that the management measures in place are responsive to the ecological demands of forest bats, taking the Bechstein's bat as model, given its strong forest character. Therefore, as part of this contract and the forestry component of the PNA on bats (2009-2013), a study based on the technique of telemetry was conducted in order to obtain accurate information on ecology of this species and the local operation of breeding colonies (selection of roosts and foraging habitats). Home ranges with several activity centers of the individuals studied had an average area of 176.73 [plus or minus] 63.26 ha for Kernel 95% and 34.64 [plus or minus] 13.58 ha for Kernel 50%. The roosts used corresponded to the classical model for the species : woodpecker hole or narrow crack in the part of healthy stand oak. The behavior of roosts utilization was typical of the fission-fusion usually observed for this species. Habitats selected for foraging are highly stratified leafy old forests (sometimes with a dense understorey) and has a well-stocked wooded stratum with a high proportion of fat trees. The data thus collected helped us to formulate conservation management recommendations can be incorporated in the planning of forest management and current management, in a context of aging and decaying forests globally.

Fishponds in Stary Brus in Polesie Lubelskie are an example of positive changes and they are regarded as one of the most significant breeding sites of this duck in the Lublin region. In 2009-2013, there were 11-19 breeding pairs, but between the late 1960s and 2005, the number of ducks was estimated at only a few breeding pairs. In 2009, there were 16 pairs (about 15% of the total Polish breeding population) and at least 9 broods. The number of Ferruginous Ducks should remain stable in Stary Brus fishponds, provided there are no drastic habitat changes in the ponds.

Bregnballe, Thomas; Amstrup, Ole; Holm, Thomas E.; Clausen, Preben; Fox, Anthony D.				Ornis Fennica	91	4		231-243	2014	2014				English	3	28	After circa 35 years of drainage and intensive arable tillage, the lower Skjern River, Denmark was re-engineered to its original meanders and flooding regime, creating 22 km2 of lakes, shallow wetlands and seasonally flooded grazed wet grassland costing (SIC)38 million. The primary motivation was to restore the sediment/nutrient retention capacity of the river valley to reduce eutrophication of Ringkobing Fjord at its efflux. Secondary objectives were to (i) restore breeding and staging bird habitat, (ii) enhance the self-sustaining Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar population and (iii) improve recreational and tourist activities. Despite lack of specific success criteria, breeding waterbird numbers increased from 134 [plus or minus] 22.9 SE (n = 3) pairs before to 1,744 [plus or minus] 153 SE (n = 5) after restoration (although on average 1,004 of these were Black-headed Gulls Chroicocephalus ridibundus), species richness and diversity also increased. Twenty-nine waterbird species returned to breed, 10 of national or international significance (Danish Red List/European Union Birds Directive Annex 1 species) now ranking Skjern River amongst the top 10 most important breeding waterbird sites in Denmark. Currently, agriculture supports cost-neutral management of the restoration area, but whilst most expected wet meadow and marsh species had returned, lack of goal-orientated management targets resulted in some additional rare and threatened species remaining absent. Breeding pair density and diversity of other species could have been greatly improved by prior planning and management intervention but at additional cost.

Babar, H.T.; Raje, G.B.; Korochikar, P.V.; Gaikwad, V.M.				World Journal of Environmental Biosciences	3	1		42-55	Jan 2014	2014				English	0	0	The avian communities in the vicinity of two manmade medium sized reservoirs viz. Morawane dam and Natuwadi dam at Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra denoted by communities 'MDV' and 'NDV', respectively, were studied during the period of January 2012 to December 2012. This was to establish a bird species list and to provide essential information on the wild birds in the vicinity of study area. Avian survey was conducted by employing the quadrate method. The total 104 bird species belonging to 14 orders and 39 families were recorded. Order wise analysis of data was done for calculating the Shannon-Weiner Index (H) and Simpson's Index (D) for species diversity; and Sorensen's Index (ISs) for similarity in both the communities. The results indicated that Shannon-Weiner Index of diversity was higher for the order Piciformes (0.5) followed by Galliformes (0.4422) and Ciconiformes (0.3281) in 'MDV' against 0.1790 for the order Ciconiformes followed by Passeriformes (0.1774) and Coraciformes (0.1686) in 'NDV'. The Simpson's Diversity Index was higher for the order Piciformes (0.75) followed by Galliformes (0.64) and Ciconiformes (0.4622) in 'MDV' against 0.2490 for the order Ciconiformes followed by Passeriformes (0.2467) and Coraciformes (0.2344) in 'NDV'. However, the Sorensen's Index of Similarity for two communities was 86.33%. Out of 14 orders, 8 showed 100% species similarity, and only one order showed 100% dissimilarity. Species wise Shannon-Weiner Index of Diversity for community 'NDV' (2.641) > 'MDV' (2.3851); and Simpson's Index for 'NDV' (0.7238) > 'MDV' (0.6664), indicated that the Morawane dam site was rather disturbed as compared to Natuwadi. It was, however, recommended that there is need to improve and manage the habitat in the vicinity of Morawane dam.

Kumar, Raman; Shahabuddin, Ghazala; Kumar, Ajith				Acta Ornithologica (Warsaw)	49	2		243-256	2014	2014				English	0	21	Ecological impacts of habitat change on woodpeckers remain largely unstudied in regions other than Europe and North America. The sub-Himalayan sal Shorea robusta forests of northwest India have 17 woodpecker species, and a history of management-induced habitat modification. We studied how habitat parameters affect woodpeckers at a community level (viz. total abundance and species richness) as well as at individual species level. We assessed woodpecker abundance, species richness and described habitat features at 8 sites representing a gradient of structure and composition in a sal-dominated landscape. We surveyed each site in 2-km-long transects 20 times over breeding and non-breeding seasons and evaluated habitat characteristics in 10 circular and belt plots. We analysed woodpecker abundance, species richness, and abundance of individual species as functions of habitat variables and season. Woodpecker encounter rates and mean species richness, respectively, ranged from 1.5 to 10.0 birds/km and 1.7 to 6.9 species per survey at individual sites. Distance-based estimates of densities for the most frequently-observed species were also obtained. Basal area (large trees) and density of snags positively influenced total woodpecker abundance and species richness, with snags being more important during breeding season. Basal area was important for Greater Flameback Chrysocolaptes lucidus, Grey-faced Woodpecker Picus canus, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker Dendrocopos macei and Lesser Yellownape Picus chlorolophus. Snags, tree density, tree diameter and termitarium density appeared to affect Grey-capped Pygmy Woodpecker Dendrocopos canicapillus, Black-rumped Flameback Dinopium benghalense, Himalayan Flameback Dinopium shorii and Streak-throated Woodpecker Picus xanthopygaeus. Hence, for the conservation of native woodpecker communities in sal forests, it is necessary to retain large trees and standing dead wood.

Glyn; Young, R.P.; Razafindrajao, F.; Bin Aboudou, Abdallah Labia; Fa, J.E.				Wildfowl	64			35-53	2014	2014				English	0	4	Madagascar still retains extensive wetlands important for fishing, hunting and agriculture. They also support a high proportion of the island's globally threatened endemic birds. However, as a result of widespread modification through human activity, wetlands are under severe pressure across the island, resulting in the decline of many waterbird species. For the effective conservation of waterbirds in Madagascar, it is vital that wetlands supporting important assemblages of species are identified and protected. In this study, we surveyed the wetlands of central western Madagascar (southern Melaky and Menabe Regions) to investigate patterns of waterbird diversity and map priority sites. Thirty-four wetland sites were surveyed in 2004, during which a total of 56 waterbird species were recorded. Waterbird species richness was associated with the size of the water body and presence of rice cultivation. All sites were ranked according to an index of vulnerability, based on the cumulative score of the degree of threat for every wetland bird species found in a site. We show that wetlands in western Madagascar hold important numbers of several globally threatened species; five of the rarest bird species in Madagascar are found here. The 10 highest-ranking wetland sites fall within BirdLife International IBAs, but four wetlands fall outside current or planned protected areas. We recommend that monitoring of wetland sites in western Madagascar is undertaken at regular intervals and that all sites are included in a network of protection that can ensure the survival of wetland bird diversity in the country.

Fogg, Alissa M.; Roberts, L. Jay; Burnett, Ryan D.				Avian Conservation and Ecology	9	2		3	2014	2014				English	0	28	Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a rare habitat specialist typically found in moderate and high severity burned forest throughout its range. It also inhabits green forest but little is known about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas, especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011 -2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since 1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects, number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest, and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05 and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in efforts to conserve this rare species.

We report the first results of conservation actions to improve wader habitats, principally by controlled rewetting of the floodplain and preventing fires in spring. In the first year, 2012, the numbers of a variety of waders increased. In 2013, a period of heavy summer rain led to increased flooding and a decline in some species, especially Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus, Marsh Sandpiper Tringa stagnatilis and Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa, and an increase in species that prefer wetter conditions, such as Great Snipe Gallinago media and Common Snipe G. gallinago. Future rewetting activities and bird population monitoring will show whether such conservations actions have long-term benefits.

Tiemeyer, Volker; Drews, Falko				Osnabruecker Naturwissenschaftliche Mitteilungen	39-4			191-212	2014	2014				German	0	0	In January 2007, the winter storm "Kyrill" caused windthrow areas in spruce and spruce-larch forests near Melle (Western Lower Saxony). The avifauna of seven of these windthrow areas was investigated throughout the whole year between March 2009 and August 2010 by transect mapping. The entire transect of 1,500 meters could be divided into three different reclaimed areas each with different "close to nature types" (I-III). Line transect counts over a 50-meter wide strip have proved to be an appropriate and manageable ornithological observation method. Altogether, 50 bird species with 1,618 individuals were registered, corresponding to a total abundance of 1,080 individuals per kilometer. Wren, Chaffinch, Blue and GreatTit had the highest continuity, Eurasian Siskin and Red Crossbill were dominant.The European Honey Buzard was the only species on the Red List. Further 19 species of priority for the protection of the German breeding birds were registered. The highest mean monthly number of species was detected between July and September, while the population size as a whole reached its maximum in November. The type III area, which is extremelyfar away from natural conditions, is populated only at low abundance and number of species. For the more natural type I, at least 45 species with an average continuity of 23,4% were recorded. Due to the significant gradients in the number of species and individuals between the different"close to nature types", recommendations for the management of windthrow areas were concluded. From a nature conservation perspective, a natural forest development should therefore be preferred, rather than an intensive reclaiming and soil cultivation after a windthrow event in managed forests. Biodiversity of bird species is promoted by leaving dead wood and root plates on the surface combined with the selfinduced succession of areas cleared by storms.

Kronenberger, John; Cipollini, Martin; Baldvins, Thomas; Montgomery, Andrew; Simpson, Averi				Natural Areas Journal	34	1		8-23	Jan 2014	2014				English	2	36	Over the last century, logging, land conversion, and fire suppression have reduced longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystems to a small fraction of their original range. Fire suppression, in particular, has facilitated encroachment by non-fire-tolerant trees and heavy litter buildup, leading to shifts in the native plant and animal community. In 2001, efforts were initiated to re-establish parts of Berry College's (Floyd County, GA) fire-suppressed mountain longleaf pine forest using combinations of prescribed fire, clear-cutting, planting, and herbicide application. We designed this study to determine the effects of management practices thus far on vegetation structure and the bird community. In 2009, vegetation structure data were collected in longleaf pine stands comprising three management classes ranging from low-to high-intensity management. Bird surveys were conducted from summer 2009 to spring 2010, and avifaunal community structure was related to vegetative characteristics within each stand. Unmanaged stands were strongly associated with common omnivorous, ground-foraging, and canopy-nesting birds of mixed woodlands. Intermediately managed stands contained mostly birds of mixed diet and aerial-and bark-feeding cavity nesters. Heavily managed stands were strongly associated with insect-, vertebrate-, seed-, and fruit-eating ground and shrub nesters, with several sightings of the near-threatened Bachman's sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis Lichtenstein). Intensity of management was positively correlated with canopy openness, understory development, and low litter levels. These vegetative differences helped explain the bird community makeup. We provide baseline data for assessing the impacts of management of mountain longleaf pine and similarly fire-suppressed forests on avian abundance and species richness.

Yang, Song; Zhang, Bolong; Zhuang, Xianglin; Xia, Jufei; Chai, Shouquan				Journal of the Entomological Research Society	16	2		117-125	2014	2014				English	0	1	The mortality rate of overwintering population of the pine bark-weevil, Pissodes punctatus and causes of mortality were examined on newly infested host trees in Northeast Yunnan Province of China. We found an 80.76% mortality rate of P. punctatus that was greatly higher than the healthy (survival) rate. Life stages of overwintering population of this pest were overlapping including older larvae (3rd-4th instar) (71.20%), pupae (16.47%) and adults (12.32%). The causes of mortality were identified into different biotic factors, which included woodpecker predation, parasitism by insect parasitoids, tree resistance and undetermined diseases. Predation by woodpeckers (41.83%) was the dominant factor causing the mortality of immature stages of P. punctatus and significantly higher than the parasitism by insect parasitoids (18.99%), tree resistance (17.97%) and undetermined diseases (1.98%). Moreover, three hymenopteran ectoparasitoids (Triaspis sp., Rhopalicus sp. and Eurytoma sp.) were observed to attack immature stages of P punctatus. Triaspis sp. was the dominant species amounting 70.59% of the parasitoids, indicating a high potential in the biological control programme of P punctatus. Relevance of these findings to biological control associated with forest management of P punctatus was discussed.

Wilson, Deborah J.; Norbury, Grant; Walker, Susan				New Zealand Journal of Ecology	38	2		257-267	2014	2014				English	2	24	The density of shrubs is increasing in many dry grassland ecosystems worldwide. In the dry interior of the South Island, New Zealand, secondary succession generates novel woody communities, as shrubs colonise anthropogenic grasslands where fire frequency has decreased. The avifauna of this dry region is also novel, with many indigenous birds extinct, extirpated or uncommon, and exotic species predominant. We studied how succession from grassland to shrubland habitats affects the abundance of dryland birds, by estimating population densities of nine common exotic and indigenous passerine bird species in dryland habitats in grassland, mixed grassland shrubland and shrubland, at three sites in Central Otago, South Island. We used distance sampling along line transects to estimate densities. Generally, succession from grassland to forest leads to decreased numbers of granivorous birds and feeding generalists, and increased numbers of insectivores. We therefore predicted that density of birds in five guilds would change as follows during succession to woodier habitats: (1) granivores: decrease, (2) a primarily ground-nesting, ground-feeding granivore-insectivore: decrease; (3) a tree- and shrub-nesting granivore-insectivore: increase; (4) ground-feeding insectivores: increase; (5) indigenous insectivores: increase. Our predictions were supported for only one guild. Yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella) (exotic primarily ground-nesting, ground-feeding granivore insectivore that prefers open country) declined in density as woody-species frequency increased. Exotic European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) and common redpoll (C. flammea) (granivores) were most abundant at intermediate woodiness. Densities of other guilds did not vary consistently with woodiness. We conclude that continued succession to shrubland in Central Otago will have little effect on densities of many common exotic passerine birds, but may lead to local declines in yellowhammer, and ultimately goldfinch and redpoll. Our density estimates for silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) and grey warbler (Gerygone igata) were lower than densities reported in forests; therefore later stages of succession may benefit these widespread indigenous insectivores.

Brandt, Patric; Abson, David J.; DellaSala, Dominick A.; Feller, Robert; von Wehrden, Henrik				Biological Conservation	169			362-371	Jan 2014	2014				English	4	135	Forests produce a myriad of ecosystem related benefits known as ecosystem services. Maximizing the provision of single goods may lead to the overexploitation of ecosystems that negatively affects biodiversity and causes ecosystem degradation. We analyzed the temperate rainforest region of the Pacific Northwest, which offers a multitude of ecosystem services and harbors unique biodiversity, to investigate linkages and trade-offs between ecosystem services and biodiversity. We mapped nine actual and potential ecosystem services, grouped into provision, supporting, regulating and cultural ecosystem service categories, as well as species richness of four taxonomic groups (mammals, birds, trees, and amphibians). We analyzed linkages and tradeoffs between ecosystem services, their overall diversity, and species richness as well as different levels of taxon diversity. We also tested if ecosystem service categories, in addition to climate and land cover parameters, could indicate species richness. We found significant positive linkages between ecosystem service diversity and species richness of all considered taxa. The provision of the majority of ecosystem services was higher in areas of high taxon diversity, indicating both positive relationships and slight trade-offs in maximizing single ecosystem services. In general, ecosystem service categories were a comparable indicator of species richness as climate. Our findings show that multifunctionality largely coincides with high levels of biodiversity within the study region. Hence, an integrative ecosystem management approach that incorporates ecosystem services and biodiversity concerns is needed to both provide diverse ecosystem benefits and conserve biological diversity.

Choi, Chang-Yong; Lee, Eun-Jae; Nam, Hyun-Young; Lee, Woo-Shin; Lim, Joo-Hoon				Landscape and Ecological Engineering	10	1		203-214	Jan 2014	2014				English	0	19	The Samcheok forest fire of April 2000 was the biggest stand-replacing fire recorded in Korea, and led to the largest-scale salvage logging operation (performed until 2005) ever implemented. We investigated the effects of the treatments performed after the fire on the breeding bird community in 2002-2005 (the management period) and 2006-2008 (the post-management period). A total of 75 line transect surveys resulted in 660 detections of 54 species in undisturbed stands (CO), in burned and naturally restored stands (NI), and in burned and logged stands (IT). Four species (Parus major, Aegithalos caudatus, Dendrocopos kizuki, and Parus ater) were identified as indicator species in CO which showed no temporal changes in bird communities and habitat structure. Among the various stand treatments, the standardized species richness was highest in CO (11.6 [plus or minus]A 4.6 species/transect in 2002-2005, 12.1 [plus or minus]A 3.5 in 2006-2008), and this richness did not change over time. On the other hand, low richness was observed in NI (6.8 [plus or minus]A 2.6 in 2002-2005, 9.6 [plus or minus]A 2.3 in 2006-2008), and the lowest richness was seen in IT (5.0 [plus or minus]A 2.4 in 2002-2005, 6.1 [plus or minus]A 1.8 in 2006-2008), but both of these increased over time. Although the bird abundances in NI and IT were lower than those in CO (38.0 [plus or minus]A 27.7 birds/transect in 2002-2005, 31.3 [plus or minus]A 10.9 in 2006-2008), the abundances in NI (15.1 [plus or minus]A 8.6 in 2002-2005, 17.6 [plus or minus]A 11.4 in 2006-2008) and IT (11.7 [plus or minus]A 8.3 in 2002-2005, 10.0 [plus or minus]A 4.6 in 2006-2008) were not significantly different. There was no significant difference in abundance between time periods for any of the stand treatments. These results imply that NI (i.e., no salvage logging) allows greater bird richness but not abundance to be recovered compared to IT. No indicator species was consistently present in NI throughout the two time periods covered due to the rapid regrowth of vegetation, but four open-habitat dwellers (Falco tinnunculus, Phoenicurus auroreus, Emberiza cioides, and Sturnus cineraceus) colonized IT during the post-management period. The bird assemblage in IT, as assessed by canonical correspondence analysis, shifted to open habitats, while the avifauna in NI became similar to that in CO over time. While post-fire treatment can provide new colonization opportunities for open-habitat dwellers, the slow colonization process, the low species richness, and the low bird abundance observed in large areas of IT indicate that post-fire treatment using salvage logging inhibits the restoration of forest bird communities by producing a poorer breeding bird community that is very different from the original one. Based on these lessons from the response to the Samcheok forest fire, we suggest that preserving as much of the disturbed forest as possible is essential, and that the current approach to post-fire treatment-intensive salvage logging-needs to be revised to ensure the effective restoration of breeding bird communities in disturbed temperate pine forests.

Pereira, Pedro; Godinho, Carlos; Gomes, Marisa; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo				Annals of Forest Science	71	1		33-41	Jan 2014	2014				English	1	25	Context The remaining riparian stretches are often the unique suitable habitats for forest breeding birds in Mediterranean landscapes undergoing long-term changes. Understanding the interactions between riparian zones and their surroundings is critical to establish successful management actions. Aims We assessed the influence of surrounding matrix on riparian bird communities and the use of riparian galleries as surrogate habitats for the forest passerine communities of southwestern Iberia. Methods We used point counts in three simultaneous sampling stations, one in the riparian gallery and two in the adjacent matrix. Three matrix types were selected with a decreasing tree density gradient: dense montado, sparse montado, and open agricultural areas. Data were analysed with redundancy analysis and differences in species' occurrences were tested with one-way ANOVA. Results In riparian galleries, we found bird species belong to three ecological guilds: riparian, woodland, and edge guilds. The richness of bird guilds and the occurrence of some species depended on the surrounding matrix type. Riparian bird richness was constant in all surrounding matrices, woodland bird guild was richer in galleries embedded in dense montados, and edge guild in riparian galleries surrounded by sparse montados. Five among 19 assessed species were influenced by matrix type, within particular a few strictly riparian species. Species richness increased close to riparian galleries, due to the increase in habitat heterogeneity and resource availability for birds in densely vegetated riversides. However, the occurrence of some bird species differed according to the type of surrounding matrix. Conclusion The matrix type explained most of the variance in riparian bird assemblages. Some woodland birds have used riparian galleries as surrogate habitat. Our study suggests that land use in the surrounding matrices must be taking into account for the management and rehabilitation of watercourses and bird conservation actions.

Kurek, Przemyslaw; Kapusta, Pawel; Holeksa, Jan				Ecological Research	29	1		1-11	Jan 2014	2014				English	1	54	This study examined the effects of burrow digging and habitation by the European badger (Meles meles) and the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) on soil properties and the plant community. The vegetation of control plots located in a similar but undisturbed habitat was compared with that of 18 burrow plots established at badger setts (N = 9) and fox dens (N = 9) in a lowland forest area in Poland. Soil physicochemical properties at different disturbance levels (mounds, intermounds and reference areas) were also investigated. The animals altered nutrient availability in the burrow plots considerably by excavating material from deep soil horizons that were less acidic and higher in K, Ca, Mg and available P but poorer in C and N. The effect was stronger for the badger, probably because it displaced larger amounts of material and disturbed wider areas. The activity of the two carnivores induced similar changes in plant communities. They increased herbaceous species richness and caused a shift in the herbaceous species composition: versus the control plots, the burrow plots contained more fugitive species (short-living plants typical for disturbed environments), among which ruderal forbs, including nutrient-demanding species, dominated. The carnivores also increased the species richness of fleshy-fruited shrubs and trees. The primary reason for this was probably not burrowing but endozoochorous seed dispersal. Overall, the results indicate that the badger setts and fox dens differ significantly from the forest matrix in terms of soil and vegetation parameters, and that they contribute to habitat heterogeneity and biological diversity.

Dorge, Tsering; Hogstedt, Goran; Lislevand, Terje				Avian Research	5			5	2014	2014				English	1	5	Background: Little is hitherto known about the breeding ecology of the Tibetan Partridge (Perdix hodgsoniae) which is endemic to the Tibetan plateau. Here we describe nest densities, inter-nest distances and general nest site characteristics in this gallinaceous bird species and explore the possibilities that certain shrub and plant types are preferred as nest surroundings. Method: A total of 56 nests were found over three breeding seasons near Lhasa, Tibet. Nest site characteristics were compared with random control plots and the proportions of specific plant species covering nests were compared with their estimated general occurrence in the study area. Results: Nest density in the two years with highest search effort was estimated at 1.43/km2 and 1.04/km2 but was clearly higher in the part of the study area facing north (1.86-2.35/km2) than that facing south (0.11-0.34/km2). The average nearest neighbour distance of nests was about 300 m. Nests were situated in relatively lush vegetation and covered by a total of eight shrub species and three herbs. In contrast to previous reports, Caragana shrub did not constitute an important part of the nest habitat. The flowering, non-thorny bush Potentilla fruticosa was significantly over-represented as nest cover, while Rhododendron nivale was similarly under-represented. Nest bush foliage covered a larger area of ground, and the shrub surrounding nests was generally denser, than in control samples. Also, nests were placed closer to paths and in areas with lower densities of Yak (Bos grunniens) dung than in control samples. Except that soil temperatures were lower on nest sites than on control sites, micro-climate variables measured in this study did not differ between nest sites and control plots. Conclusions: Opportunity for nest concealment is probably an important quality of the nest habitat in Tibetan Partridges, yet it is unclear why the species should prefer P. fruticosa as nest cover. It is possible that nest sites are chosen to secure escape exits in the case of approaching predators and to reduce the risk of nest trampling. Tibetan Partridges may also select nest sites according to micro-climate, either directly or indirectly through climate-related differences in shrub vegetation.

Recently, it is famous because of a sharply increased in encroachment activities for forest conversion, especially for oil palm plantations and village sites. It was conducted in logged forest around Segati river, Toro river, Mamahan river and Sawan river in June 2003. The results showed that the area had the high richness of plant species which was indicated by the high value of Mennhenick index. Records from the 1 ha studied plot identified a total of 360 species included 165 genera and 57 families with 215 tree species 305 sapling species. Some important tree species which were included in the Red List of IUCN were 'gaharu' (Aquilaria malaccensis), 'ramin' (Gonystylus bancanus), Shorea spp. and Dipterocarpus spp. The local community utilized 83 species of medicinal plants and 4 species of toxic plants for fishing. The total number of recorded bird species was 114 species represented 29% of the total Sumatran bird species. The most important bird species were the Wrinkled Hornbill (Aceros corrugatus), Crestless Fireback (Lophura erythrophthalma), Crested Fireback (Lophura ignita) and Hooked-billed Bulbul (Setornis criniger). The total number of recorded mammal species was 34 species or 16.5% of 206 species of Sumatran mammals. The most important mammal species included Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae), Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatrensis), the Sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) and three species of Primates: Hylobates agilis, Presbytis femoralis and Macaca nemestrina. The herpetofauna contained 15 reptile species and 18 amphibian species. The most important herpetofauna was the endangered False Gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) and the vulnerable Common Soft-shelled turtle (Amyda cartilaginea). The number of recorded fish species was 50 represented 18% of the total Sumatran fish species (272 species). The important fish species were Breinsteinea sp. and Chaca bankanensis which were unique and rare. Since insects are the largest group of animal, this study only focused on beetles. The identified beetles were classified into 644 species and 34 families. The important beetles were the Longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) and the Scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae). The small mammal parasites consisted of ectoparasites which were categorized into 14 species and endoparasites which were categorized into 2 orders and 3 species.

Saracco, James F.; Holmgren, Amanda L.; Wilkerson, Robert L.; Siegel, Rodney B.; Kuntz, Robert C., II; Jenkins, Kurt J.; Happe, Patricia J.; Boetsch, John R.; Huff, Mark H.				U S Geological Survey Open-File Report	1202			1-36	2014	2014				English	0	0	National parks in the North Coast and Cascades Network (NCCN) can fulfill vital roles as refuges for bird species dependent on late-successional forest conditions and as reference sites for assessing the effects of land-use and land-cover changes on bird populations throughout the larger Pacific Northwest region. Additionally, long-term monitoring of landbirds throughout the NCCN provides information that can inform decisions about important management issues in the parks, including visitor impacts, fire management, and the effects of introduced species. In 2005, the NCCN began implementing a network-wide Landbird Monitoring Project as part of the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program. In this report, discuss 8-year trends (2005-12) of bird populations in the NCCN, based on a sampling framework of point counts established in three large wilderness parks (Mount Rainier, North Cascades, and Olympic National Parks), 7-year trends at Lewis and Clark National Historical Park (sampled in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012), and 5-year trends at San Juan Islands National Historical Park (sampled in 2007, 2009, and 2011). Our analysis encompasses a fairly short time span for this long-term monitoring program. The first 2 years of the time series (2005 and 2006) were implemented as part of a limited pilot study that included only a small subset of the transects. The subsequent 6 years (2007-12) represent just a single cycle through 5 years of alternating panels of transects in the large parks, with the first of five alternating panels revisited for the first time in 2012. Of 204 transects that comprise the six sampling panels in the large parks, only 68 (one-third) have thus been eligible for revisit surveys (34 during every year after 2005, and an additional 34 only in 2012) and can contribute to our current trend estimates. We therefore initiated the current analysis with a primary goal of testing our analytical procedures rather than detecting trends that might be strong enough to drive conservation or management decisions in the parks or elsewhere. We expect that aggregated trend detection results may change substantially over the next several years, as the number of transects with revisit histories triples and the spatial dispersion of transects contributing to trend estimates also improves greatly. In the meantime, caution should be exercised in interpreting the importance of trends, as individual years can have very large influences on the direction and magnitude of trends in a time series of such limited duration (and limited numbers of repeat visits at the small parks). Nevertheless, we estimated trends for 43 species at Mount Rainier National Park, 53 species at North Cascades National Park Complex, and 41 species at Olympic National Park. Of 137 park-species combinations (including combined-park analyses), we found 16 significant decreases (12 percent) and five significant increases (4 percent). We identify several limitations of the current analytical framework for trend assessment but suggest that the overall sampling design is strong and amenable to analysis by more recently developed model-based methods. These could provide a more flexible framework for examining trends and other population parameters of interest, as well as testing hypotheses that relate the distribution and abundance of species to environmental covariates. A model-based approach would allow for modeling various components of the detection process and analyzing observations (detection process), population state (occupancy, population size, density), and change (trend, local extinction and colonization rates turnover) simultaneously. Finally, we also evaluate operational aspects of NCCN Landbird Monitoring Project, and conclude that our robust, multi-party partnership is successfully implementing the project as it was envisioned.

Zukunftsperspektive fur die Uferschnepfe Limosa limosa in der Hetter: Flachenerwerb als Voraussetzung fur Grunland- und Wassermanagement zur Bestandsstabilisierung.	Barkow, Andreas				Vogelwelt	135	1		3-17	2014	2014				German	0	0	In Europe, and in particular in the core areas of its distribution in The Netherlands and northern Germany, the Black-tailed Godwit nominate population has decreased for decades and partly dramatically. In the Hetter, located in the SPA Lower Rhine area in North Rhine-Westphalia, a local population of 25-50 territorial pairs can be maintained since the mid-1990s. The nature reserve holds up to a quarter of the North Rhine-Westphalian breeding population. Since 2009, hatching success is monitored and breeding success is assessed by the number of alarming adult birds. The daily survival rate is 0.966. The hatching success estimated with the Mayfield method is about 45%. The breeding success is subject to large annual fluctuations. A careful estimate of the fledging success, assuming one young bird for each successful breeding pair only, results to an average reproduction rate of 0.42 fledglings per breeding pair and year. In favourable years such as 2010 and 2011 values of 0.53 and 0.55 are achieved. When looking at successive years, those with an increase in the number of breeding pairs show more pairs indicating success compared to years with less pairs present than in the preceding year. Only under the assumption of two fledged chicks per successful breeding pair, Black-tailed Godwits in the Hetter raise more than one chick per territorial pair on average. In the Hetter, land acquisition has consistently been part of the management since 1992. Purchased land was managed extensively. By taking into account for the habitat requirements of grassland birds i) suspended management during the breeding season, ii) extensive management with waiver of pesticides, mineral fertilizers and manure under moderate conservation fertilization with solid farmyard manure and grazing with a reduced number of cattle, and iii) improvement of the grassland by a system of ponds (so-called Blanken) was achieved. The land acquired by the NABU or especially the NRW-Stiftung (a foundation) was leased to local farmers for cultivation under the above-mentioned standards. After another 20 ha of land was bought in the frame of a LIFE+ project, a total of c. 90 ha of continuous land is now property of nature conservation. The purchase of land was the precondition for sustainable effects and area-wide measures, which enabled a variable retention of water in the area through the installation of weirs. First congestion measures proved to be successful with respect to bird density. The removal of perennial herbaceous plants and bushes along existing waterbodies also showed positive effects, because Black-tailed Godwit as the target species populated a larger continuous area in the study area. However, a permanent increase of local population could not be found. Effects of increasing loss rates to clutches and chicks due to a rising predation pressure are discussed.

The Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP) is a long-term, large-scale manipulative experiment testing the effects of even-aged (3-13 ha cuts over 10-15% of the site; n = 3), uneven-aged (0.03-3.14 ha cuts over 57% of the site; n = 3), and no harvest forest management on ecosystem level responses. We report on the effects of these management systems on the density and reproductive success of 11 songbird species from 5 years of pre-harvest (1991-1995) to 14 years of post-harvest (1997-2010). Density of four of the five mature forest species were lower after harvest in all management types and did not return to pre-harvest density, even in no harvest sites. Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) responded most negatively to even-aged management in the early post-harvest period (1997-2003) where density was significantly lower than in no harvest sites. Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa) density increased on uneven-aged and even-aged sites during early post-harvest, but returned to pre-harvest density on both management types by 14 years post-harvest. Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus) had lower density in all treatments post-harvest. Among the six early-successional species, density of Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera), Hooded Warbler (Setophaga citrina), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus) and Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) were significantly higher in even-aged and uneven-aged sites than in no harvest sites after harvest. Density of Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor) were significantly higher only in even-aged management after harvest. Prairie Warbler, Hooded Warbler, and White-eyed vireo appeared on the study sites following harvest while Indigo Bunting, Prairie Warbler, and Yellow-breasted Chat were absent from the study area 14 years post-harvest. Nest survival of mature forest and early-successional species did not change significantly from the pre- to the late post-harvest period or with forest management. Brood parasitism rates remained low from pre-harvest to late post-harvest, but parasitism rates were higher for early-successional species (4%) than mature forest species (1%). Although forest management had variable effects on species, we suggest a modified version of even-aged management could maximize benefits to early-successional species while minimizing decreases in mature forest bird species in central hardwood forests. Rather than the current prescription to harvest 10-15% of the mature stands every 15 years, we recommend harvesting approximately half the number of mature stands with a shorter re-entry period of 8-10 years.

Forest Ecology and Management	310			1045-1056	Dec 15 2013	2013				English	2	49	The retention of mature forest habitat elements (e.g., snags, downed wood, green trees) in clearcut forest stands is used to mitigate the negative impacts of timber harvesting on wildlife. We measured retained habitat elements and surveyed forest birds in recently (<15 years old) clearcut forest stands within 4 locations across the Pacific Northwest of the United States, ranging from central Washington to northern California. Our objectives were to quantify the structural characteristics of retained habitat elements and identify how retention practices have shaped local breeding bird communities. We sampled 20-22 harvest units in each location. We used a multi-species, multi-scale occupancy model to estimate probabilities of occurrence at large (stand level) and small (within stand) scales for all observed bird species, including those that were rarely detected, in addition to generating estimates of species richness at the stand level. We compared local occupancy with an index of regional occupancy to identify species that were selecting or avoiding clearcuts with retention. Average green-tree diameters ranged from 33 to 42 cm while snag diameters ranged from 34 to 74 cm; single trees were often larger on average than trees retained in patches, depending on the region. Downed wood volumes ranged from 129 to 650 m3 ha-1, with the majority of volume ([approximately]60-76%) contributed by larger logs (>50 cm in diameter). We observed 71 songbird and woodpecker species using clearcuts during 2008-2009. Stand-level richness varied within and across study regions (mean range: 30-38 species). We found species with considerably higher and lower probabilities of occurrence than predicted by regional occurrence, suggesting that clearcuts with retention were valued differently by members of the forest bird community in each region. Upper canopy/bark foraging species generally occurred within clearcuts less often than expected, while cavity-nesting species exhibited a range of positive and negative relationships that sometimes differed by region. Our results provide context for understanding the contribution of retained habitat elements to forest birds and can potentially guide future monitoring activities pertaining to conservation of forest species in managed landscapes of the Pacific Northwest.

Millsap, Brian A.; Breen, Timothy F.; Phillips, Laura M.				North American Fauna	78			1-58	Dec 2013	2013				English	1	16	We studied adult Cooper's hawks Accipiter cooperii on two study areas in north Florida from 1995 to 2001, an area dominated by large plantations managed for northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus and an area of mixed farmland and woods with no direct bobwhite management. We monitored 76 Cooper's hawk nesting attempts at 31 discrete nest areas, and radio-tagged 19 breeding males and 30 breeding females that we radio-tracked for up to 5 y. Nesting density (565 to 1,494 ha per occupied nest area) was comparable but productivity (1.8 and 2.8 young fledged per occupied and successful nest area, respectively) was lower than for the species elsewhere. Prey may have been more limiting than in other areas studied because chipmunks Tamias striatus, an important prey elsewhere, were absent. Annual Cooper's hawk survival averaged 84% for males and 81% for females, except in 1998 when survival was substantially lower. Average annual home-range size for male Cooper's hawks was 15.3 km2 inclusive of one nesting area. Female annual ranges averaged 30.3 km2, and included from three to nine nesting areas. Daily space use was similar between the sexes, but females had separate breeding and nonbreeding ranges whereas males were sedentary. Females used the same nonbreeding areas among years, but switched nesting areas 68% of the time compared with only 17% for males. Birds comprised 88% of the breeding and 98% of the nonbreeding season diet of Cooper's hawks by frequency. Important prey species all year were mourning doves Zenaida macroura, blue jays Cyanocitta cristata, and northern bobwhite; during summer, cattle egrets Bubulcus ibis, northern mockingbirds Mimus polyglottos and northern cardinals Cardinalis cardinalis were also important; and during autumn and winter, killdeer Charadrius vociferus, yellow-billed cuckoos Coccyzus americanus, and chickens were important. Female Cooper's hawks took larger prey than males; females were responsible for most cattle egret and chicken kills; whereas, males took most blue jays, killdeer, northern mockingbirds, and northern cardinals. Of avian prey brought to nests, 64% were nestling birds. Most adult male Cooper's hawks were adept at raiding bird nest boxes. Male Cooper's hawks captured 85% of the prey fed to nestlings. Female Cooper's hawks relied on males for food from early March until young were >= 12 d old, and 6 of 10 breeding females monitored intensively were never observed foraging for their broods. Most prey brought to nestling Cooper's hawks was captured within 2 km of nests, and foraging effort was consistent throughout the day. During the nonbreeding season, most prey captures occurred before 0900 hours or at dusk. Northern bobwhite made up 2% of male and 6% of female Cooper's hawk prey annually by frequency; this extrapolated to 18 bobwhite/year/adult Cooper's hawk on both study areas, 59% of which were captured between November and February. Outside the breeding season, male Cooper's hawks foraged evenly over their home range whereas females tended to focus on prey concentrations. Because female Cooper's hawks were so adept at finding and exploiting prey hotspots, perhaps the best strategy for reducing predation on bobwhite is habitat management that produces an even distribution of bobwhite across the landscape.

Becker, Rafael Gustavo; Paise, Gabriela; Pizo, Marco Aurelio				Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia	21	4		221-234	Dec 2013	2013				English	1	24	Mined areas undergo physical changes and profound alterations in the structure and composition of the vegetation. Hence, the fauna cannot return to these areas without human intervention, usually through revegetation. In the state of Parana, southern Brazil, we assessed the structure of bird communities (species richness, composition, trophic guilds, and forest dependence) in areas of different ages (5, 10, and 20 years) that were revegetated after mining with a single species of native tree (Mimosa scabrella). These areas were compared with a forest area with no mining influence (control). The areas differed in species richness and species composition. Birds of some foraging guilds (e. g., frugivores) were absent from 10- and 5-year-old areas. The occurrence of forest-dependent birds increased, whereas forest-independent birds decreased with increasing area age. The death of Mimosa scabrella trees between 10 and 20 years after planting reduced vegetation complexity and affected the bird fauna. To avoid such an effect, and to assure the presence of frugivorous birds that are important to restore the vegetation through seed dispersal, we recommend the use of a high diversity of plant species in the initial planting, including plants with fleshy fruits that attract frugivorous birds.

We studied this in Cotove Agricultural Center in the municipality of Santa Fe de Antioquia (Colombia),where the conversion of natural forests to different land use systems, has limited the amount of available habitat. With the aim to describe the effect of habitat loss on bird presence in five land uses (fruiting trees, silvopastoral systems, secondary forest, pasture low density of trees and grass cutting) in this area, we studied bird diversity using two methods: fixed point counts and mist nets to analyze the influence of land use in the composition, richness and abundance of birds present were studied. A total of 6 633 individuals of 101 species were observed of which 11 species were migratory. The insectivorous and frugivorous foraging guilds were better represented. The Shannon index indicated the highest values of alpha diversity for the silvopastoral system, and the fruit with the lowest. The grazing and silvopastoral land systems shared more species with low tree density. The importance of the environmental heterogeneity found is highlighted as a positive factor for bird species richness, mostly of low and middle habitat specificity, and preferably from edge habitats and open areas. In order to preserve natural regeneration and connectivity between different land use types, and to promote stability of bird species populations, some management actions should be implemented in the area.

Mudrzynski, Brad M.; Norment, Christopher J.				Wilson Journal of Ornithology	125	4		744-754	Dec 2013	2013				English	6	44	Many studies have suggested that early successional habitats are important for fall migrant and resident birds. In light of this, we studied habitat relationships, preferred fruiting shrub species, and fruit consumption by birds in early successional habitats during the fall at Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge, Alabama, New York, USA. We used transects to count birds in 12 shrub and 6 early successional forest sites during 2008-2009, and collected data to construct habitat models. We examined frugivory using a paired open/enclosed fruit branch experiment and by analyzing fecal samples of birds captured in mist nets. More fall songbirds were detected in shrublands than in forests across the 2 years, although forests with well-developed understories also had high detection levels. Total bird abundance was positively related to fruiting species richness and negatively related to small woody stem (0.0-2.5 cm) abundance. Abundance of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) was positively related to total shrub cover and fruit abundance on common buckthorns (Rhamnus cathartica), and negatively related to small and large (2.5-8.0 cm) stem abundance. Abundance of Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) was positively related to fruiting shrub species richness. Abundance of Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) was positively related to gray dogwood (Cornus racemosa) fruit abundance, and negatively related to small stem abundance and bella honeysuckle (Lonicera X bella) fruit abundance. Fecal analysis suggested that birds as a whole disproportionately consumed fruit species relative to availability, and consumed more bella honeysuckle and common buckthorn than gray dogwood. Fewer fruits remained on open branches than enclosed branches, suggesting birds actively consumed fruits at our sites. Our results suggest that fall migrant and resident songbirds as a whole benefit more from mature shrublands that contain a diversity of fruiting shrub species than from early successional forests. While these characteristics may benefit the suite of fall migrants and residents at our location, appropriate habitat management may differ for other locations or migratory species.

Orlowski, Grzegorz				Ecological Engineering	61	A		436-445	Dec 2013	2013				English	4	37	The progressive loss of natural wetlands globally means that anthropogenic water reservoirs are increasingly important as habitat for wetland bird species. During yearly bird counts (in one-week intervals) on seven waste-stabilization ponds (size range =0.379-4.450 ha; total = 8.392 ha) located on a large sewage farm in a Wroclaw city suburb (south-west Poland), I recorded a total of 7776 individuals from 84 bird species. The most numerous bird guild was waterbirds (45.8% of the community), followed by shorebirds (35.7%), passerines (14.9%) and aerial feeders (3.5%). In general, the density (including all bird guilds) and species diversity of birds was positively related to the bed exposure and 'naturalness' (artificial [approximately equal] small ponds with preliminary treatment versus natural [approximately equal] large ponds after preliminary treatment) of the waste-stabilization ponds. The compulsory European Union (EU) law regulating urban wastewater treatment (The Council Directive 91/271/EEC, Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive) does not permit use of open sewage farms as a method of treatment for domestic and other wastewater. In many new EU member states, the sewage fields are still used, although this method of sewage treatment will function only until 2015, and after that all wastewater must be purified in modern sewage treatment works. It is recommended that areas historically used as sewage farms located on the outskirts of large cities should be converted into protected areas. However, due to the contamination of invertebrates that inhabit and emerge from sewage treatment works, and the potential high risk of detrimental effects on bird species that feed on such prey, empty waste-stabilization ponds should be re-filled with clean natural water sources such as rain and spring water or alternatively with well-treated waste water. The strategy for managing such areas requires a proper water regime and maintenance of the periodically dry bottom, a crucial feeding area for birds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Green, Ken				Victorian Naturalist (Blackburn)	130	6		240-248	Dec 2013	2013				English	0	1	The seasonal changes in abundance of bird species and individuals in subalpine woodland in the Munyang Valley were studied from 2000 to 2012. The immediate response of the avifauna to the fires of 2003 was a reduction in the number of species (from 12 to 7) and individuals (by 77%). Key to these reductions was the loss of foraging substrates that did not recover quickly, such as shrubs and the tree canopy, bark, lower branches and leaves. The general response of the avifauna was in contrast to other areas in south-eastern Australia, particularly with the slower recovery of vegetation due to low growth rates and trees regenerating from lignotuber tillers rather than epicormic shoots. The Flame Robin Petroica phoenicea was the first to re-occupy the woodland, with winter resident species being next to return. After ten years, the canopy had still not regrown, adversely affecting canopy foraging species, particularly seed eaters, while food sources such as flowers of Grevillea victoriae were not available in pre-fire amounts, slowing the return of honeyeaters.

In 1999-2001 and 2007-2009 woodpeckers and dead wood abundance were studied in coniferous stands of the Biaowiea Forest, Poland. Transects (3.9-6 km long) were established in three zones of different types of management: 1) primeval, unmanaged stands (BNP); 2) partially managed nature reserve (RES); 3) heavily managed stands (MAN). Woodpeckers were counted along transects three times per season, and tree stand measurements (number of standing and fallen trees, diameter at breast height, volume of fallen logs) were made once every three years. Woodpecker indices were highest in BNP and lowest in RES in both three-year study periods. The highest number of species (seven) was recorded in RES. Indices of four woodpeckers including two focal species (Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus and White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos) were dependent on the basal area of dead standing trees. The same relation was found for the whole woodpecker assemblage. The highest indices were recorded in BNP, where the highest density of dead standing trees was recorded, and the lowest in the MAN transect with the lowest density of dead trees. However in the RES plot the amount of dead wood was much lower than in the national park. We recommend that the management regulations in Polish nature reserves be changed. In coniferous reserves, it would be best to leave at least 2 m2 ha-1 (basal area) of freshly killed spruce Picea sp. after each bark beetle outbreak.

Van Bael, Sunshine A.; Zambrano, Ruby; Hall, Jefferson S.				International Journal of Biodiversity Science Ecosystem Services & Management	9	4		281-289	Dec 1 2013	2013				English	0	9	While deforestation continues to be a threat to species diversity in the tropics, reforestation either by natural succession or human tree planting is also occurring. Very little is known about how bird communities respond to human-mediated reforestation schemes in tropical areas. We surveyed bird communities in Central Panama to compare their abundance and richness in mature forest, young natural succession (fallow pastures), active cattle pastures, and native species reforestation areas. We found the greatest abundance of birds in mature forest, while natural succession areas had slightly greater species richness relative to mature forest. Bird communities were most similar in forest and natural succession areas, and were distinct from bird communities in cattle pastures and reforestation areas. Migratory bird species were most abundant in the young natural succession areas. Reforestation areas that were closer to mature forest had a greater abundance of birds relative to areas further from forests. Our study provides a baseline for future studies at this site that will allow assessment of the speed at which reforestation efforts with tree plantations will support a more diverse and abundant bird community. Moreover, our finding of the greatest species richness and migratory bird abundance in a natural succession habitat supports previous bird community studies in agroforestry and successional habitats.

Benson, Thomas J.; Dinsmore, James J.; Hohman, William L.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	37	4		725-732	Dec 2013	2013				English	0	11	Extensive conversion of natural areas for agricultural production has had many consequences, including reduced habitat for nesting birds. Increasing focus on habitat re-establishment has led to the establishment of patches of perennial herbaceous vegetation in these agricultural landscapes, although these often consist of monotypic grass fields with little vegetation diversity. In 2001 and 2002, we assessed songbird responses to mowing followed by a soil disturbance (disking) meant to increase vegetation diversity and abundance of arthropod food resources in conservation easements in East-central Iowa, USA. We randomly assigned fields to disking and control treatments and collected data on breeding bird density and species richness in these habitats before and after treatments were applied. Disking increased density of all species combined, several individual species including dickcissel (Spiza americana; a declining species of concern), and overall conservation value of bird communities in treated fields. Total bird density increased with disking when the size of disked area was relatively small, and dickcissels and American goldfinches (Spinus tristis) responded positively and negatively to block-shaped treatments, respectively. Most species either showed no response or increased in density with disking. Changes associated with disking treatments were likely related to changes in both vegetation structure and increased abundance and biomass of arthropod food resources. Disking appears to be an effective management practice for maintaining herbaceous habitats, increasing vegetation diversity and food availability for insectivorous birds, and increasing habitat quality for priority bird species. Given the increasing availability of monotypic grasslands in agricultural landscapes, this practice may provide a relatively inexpensive way to improve re-established habitats.

Hails, Christopher J.; Kavanagh, Mikaail				Raffles Bulletin of Zoology			29	243-258	Nov 30 2013	2013				English	2	23	Life for human populations in high-density urban areas can be considerably enriched by being in closer contact with nature, leading to many benefits for psychological well-being. The movement, colours and sounds of birds can be particularly attractive and the steps taken to create suitable and sustainable habitats for them in urban landscapes can make city-life much more attractive for a significant part of the human population. The challenges set by the ecology of a humid tropical environment are examined. Based on fundamental ecological principles guidance is provided for the landscaping design and species planting for cities in SE Asia. The conservation of wild refuges, wise park planting, and well-laid out ecological corridors are all critical components which need to play together. Advice is provided on the types of species, both indigenous and exotic, which can be used and how these interact with particular bird species in the Malay Peninsula. As the ecosystems of tropical SE Asia rapidly change in the face of large-scale resource exploitation such activities in cities are increasingly important in keeping alive a public awareness of the dependence of economic development upon environmental sustainability.

Zhao, Qing; Azeria, Ermias T.; Le Blanc, Melanie-Louise; Lemaitre, Jerome; Fortin, Daniel				PLoS ONE	8	11		e81358, 1-11	Nov 25 2013	2013				English	1	57	Ecosystem-based forest management strives to develop silvicultural practices that best emulate natural disturbances such as wildfire to conserve biodiversity representative of natural forest ecosystems. Yet, current logging practices alter forest structure and reduce the proportion of old-growth forest and, consequently, can exert long-term effects on the dynamics of forest biota. The stand-and landscape-scale factors driving bird community dynamics in post-disturbance environment remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined bird community dynamics along successional gradients in boreal ecosystems originating from fire and logging in landscapes dominated by old-growth forest. We tested if bird species richness and community compositions in clear-cutting stands became comparable to those in natural stands after 70 years, and identified the relative contributions of stand-and landscape-scale forest attributes in bird community dynamics. Based on records of bird occurrences at 185 field sites in natural and clearcutting stands, we demonstrate that (1) both forest structures and bird communities underwent evident changes along successional gradients in post-clearcutting environment; (2) bird species richness and community composition in 60-to 70-years-old clearcutting stands still differed from those in 50-to 79-years-old natural stands, in spite of the fact that most forest attributes of clearcutting stands became comparable to those of natural stands after 40 years; and (3) landscape disturbances contributed more than stand characteristics in explaining the lack of convergence of mature forest species, residents, and short-distance migrants in post-clearcutting environment. Our study points out that more regards should be paid to improve the landscape configuration of the managed forests, and implies that old-growth forest retention within logged areas, combined with selection cutting and prolonged logging rotations, can better emulate fire and alleviate forest harvesting effects on bird community assemblages typical of natural boreal ecosystem.

Young, Jock S.; Ammon, Elisabeth M.; Weisberg, Peter J.; Dilts, Thomas E.; Newton, Wesley E.; Wong-Kone, Diane C.; Heki, Lisa G.				Ecological Indicators	34			159-167	Nov 2013	2013				English	2	80	The use of a bird community index that characterizes ecosystem integrity is very attractive to conservation planners and habitat managers, particularly in the absence of any single focal species. In riparian areas of the western USA, several attempts at arriving at a community index signifying a functioning riparian bird community have been made previously, mostly resorting to expert opinions or national conservation rankings for species weights. Because extensive local and regional bird monitoring data were available for Nevada, we were able to develop three different indices that were derived empirically, rather than from expert opinion. We formally examined the use of three species weighting schemes in comparison with simple species richness, using different definitions of riparian species assemblage size, for the purpose of predicting community response to changes in vegetation structure from riparian restoration. For the three indices, species were weighted according to the following criteria: (1) the degree of riparian habitat specialization based on regional data, (2) the relative conservation ranking of landbird species, and (3) the degree to which a species is under-represented compared to the regional species pool for riparian areas. To evaluate the usefulness of these indices for habitat restoration planning and monitoring, we modeled them using habitat variables that are expected to respond to riparian restoration efforts, using data from 64 sampling sites in the Walker River Basin in Nevada and California. We found that none of the species-weighting schemes performed any better as an index for evaluating overall habitat condition than using species richness alone as a community index. Based on our findings, the use of a fairly complete list of 30-35 riparian specialists appears to be the best indicator group for predicting the response of bird communities to the restoration of riparian vegetation.

Regnery, Baptiste; Couvet, Denis; Kubarek, Loren; Julien, Jean-Francois; Kerbiriou, Christian				Ecological Indicators	34			221-230	Nov 2013	2013				English	5	171	Tree microhabitats (e.g., canopy deadwood, cavities, and loose bark) may play an important role in forest biodiversity conservation. Indeed, many species depend on tree microhabitats during their life-cycles for food, shelter, and breeding habitat. Although recent studies have developed a set of definitions and descriptions for tree microhabitats, the relationships between tree microhabitat inventory data and biodiversity remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified relationships among tree microhabitat variables (i.e., the density and diversity of microhabitat) and bird and bat metrics using data from 59 plots in 3 Mediterranean forest ecosystems in France. In each plot, 9 types of tree microhabitats were inventoried: canopy deadwood; woodpecker cavities; non-woodpecker cavities (divided into lower, medium, and upper cavities); Cerambyx cavities; loose bark or cracks; conks of fungi; and ivy. We also assessed structural characteristics (e.g., basal area, stand height), the time since last cutting (i.e., the number of years since the stand was last cut), the number of forest habitats, and the distance to the nearest road. We performed bird and bat inventories in the same plots and we used abundances and a number of bird and bat community indices (e.g., species richness, mean forest specialization). We found that variations in tree microhabitat (more specifically, variations in microhabitat diversity) were a major factor in explaining the abundance and community response of birds and bats. Bird species, including cavity-nesting birds, were most strongly affected by tree microhabitat diversity, while bat species were positively affected by both the diversity of the tree microhabitat and the density of cavities created by Cerambyx spp. Tree microhabitats were better predictors of bird and bat responses than other stand characteristics. Tree microhabitat characteristics provide a reliable measure of ecological niches in forest ecosystems and we propose that these microhabitats be used as indicators for assessing biodiversity in forests.

The study was conducted between August 2010 and September 2012, and used point counts and mist netting to survey birds at three sampling transects from the forest edge: 0-100 m (edge transect), 101-300 m (intermediate transect) and 301-500 m (interior transect). A total of 93 species were recorded. There were significant differences among the three sampling transects for mean species richness and mean number of individuals per point. Multiple comparisons revealed that species richness and individual abundance was highest in the intermediate transect and lowest in the edge transect. Species composition differed significantly from the edge to the interior transect. Intermediate and interior transects supported more forest-dependent species and forest generalists whose guilds were composed of frugivores, nectarivores and insectivores, which were sensitive to conditions at the forest edge. The edge transect harboured more open-habitat users, as well as a great number of granivores, ground insectivores and omnivores. In conclusion, forest edges have negative effects on bird diversity on Hainan Island, which should be borne in mind when developing strategies for forest bird conservation and habitat management.

Zellweger, Florian; Braunisch, Veronika; Baltensweiler, Andri; Bollmann, Kurt				Forest Ecology and Management	307			303-312	Nov 1 2013	2013				English	7	144	Along with plant species composition forest structural complexity is an important determinant of forest biodiversity, but difficult to predict in space from field data. We analyzed forest structural complexity based on a comprehensive set of variables derived from nationally available, area-wide remote sensing, particularly LiDAR data. We generated variables related to vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity, as well as site factors potentially indicating the abundance of weakened trees or snags. We used them to predict the occurrence of four bird species with narrow and complementary structural habitat requirements, together being indicative of structurally diverse forests. Presence/absence data of Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) from three biogeographic mountain regions in Switzerland were used to calibrate species distribution models (boosted regression trees BRT) for each species individually, as well as for the sympatric occurrence of at least three of the four target species. The predictive deviances explained (D2) and the AUC values obtained from cross-validation ranged from 15.5% to 63.1% and 0.77% to 0.97% respectively. Sympatric species occurrence reflecting overall forest structural complexity was predicted best, with an outstanding accuracy. To support management and monitoring schemes we identified variable threshold effects based on partial dependence plots. Variables related to vertical foliage distributions were most important, followed by horizontal structural attributes such as canopy height variations, forest edges and gaps. Site factors such as topographic position improved all models and were most important for the species depending on weakened trees and dead wood. We conclude that recent advances in remote sensing allow for large-scale determination of forest structural characteristics suitable for developing species and habitat distribution models of considerable generality, while keeping an unprecedented level of detail. Our approach allows forest managers to amend regional and countrywide management plans with reliable maps depicting areas of high forest structural complexity and habitat quality, which will facilitate the integration of conservation-relevant information into multifunctional forestry.

Ntongani, Wilbard A.; Andrew, Samora M.				Open Journal of Ecology	3	7		482-488	Nov 2013	2013				English	0	1	Wetland natural grasslands are important habitats for avian populations throughout the world. Unfortunately the increase of human population and rise in demand for settlements and agricultural land have degraded these habitats in many tropical wetlands. To effectively restore these natural grasslands and conserve avifaunal biodiversity, understanding of the relationships between habitat conditions and bird community structure are central. We used a combination of information from nearby villagers and field surveys to establish two important grassland habitats with low and high disturbance histories, and related the habitats to bird community structure. We surveyed a total of 119 sites in the two habitats to examine variation in the abundance, richness, diversity and composition of birds at Kilombero Wetland Tanzania. In total, 3049 individuals, 126 species, 88 genera and 45 families were recorded from Kilombero grasslands. Our results show that grasslands with low human disturbance had more number of bird species, genera, families and diversity (both Shannon-Wiener and Simpson) than the most disturbed grasslands at p < 0.05. However, the abundance and Shannon evenness of birds were not different (p > 0.05) between low and highly disturbed grassland habitats suggesting that other factors including variety of foraging sites are important. This study confirms that the wetland grasslands of Kilombero are important for conservation of birds including rare and endemic species. It is recommended that anthropogenic disturbances should be minimized including con-trol of fire, regulation of agricultural activities and population of cattle within the wetland system to restore and conserve biodiversity.

Resetarits, William J., Jr; Binckley, Christopher A.				Oecologia (Berlin)	173	3		933-946	Nov 2013	2013				English	0	82	Colonization and extinction are primary drivers of local population dynamics, community structure, and spatial patterns of biological diversity. Existing paradigms of island biogeography, metapopulation biology, and metacommunity ecology, as well as habitat management and conservation biology based on those paradigms, emphasize patch size, number, and isolation as primary characteristics influencing colonization and extinction. Habitat selection theory suggests that patch quality could rival size, number, and isolation in determining rates of colonization and resulting community structure. We used naturally colonized experimental landscapes to address four issues: (a) how do colonizing aquatic beetles respond to variation in patch number, (b) how do they respond to variation in patch quality, (c) does patch context affect colonization dynamics, and (d) at what spatial scales do beetles respond to habitat variation? Increasing patch number had no effect on per patch colonization rates, while patch quality and context were critical in determining colonization rates and resulting patterns of abundance and species richness at multiple spatial scales. We graphically illustrate how variation in immigration rates driven by perceived predation risk (habitat quality) can further modify dynamics of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography beyond predator-driven effects on extinction rates. Our data support the importance of patch quality and context as primary determinants of colonization rate, occupancy, abundance, and resulting patterns of species richness, and reinforce the idea that management of metapopulations for species preservation, and metacommunities for local and regional diversity, should incorporate habitat quality into the predictive equation.

Landing trends for most abundant species revealed that typical lagoon fish species-groups, such as Mugilidae (Mugil cephalus, Chelon labrosus, Liza saliens, Liza aurata and Liza ramada), eels (Anguilla anguilla) and Gobies (mainly Zosteriosessor ophiocephalus) had largely decreased, while the landings of Sparus aurata increased during the entire study period. These trends led to a significant change in species composition during recent years that might be attributed to large-scale climatic changes as well as serious anthropogenic impacts that degraded the water quality and altered the hydrology within the gulf and lagoons, the increase of fishing exploitation in Amvrakikos gulf, the expansion of aquaculture activities within the gulf, the application of new fishing management practices in lagoons, and the increase of fish-eating sea-bird populations. The findings are needed for the implementation of an efficient and integrated management tool for the study of coastal systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neal				Auk	130	4		666-676	Oct 2013	2013				English	0	39	Relating population density to spatially explicit habitat characteristics can inform management by directing efforts to areas with lower densities or focusing conservation and land protection on high-density areas. We conducted point-transect surveys for the endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla) in the live-fire region of Fort Hood, Texas. We used mark recapture distance sampling and combined a Horvitz-Thompson estimator with a habitat-based, resource-selection gradient to estimate spatially explicit density for both species. We detected Golden-cheeked Warblers at 120 locations (202, 197, and 89 detected by primary, secondary, and both observers, respectively) and Black-capped Vireos at 173 locations (241, 255, and 107 detected by primary, secondary, and both observers, respectively). For Golden-cheeked Warblers, the average ( SE) composite detection probability estimate within a 100-m point-sample radius was 0.57[plus or minus]0.14, and for vireos it was 0.24[plus or minus]0.02. Estimated mean density (singing males ha-1) was 0.14[plus or minus]0.03 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08-0.23) and 0.47[plus or minus]0.05 (95% CI: 0.38-0.60) for Golden-cheeked Warblers and Black-capped Vireos, respectively. Our analysis suggested evidence of heterogeneity in the detection process for both species, as well as imperfect detection at distance g(0), both of which would bias estimated densities if ignored. Additionally, both species exhibited spatial variability in estimated densities, with those areas that had higher occurrence probabilities typically having higher estimated density. In the absence of spatially explicit density prediction, managers must treat all losses of potential habitat for endangered species uniformly, despite likely differences in conservation value. Our approach could be used to ascertain areas of changing density in relation to changing habitat conditions over time and space.

Takeda, Keise				Japanese Journal of Ornithology	62	2		135-142	Oct 2013	2013				Japanese	0	15	The impact of wind turbines on natural environments is a current and developing issue. Effects (some small, some large) on birds have been reported world wide, yet no detailed reports have been published in Japan. I studied the effects of wind turbines on breeding birds at Aoyamakogen, Mie Prefecture, Japan, where Japan's largest wind farms is located. In this highland area 51 wind turbines have been installed. Using the territory mapping method on fine mornings during late-May and June 2007, I compared densities of territories and numbers of species of breeding birds between research plots within 200 m of wind turbines and control plots more than 850 m away from wind turbines. Both research and control plots were at the same altitude and supported the same vegetation. In research plots within broad-leaved forest, the density of territories was considerably lower (1.3 [plus or minus] 0.69 territories/ha) than in control plots (5.4 [plus or minus] 0.95 /ha). The density of species in research plots was also much lower (1.2 [plus or minus] 0.45 /ha) than in control plots (3.1 [plus or minus] 0.73 /ha). In research plots within Japanese Cypress Chamaecyparis obtusa forest, the densities of species and territories were also lower 75% than in control plots. When the number of species present before and after the construction of wind turbines was compared, species diversity was found to have fallen by 57% (from 21 species to nine species), in the Nunobikinomori reserve, indicating that wind turbines seriously disturb breeding birds.

A Case Study on Cavity-Nesting by the Introduced Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis) and Two Australian Native Parrots.		Grarock, Kate; Lindenmayer, David B.; Wood, Jeffrey T.; Tidemann, Christopher R.				Environmental Management	52	4		958-970	Oct 2013	2013				English	2	75	Introduced species pose a major threat to biodiversity across the globe. Understanding the impact of introduced species is critical for effective management. Many species around the world are reliant on tree cavities, and competition for these resources can be intense: threatening the survival of native species. Through the establishment of 225 nest boxes, we examined the relationship between tree density and the abundance and nesting success of three bird species in Canberra, Australia. The common myna (Acridotheres tristis) is an introduced species in Australia, and the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) and eastern rosella (Platycercus eximius) are native species. We then investigated the impact of common myna nest box occupation on crimson rosella and eastern rosella abundance. Tree density significantly influenced the abundance and cavity-nesting of all three species. Common myna abundance (birds per square kilometer) was greatest at low tree density sites (101.9 [plus or minus]A 22.4) and declined at medium (45.4 [plus or minus]A 10.1) and high (9.7 [plus or minus]A 3.6) tree density sites. The opposite pattern was observed for the crimson rosella, with greater abundance (birds per square kilometer) at high tree density sites (83.9 [plus or minus]A 9.3), declining over medium (61.6 [plus or minus]A 6.4) and low (31.4 [plus or minus]A 3.9) tree density sites. The eastern rosella was more abundant at medium tree density sites (48.6 [plus or minus]A 8.0 birds per square kilometer). Despite the strong influence of tree density, we found a significant negative relationship between common myna nest box occupancy and the abundance of the crimson rosella (F 1,13 = 7.548, P = 0.017) and eastern rosella (F 1,13 = 9.672, P < 0.001) at some sites. We also observed a slight increase in rosella nesting interruptions by the common myna at lower tree densities (high: 1.3 % [plus or minus]A 1.3, medium: 6.6 % [plus or minus]A 2.2, low: 12.7 % [plus or minus]A 6.2), although this increase was not statistically significant (F 2,40 = 2.435, P = 0.100). Our study provides the strongest evidence to date for the negative impact of the common myna on native bird abundance through cavity-nesting competition. However, due to the strong influence of habitat on species abundance and nesting, it is essential to investigate the impacts of introduced species in conjunction with habitat variation. We also suggest one component of introduced species management could include habitat restoration to reduce habitat suitability for introduced species.

Simonetti, Javier A.; Grez, Audrey A.; Estades, Cristian F.				Conservation Biology	27	5		1117-1121	Oct 2013	2013				English	4	44	The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) expects forestry plantations to contribute to biodiversity conservation. A well-developed understory in forestry plantations might serve as a surrogate habitat for native species and mitigate the negative effect of plantations on species richness. We experimentally tested this hypothesis by removing the understory in Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) plantations in central Chile and assessing changes in species richness and abundance of medium-sized mammals. Frequency of occurrence of mammals, including kodkods (Leopardus guigna), culpeo foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus), lesser grisons (Conepatus chinga), and Southern pudu deer (Pudu puda), was low in forest stands with little to no understory relative to stands with well-developed undergrowth vegetation. After removing the understory, their frequency of occurrence decreased significantly, whereas in control stands, where understory was not removed, their frequency did not change. This result strongly supports the idea that facilitating the development of undergrowth vegetation may turn forestry stands into secondary habitats as opposed to their containing no habitat for native mammals. This forestry practice could contribute to conservation of biological diversity as it pertains to CBD targets.

Reynolds, Chevonne; Symes, Craig T.				African Zoology	48	2		228-239	Oct 2013	2013				English	1	20	Spatial and temporal patterns of disturbance and the subsequent heterogeneity are critical in maintaining biodiversity within grassland ecosystems. Grassland birds have evolved within this 'shifting mosaic' to become reliant on specific habitat characteristics maintained under varying levels of both natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Unfortunately, grasslands in South Africa have been extensively transformed and remain poorly conserved, threatening grassland avifauna. Mistbelt grassland is a threatened vegetation type endemic to the province of KwaZulu-Natal, of which only 0.3% is formally protected. This study investigated seasonal and patch type heterogeneity in a Mistbelt grassland avian community by determining avian community structure and composition in four patch types, i.e.i) untransformed open grassland, burnt grassland, iii) bramble-invaded and, iv) bramble-cleared grassland, during winter and summer. Avian assemblages were significantly different between the different patch types for each season. The bramble patch type negatively affected grassland bird species diversity Bramble-cleared grassland and untransformed grassland had similar vegetation structure and avian communities in the summer, suggesting that the grassland bird community benefitted soon after the clearing of invasive vegetation. This study provides further evidence that bird diversity is enhanced in structurally heterogeneous grassland landscapes. Furthermore, the protection and appropriate management of privately owned Mistbelt grassland, conserved in the form of rangeland, is an important refuge for threatened and endemic avifauna, such as the globally-threatened blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) and wattled crane (Bugeranus carunculatus).

Greenberg, Cathryn H.; Waldrop, Thomas A.; Tomcho, Joseph; Phillips, Ross J.; Simon, Dean				Forest Ecology and Management	304			80-88	Sep 15 2013	2013				English	1	35	Prescribed burning is a common management tool for upland hardwood forests, with wildlife habitat improvement an often cited goal. Fire management for wildlife conservation requires understanding how species respond to burning at different frequencies, severities, and over time. In an earlier study, we experimentally assessed how breeding bird communities and species responded to fuel reduction treatments by mechanical understory reduction, low-severity prescribed fires, or mechanical understory reduction followed a year later by high-severity prescribed fires in upland hardwood forest. Here, we assess longer-term response to the initial mechanical treatment (M), and a second low-intensity burn in twice burned (B2) and mechanical + twice burned (MB2) treatments and controls (C). Initial (2003) higher dead fuel loadings and consequently high-severity fires in MB2 created open-canopy structure with abundant snags, resulting in much higher species richness and density of breeding birds compared to other treatments. Relative bird density and richness remained much higher in MB2 after a second burn, but few changes were evident that were not already apparent after one burn. The initial (2003) burn in B2 had cooler, low-severity fires that killed few trees. Delayed tree mortality occurred in both burn treatments after one burn, and continued in both after a second low-intensity burn. In B2, this resulted in gradual development of a "perforated," patchy canopy structure with more snags. Abundance of total birds and most species in B2 was similar to C, but several additional species associated with open-forest conditions occurred at low levels, increasing richness in B2. In both burn treatments, burning temporarily reduced habitat suitability for ground-nesting birds. Bird communities in M were similar to C, as shrubs recovered rapidly. Results indicate that one or two relatively low-intensity burns with patches of hotter fire may result in gradual, subtle changes to canopy cover and structure that may slightly increase bird species richness over time. In contrast, a single high-intensity, high severity fire can create young forest conditions and a heterogeneous canopy structure that can be maintained by repeated burning and increase breeding bird relative abundance and richness by attracting disturbance-adapted species while retaining most other forest species.

White, Angela M.; Zipkin, Elise F.; Manley, Patricia N.; Schlesinger, Matthew D.				Forest Ecology and Management	304			261-274	Sep 15 2013	2013				English	3	48	Over a century of fire suppression activities have altered the structure and composition of mixed conifer forests throughout the western United States. In the absence of fire, fuels have accumulated in these forests causing concerns over the potential for catastrophic wildfires. Fuel reduction treatments are being used on federal and state lands to reduce the threat of wildfire by mechanically removing biomass. Although these treatments result in a reduction in fire hazard, their impact on wildlife is less clear. We use a multi-species occupancy modeling approach to build habitat-suitability models for 46 upland forest birds found in the Lake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra Nevada based on forest structure and abiotic variables. Using a Bayesian hierarchical framework, we predict species-specific and community-level responses to changes in forest structure and make inferences about responses of important avian foraging guilds. Disparities within and among foraging group responses to canopy cover, tree size and shrub cover emphasized the complexities in managing forests to meet biodiversity goals. Based on our species-specific model results, we predicted changes in species richness and community similarity under forest prescriptions representing three management practices: no active management, a typical fuel reduction treatment that emphasizes spacing between trees, and a thinning prescription that creates structural heterogeneity. Simulated changes to structural components of the forest analogous to management practices to reduce fuel loads clearly affected foraging groups differentially despite variability in responses within guilds. Although species richness was predicted to decrease slightly under both simulated fuels reduction treatments, the prescription that incorporated structural heterogeneity retained marginally higher species richness. The composition of communities supported by different management alternatives was influenced by urbanization and management practice, emphasizing the importance of creating heterogeneity at the landscape scale.

Guilherme, Joao Lopes; Pereira, Henrique Miguel				PLoS ONE	8	9		e73619	Sep 2 2013	2013				English	4	69	Widespread farmland abandonment has led to significant landscape transformations of many European mountain areas. These semi-natural multi-habitat landscapes are important reservoirs of biodiversity and their abandonment has important conservation implications. In multi-habitat landscapes the adaptation of communities depends on the differential affinity of the species to the available habitats. We use nested species-area relationships (SAR) to model species richness patterns of bird communities across scales in a mountain landscape, in NW Portugal. We compare the performance of the classic-SAR and the countryside-SAR (i.e. multi-habitat) models at the landscape scale, and compare species similarity decay (SSD) at the regional scale. We find a considerable overlap of bird communities in the different land-uses (farmland, shrubland and oak forest) at the landscape scale. Analysis of the classic and countryside SAR show that specialist species are strongly related to their favourite habitat. Farmland and shrubland have higher regional SSD compared to oak forests. However, this is due to the opportunistic use of farmlands by generalist birds. Forest specialists display significant regional turnover in oak forest. Overall, the countryside-SAR model had a better fit to the data showing that habitat composition determines species richness across scales. Finally, we use the countryside-SAR model to forecast bird diversity under four scenarios of land-use change. Farmland abandonment scenarios show little impact on bird diversity as the model predicts that the complete loss of farmland is less dramatic, in terms of species diversity loss, than the disappearance of native Galicio-Portuguese oak forest. The affinities of species to non-preferred habitats suggest that bird communities can adapt to land-use changes derived from farmland abandonment. Based on model predictions we argue that rewilding may be a suitable management option for many European mountain areas.

We compared breeding bird density, vegetation structure and composition, and arthropod biomass between six native grass and six OWB fields in the southern Great Plains, The OWB fields supported 1.70 [plus or minus] 0.27 (mean [plus or minus] SE) Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) per ha compared to 0.95 [plus or minus] 0.25 in native grass fields, but total species richness was greater in native grass fields (40 versus 28 species). Density of some bird species was correlated with vegetation structure regardless of field type, suggesting that management practices may be more influential than plant species composition. Mean arthropod biomass was 3.39X greater in native grass fields than in OWB monocultures. Native grass fields provided habitat for a larger complement of birds than did OWB monocultures, and reduced food availability in OWB fields suggests a mechanism for that difference.

Bently				Journal of Field Ornithology	84	3		270-286	Sep 2013	2013				English	4	99	Point counts are commonly used to assess changes in bird abundance, including analytical approaches such as distance sampling that estimate density. Point-count methods have come under increasing scrutiny because effects of detection probability and field error are difficult to quantify. For seven forest songbirds, we compared fixed-radii counts (50 m and 100 m) and density estimates obtained from distance sampling to known numbers of birds determined by territory mapping. We applied point-count analytic approaches to a typical forest management question and compared results to those obtained by territory mapping. We used a before-after control impact (BACI) analysis with a data set collected across seven study areas in the central Appalachians from 2006 to 2010. Using a 50-m fixed radius, variance in error was at least 1.5 times that of the other methods, whereas a 100-m fixed radius underestimated actual density by >3 territories per 10 ha for the most abundant species. Distance sampling improved accuracy and precision compared to fixed-radius counts, although estimates were affected by birds counted outside 10-ha units. In the BACI analysis, territory mapping detected an overall treatment effect for five of the seven species, and effects were generally consistent each year. In contrast, all point-count methods failed to detect two treatment effects due to variance and error in annual estimates. Overall, our results highlight the need for adequate sample sizes to reduce variance, and skilled observers to reduce the level of error in point-count data. Ultimately, the advantages and disadvantages of different survey methods should be considered in the context of overall study design and objectives, allowing for trade-offs among effort, accuracy, and power to detect treatment effects.

Torres-Moye, Guillermo; Edwards, Matthew S.; Gabriela Montano-Moctezuma, Cira				Ciencias Marinas	39	3		239-252	Sep 2013	2013				English	1	41	The United States and Mexico share the Southern California Bight (SCB) ecosystem in the Northeast Pacific Ocean where marine wildlife and habitats historically have been disturbed by human activities. Within this ecosystem, forests of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera are critical habitats that sustain diverse biological assemblages and important fishery species. We studied patterns of temporal and spatial variability within the benthic communities of five transboundary kelp forests in California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) over a four-year period that included a moderate El Nino event. While the benthic marine communities shared some species, they varied significantly in community structure from each other, and the degree of dissimilarity was not related to the geographic distances among the studied habitats. Rather, species richness was significantly related to local substratum rugosity, suggesting it could be used as a proxy of relative benthic biological diversity. Temporal changes in the benthic assemblages were not consistent across all forests, and contrary to observations made during previous El Nino events in the SCB, the benthic communities did not change significantly following the 2009-2010 El Nino. Such an unexpected community response may be explained by the fact that the 2009-2010 El Nino was linked to the Modoki phenomenon, where warm sea surface temperature is focused in the central equatorial Pacific and not in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We propose that long-term conservation efforts should incorporate this ecological knowledge to support science-based decisions, binational coordination of policies, and coherent management practices including the design of transboundary conservation networks as spatial management tools for the protection, conservation, and/or restoration of the SCB ecosystem.

Revue d'Ecologie la Terre et la Vie	68	3-4		267-274	Sep 2013	2013				English	1	7	Hole-nesting birds include species highly dependent on old trees or dead wood for nesting, roosting, breeding and feeding. In this study we characterize the assemblages of these species occurring in five different habitat types located in a heterogeneous Mediterranean landscape. We used the point count method. In all habitat types, tits (Parus major and Cyanistes caeruleus) were the most abundant species, except in beech forests, where Sitta europaea showed the highest mean abundance. Hole nesting bird assemblages increase in abundance, richness and diversity, with significant changes from termophilic and sclcrophyllous forests (Holm-oak and Cork-oak) to temperate and mesophilic forests (chestnut, Turkey oak and Beech). This pattern reflects the progressive change in vegetation type both due to structure and species composition, ultimately due to progressive change in altitude and local climate. In particular, data at singles species level corroborate that the presence of mature and dead trees (i.e., with high mean diameter) may explain the abundance of Sitta europaea, Picus viridis and Certhia brachydactyla. Our dataset highlights that, for the hole-nesting birds, mesophilous beech and oak Mediterranean forests of biogeographic and conservation concern, represent suitable habitat types for these specialized species.

Journal of Wildlife Management	77	6		1157-1165	Aug 2013	2013				English	5	52	Fire-adapted forests in the western United States have dramatically departed from the natural or evolutionary environment over the past century because of fire suppression, logging, grazing, and other management practices. In particular, most southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests are characterized by dense stands of small-diameter trees that are susceptible to stand-replacing crown fires and ensuing damage to watersheds, wildlife habitat, and communities at the wildland-urban interface. Restoration treatments using mechanical thinning and prescribed fire have become the dominant management paradigm in this forest type, with landscape-scale projects being implemented over the next 20 years. Although many studies have examined wildlife responses to restoration treatments, single-species information is difficult for managers to synthesize and incorporate into management decisions made at large scales. Our goal was to investigate responses of breeding birds in ponderosa pine forests to forest stand characteristics modified by restoration treatments. We sampled birds in 23 stands for 3 years in northern Arizona, and used multi-season and multi-species occupancy models to determine relationships between avian occupancy and stand attributes affected by treatment. Increasing occupancy rates and species richness were associated with decreasing canopy cover, increasing density of mature trees, and increasing density of snags. Occupancy rates and species richness were negatively associated with quadratic mean diameter, medium-sized trees, and downed woody material. Associations of the avian community and individual species with herbaceous cover and tree clumping were less consistent. Our results support the implementation of forest restoration treatments for restoring avian community occupancy in ponderosa pine forests, and emulating the evolutionary environment is likely the best approach. We recommend reducing canopy cover via thinning, and retaining trees >45.7cm diameter at breast height and snags. A commonly-proposed diameter cap for retaining large trees after thinning (40.6cmdbh) seems unlikely to benefit nesting passerines, as resulting tree densities would remain too large. We recommend occupancy modeling as an efficient method for assessing wildlife-habitat relationships at large scales. [copyright] 2013 The Wildlife Society.

During the 2007-2009 breeding seasons, we located 387 nests in buffers of a northeast Mississippi agroecosystem. Dickcissel (Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) were the most common nesting species. Time since disturbance influenced nest densities of dickcissels and red-winged blackbirds; densities were lesser during the first growing season post-disturbance but increased during the second growing season post-burn. Nest densities for both species were least in buffers adjacent to woodland. Inclusion of disturbance did not improve models of dickcissel and red-winged blackbird nest survival, suggesting that disturbance influenced nesting density, but not nesting outcomes. Amount of grassland surrounding dickcissel nests was positively associated with nest survival, but confidence intervals included zero indicating effects were not strong. Although distance to nearest crop or developed edge were included in competing models of red-winged blackbird nest survival, their effects were negligible. Agricultural conservation buffers will best serve breeding grassland bird populations if they are established in areas with minimal woodland cover, maximize total grassland in the landscape, and are maintained with prescribed burning. These results will help characterize the contribution of agricultural conservation buffers in agroecosystems of the southeastern United States. [copyright] 2013 The Wildlife Society.

Jimenez, Jaime E.; Arriagada, Aldo M.; Fonturbel, Francisco E.; Camus, Patricio A.; Avila-Thieme, M. Isidora				Naturwissenschaften	100	8		779-787	Aug 2013	2013				English	2	65	Salmon farming is a widespread activity around the world, also known to promote diverse environmental effects on aquatic ecosystems. However, information regarding the impact of salmon farming on bird assemblages is notably scarce. We hypothesize that salmon farming, by providing food subsidies and physical structures to birds, will change their local community structure. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a seasonal monitoring of bird richness, abundance, and composition at paired salmon pen and control plots in two marine and two lake sites in southern Chile, from fall 2002 to summer 2004. Overall, salmon farming had no significant effects on species richness, but bird abundance was significantly and noticeably higher in salmon pens than in controls. Such aggregation was mainly accounted for by the trophic guilds of omnivores, diving piscivores, carrion eaters, and perching piscivores, but not by invertebrate feeders, herbivores, and surface feeders. Species composition was also significantly and persistently different between salmon pens and controls within each lake or marine locality. The patterns described above remained consistent across environment types and seasons indicating that salmon farming is changing the community structure of birds in both lake and marine habitats by promoting functional and aggregation responses, particularly by favoring species with broader niches. Such local patterns may thus anticipate potential threats from the ongoing expansion of the salmon industry to neighboring areas in Chile, resulting in regional changes of bird communities, toward a less diverse one and dominated by opportunistic, common, and generalist species such as gulls, vultures, and cormorants.

Syrbe, Ralf-Uwe; Michel, Elisa; Walz, Ulrich				Ecological Indicators	31			89-98	August 2013	2013				English	3	117	Biodiversity can, on the one hand be seen as a basis for ecosystem services and consequently for the associated human welfare; on the other, biodiversity as such has an independent value for man. However, biodiversity means not only the diversity of species, but also encompasses a number of manifestations of land use and the occurrence of genes, which also contribute to biodiversity, and which require assessment by suitable indicators. The present study seeks to describe biodiversity not only at the species level, but also the level of landscape variety, and to ascertain the connections between them. Its purpose is to develop a set of indicators for a comprehensive representation of biodiversity which contains species and habitat characteristics and can be used for planning practice and for scenarios. The study area is the district of Gorlitz in the German state of Saxony, which borders Poland and the Czech Republic. Details regarding the population size of Red List bird species for the time period 2003-2007 were analyzed, using data from the MultibaseCS database of the Saxon state Conservation of Nature Authority. Land use and specific land elements derived from the 2005 biotope mapping process were described by state indicators. In addition, regional statistical data on traffic volume and paved areas were used as impact indicators. All indicators were compiled and compared based on a 1000 m grid, so as to ascertain statistical correlations. The highest correlations between a combined species metric ("species-sum index") and landscape structure indicators were ascertained for birds of water and wetland habitats. However, those indicators revealed only slight correlations for birds in the other two landscape types, forests and open country. The best connections for all three habitat types between species and structural data were found using edge density indicators. All significant correlations were helpful for the evaluation of future landscape scenarios and, therefore provide a good basis for the design and implementation of planning goals.

Zhang Mei; Niu Jun-ying; Yang Xiao-ting; Tang Chen-dong; Wang Tian-hou				Changjiang Liuyu Ziyuan Yu Huanjing	22	7		858-864	Jul 2013	2013				Chinese	0	1	With natural wetlands loss and degradation as a consequence of human activities around the world, artificial wetland as alternative habitats for waterbirds receives more and more attention. Chongming Dongtan, located at the Yangtze River Mouth, is one of most important wintering and stopover sites for thousands of migratory waterbirds. During last decade, this area was reclaimed for multi-purposes,and part of area was converted into four patterns of the artificial wetlands: (1)wetland park, (2) aquacultural ponds, (3)abandoned fishpond, and (4) artificial wetland restoration demonstration area. In order to understand the environmental impacts of different land use on the waterbirds after the coastal reclamation and sort out the key habitat factors impacting the waterbird distribution, we undertook a wetland survey and waterbird study in Chongming Dontan, Shanghai coastland during November 2011 to May 2012. The study focused on the four types of artificial wetlands (Dongtan wetland park, fishpond in Beibayao, abandoned fishpond, Spartina alterniflora controlled demonstration sampling area). During the survey, a total number of 20 050 waterbirds were counted in winter, covering 34 species of 5 orders and 9 families. The dominant species were the spot-billed duck(Anas poecilorhyncha), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), northern pintail(Anas acuta), among which, 3 oriental white storks (Ciconia boyciana) ranked as IUCN/ICWP Endangered Species were recorded regularly in the December. In spring,5 080 waterbirds were counted, belonging to 47 bird species of 6 orders and 7 families. The dominant species were the spot-billed duck(Anas poecilorhyncha),mallard(Anas platyrhynchos), northern pintail (Anas acuta). The further study indicted that there were significant difference in the waterbirds species, density and diversity Shannon-Wiener(H') among the four artificial wetland in winter and spring with One-Way ANOVA analysis. Correlation analysis were undertaken between the waterbird characteristics (species number, H' and evenness) and the habitat factors (water area, mean water lever, human disturbance, mudflat and vegetation areas). The number of species, H' were positively correlated with water area, the number of species were negatively correlated with vegetation area in winter, and the number of species, density and HI were positively correlated with area of mudflat in spring. The study results indicates the artificial wetland of Chongming Dongtan plays an important role in the biodiversity conservation for wintering waterbirds,in terms of alternative habitats. According to our results, some recommendations were raised for artificial wetland management: (1) to maintain the large water area and proper water lever for building up a suitable habitat for wild goose and ducks in winter; (2)to maintain large mudflat area and control the vegetation expansion for the shorebird in spring; (3) to reduced human disturbance, particularly, in terms of controlling the number of the visitors in the Dongtan wetland park.

Mestre, Luiz A.M.; Cochrane, Mark A.; Barlow, Jos				Biotropica	45	4		480-488	Jul 2013	2013				English	1	52	We examined long-term responses of an Amazonian bird assemblage to wildfire disturbance, investigating how understory birds reacted to forest regeneration 1, 3, and 10years after a widespread fire event. The bird community was sampled along the Arapiuns and Maro river catchments in central Brazilian Amazonia. Sampling took place in 1998, 2000, and 2008 using mist-nets in eight plots (four burned, four unburned sites). Species richness did not change significantly in unburned sites. In burned sites, however, we found significantly lower richness in 1998, higher richness in 2000, and similar richness in 2008. Multi-dimensional scaling ordination showed consistent differences in bird communities both within burned sites sampled in different sampling years, and between burned and unburned sites in all years. Of the 30 most abundant species, 12 had not recovered 10years after the fires, including habitat specialists such as mixed flocks specialists and ant-followers. Fire-disturbance favored three species (two hummingbirds and a manakin) in the short term only. All other species were either favored throughout the study (seven species of omnivores and small insectivores) or did not show a clear response (eight species). In burned sites, we also found significantly lower abundance of species sensitive to disturbances and habitat specialists over the entire study period. Although the bird community seems to be recovering in terms of richness, the overall community composition and abundance of some species in post-burned and unburned sites remain very different, and have not recovered after 10years of forest regeneration.

Boyes, Rutledge S.; Perrin, Michael R.				Journal of Ornithology	154	3		849-861	Jul 2013	2013				English	0	11	Meyer's Parrot Poicephalus meyeri has the widest distributional range of any African parrot. There are six subspecies distributed throughout the African subtropics, all of which manage to breed successfully during the winter dry season when few other cavity-nesting birds are actively nesting. In 2004, we recorded Meyer's Parrots feeding on four cryptic arthropod larvae incubating inside fruits and pods in their seasonal diet. All of these were previously unknown in the diet of African parrots. Nesting females and chicks were fed regurgitate almost exclusively comprising these arthropod larvae for the first 10 weeks after nest occupation. In 2007, we demonstrated that Meyer's Parrots actively search for these protein-rich arthropod larvae and synchronized their breeding effort within our study area to coincide their hatching period with the period of highest relative abundance of these larvae, resulting in a breeding synchrony index value of 79.3 % between females in the population. In 2009, we recorded the consumption of similar arthropod larvae parasitizing similar tree species in northern Zambia and two locations in Tanzania, thus confirming this behaviour throughout their distributional range. Similar behaviour is expected in their closest congeners, the Brown-headed Parrot P. cryptoxanthus and Ruppell's Parrot P. rueppellii. Poor land management practices (e.g. deforestation and frequent fires) most likely influence the abundance of these cryptic arthropod larvae and thus the breeding success of Meyer's Parrot at population level.

Ding, Zhifeng; Feeley, Kenneth J.; Wang, Yanping; Pakeman, Robin J.; Ding, Ping				Journal of Animal Ecology	82	4		781-790	Jul 2013	2013				English	1	116	The loss of species diversity due to habitat fragmentation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the impacts of habitat fragmentation on functional diversity remains relatively poorly understood. We conducted bird functional diversity studies on a set of 41 recently isolated land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We analysed differences in bird species richness and a recently developed suite of complementary functional diversity indices (FRic, volume of functional space occupied; FEve, evenness of abundance distribution in the functional trait space; FDiv, divergence in the distribution of abundance in the trait volume) across different gradients (island area and isolation). We found no correlations between FRic and FEve or FEve and FDiv, but negative correlations between FRic and FDiv. As predicted, island area accounted for most of the variation in bird species richness, whereas isolation explained most of the variation in species evenness (decreasing species evenness with increasing isolation). Functional diversity appears to be more strongly influenced by habitat filtering as opposed to limiting similarity. More specifically, across all islands, both FRic and FEve were significantly lower than expected for randomly assembled communities, but FDiv showed no clear patterns. FRic increased with island area, FEve decreased with island area and FDiv showed no clear patterns. Our finding that FEve decreases with island area at TIL may indicate low functional stability on such islands, and as such large islands and habitat patches may deserve extra attention and/or protection. These results help to demonstrate the importance of considering the effects of fragmentation on functional diversity in habitat management and reserve design plans.

Dorresteijn, Ine; Hartel, Tibor; Hanspach, Jan; von Wehrden, Henrik; Fischer, Joern				PLoS ONE	8	6		e65236, 1-7	Jun 19 2013	2013				English	3	69	Land use change is a major threat to global biodiversity. Forest species face the dual threats of deforestation and intensification of forest management. In regions where forests are under threat, rural landscapes that retain structural components of mature forests potentially provide valuable additional habitat for some forest species. Here, we illustrate the habitat value of traditional wood pastures for a woodpecker assemblage of six species in southern Transylvania, Romania. Wood pastures are created by long-term stable silvo-pastoral management practices, and are composed of open grassland with scattered large, old trees. Because of their demanding habitat requirements, woodpeckers share habitat with many other bird species, and have been considered as possible indicator species for bird species diversity. We first compared woodpecker assemblages between forests and wood pastures. Second, we grouped features of wood pastures into three spatial contexts and addressed how these features related to the occurrence of three woodpecker species that are formally protected. Woodpecker species composition, but not the number of species, differed between forests and wood pastures, with the green woodpecker occurring more commonly in wood pastures, and the lesser spotted woodpecker more commonly in forests. Within wood pastures, the intermediate context (especially surrounding forest cover) best explained the presence of the grey-headed and middle spotted woodpecker. By contrast, variables describing local vegetation structure and characteristics of the surrounding landscape did not affect woodpecker occurrence in wood pastures. In contrast to many other parts of Europe, in which several species of woodpeckers have declined, the traditional rural landscape of Transylvania continues to provide habitat for several woodpecker species, both in forests and wood pastures. Given the apparent habitat value of wood pastures for woodpeckers we recommend wood pastures be explicitly considered in relevant policies of the European Union, namely the Habitats Directive and the EU Common Agricultural Policy.

Topping, Christopher J.; Odderskaer, Peter; Kahlert, Johnny				PLoS ONE	8	6		e65803, 1-15	Jun 4 2013	2013				English	0	2	Agent-based simulation models provide a viable approach for developing applied models of species and systems for predictive management. However, there has been some reluctance to use these models for policy applications due to complexity and the need for improved testing and communication of the models. We present the development and testing of a comprehensive model for Skylark (Alauda arvensis) in Danish agricultural landscapes. The model is part of the ALMaSS system, which considers not only individual skylarks, but also the detailed dynamic environment from which they obtain the information necessary to simulate their behaviour. Population responses emerge from individuals interacting with each other and the environment. Model development and testing was carried out using pattern-oriented modelling. The testing procedure was based on the model's ability to represent detailed real world patterns of distribution and density, reproductive performance and seasonal changes in territory numbers. Data to support this was collected over a 13-year period and comprised detailed field observations of breeding birds and intensive surveys. The model was able to recreate the real world data patterns accurately; it was also able to simultaneously fit a number of other secondary system properties which were not formally a part of the testing procedure. The correspondence of model output to real world data and sensitivity analysis are presented and discussed, and the model's description is provided in ODdox format (a formal description inter-linked to the program code). Detailed and stringent tests for model performance were carried out, and standardised model description and open access to the source code were provided to open development of the skylark model to others. Over and above documenting the utility of the model, this open process is essential to engender the user trust and ensure continued development of these comprehensive systems for applied purposes.

Jalilova, Gulnaz; de Groot, Jan; Vacik, Harald				Biodiversity	14	2		97-110	June 2013	2013				English	1	3	Walnut fruit forests represent both a valuable hotspot of biological diversity and have significant economic value for the livelihoods of local communities. However, the sustainable management of these forests is a complex task requiring the successful juggling of the different interests of local stakeholders, including fulfilling their economic, social and ecological demands. Birds were chosen as the indicator of biodiversity with which to evaluate the effects of forest management activities. A research study was conducted in 2005 during the birds' breeding season in five different habitats (primary and secondary forests, plantation, agroforestry and brushwood) using the point sampling method. A total of 23 species were recorded. According to the various diversity indices employed, the best habitats for species richness were areas of agroforestry, while primary forests were found to be the best habitats in terms of species abundance. In contrast, the lowest bird diversity was observed in plantations due to their structural homogeneity. In addition, habitat suitability was assessed according to both horizontal and vertical structural parameters and tested using five selected indicator bird species. The results reveal a link between birds and vegetation, with abundance of old trees, availability of deadwood and habitat understorey density found to be the most important indicators of bird survival. Our research findings highlight that it is imperative to protect existing primary forests which are genetic diversity hotspots for endemic species such as Dendrocopos leucopterus. Although areas under agroforestry were primarily found to be relatively promising habitats in terms of species richness, these intensively managed ecosystems may also be useful for simultaneously fulfilling the needs of local people, if such projects are carefully planned and managed.

Sierro, Antoine; Arlettaz, Raphael				Nos Oiseaux	60	2		79-90	Juin 2013	2013				French	0	0	Scops Owl is one of the rarest breeding birds in Switzerland with reproduction essentially restricted to Valais. In order to recommend appropriate conservation measures, we studied the habitat selection and hunting strategy of breeding Scops owls in the remaining core population on the South-exposed slope of Central Valais. Four adults were equipped with radio transmitters. Thanks to a light amplifier, their hunting strategy could be observed visually. The Scops foraged principally along grassy edges, in low-intensity grasslands and in dry meadows. Low-intensity grasslands were used more than predicted from their availability within birds' home ranges, probably because this type of habitat harboured more insect prey. The Scops mostly used isolated trees and fence posts as hunting perches. When perch-hunting from trees, they preferred dead branches. Hunting success was greatest in meadows regrowing after mowing. Conservation recommendations include promoting dry and low-intensity grasslands and keeping grass strips under extensive management along hedgerows so as to create an arthropod-rich habitat mosaic offering sufficient refuges for insect prey during mowing operations.

To illustrate the value of science to management, we consider five scenarios for the 202.0 kmA2 Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, Philippines: (1) closure to human activities, (2) and (3) two levels of increase in unplanned human activities, (4) creation of a forest corridor and (5) additional allocation of land for permanent or shifting agriculture. We then use habitat-specific bird density estimates to simulate the net effect of each scenario on 18 focal bird populations. Closure has significant benefits-populations of five species are predicted to increase by >50 % and nine by >25 %, but two secondary forest flycatchers, including the endemic and 'Vulnerable' Palawan flycatcher, decline dramatically, while the creation of a 4.0 kmA2 forest corridor yields average increases across species of 2 [plus or minus]A 4 % (SD). In contrast, heavier unplanned park usage produces declines in all but a few species, while the negative effects of an extra 2.0 kmA2 of shifting cultivation are 3-5 times higher than for a similar area of permanent agriculture and affect species whose densities are highest in primary habitats. Relatively small changes within the park, especially those associated with agricultural expansion, has serious predicted implications for local bird populations. Our models do not take into account the full complexities of bird ecology at a site, but they do provide park managers with an evidence base from which to make better decisions relating to biodiversity conservation obligations which their parks are intended to meet.

Hache, Samuel; Petry, Thibaut; Villard, Marc-Andre				Avian Conservation and Ecology	8	1		15pp.	Jun 2013	2013				English	0	1	Silvicultural treatments have been shown to alter the composition of species assemblages in numerous taxa. However, the intensity and persistence of these effects have rarely been documented. We used a before-after, control-impact (BACI) paired design, i.e., five pairs of 25-ha study plots, 1-control and 1-treated plot, to quantify changes in the density of eight forest bird species in response to selection harvesting over six breeding seasons, one year pre- and five years postharvest. Focal species included mature forest associates, i.e., Northern Parula (Setophaga americana) and Black-throated Green Warbler (Setophaga virens), forest generalists, i.e., Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius) and Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), early-seral specialists, i.e., Mourning Warbler (Geothlypis philadelphia) and Chestnut-sided Warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica), species associated with shrubby forest gaps, i.e., Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens), and mid-seral species, i.e., American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla). As predicted, we found a negative numerical response to the treatment in the Black-throated Green Warbler, no treatment effect in the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, and a positive treatment effect in early-seral specialists. We only detected a year effect in the Northern Parula and the American Redstart. There was evidence for a positive treatment effect on the Swainson's Thrush when the regeneration started to reach the pole stage, i.e., fifth year postharvest. These findings suggest that selection harvesting has the potential to maintain diverse avian assemblages while allowing sustainable management of timber supply, but future studies should determine whether mature-forest associates can sustain second-and third-entry selection harvest treatments.

Esque, Todd C.; Webb, Robert H.; Wallace, Cynthia S.A.; van Riper, Charles, III; McCreedy, Chris; Smythe, Lindsay				Southwestern Naturalist	58	2		223-233	Jun 2013	2013				English	1	14	In 2005, fire ignited by humans swept from Yuma Proving Grounds into Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona, burning ca. 9,255 ha of Wilderness Area. Fuels were predominantly the native forb Plantago ovata. Large fires at low elevations were rare in the 19th and 20th centuries, and fires fueled by native vegetation are undocumented in the southwestern deserts. We estimated the area damaged by fire using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, which are more accurate and reduce subjectivity of aerial surveys of perimeters of fires. Assemblages of upland and xeroriparian plants lost 91 and 81% of live cover, respectively, in fires. The trees Olneya tesota and Cercidium had high amounts of top-kill. King Valley was an important xeroriparian corridor for birds. Species richness of birds decreased significantly following the fire. Numbers of breeding birds were lower in burned areas of King Valley 3 years post-fire, compared to numbers in nearby but unburned Alamo Wash. Although birds function within a large geographic scale, the extent of this burn still influenced the relative abundance of local species of breeding birds. This suggests that breeding birds respond to conditions of localized burns and slow recovery of vegetation contributes to continued lower numbers of birds in the burned sites in King Valley.

Prince, Karine; Jiguet, Frederic				Journal of Environmental Management	121			110-116	May 30 2013	2013				English	1	98	Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been implemented to cope with the loss of farmland biodiversity due to agricultural intensification over the last decades. In France, grassland measures (more closely linked to extensive grazing) are the most widely implemented within the French AES, and are presumably those whose effectiveness can be better assessed. In this paper, we have evaluated the effectiveness of French grassland agri-environmental measures (gAES) to enhance farmland bird diversity on a national scale, using local abundances of 19 farmland breeding birds within 463 Small Agricultural Regions (SAR) covering France during 2001-2008. We modeled responses of species abundances and estimated species richness to five categories of grassland AES, accounting for the characteristics of local production systems. Extensive management of grasslands had a positive effect on species richness. Despite mixed results on the effectiveness of the different grassland AES categories, our results are optimistic in terms of the ability of some French AES to provide benefits to birds. It seems that some grassland AES have achieved their objectives while meeting species ecological requirements. Moreover, this study highlights the fact that some of these grassland AES have the potential to enhance the population dynamics of declining species. Finally, although they all aim at benefitting biodiversity, it cannot be assumed that grassland measures lead to uniform conservation benefits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DeFisher, Luke E.; Bonter, David N.				PLoS ONE	8	5		e64185	May 17 2013	2013				English	1	58	Various invasive ant species have negatively affected reproductive success in birds by disrupting nest site selection, incubation patterns, food supply, and by direct predation on nestlings. Impacts can be particularly severe when non-native ants colonize seabird nesting islands where thousands of birds may nest in high densities on the ground or in burrows or crevices. Here we report on the first documented effects of Myrmica rubra, the European fire ant, on the reproduction of birds in its non-native range. We documented herring gulls (Larus argentatus) on Appledore Island, Maine, engaging in more erratic incubation behaviors at nests infested by the ants. Newly-hatched chicks in some nests were swarmed by ants, leading to rapid chick death. Due to high overall rates of chick mortality, survival probabilities did not vary between nests with and without ant activity, however chick growth rates were slower at nests with ants than at ant-free nests. Ant infestation likely leads to longer-term fitness consequences because slower growth rates early in life may ultimately lead to lower post-fledging survival probabilities.

Chalmandrier, Loic; Midgley, Guy F.; Barnard, Phoebe; Sirami, Clelia				Acta Oecologica	49			99-106	May 2013	2013				English	1	50	Global changes are influencing fire regimes in many parts of the world. In the Fynbos plant diversity hotspot (Cape Floristic Region, South Africa), fire frequency has increased in protected areas where the mean fire interval went from 12-19 to 6-9 years between 1970 and 2000. Fire is one of the main drivers of plant diversity in the Cape Floristic Region. Too frequent fires threaten the persistence of slow-maturing plant species, and such insights have led to the adoption of fire management principles based on plant responses. The effects of fire on Fynbos fauna are much more poorly understood, and have not generally been considered in depth in Fynbos conservation policies, planning or management. We assessed the response of bird communities to long-term fire-induced vegetation changes using space-for-time substitution. We studied bird communities, vegetation structure and plant functional composition in 84 Fynbos plots burnt between two and 18 years before. Ten of the 14 bird species analysed showed a significant change in their abundance with time since fire. We observed a significant species turnover along the post-fire succession due to changes both in vegetation structure and plant functional composition, with a characteristic shift from non-Fynbos specialists and granivorous species to Fynbos specialists and nectarivorous species. If current trends of increasing fire frequency continue, Fynbos endemic birds such as nectarivores may become vulnerable. Conservation management should thus aim more carefully to maintain mosaics of Fynbos patches of different ages. Future research needs to estimate the proportion of vegetation of different ages and patch sizes needed to support dependent fauna, particularly endemics. [copyright] 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Douglas				Journal of Wildlife Management	77	4		737-748	May 2013	2013				English	2	34	We employed a chronosequence approach to evaluate patterns of bird abundance in relation to post-fire vegetation recovery in mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata vaseyana). We estimated population density for 12 species of birds within the perimeters of 4 fires that had undergone 820 years of vegetation recovery and on adjacent unburned areas in the northwestern Great Basin, USA. Six species showed negative responses to fire persisting up to 20 years. Two species showed positive responses with effects persisting for <20 years. Understory vegetation was similar between burned and unburned areas irrespective of recovery time, and shrub canopy cover was similar between burned and unburned sites after 20 years of recovery. Persistent reductions in bird densities lead us to conclude that shrub canopy cover alone is not a sufficient metric for predicting recovery of songbird abundances following disturbance in mountain big sagebrush.

Biotropica	45	3		365-372	May 2013	2013				English	2	41	In the Peruvian Amazon, white-sand forests are patchily distributed and restricted to a few localities in the North. Although recent studies have documented patterns of habitat specialization by plants in these unique forests, very few studies of the fauna of these habitats have been conducted. The species composition of the avifauna of the white-sand forests at six localities in the region was sampled by conducting transects and point counts. Surrounding habitats were also sampled to compare avifaunal communities and to determine the degree of restriction of bird species to white-sand habitats. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed that bird communities of white-sand forests were more similar to each other than they were to terra firme or flooded forest communities. Sites on either side of the Amazon-Maranon barrier were the most similar within habitat type consistent with the hypothesis that these rivers represent a major biogeographic barrier. Twenty-six species, belonging to 13 families, were to some degree specialized to white-sand forests. This is the first comprehensive ornithological assessment carried out on these habitats in Peru. The high degree of habitat specialization found in these 26 bird species highlights the need for conservation and management measures that will protect white-sand forests.

Powell, Alexis F.L.A.; Busby, William H.				Natural Areas Journal	33	2		130-138	Apr 2013	2013				English	4	33	We studied responses of breeding birds to alternative regimes for managing tallgrass prairie at the Smoky Hill Air National Guard Range in central Kansas. Species richness, diversity, and evenness did not differ among treatments, but overall abundance was highest in unburned idle (i.e., not grazed or hayed) transects, and was lowest in idle transects burned that spring. However, no treatment was either superior or inferior to all others for attracting the highest numbers of every species. Dickcissels (Spiza americana) and Henlow's sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii) were most numerous in unburned idle units, grasshopper sparrows (A. savannarum) were most abundant in grazed units and hayed units, upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) were most often found in burned units, whereas eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) were less abundant in burned units than in all other treatments. We conclude that the recent switch to burning idle units every 3-4 years, rather than annually, has benefitted most grassland bird species. The variety of management regimes implemented at Smoky Hill Air National Guard Range fosters heterogeneity of vegetative structure across the landscape, and thereby allows the site to provide for differing needs of various species, thus enhancing its value for grassland bird conservation.

Journal of Threatened Taxa	5	5		3969-3976	Mar 26 2013	2013				English	0	4	The Chhilchhila Wildlife Sanctuary (76[degree]36'-76[degree]46'E & 29[degree]52'-30[degree]00'N), situated in Kurukshetra District of Haryana provides an important wintering ground for a diverse range of wetland birds. This study was carried out from April 2009 to March 2012 to document the diversity of wetland birds. Altogether 57 species of wetland birds belonging to 37 genera and 16 families were recorded from the study area. Family Anatidae dominated the wetland bird community with 13 species. Among recorded species, 33 were winter migrants, two summer migrants and 22 were resident species. The winter migratory birds did not arrive at this wetland in one lot and at one time. Instead, they displayed a definite pattern specific to species for arrival and departure. They appeared at the wetland during mid-October and stayed up to early April. The composition of birds in major feeding guilds in the study area showed that the insectivore guild was the most common with 35.09% species, followed by carnivore (29.82%), omnivore (19.30%), herbivore (10.53%) and piscivore (5.26%). Among the birds recorded in this study area, Darter (Anhinga melanogaster) and Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala) were Near Threatened species. Comb Duck (Sarkidiornis melanotos), listed in Appendix II of CITES, was also spotted in the sanctuary. The spotting of these threatened bird species highlights the importance of Chhilchhila Wildlife Sanctuary as a significant wetland bird habitat in Haryana. However, anthropogenic activities like fire wood collection, livestock grazing, cutting of emergent and fringe vegetation and improper management of the wetland are major threats to the ecology of this landscape.

Mabry, Catherine				Ecological Restoration	31	1		63-68	Mar 1 2013	2013				English	0	4	Shrubs play a key role as bird habitat in eastern North America and are associated with a group of songbirds that are in sharp decline in the Midwest region, U. S. A. Savanna restoration throughout the region is a key priority for vegetation managers, and a priority goal is often to clear the understory of woody species encroachment, including shrubs. However, while the benefit of maintaining a shrub layer in restored savanna has been noted by wildlife managers, the degree to which native shrubs should be retained has not yet been quantified. In this study, I measured songbird occurrence in sites that met the criteria of savanna physiognomy and that have shrub cover ranging from 10 to >=75%. The results indicated that the highest overall species richness and richness of species conservation concern occurred when shrub cover was <=35%. This observation suggests that shrub cover in the range of 10-35% may be adequate to conserve declining shrub dependent bird species, while also meeting the objective of opening the understory desired by savanna restoration practitioners.

Restoration Ecology	21	2		193-199	Mar 2013	2013				English	2	37	In Mediterranean areas, river systems are key for maintaining regional biodiversity by providing a high diversity of habitats. We studied bird community recovery for 9 years (20012009) during landscape restoration and Guadiamar Green Corridor establishment in the area affected by the Aznalcollar mine spill (SW Spain, 1998). One year following plant restoration (3 years after the spill), values for - and -bird species diversity were high, sooner than reported for similar restoration processes elsewhere. Species richness, ecological diversity, and abundance increased only slightly in the following 8 years. Overlap between communities in sequential years, measured by similarity indexes, increased throughout the study period to about 70% during final survey years, and most breeding bird species present before the accident again inhabit the area. Only 5 years after the mine accident, bird communities in the restored site were similar in species richness, abundance, and diversity to an unaffected reference site; redundancy analysis demonstrated that bird communities were also similar between the reference river and the Guadiamar. Despite the severity of the mine accident, our results suggest a swift recovery of the bird community. We attribute this success to the rapid restoration of habitat availability and the resilience of the birds. This long-term study contributes to our limited knowledge of bird species response to habitat restoration following toxic spills in Mediterranean habitats.

Otis, David L.; Crumpton, William R.; Green, David; Loan-Wilsey, Anna; Cooper, Tom; Johnson, Rex R.				Restoration Ecology	21	2		276-284	Mar 2013	2013				English	2	71	Justification for investment in restored or constructed wetland projects are often based on presumed net increases in ecosystem services. However, quantitative assessment of performance metrics is often difficult and restricted to a single objective. More comprehensive performance assessments could help inform decision-makers about trade-offs in services provided by alternative restoration program design attributes. The primary goal of the Iowa Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program is to establish wetlands that efficiently remove nitrates from tile-drained agricultural landscapes. A secondary objective is provision of wildlife habitat. We used existing wildlife habitat models to compare relative net change in potential wildlife habitat value for four alternative landscape positions of wetlands within the watershed. Predicted species richness and habitat value for birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles generally increased as the wetland position moved lower in the watershed. However, predicted average net increase between pre- and post-project value was dependent on taxonomic group. The increased average wetland area and changes in surrounding upland habitat composition among landscape positions were responsible for these differences. Net change in predicted densities of several grassland bird species at the four landscape positions was variable and species-dependent. Predicted waterfowl breeding activity was greater for lower drainage position wetlands. Although our models are simplistic and provide only a predictive index of potential habitat value, we believe such assessment exercises can provide a tool for coarse-level comparisons of alternative proposed project attributes and a basis for constructing informed hypotheses in auxiliary empirical field studies.

This has been well established in agricultural and forested areas, but less is known about how management of the suburban matrix affects adjacent reserves. We argue that it is critically important to understand the impact of suburban management on reserves, as flawed planning decisions can have negative conservation outcomes and waste limited resources. Location Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Methods We examined bird distribution patterns in suburbs and adjacent reserves to the effects of two suburban management practices: (1) street tree planting and (2) boundary design. We focused on three groups of birds with known responses to urbanization: native urban-intolerant species (native avoiders), native urban-tolerant species (native adapters) and exotic urban-tolerant species (exotic adapters). Results We found that suburbs with 30% native (Eucalyptus) street trees and reserves adjacent to these suburbs had significantly higher bird species richness, native adapter species richness and probability of reporting exotic adapters than those with exotic trees. The type of street trees, however, did not affect the probability of reporting native avoiders. These species were more likely to be reported when habitat complexity was high. Only native adapters responded to boundary design, with higher species richness when the boundary type was a local or unsealed road as opposed to an arterial road. Main conclusions Native street trees provide foraging resources for birds that would be reduced or absent in exotic streetscapes, enabling native streetscapes to support a rich community of birds. Furthermore, native streetscapes increase bird richness and diversity in adjacent reserves. This result has important conservation implications for suburb and reserve management practices. Our study provides evidence that the establishment and retention of native suburban streetscapes is an important management strategy for improved bird conservation.

Wilson Journal of Ornithology	125	1		134-139	Mar 2013	2013				English	1	31	Feral herbivores can affect birds on islands indirectly, by altering habitat structure via impacts on vegetation. I censused birds in an open shrub/grassland habitat on Santa Cruz Island, California, in 1980 and again in 2008, 24 years after feral sheep were removed, in order to assess avian responses to vegetation changes resulting from sheep removal. Vegetation change was characterized by an increased density of both overstory and low-growing shrubs, along with denser herbaceous vegetation, and these characteristics were associated with substantial changes in bird abundance. Species that prefer dense shrubs, such as Spotted Towhees (Pipilo maculatus) and Orange-crowned Warblers (Oreothlypis celata), increased in abundance, whereas species such as House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) and Mourning Doves (Zenaida macroura) that prefer open, disturbed areas decreased. Rufous-crowned Sparrows (Aimophila ruficeps) and Island Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma insularis), both insular endemic taxa, showed a mixed response and perhaps prefer wooded habitats in which low-growing vegetation is not exceptionally dense.

Numbers of bird species were higher in large forest patches and decrease with decreasing patch size. Bird species richness also decreased with increased isolation of forest patches. Suitable trees should be planted in the gaps between the forests that will create wildlife corridors to maintain connectivity. Resume Cette etude examine comment la fragmentation causee par des changements de la taille des parcelles forestieres ou par une distance croissante entre ces parcelles affecte la richesse en especes d'oiseaux. Le nombre d'especes d'oiseaux etait plus eleve dans les grandes parcelles forestieres et diminuait en meme temps que la taille des parcelles. La richesse en especes diminuait aussi avec l'augmentation de l'isolement des parcelles. Il faudrait planter des arbres appropries dans les vides existant entre les forets pour creer des corridors pour la faune et preserver la connectivite.

Singleton, Lindsey C.; Sladek, Brandon G.; Burger, L. Wes; Munn, Ian A.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	37	1		189-197	Mar 2013	2013				English	2	6	Open pine-grasslands are one of the most threatened ecological communities in the southeastern United States and provide essential habitat for many regionally declining bird species. While open pine grassland forests have diminished, acreage of pine plantations has increased throughout the Southeast, in part because of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Bill conservation programs. To understand whether fire and herbicide treatments would be effective in creating pine grassland structure in plantations suitable for a suite of declining early successional and pine grassland adapted species, we evaluated combined effects of selective herbicide and prescribed fire on plant and bird communities in thinned, mid-rotation pine stands established under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in Mississippi, USA. Within each of the 12 replicate sites, we assigned 2 paired 8.1-ha plots to either treatment (herbicide + prescribed fire) or control in a randomized complete block design. We applied treatments during autumn and winter of 2002 2003. During 2003-2006 breeding seasons, we characterized the bird community using repeated (4-6 repetitions/yr), standardized, 10-minute point counts from which we estimated species richness, total relative abundance, total avian conservation value, and density of select species. Managed plots exhibited reduced hardwood midstory and a greater abundance of grasses and forbs in the ground layer. Although avian species richness and total relative abundance were similar in treatment and control stands, we observed a shift in the bird community from closed-canopy forest species to early successional and pine grassland adapted species, many of which are experiencing population declines. We recommend thinning, hardwood midstory control, and prescribed burning within CRP pine plantations to provide habitat for a suite of regionally declining bird species.

Hulme, Mark F.; Vickery, Juliet A.; Green, Rhys E.; Phalan, Ben; Chamberlain, Dan E.; Pomeroy, Derek E.; Nalwanga, Dianah; Mushabe, David; Katebaka, Raymond; Bolwig, Simon; Atkinson, Philip W.				PLoS ONE	8	2		e54597, 1-13	Feb 4 2013	2013				English	4	195	Reconciling the aims of feeding an ever more demanding human population and conserving biodiversity is a difficult challenge. Here, we explore potential solutions by assessing whether land sparing (farming for high yield, potentially enabling the protection of non-farmland habitat), land sharing (lower yielding farming with more biodiversity within farmland) or a mixed strategy would result in better bird conservation outcomes for a specified level of agricultural production. We surveyed forest and farmland study areas in southern Uganda, measuring the population density of 256 bird species and agricultural yield: food energy and gross income. Parametric non-linear functions relating density to yield were fitted. Species were identified as "winners" (total population size always at least as great with agriculture present as without it) or "losers" (total population sometimes or always reduced with agriculture present) for a range of targets for total agricultural production. For each target we determined whether each species would be predicted to have a higher total population with land sparing, land sharing or with any intermediate level of sparing at an intermediate yield. We found that most species were expected to have their highest total populations with land sparing, particularly loser species and species with small global range sizes. Hence, more species would benefit from high-yield farming if used as part of a strategy to reduce forest loss than from low-yield farming and land sharing, as has been found in Ghana and India in a previous study. We caution against advocacy for high-yield farming alone as a means to deliver land sparing if it is done without strong protection for natural habitats, other ecosystem services and social welfare. Instead, we suggest that conservationists explore how conservation and agricultural policies can be better integrated to deliver land sparing by, for example, combining land-use planning and agronomic support for small farmers.

Fuller, Robert J.; Rothery, Peter				Forest Ecology and Management	289			164-174	Feb 1 2013	2013				English	2	34	Temporal consistency of models of animal-habitat relationships is important because it is widely assumed that such models have long-term relevance for conservation management. Habitat associations can potentially shift over time due to changes in factors such as habitat quality, predation risk and intra-specific competition. Relationships between vegetation attributes and bird distribution were examined in rotationally harvested woodland in two breeding seasons separated by 16 years. Over this period habitat suitability deteriorated for understory bird species as a result of increased browsing pressure by deer. Generalised additive models were constructed for eight species and three groups of songbirds (all species, migrants, hole-nesters), with choice of predictors and the assumed form of underlying relationships informed by cross-validation deviance. Three species differed strongly between years in their responses to age of vegetation regrowth following harvesting; in two of these cases the differences were probably a consequence of deer browsing altering relationships between age of regrowth and vegetation structure. Canopy height was generally the single best predictor and for six of the 11 response variables, height was the best predictor in both years. Density of shrub layer foliage was frequently the second best predictor in both years. Multi-variable models in most cases selected canopy height as the first variable. Floristic variables (i.e. ones measuring aspects of tree or shrub species composition) featured in 64% of the multi-variable models and 27% of the selected variables were floristic rather than structural. Overall, there was a high level of temporal consistency in the bird-habitat models with most species apparently keying into very similar vegetation structures irrespective of browsing pressure. Canopy height is considered to be a surrogate for a complex of micro-habitat elements associated with resource provision for many birds. However, the understory micro-structures that are important determinants of habitat quality for many forest species are difficult to measure in ecologically meaningful ways. New technologies potentially offer better ways of measuring these habitat attributes and of assessing how they are affected by forest management. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Scarton, Francesco; Cecconi, Giovanni; Valle, Roberto				Wetlands Ecology and Management	21	1		15-27	Feb 2013	2013				English	0	35	Colonization of newly created habitats is a challenge for waterbird populations in a changing world. Knowing which habitat characteristics are required by waterbird populations is a research challenge for rational management of the new ecosystems and their aquatic bird populations. Since 1989 intertidal dredge islands have been built in the lagoon of Venice using sediments coming from regular dredging of lagoon channels and inlets. Kentish Plover, a species declining in Europe, readily uses these new sites as soon as they become available. Between 2005 and 2007, 75 dredge islands were surveyed each year and the number of breeding pairs of Kentish Plover estimated. Each year about one-third of available dredge islands was used by Kentish Plover. Between 34 (in 2005) and 131 (in 2007) breeding pairs were found, and possible differences in vegetation and morphological characteristics between occupied and unoccupied sites were investigated. Only age, mean elevation above sea level and extension of bare ground were statistically different; Kentish Plover preferred younger sites, with higher elevation and with larger areas of bare ground. The largest groups of breeding pairs, up to thirty pairs, were found on islands which also supported colonies of Little Terns. In the study period dredged islands supported about 60 % of the total breeding population of the lagoon of Venice and 4-6 % of the estimated Italian population. Along coastal sites where human pressure on beaches is particularly heavy, man made habitats such as dredge islands may become a valuable alternative breeding site for this and other species of conservation concern. Management works aimed at promoting the occurrence of this species at selected dredge islands have been made in the lagoon of Venice.

Ecoscience	20	4		319-327	2013	2013				English	1	33	Landscape homogenization resulting from high browsing pressure or forest management practices can impact plant and animal diversity. Large herbivores and logging may therefore influence small mammal populations, which are known to strongly respond to forest disturbances. We assessed the influence of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) density and forest harvesting on deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in the boreal forest of Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada). We expected mice to be favoured by logging and thus that their abundance and body mass would increase in cutblocks, due to a greater availability of grasses providing food, shelter from predators, and improved thermoregulation. Mice may also benefit from an increase in deer density, especially at intermediate densities, where food (insects and seeds) availability is the highest. In 2 consecutive summers, we live-captured mice within a large, controlled deer browsing experiment where deer were maintained at 4 different densities (0, 7.5, and 15 deer.km-2 and ambient density, 27 to 56 deer.km-2) in forest and in cutblocks. We found higher mice abundance in logged habitat regardless of deer density, but body mass was unaffected by deer density and forest harvesting. While plant, insect, and bird communities have all been shown to respond to deer density reduction, the interspecific relationships between deer and mice appear neutral in this system.
