We seasonally recorded birds at 60 point count stations (30 in each type of habitat) between March 1998 and August 1999. The shrubless area showed higher percentages of herb cover and bare ground than the forest, whereas in the forest there were higher covers of litter and shrubs and a higher shrub height than in the shrubless area. Moreover, the shrubless area showed a lower species richness and bird abundance than the forest in summer. At the guild level, analyses revealed that bark insectivores were more abundant in the shrubless area, whereas foliage insectivores, terrestrial insectivores, and arboreal seed eaters were more abundant in the forest. Our results show that shrub removal has a great influence on the structure of bird assemblages, which persists several years later after the application of this technique. We recommend that, in case of massive shrub removal, stripes of shrubby vegetation should be maintained in order to guarantee the inclusion of shrub-associated bird species in the mosaic landscape.

France) to the Middle Atlas (Marocco). A common background of ca 15 Palearctic bird species accounts for three quarters of relative abundances in all communities. However, significant differences appear at several levels. (1) Between the medio-european and Mediterranean biogeographical areas, middle latitudes of Spain prevent the presence southward of ca 10 species, such as the Goldcrest and the Bullfinch. Conversely, although belonging to the same faunistic region, 11 species, such as the Short-toed "Free Creeper and the Serin, are more frequent in the Mediterranean than further north. Over the two forest types investigated, there are only 33 Passerine species, over a total of 54, common to Middle Europe and the Mediterranean area. (2) Abies and Pinus forests have in common a striking figure of 46 bird species. The distinctive species are the Firecrest and the Blackcap in fir forests, the Crested Tit and the Common Crossbill in pine forests. As already noted by various authors, as a consequence of its insularity and mesological peculiarities the Mediterranean forest avifauna can be considered as an impoverished version of its Medio-european counterpart. (3) At the broad regional scale, a multivariate analysis shows an avifaunistic gradient running from climacic forests, mainly on north-facing slopes from Vanoise (French Alps) to the Pyrenees, to para-climacic pre-forests, mainly on south-facing slopes, in Andalucia and Marocco. In the former case, boreal bird species account for three quarters of the abundances in the community but less than half in the latter where the rest consists predominantly of rather biogeographically and ecologically ubiquitous species (Carduelinae, Woodlark, Rock Bunting) which, for a mix of ecological and anthropogenic reasons, are able to colonize more and more common southward thermo-xerophilous and open wooded landscapes.

I studied L. kaempferi plantations of various stand ages in central Japan to examine and compare the effect of stand age on the abundance, size, and species composition of snags (standing dead trees) compared to those in secondary broadleaf forests. Plantations that were older than the standard rotation age had more and larger snags than young plantations, and the species diversity of snags was positively correlated with stand age. Because the density of living planted L. kaempferi showed little correlation with snag variables, whereas that of naturally regenerated tree species was positively correlated with snag variables, the density dependence of snag occurrence was stronger in naturally regenerated trees than in planted L. kaempferi. Snag species that were positively correlated with stand age were the main species in secondary broadleaf forests in this area. Basal area, density, and number of species of snags in standard-rotation plantations were significantly lower than in long-rotation plantations and secondary broadleaf forests. Long-rotation plantations are useful for retaining snags compared to standard-rotation plantations.

Large reserves have potential to provide important refugia for fragmentation-sensitive species as they lack many aspects of habitat degradation associated with fragmented regions. However, large reserves often have a history of deleterious management practices that may affect the restoration of biological diversity. One significant symptom of habitat fragmentation and disturbance in Australia is the increased occurrence of the aggressive noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). In Queensland, however, even large continuous areas of woodland appear to be dominated by the noisy miner.Aims. We examined the severity of this phenomenon by identifying the interactions between habitat structure, noisy miner abundance and avian assemblages in a private and a public conservation reserve in central Queensland. We investigated potential constraints on restoration of avian diversity including: (1) how changes in habitat structure as a result of grazing by feral animals and burning regimes affect bird assemblages; and (2) how the noisy miner impacts on avian assemblages in these unfragmented woodlands.Methods. Bird surveys and habitat assessments were conducted in 49 sites on three separate occasions. Fire history and intensity of grazing pressure were determined for each site with direct and indirect observations. Sampling for lerp from insects of the family Psyllidae was also undertaken during the survey periods. A Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach was used to model avian response to each of the habitat variables.Key results. The noisy miner dominated most of the study area, reducing small passerine abundance and species richness. Noisy miners were advantaged where shrub cover was low and feral grazing impacts were evident. Disturbance factors including recent wild. re and heavy grazing strongly reduced small passerine bird richness and abundance.Conclusions. Reducing the abundance of this 'reverse keystone' species requires control of feral herbivore populations and modi. cation of. re regimes to achieve a mosaic including patches with a dense shrub layer.Implications. Deleterious interactions with competitive native species, such as noisy miners, are obstacles to bird conservation not only in fragmented landscapes but also in large, continuous woodland areas. Land mangers of protected areas need to be aware of shifts in interactions among native species driven by habitat disturbance, which may ultimately affect conservation outcomes.

We assessed changes in the relative abundance of cavity nesting birds in two intensities of partial cutting, compared to uncut and clearcut stands, 9 years post-treatment. We then examined the relationship between forest structure and nesting abundance (stand scale) and compared characteristics of used nest and forage trees to unused trees (tree scale). The relative abundance of most species was highest in either heavy removal or light removal treatments 9 years post-harvest. Brown creepers were most abundant in uncut, and red-breasted sapsuckers were most abundant in clearcut and heavy removal treatments. The proportion of deciduous trees and the density of dead trees were the best predictors of nest abundance. Individual nest tree use was predicted by the presence of large deciduous trees with broken tops and early to advanced stages of decay. Forage tree use was predicted by the presence of large conifer trees in advanced stages of decay. To maintain breeding habitat for cavity nesters, we suggest that forest managers retain the specific structural attributes required for nesting, but also the diverse forest conditions required for foraging.

Predicting the response of biota to disturbance is therefore important, but it nevertheless remains difficult to make accurate forecasts of response. We tested predictions from disturbance-related theories and concepts in 10 vegetation types at Booderee National Park (southeastern Australia) using a retrospective study of bird responses to. re history (over 35 years) on 110 sites and a prospective study following a single wild. re event in 2003 at 59 of these sites. Our data did not support predictions from the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis; observed bird species richness at a site was significantly (F(1,99) = 6.30, P = 0.014) negatively related to the number of fires since 1972 and was 8.7% lower (95% CI, 1.8 -15.1%) for each additional. re. In contrast to. re history effects, we found that after the 2003. re, the vast majority of individual species and the bird assemblage per se in most vegetation types recovered within two years. Thus, recovery after a single. re did not reflect long-term effects of multiple fires on overall bird species richness at a site. We postulated that the recovery of bird species richness and bird assemblage composition after the 2003. re would be fastest in structurally simple vegetation types and slowest in structurally complex vegetation, but observed the opposite. Although observed bird species richness in vertically heterogeneous forest and woodland had returned to prefire levels by 2006, bird species richness in structurally simple vegetation types (e. g., sedgeland) had not. Post. re vegetation regeneration, together with a paucity of early-successional specialists, would explain the speed of recovery of the bird assemblage and why it changed relatively little during our investigation.

It has been shown that the replacement of primary dark conifer-deciduous forests by secondary forests is accompanied by a significant decrease in bird population density, with some species being lost and the composition of the dominant species group being changed. On the other hand, fires lead to increasing patchiness of the environment, which can sometimes provide for an increase in biological diversity.

By studying the metapopulation system of a territorial passerine, the Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti, we analysed the demographic correlates of population vocal activity, and the relationships between the occurrence of immigration and the availability of social information (e.g. vocal activity, population size, density and productivity) in 22 local populations. We found that the proportion of active singing days in spring and territorial call advertisement after breeding were positively related to the number of males within local populations. In turn, the intensity of vocal activity was associated with the likelihood of receiving immigrants, better explaining immigration than other kinds of social or public information. Because of depressed signalling, small local populations could experience reduced rescuing from others, thus compromising population persistence. In such cases, habitat management alone may not be enough to overcome this behavioural constraint. Because we found that the occurrence of inter-patch movements also depended on the size of nearby local populations, understanding regional processes may be as important as controlling social and environmental factors for the maintenance of small populations.

I examined vegetation and bird abundance at three locations within a highly fragmented Polylepis forest landscape in the Cordillera Vilcanota, southern Peru. Across the landscape, there was significant variation in the vegetation structure of Polylepis forest patches of different size categories, especially in terms of tree girth, tree height, tree density, and canopy vegetation structure. Principal Component Analysis extracted five factors of habitat quality, which together accounted for 74.2% of the variability within 15 habitat variables. Polylepis bird species differed in their responses to habitat quality but, overall, variation in Polylepis bird abundance was not fully captured by the range of habitat quality variables. Tall, dense vegetation cover was clearly important for 11 conservation-important species, a high density of large trees was important for 10 species and primary forest ground cover was important for eight species. Habitat quality exhibited no significant influence on the abundance of only one species - Asthenes urubambensis. The abundance of seven species was associated with lower elevation forest, but only one species was associated with higher elevation forest. Management of habitat quality in large and medium remnant forest patches throughout the Cordillera Vilcanota, particularly in the 3800-4200 m elevation range, will be a cornerstone in ensuring the persistence of the majority of conservation-important bird species populations.

During the 2001 and 2002 breeding seasons, we examined the relationship between bird communities and environmental variables, including vegetation characteristics and site prescribed-burn frequencies. across a habitat gradient in dry oak savannas in central Minnesota. The habitat gradient we studied went from: (1) prairie to (2) remnant oak savanna to (3) oak woodland undergoing savanna restoration via fire or mechanical removal of woody vegetation to (4) oak woodland. We conducted fixed-radius point Counts (n = 120) within habitats with either prairie groundcover or predominately oak canopy. We described canopy and groundcover characteristics at a sub-sample (n = 28) of non-prairie points. and collected canopy and woody species richness data and prescribed-burn frequencies over the past 20 years for all points. Observed bird communities were most strongly correlated with canopy cover and burn frequency and, to a lesser extent, attributes of the shrub component. Most savanna points had bird communities that were distinct from those found at oak woodland or oak woodland points undergoing restoration via burning. Savanna points similar to oak woodland points were in areas managed by periodic cutting rather than burning. Remnant savanna bird communities were more strongly associated with prescribed burning than those in other habitat types. but it appeared that most oak woodlands that had undergone 20 year's of prescribed burning remained ecologically distinct from remnant savannas. This suggests that some savannas that have converted to oak woodlands may exist in an alternative, or,table. ecological state even following extended restoration efforts.

Forty-seven bird species were recorded thirty-three at both invaded and uninvaded sites. Grassland/shrubland birds. Such as prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor). field sparrow (Spizella pusilla). red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), and eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus). were twice as frequent and three times as abundant at uninvaded sites. Native bird species characteristic of closed-canopy forest were more frequent and abundant at stations in invaded sites. Multivariate analyses indicate distinct associations of particular birds with unique combinations of vegetation characteristics that differed between invaded and uninvaded points.

The white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) is one of several specialised forest species whose populations have declined. Conservation management directed at this species' habitat has made it a de facto umbrella species for conservation of the biodiversity associated with forests rich in deciduous trees and dead wood. We assessed empirically the value of the white-backed woodpecker as an indicator and umbrella species in central Sweden. Occurrence of the woodpecker in breeding bird atlas squares (5 x 5 km(2)) indicated high species richness of forest birds, particularly species of special conservation concern, which included on average 13% more species in squares with than without the woodpecker. The number of red-listed cryptogam species expected to benefit from conservation actions directed at white-backed woodpecker habitats was higher in squares where the woodpecker bred compared to where is was absent. However, no such pattern was found for red-listed beetles, a group with very few records in the studied squares. White-backed woodpecker occurrence was positively associated with the current area of deciduous and mixed forest of high conservation value. Considering its indicator value, its specialised habitat requirements and its potential as a communication tool, using the white-backed woodpecker as an umbrella species may provide a coarse filter for the conservation of several other deciduous forest species. However, focusing solely on white-backed woodpecker habitat may not provide for the conservation of all such species, which stresses the need for a suite of complementary planning approaches.

Effects of patch-burn management on dickcissel nest success in a tallgrass prairie	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	dickcissel, grazing, logistic exposure, nest success, Oklahoma, patch-burn management, prescribed fire, Spiza americana, tallgrass prairie	BROWN-HEADED COWBIRDS, SPIZA-AMERICANA, HABITAT SELECTION, MOLOTHRUS-ATER, PARASITISM, ABUNDANCE, FIRE, CONSERVATION, DENSITY, KANSAS	Grassland birds have declined more than any other North American habitat-associated bird community. Because most species of grassland birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines, especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an alternative grassland management practice known as patch-burning has been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296 dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures. Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides further evidence that this practice can he a useful tool for grassland bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation, patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g., trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects of grazing, which are not available under traditional management. Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains.

LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND SPATIAL SCALE AFFECT SPACE USE BY SONGBIRDS IN NATURALLY PATCHY AND HARVESTED BOREAL FORESTS	CONDOR			English	Review	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	boreal forest, clearcut, home range, movement, songbird, territory	HOME-RANGE SIZE, KERNEL DENSITY ESTIMATORS, TERRITORY SIZE, BIRD ASSEMBLAGES, MALE OVENBIRDS, HABITAT USE, REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, PAIRING SUCCESS, NESTING SUCCESS, BREEDING BIRDS	Knowledge of how landscape structure influences patterns of animal space use is critical to developing sustainable landscape management practices. For breeding songbirds that defend a territory embedded within a larger home range, effects of structural change on movement may be manifested at multiple spatial scales. We used radio-telemetry to assess with in-territory and home range space use as functions of the proportion of clearcut-harvested versus naturally unforested land for two species of Neotropical migrant songbirds. We tested whether these relationships varied with spatial scale by assessing landscape structure in both the local neighborhood (115 m radius around an individual's territory center) and across the landscape (1250 in radius). Territory size for riparian-associated male Northern Waterthrushes (Seiurus noveboracensis) was curvilinearly related to the proportion of harvested versus naturally unforested land and varied by greater than two orders of magnitude. Waterthrush territories were largest in the most heavily harvested landscapes. Home range space use by male Blackpoll Warblers (Dendroica striata), which are habitat generalists, was influenced by the ratio of clearcuts to natural gaps in both the neighborhood and landscape. Blackpolls may modify their behavior as a result of anthropogenic processes acting at both small and larger spatial scales, but we observed considerable interannual variability. Our results suggest that boreal forest-breeding passerines may be capable of modifying their space use behavior in response to moderate levels of structural change caused by forestry.

One such regime is use of the selective herbicide Imazapyr (Arsenal Applicators Concentrate) and prescribed burning, which is permitted on CRP lands and cost share payments are available. This study quantified combined effects of Imazapyr and prescribed fire on the breeding season avian community characteristics and pine volume growth in thinned, midrotation afforested loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations in Mississippi. Herbicide treatments were applied in fall of 2002 and winter burns were conducted during winter and early spring of 2002-2003. ES bird species richness was significantly greater in the treated plots compared with controls for both 2003 and 2004. Ten individual species exhibited treatment effects. These responses by ES bird species indicate that midrotation UP plantations can provide needed ES habitat if treated with appropriate disturbance regimes.

We have limited knowledge about the effects of human activities on native species in these landscapes and which, if any, management practices might enhance the conservation of native biodiversity within them. Through a citizen volunteer bird-monitoring project, we compared bird abundance and species richness in northern Californian riparian zones surrounded by vineyards, urban areas, and natural areas. We assessed both local and landscape-level variables that may enhance native bird diversity in each land use type. We also demonstrate a new statistical approach, generalized estimating equations, to analyze highly variable data, such as that collected by volunteers. Avian abundance was highly correlated with both landscape context and local habitat variables, while avian richness was correlated with local habitat variables, specifically shrub richness, and percent of tree cover. In particular, shrub species richness has a strong positive correlation with riparian-preferring bird species. This suggests that active local management of riparian zones in human-dominated landscapes can increase our ability to retain native bird species in these areas.

Moths are species-rich in northeastern forests of North America. with the most diverse families being, Noctuidae and Geometridae. Individual trees and forest stands, however, are often dominated by few species. Climate, stand age. disturbance regime, and landscape heterogeneity are significant predictors of abundance of dominant species. Most other moth species ill the regional pool are patchily dominant and appear to occur regularly at very low abundance. Moth communities respond predictably to forest-management practices, and the outcomes of postmanagement response are largely drivelly changes in the plant community. Significant reductions in moth species richness and changes in Community composition are correlated With Clear-cut harvesting, whereas selective logging appears to cause more moderate changes in moth community Structure. Broad-scale effects of forest fragmentation on moth communities in unglaciated regions are best described by species replacement rather than species loss: moth species richness decreases slightly across a gradient of fragment sizes'. but shifts in moth community composition are more important, especially ill the relative importance of herbaceous-plant-feeding species ill large and small fragments.

Fuel-reduction treatments did not affect species richness or evenness, and effects on density of 5 commonly detected species varied among species. Populations of some species, such as the western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), increased following burning treatments, whereas others, such as the mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli), decreased in response to thinning treatments. Our results also identified a temporal response component, where avian community composition and structure changed synchronously on all treatments over time. Given the modest effects these small-scale fuel-reduction treatments had on avian composition and the specific density responses of particular species, our results suggest that land managers should consider implementing prescribed surface fire after thinning projects, where appropriate.

Bird community and abundance measures revealed that there was considerably variation in bird species richness, diversity and mean encounter rates between large, medium, and small forest patches. Densities of Polylepis-dependent bird species (including five globally-threatened and eight restricted-range species) were greater in larger forest patches and differed significantly between different patch size categories. Density estimates for matrix-dependent species were higher in smaller Polylepis patches indicating that the matrix exerts an influence on bird species composition and abundance in remnant Polylepis forests, particularly smaller patches. Comparison of lowland forest habitat specialists using three categories of rarity revealed that between 19-22% of all Polylepis-dependent species were intrinsically rare within larger forest patches, and a greater number (34-74%) were rare in smaller forest patches. Population estimates for all species, in particular for all threatened species, were extremely low, numbering <= 10 individuals at nine of the ten sites examined. The results suggest that declines in the densities of certain Polylepis birds may be predictable following habitat loss and that these patterns of rarity should govern population recovery goals through appropriate habitat restoration strategies. Such strategies are urgently required and must be designed to prevent further habitat loss, and to increase Polylepis habitat quantity to boost threatened bird populations in the Cordillera Vilcanota.

We analyzed data following a diversity/dominance approach that ranks the species in order of their abundance, to obtain rank/abundance diagrams ('Whittaker plots'). Although it is generally accepted that fire may induce structural changes in forest communities of breeding birds, we observed more evident effects when considering the assemblage of forest-specialist species. When considering the whole community of birds, ordinate intercepts of the regression between rank and relative abundance of species were not significantly different between unburnt and burnt plots in any of the three years of study. However, when considering only the forest-related species, there was a significant difference between unburnt and burnt plots in all the years of study. Evenness showed lower values that were explicited by the diversity/dominance diagrams (lower collocation of the curves of burnt pinewoods if compared to unburnt ones). Overall, the patterns observed in this study suggest that the effects of fire disturbance were more evident at the ecological level than at the taxonomic-level assemblages. The gradual decline of the more sensitive species due to fires and the proportional increase of edge/generalist species may induce a species turnover in burnt woods with cascade and relaxation effects which could be evidenced by diversity/dominance diagrams. Consequently, it is useful to separate the effects of fires at community-level and at assemblage-level when studying bird communities in areas subjected to fires.

One reason for limited effectiveness of AESs may be their application to small and scattered patches of land. This study presents the evaluation of a scheme adopted by the canton of Aargau, Switzerland, which seems to be unique in its consequent focus on entire farms, aiming at increasing quality and quantity of ecological compensated areas (ECAs). In vascular plants and snails, the species richness increased during a period of 5 years on plots with AES, but not on control plots without AES. In butterflies and birds, no significant differences were found between AES plots and control plots in the change of species richness over time. While butterfly species numbers generally decreased, bird species numbers increased on both AES plots and control plots. It appears that agri-environment schemes can be effective in protecting and promoting biodiversity, but the effect may depend on the group of organisms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, there is a remarkable lack of information on the impact of forestry on native biodiversity. We analyzed the effect of Pinus ponderosa plantations on bird communities, considering different stand management practices (dense and sparse tree covers), and different landscape contexts where they are planted (Austrocedrus chilensis forest and steppe). Ultimately we wished to assess in which way plantations may be designed and managed to improve biodiversity conservation. Bird richness and abundance did not change significantly in the steppe, although community composition did, and was partially replaced by a new community, similar to that of ecotonal forests. In contrast, in the A. chilensis forest areas, species richness decreased in dense plantations, but bird community composition remained relatively constant when replacing the native forest with pine plantations. Also, in A. chilensis forest, stand management practices aiming at maintaining low tree densities permit the presence of many bird species from the original habitat. In the steppe area in turn, both dense and sparse plantations are unsuitable for most steppe species, thus it is necessary to manage them at higher scales, maintaining the connectivity of the native matrix to prevent the fragmentation of bird populations. We conclude that pine plantations can provide habitat for a substantial number of native bird species, and this feature varies both with management practices and with the landscape context of areas where afforestation occurs.

We developed compositional, structural and functional indicators of biodiversity for five taxonomic groups-bryophytes, vascular plants, spiders, hoverflies and birds-using data from 44 Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) plantation forests in Ireland. The best structural biodiversity indicator was stand stage, defined using a multivariate classification of forest structure variables. However, biodiversity trends over the forest cycle and between tree species differ among the taxonomic groups studied. Canopy cover was the main structural indicator and affected other structural variables such as cover of lower vegetation layers. Other structural indicators included deadwood and distances to forest edge and to broadleaved woodland. Functional indicators included stand age, site environmental characteristics and management practices. Compositional indicators were limited to more easily identifiable plant and bird species. Our results suggest that the biodiversity of any one of the species groups we surveyed cannot act as a surrogate for all of the other species groups. However, certain subgroups, such as forest bryophytes and saproxylic hoverflies, may be able to act as surrogates for each other. The indicators we have identified should be used together to identify stands of potentially high biodiversity or to evaluate the biodiversity effects of silvicultural management practices. They are readily assessed by non-specialists, ecologically meaningful and applicable over a broad area with similar climate conditions and silvicultural systems. The approach we have used to develop biodiversity indicators, including stand structural types, is widely relevant and can enhance sustainable forest management of plantations.

The study was conducted within the context of two alternative vegetation management treatments applied to pastures on a tallgrass prairie site in northcentral Oklahoma from 2001 to 2003. The brown-headed cowbird, a brood parasite, and the grasshopper sparrow, a common grassland obligate species, were most abundant in areas managed under a traditional treatment in which entire pastures were annually burned. Conversely, Henslow's sparrow, a grassland obligate of conservation concern, was completely absent from traditional treatment pastures. Total bird species diversity and grassland obligate richness was highest in the patch-burn treatment, in which only discrete portions of each pasture were burned each year to create a mosaic of vegetation 'patches' in various stages of recovery from disturbance. Models of bird abundance reflected not only species-specific vegetation preferences, but also the often negative influence of structural features such as woody edges, roads, and ponds on breeding bird use of grasslands. Our study demonstrated that both disturbance-derived vegetation attributes and structural features contribute to heterogeneity and influence subsequent use by and composition of grassland bird communities.

Each silvicultural treatment was applied to two approximately 100aha units within each of three blocks. Prescribed burning was applied to one-half of each silvicultural treatment in a split-plot design. Occupancy was estimated at eight points in each plot for 11 bird species and three foraging guilds (bark gleaners, woodpeckers, and foliage gleaners). The frequencies of species detections on the point counts were used to estimate species richness on each plot. Occupancy did not differ among treatments for any of the guilds. Four of the 11 bird species, the American robin (Turdus migratorius L., 1766), the chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina (Bechstein, 1798)), the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis Latham, 1790), and the western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana (A. Wilson, 1811)), showed responses to the treatments. Species richness did not differ between the silvicultural or the burn treatments. The general lack of response of the bird community to the silvicultural and burn treatments is likely a result of the relatively large size of the trees and snags retained on both silvicultural treatments, the low intensity of the prescribed burns, and the lack of a strong contrast in tree density between the silvicultural treatments.

Factors influencing species richness and community composition of breeding birds in a desert riparian corridor	CONDOR			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	defection, mark-recapture, riparian, San Pedro River, species richness, species uniqueness	SAN-PEDRO RIVER, MIDDLE RIO-GRANDE, UNITED-STATES, COLORADO RIVER, NEW-MEXICO, VEGETATION, ARIZONA, BIODIVERSITY, DIVERSITY, CAPTURE	The San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona is one of the last free-flowing rivers in the southwestern United States that maintains significant stretches of perennial water. While critical for birds, this river is vulnerable to salt cedar (tamarisk, Tamarix spp.) invasion, woody encroachment into grassland, and alteration of hydrologic regime resulting from groundwater pumping. Bird species richness and community composition metrics provide a means to assess effects of management or conservation efforts. To estimate these metrics, we used methods that incorporated species detection probabilities from data collected at 160 points at 23 sites on the San Pedro River during 1998-2001. Species richness, co-occurrence, and uniqueness were estimated as a function of four riparian vegetation types (cottonwood-willow [Populus-Salix], salt cedar, mesquite [Prosopis spp], and grassland), three hydrologic regimes (perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral), and riparian location (floodplain and terrace). We found significantly higher species richness in cottonwood and mesquite compared with salt cedar and grassland. Intermittent and perennial flow sites had higher species richness compared with ephemeral. Cottonwood and mesquite supported more unique species compared with grassland and salt cedar, and cottonwood or perennial sites supported canopy or water-dependent species, for which habitat is rare on the landscape. Within the intermittent class, salt cedar maintained all estimated 0-2 unique species compared with native woody vegetation types, while cottonwood and mesquite contributed all estimated 20-21 unique species compared with salt cedar. Thus, while maintaining relatively high species richness, salt cedar contributed little to regional avian diversity compared with native woody riparian vegetation. This research has important implications for regional conservation planning and riparian restoration efforts.

Associations among breeding birds and Gambel oak in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	avian species richness, black-headed grosbeak, breeding birds, Gambel oak, habitat, ponderosa pine, red-faced warbler, Virginia's warbler, yellow-rumped warbler	HABITAT, ARIZONA, USA	Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests with Cambel oak Quercus gambelii) are associated with higher bird abundance and diversity than are ponderosa pine forests lacking Gambel oak. Little is known, however, about specific structural characteristics of Gambel oak trees, clumps, and stands that may be important to birds in ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (hereafter pine-oak) forests. We examined associations among breeding birds and structural characteristics of Gambel oak at a scale similar in size to individual bird territories in pine-oak forests in northern Arizona and western New Mexico, USA. Avian species richness and occurrence of some bird species were associated with specific growth forms of Gambel oak. Estimated probability of Virginia's warblers (Vermivora virginiae), black-headed grosbeaks (Pheucticus melanocephalus), and red-faced warblers (Cardellina rubrifrons) occurring at points increased with increasing density of pole-sized Gambel oak 715 cm in diameter at breast height. We also found evidence that large Gambel oak trees (>= 23 cm dbh) were associated with increased occurrence of yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata) at points. Some avian associations with oak were influenced by characteristics of ponderosa pines. For example, bird species richness was positively associated with the abundance of large Gambel oak when density of large pine trees >= 23 cm in diameter at breast height was low. Because large oak trees are rare and their numbers are thought to be declining, efforts should be made to retain and promote growth of additional oaks in this size class. Forest management practices that maintain forest openings, such as prescribed burning, could promote growth of pole-sized Gambel oak, which appears important to some bird species in pine-oak forests.

Canopy height, total foliage cover, tree density, total basal area of tree, total basal area of snags, foliage height diversity, and tree species richness all increased with successional age. However, shrub cover peaked in intermediate successional stages. The vertical profile of foliage cover was more diverse in later successional forests, which had more breeding bird species and ecological guilds. All the breeding bird species recorded in early and intermediate stages were also found distributed in the late successional forests. Because Taiwan has high precipitation and humidity, and most forest fires in Taiwan are caused by human activities, forest fires and large areas of early successional vegetation were probably rare in the mountain areas of Taiwan prior to the arrival of humans. Therefore, bird species have not had enough time to adapt to areas with early or intermediate successional vegetation. Moreover, late successional forests host all the major plant species found in the early and intermediate stages and have higher foliage height diversity index, which was positively correlated with the bird species richness and bird species diversity index in this study. As a result, all breeding bird species and guilds in the area can be found in late successional forests. Efforts for conserving avian diversity in Taiwan should focus on protecting the remaining native old-growth forests. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The increased spatial extent of commercial timber harvesting is modifying forest structure across the land base and may thus compromise the availability of large trees at the landscape scale. In this study, our objectives were to (1) characterize the availability of large living and dead trees in old-growth stands dominated by different tree species and surficial deposits that encompass the range of natural cover types of eastern Quebec's boreal forest; (2) analyze the distribution of trees among decay-classes; and (3) compare the availability of large trees in unharvested, remnant, and harvested stands for the entire range of decay-classes. A total of 116 line transects were distributed across unharvested forests, remnant linear forests, and cutblocks in cutover areas. Unharvested forest stands (black spruce [Picea mariana], balsam fir [Abies balsamea]-black spruce, balsam fir-white spruce [Picea glauca] and balsam fir) reflected a gradient of balsam fir dominance. The remnant forests selected were isolated for 5-15 years. Analyses were performed at two diameter cut-off values. Trees with DBH > 20 cm were considered for availability of total trees whereas trees with DBH > 30 cm were considered for availability of large trees. Forest stands comprised high proportions of standing dead trees (33% of all stems, 8% were large dead stems). Availability of total and large standing trees increased with the dominance of balsam fir in stands. Forest stands located on thick surficial deposits showed higher densities of large dead trees for every stand type suggesting a higher productivity on those sites. Availability of stems according to decay-classes showed a dome-shaped distribution with higher densities of snags in intermediate decay stages. However, for large stems, black spruce stands showed a significantly lower availability that was consistent across all decay-classes. In linear remnant forests, pure balsam fir stands were absent. Remnant stands thus showed a much lower availability in large trees when compared with unharvested balsam fir stands. Clearcuts had the lowest densities of dead trees across sampled stands. Current even-aged management practices clearly affect availability and recruitment of large trees, therefore forest-dwelling wildlife relying on these structures for breeding is likely to be affected by large-scale harvesting in coniferous boreal forests.

Here, we evaluate the effects of vegetation cover, conspecific and heterospecific densities, and distance to the nearest neighbor on territory size, shape, and overlap in insectivorous birds. We studied these effects along a gradient of postfire habitat regeneration in which foliage cover and densities of focal species varied several-fold. We delineate 197 territories (minimum convex polygons) of the shrub-dwelling Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) and 255 of the syntopic Sardinian (Sylvia melanocephala), subalpine (Sylvia cantillans) and melodious (Hippolais polyglotta) warblers at three plots in NE Catalonia (Spain and France) in 1987-2005. After accounting for the effect of the number of locations used to delineate polygons, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) showed a reduction in territory area of the Dartford warbler as conspecific density increased and distance to nearest neighbor decreased, in accordance with the contender pressure hypothesis for territory size regulation. Heterospecific density was not included in the final model of territory size and the effect of habitat structure was marginal. Territory roundness was positively correlated with its size and with conspecific density, probably in relation to energetic constraints, and negatively with heterospecific density. Territorial exclusion was almost complete among Dartford warblers, whereas interspecific territory overlap was extensive and tended to increase with heterospecific density and with structural diversity along the gradient. Our results support the hypothesis that Mediterranean warbler coexistence derives from ecological segregation and not from interspecific territoriality.

However, the role of such features in habitat selection and demography of individual species has not been established. Understanding the mechanisms of habitat selection requires both experimental manipulation of habitat structure and detailed estimation of the behavioral and demographic response of animals, e. g., changes in movement patterns and survival probabilities. Such studies have not been conducted in natural tropical forest, perhaps because of high habitat heterogeneity, high species diversity, and low abundances of potential target species. Agroforestry systems support a less diverse. ora, with greater spatial homogeneity which, in turn, harbors lower overall species diversity with greater numerical dominance of common species, than natural forests. Furthermore, agroforestry systems are already extensively managed and lend themselves easily to larger scale habitat manipulations than protected natural forest. Thus, agroforestry systems provide a good model environment for beginning to understand processes underlying habitat selection in tropical forest animals. Here, we use multistate, capture-recapture models to investigate how the experimental removal of epiphytes affected monthly movement and survival probabilities of two resident bird species (Common Bush-Tanager [Chlorospingus ophthalmicus] and Golden-crowned Warbler [Basileuterus culicivorus]) in a Mexican shade coffee plantation. We established two paired plots of epiphyte removal and control. We found that Bush-Tanagers were at least five times more likely to emigrate from plots where epiphytes were removed compared to control plots. Habitat-specific movement patterns were not detected in the warbler. However, unlike the Golden-crowned Warbler, Common Bush-Tanagers depend upon epiphytes for nest sites and (seasonally) for foraging. These dispersal patterns imply that active habitat selection based on the presence or absence of epiphytes occurs in C. ophthalmicus on our study area. Survival rates did not vary with habitat in either species. Interestingly, in both species, survival was higher in the nonbreeding season, when birds were in mixed-species flocks.

Waterbird response to wetlands restored through the conservation reserve enhancement program	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, Farm Bill, Illinois, restoration, waterbirds, waterfowl, wetlands	PRAIRIE POTHOLE REGION, FLORISTIC QUALITY, BREEDING WATERFOWL, BASIN WETLANDS, SOUTH-DAKOTA, NORTH-DAKOTA, LANDSCAPE, DUCK, HABITAT, MARSH	Conservation programs that facilitate restoration of natural areas on private land are one of the best strategies for recovery of valuable wetland acreage in critical ecoregions of the United States. Wetlands enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) provide many ecological functions but may be particularly important as habitat for migrant and resident waterbirds; however, use of, and factors associated with use of, CREP wetlands as stopover and breeding sites have not been evaluated. We surveyed a random sample of CREP wetlands in the Illinois River watershed in 2004 and 2005 to quantify use of restored wetlands by spring migrating and breeding waterbirds. Waterbirds used 75% of wetlands during spring migration. Total use-day abundance for the entire spring migration ranged from 0 to 49,633 per wetland and averaged 6,437 +/- 1,887 (SE). Semipermanent wetlands supported the greatest total number of use-days and the greatest number of use-days relative to wetland area. Species richness ranged from 0 to 42 ((x) over bar = 10.0 +/- 1.5 [SE]), and 5 of these species were classified as endangered in Illinois. Density of waterfowl breeding pairs ranged from 0.0 pairs/ha to 16.6 pairs/ha ((x) over bar = 1.9 +/- 0.5 [SE] pairs/ha), and 16 species of wetland birds were identified as local breeders. Density of waterfowl broods ranged from 0.0 broods/ha to 3.6 broods/ha and averaged 0.5 +/- 0.1 (SE) broods/ha. We also modeled spring stopover use, waterbird species richness, and waterfowl reproduction in relation to spatial, physical, and floristic characteristics of CREP wetlands. The best approximating models to explain variation in all 3 dependent variables included only the covariate accounting for level of hydrologic management (i.e., none, passive, or active). Active management was associated with 858% greater use-days during spring than sites with only passive water management. Sites where hydrology was passively managed also averaged 402% greater species richness than sites where no hydrologic management was possible. Density of waterfowl broods was 120% greater on passively managed sites than on sites without water management but was 29% less on sites with active compared to passive hydrologic management. Densities of waterfowl broods also were greatest when ratios of open water to cover were 70:30. Models that accounted for vegetation quality and landscape variables ranked lower than models based solely on hydrologic management or vegetation cover in all candidate sets. Although placement and clustering of sites may be critical for maintaining populations of some wetland bird species, these factors appeared to be less important for attracting migrant waterbirds in our study area. In the context of restored CREP wetlands, we suggest the greatest gains in waterbird use and reproduction may be accomplished by emphasizing site-specific restoration efforts related to hydrology and floristic structure.

Distribution and abundance of birds and their habitats within the lowland farmland of Britain in winter	BIRD STUDY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology		FIELD USE, VANELLUS-VANELLUS, FOOD RESOURCES, LAND, GRASSLAND, ENGLAND, CLASSIFICATION, PASSERINES, MANAGEMENT, CROPS	Capsule Farmland bird species occurred at low densities and were highly aggregated in a small proportion of available pastures, stubble fields and farmyards.Aim To document the current distribution and abundance of farmland birds and their habitats within the lowland farmland of Britain in winter.Methods Over three winters volunteer observers visited a stratified random sample of 1090 1-km squares within which they counted a suite of 30 farmland bird species and mapped agricultural habitats.Results For individual species, less than 10% of habitat patches were occupied and densities in occupied patches were low. Several differences were apparent in patterns of relative abundance compared to the 1980s. In particular marked declines of Tree Sparrow and Corn Bunting were apparent. The national distribution of cereal stubbles was localized. A large proportion of most species was found in grassland. Positive associations at the patch scale were apparent for improved grassland by invertebrate feeders and cereal and maize stubbles and farmyards, mostly by granivores.Conclusion Many farmland passerines are highly aggregated, even within particularly favoured field types. These results are consistent with winter food resources being highly localized and the need to create more food-rich patches if declines are to be reversed.

Rethinking avian response to Tamarix on the lower Colorado River: A threshold hypothesis	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	birds, habitat restoration, invasive species, lower Colorado River in Arizona, riparian habitat, Tamarix	RIPARIAN VEGETATION, HABITAT SELECTION, NORTH-AMERICA, UNITED-STATES, COMMUNITY, BIRDS, ECOSYSTEMS, PATTERNS, WATER, BIODIVERSITY	Many of the world's large river systems have been greatly altered in the past century due to river regulation, agriculture, and invasion of introduced Tamarix spp. (saltcedar, tamarisk). These riverine ecosystems are known to provide important habitat for avian communities, but information on responses of birds to differing levels of Tamarix is not known. Past research on birds along the Colorado River has shown that avian abundance in general is greater in native than in non-native habitat. In this article, we address habitat restoration on the lower Colorado River by comparing abundance and diversity of avian communities at a matrix of different amounts of native and non-native habitats at National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona. Two major patterns emerged from this study: (1) Not all bird species responded to Tamarix in a similar fashion, and for many bird species, abundance was highest at intermediate Tamarix levels (40-60%), suggesting a response threshold. (2) In Tamarix-dominated habitats, the greatest increase in bird abundance occurred when small amounts of native vegetation were present as a component of that habitat. In fact, Tamarix was the best vegetation predictor of avian abundance when compared to vegetation density and canopy cover. Our results suggest that to positively benefit avian abundance and diversity, one cost-effective way to rehabilitate larger monoculture Tamarix stands would be to add relatively low levels of native vegetation (similar to 20-40%) within homogenous Tamarix habitat. In addition, this could be much more cost effective and feasible than attempting to replace all Tamarix with native vegetation.

Winter and early spring bird communities in grasslands, shrubsteppe, and juniper woodlands in central Oregon	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	avian communities, Artemisia, juniper encroachment, old-growth	OCCIDENTALIS WESTERN JUNIPER, SAGEBRUSH-STEPPE, VEGETATION STRUCTURE, SPECIES-DIVERSITY, HISTORY, FIRE, ESTABLISHMENT, ENCROACHMENT, EXPANSION, HABITATS	We compared winter (December, January, and February),and early spring (March and April) bird communities among 4 successional stages that included grassland, shrubsteppe, juniper-shrubsteppe, and old-growth juniper woodland in central Oregon. Birds were surveyed monthly from December through April in 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 using the point count method to estimate relative abundance of birds (individuals.transect(-1)year(-1)). We used distance sampling to correct for potential bias in estimating abundance and density among successional stages. A total of 4513 birds (32 species) were detected. Relative abundance of total birds (all species combined) was similar in the juniper-shrubsteppe and old-growth woodland (48.7 and 48.9 individuals.transect(-1), respectively) but 6 times greater than in the grassland and shrubsteppe (8.0 and 7.7 individuals.transect(-1), respectively) during the 5-month period. Total density of birds was greater in old-growth juniper woodland and juniper shrubsteppe than in grassland or shrubsteppe. However, median bird species richness in 1998/1999 was highest in grassland and lowest both in shrubsteppe and juniper-shrubsteppe, and in 1999/2000 it was highest in shrubsteppe and lowest in juniper-shrubsteppe and oldgrowth juniper woodland. American Robins and Townsend's Solitaires were the most abundant species in juniper-shrubsteppe and old-growth juniper woodland during the winter months. Sage Sparrows and Horned Larks were the most abundant species in shrubsteppe during winter, and Horned Larks were most abundant in grasslands during the early spring transition period prior to nesting. Our results indicate that a different suite of species use these successional stages during the nonbreeding season. If avifauna conservation is a part of long-term management goals, a broad range of successional stages Should be maintained on the landscape to provide habitat for it variety of avian species throughout the year.

Bird community responses to reduced-impact logging in a certified forestry concession in lowland Bolivia	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	Ficus boliviana, insectivores, falcons, frugivores, toucans, guild, population	CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS, TROPICAL FOREST, AMAZONIAN FORESTS, RAIN-FOREST, NATURAL REGENERATION, INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS, UNDERSTORY BIRDS, ATLANTIC FOREST, GAPS, DIVERSITY	We studied bird community composition and abundance within the logged and unlogged forest areas of a certified forestry concession in lowland Bolivia. The logged forest was harvested using reduced-impact logging techniques between one and four years previously We used canonical correspondence analysis to describe the relationship between selected environmental variables and bird species abundance data, and the indicator Value procedure to test for associations between bird species and the logged and unlogged habitats. Approximately one-third of birds were restricted to either the logged or unlogged areas, with 20% of all species only encountered in, or significantly more abundant in, the unlogged areas of the concession. The majority of birds found in significantly higher abundance in the unlogged areas of the concession were associated with forest habitats dominated by large trees, or a high diversity of trees, providing dense canopy cover and deep leaf litter, with an understorey dominated by ferns. Over 40% of bird species that were significantly associated with the unlogged areas of the concession are of conservation concern. In contrast, the majority of birds associated with the logged areas of the concession are known to be relatively resilient to human disturbance. The majority of species which exhibited significant lower abundances in the logged areas of the concession belonged to insectivorous or frugivorous feeding guilds. We discuss whether current management practices within this certified concession are sustainable and how our results can be used to guide future research and inform better practice.

Habitat destruction and fragmentation have led to precipitous declines in a number of species of concern. For these species, traditional models that group individuals into age or stage cohorts may not accurately capture the stochasticity associated with small populations. Additionally, traditional models do not explicitly incorporate landscape-level structure, which becomes increasingly important at small population sizes. Thus, for declining species, spatially explicit individual-based models (SEIBM) can be used to understand both population demography and the impacts of habitat destruction, and to guide management practices to increase the chances of species survival.2. To gauge the impacts of changes in habitat and also demographic rates on a US endangered species, we constructed an SEIBM for the Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis Howell) of the South Florida Everglades. The model simulates temporal and spatial dynamics of individual sparrows using local GIS-based topography, vegetation and hydrology along with behavioural and demographic rates derived from field studies.3. When adult mortality and, to a lesser extent, juvenile mortality were increased in model simulations, there was an increase in extinction risk and a decrease in population size, whereas changes in number of clutches or female mating range had little impact. In contrast to the effects of simulating changes in mortality rates, simulated landscape-level changes (increasing water levels or decreasing habitat availability) were associated with dramatic population declines and increases in extinction risk. The sparrow appears to be particularly sensitive to the loss of higher-elevation breeding habitat. These results highlight the importance of proper water- and land-use management in assuring the species' survival.4. Synthesis and applications. Although changes in demographic rates affect population growth and are often the focus of conservation efforts, changes in habitat structure can also dramatically alter population viability. When both landscape-level and demographic data are available, spatially explicit models are particularly advantageous. Not only do they allow researchers and resource managers to prioritize areas for habitat restoration and species management, but they can also be used to help focus future research efforts.

Restoration of wet features for breeding waders on lowland grassland	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	agriculture, agri-environment schemes, conservation, habitat management, lapwing, shorebirds, wetlands	LAPWINGS VANELLUS-VANELLUS, AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES, COASTAL GRAZING MARSHES, PLOVER PLUVIALIS-APRICARIA, SNIPE GALLINAGO-GALLINAGO, BIRD POPULATIONS, HABITAT SELECTION, FOOD RESOURCES, CLIMATE-CHANGE, SWARD HEIGHT	1. Over the last century, the loss of around half of the world's wetlands, principally through drainage and conversion to agriculture, has been one of the main drivers of declines in breeding waders. Across Europe, nature reserves have been effective conservation islands for breeding waders, but management of the wider countryside is needed for more wide-scale population recovery. This is likely to require the restoration of wet features, but in a manner which is compatible with farming operations.2. Here we explore the extent to which three types of wet feature influence the distribution of breeding lapwings Vanellus vanellus and their chicks on grassland. Footdrains are shallow channels used historically for drainage, but which can also be created and managed for water retention and cause little disruption to farming activities. Footdrain floods are areas where water overtops footdrains. Isolated pools are unmanaged areas of surface water resulting from rainfall or high water tables.3. We selected 70 fields on nine sites which spanned the range of wet feature type and cover in early April. By May, only around 10% of the water within isolated pools remained, whereas 30-40% water was maintained in footdrains into June.4. Fields with high footdrain flood densities attracted significantly higher densities of nesting lapwing and nests were more likely to be within 50 m of footdrain floods. Later in the season, footdrains were the primary remaining water source, and chick field use increased significantly with footdrain density. Chicks were also more likely to forage nearer footdrain floods in areas of wet mud created by receding water levels.5. Synthesis and applications. Areas of shallow, small-scale flooding are of critical importance for breeding waders. Management tools such as footdrains, coupled with appropriate hydrological management, provide a means of retaining water throughout the breeding season. Installation of these features is relatively simple, but maintaining sufficient water levels within the system is critical, especially in the face of increasingly unpredictable water supplies associated with climate change. Such management tools offer a solution that may be both effective at improving breeding wader populations and practicable for commercial grazing marsh management.

Using conservation value to assess land restoration and management alternatives across a degraded oak savanna landscape	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	bird communities, conservation index, conservation planning, conservation trade-offs, Indiana Dunes, national parks, Partners in Flight, restoration goal-setting, species diversity	BIRD COMMUNITIES, UNITED-STATES, HABITAT USE, FIRE, DIVERSITY, DENSITY, AREAS, WOODLANDS, INDICATOR, PARTNERS	1. Managers considering restoration of landscapes often face a fundamental challenge - what should be the habitat composition of the restored landscape? We present a method for evaluating an important conservation trade-off inherent in making that decision.2. Oak savannas and grasslands were historically widespread across central North America but are now rare. Today, in north-west Indiana, USA, habitats spanning a range of woody vegetation density, from nearly treeless open habitats to forests, occur across the conserved landscape where savannas probably once dominated. To understand the benefits of different potential landscape compositions, we evaluated how different proportions of five habitats - open, savanna, woodland, scrub and forest - might affect the conservation value of the north-west Indiana landscape for birds. Two variables of potential conservation importance were examined: species diversity, a measure of avian community richness, and conservation index, the percentage of a bird species' global population occurring on a hectare of landscape, summed across all bird species present. Higher values of conservation index were associated with higher local densities of globally more rare and more threatened species.3. Conservation index and species diversity were correlated negatively across hypothetical landscapes composed of different proportions of the five habitats. Therefore, a management trade-off existed between conservation index and species diversity because landscapes that maximized species diversity differed from landscapes that maximized conservation index.4. A landscape of 50% open, 22% savanna, 15% scrub and 13% forest was predicted to represent a compromise at which conservation index and species diversity reached the same percentage of their maxima. In contrast, the current landscape is dominated by forest.5. Synthesis and applications. We quantified the trade-off between two potential aspects of a landscape's conservation value for birds - the landscape's ability to promote avian species diversity and the landscape's use by threatened avian species. This quantification allowed us to evaluate the ability of different landscape compositions to achieve preferable trade-off compromises, such as maximizing diversity for a given level of landscape use by threatened species. Managers can use these trade-off results to determine which landscape compositions are associated with particular conservation and management priorities.

Our objectives were to examine nesting densities, reproductive parameters, and species-specific habitat selection of woodpeckers in a recently burned region of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, between 2001 and 2004. Postfire nesting densities were greatest in areas dominated by high prefire canopy cover, and reproductive success averaged >70%. For some species of woodpeckers, factors such as diameter at breast height, burn severity, and distance to unburned patches were important for nest-site selection. Our data indicated that nesting densities of many woodpeckers in the Black Hills were lower than what has been recorded elsewhere following recent, large wildfires in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests.

Pesticide treatments affect mountain pine beetle abundance and woodpecker foraging behavior	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	arsenic, bark beetles, Dendroctonus ponderosae, forestry, monosodium methanearsonate, mountain pine beetle, pesticides, Picoides spp., woodpeckers	TREATED LODGEPOLE PINES, SPRUCE BEETLES, BARK BEETLES, MONOSODIUM METHANEARSONATE, COLEOPTERA-SCOLYTIDAE, TRAP TREES, MORTALITY, FOREST, PREDATORS, COLORADO	In British Columbia, Canada, management efforts used to control mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks have included treatment of infested trees with an organic arsenic pesticide, monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA). Cumulative pesticide applications over a large geographic-area have generated concerns about arsenic loading in the environment and potential toxicity to nontarget wildlife. We investigated woodpecker foraging patterns in infested stands with and without MSMA treatment using a combination of tree debarking indices, point count surveys, and radiotelemetry methods in addition to insect flight traps to measure mountain pine beetle emergence. Debarking indices indicated woodpecker foraging of MSMA-treated trees was significantly lower than nontreated trees in all sampling years. However, similar to 40% of MSMA trees had some evidence of foraging. Focal observations of foraging woodpeckers and point count surveys in MSMA treatment areas further confirmed that several species of woodpeckers regularly used MSMA stands during the breeding season. Radio-tagged Hairy (Picoides villosus) and Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) Woodpeckers spent on average 13% and 23% (range 0-66%) of their time, respectively, in treated stands, despite the fact that these areas only comprised on average I2% of their core home range ( 1 km(2)). MSMA strongly reduced the emergence of several bark beetle (Coleoptera, Scolytidae) species including the mountain pine beetle, and there was a highly significant positive relationship between Dendroctonus beetle abundance and Three-toed Woodpecker abundance. This study identifies the potential negative impact that forest management practices using pesticides can have on woodpecker populations that depend on bark beetles and their host trees.

Anthropogenic and environmental determinants of Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus breeding numbers and productivity in the Camargue (Rhone delta, southern France)	IBIS			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	chick condition, Mediterranean climate, NAO, North Atlantic Oscillation	NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION, CLIMATE-CHANGE, POPULATION-DYNAMICS, MEDITERRANEAN SEA, BLACK KITES, LONG-TERM, IMPACT, CONSEQUENCES, TEMPERATURES, VARIABILITY	Predicting how bird populations may respond to climate change is a major challenge which could be addressed by understanding how past environmental processes have driven the variations of breeding population size and productivity. In inhabited regions, this issue may be complicated by the interference associated with heterogeneous levels of habitat management. Here, we have explored how several hydrological variables influenced the breeding of the Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus in the Camargue (Rhone delta, southern France) over a 28-year period (1974-2001). In this region, Flamingos breed in a commercial salt pan. They forage in both salt pans and adjacent brackish lagoons. We hypothesized that breeding numbers, productivity and body condition of chicks at fledging were influenced positively by water levels of the Vaccares, the main lagoon of the delta, in spring (water and food availability) and the Rhone discharge in winter (nutrient availability in the salt pans). We controlled for variations of the flooding date of the breeding salt pan by the salt company and the size of the breeding island. We first found the Vaccares water levels and Rhone discharge to be negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Secondly, the number of Flamingo breeding pairs (range 3560-22 200) increased by 1767 +/- 1418 (95% CI) with a 10-day advance of the flooding date of the breeding salt pan and by 1146 +/- 1081 per 10-cm water level rise in the Vaccares. Productivity was 0.46 +/- 0.41 chicks per pair and could not be explained by any of the variables considered. Finally, chick body condition decreased with the number of breeding pairs and Rhone discharge. Our results show that (1) this intensely managed system remains sensitive to large-scale climate variations, (2) the breeding of the Greater Flamingo is affected by both climate variations and management of the salt pan, and (3) the expected enhancement of delta productivity by high river discharge was absent, probably prevented by dykes and embankments along the river. The response of bird populations to climate variations can thus be complex in intensely managed biological systems as found in the Mediterranean. We encourage pursuing such analyses incorporating anthropogenic variables explicitly in order to expand our capacity to make inference on the future of these systems.

In this 4-year experimental field study, the predatory Gamasina mite diversity was estimated in plots where the feather moss layer was removed or disturbed by turning over, in relation to that in control plots. Species richness, Shannon's diversity and equilabitity in spring but not autumn were decreased when the feather moss layer was removed.

Five weeks after the fire we surveyed 12 sites (six burnt, six unburnt); each pair of sites was closely matched for soil type and vegetation. The species richness and abundance of mammals and reptiles was greater at unburnt sites, especially for mammals (with a 4-fold difference in abundance between burnt and unburnt sites). There was an indication that reptiles immigrated into unburnt patches, but mammals did not. There were also species-specific responses to the fire: Rattus tunneyi and Pseudomys nanus were much more abundant in unburnt sites, whereas Pseudomys delicatulus was caught in equal numbers at burnt and unburnt sites. Diurnal reptiles were more abundant at unburnt sites, but nocturnal reptiles were equally common at burnt and unburnt sites. Avian species richness and overall abundance was similar between burnt and unburnt patches, although a few species showed preferences for one state or the other. The overall high trapping success for mammals (18% across all sites; 28% in unburnt patches) contrasts with the well documented mammal collapse in parts of northern Australia and seems paradoxical given that our study area has experienced the same increase in fire frequency and extent that is often blamed for species collapse. However, our study area has fewer pressures from other sources, including grazing by large herbivores, suggesting that the effects of these pressures, and their interaction with fire, may have been underestimated in previous studies.

Breeding birds in hemiboreal clear-cuts: tree-retention effects in relation to site type	FORESTRY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences		BOREAL FORESTS, NATURAL DISTURBANCE, SPECIES-DIVERSITY, COMMUNITIES, MANAGEMENT, RESPONSES, FIRE, FENNOSCANDIA, SUCCESSION, HABITAT	The variability of natural disturbance regimes implies that retention cutting, aimed at emulating natural disturbances to support biodiversity, should be forest-type specific. We explored in four site types (ranging from dry nutrient-poor to wet nutrient-rich) in Estonia how the retention of live and dead trees affects post-cut abundance and species richness of birds. The whole bird communities and harvest-sensitive species groups responded differently: while the total abundance and relative species richness of birds increased along with the abundance of dead trees, the species of national conservation concern occurred more frequently at higher densities of live trees. Hence, although the species of conservation concern and hole-nesters preferred the cuts having the generally densest and most species-rich avian communities, this co-variation was obviously insufficient for using the total community characteristics (particularly density) as indicators of forestry impacts on bird biodiversity. In contrast to expectations, tree retention always influenced birds independently of forest type. This may be related to the particular study system (notably low retention levels) but future studies should nevertheless explicitly address to what extent forest species are adapted to natural disturbances, and in which cases that knowledge can be used for forestry planning.

Using published data, we modelled the global and regional impact of abandonment and wildfires on 554 species of terrestrial vertebrates occurring in Mediterranean Europe. For all groups except amphibians, open habitats or farmland sustained higher species richness. Open habitats showed regional differences in their conservation value, western areas being particularly important for birds and amphibians and eastern areas for reptiles. Scrublands hosted fewer species than open habitats, farmland and forest, but sustained several endemic birds and mammals. The greater species richness of forests was mostly due to species widespread in Europe. Wildfires promote scrubland expansion in detriment of forest; because more species are associated to eastern forests, fire is predicted to affect more seriously this region. Scrubland conservation value was found to be highest in the west, where fire might have a positive impact. Fire regime, however, plays a crucial role. Although large fires have a negative impact, small-scale fires may favour biodiversity in abandoned areas. Due to the intrinsic difficulty in managing abandoned land to preserve the original Mediterranean vertebrate diversity, the best option to achieve this goal is the development of policies designed to make farmers and traditional farmland survive.

Restoration treatments were designed to create stand structure and composition similar to pre-settlement forests, which were influenced by a frequent fire regime. Overall, avian community composition was changed as a result of the treatments. Cassin's Finch, Chipping Sparrow, and Yellow-rumped Warbler were found at higher densities in treated stands, whereas Mountain Chickadee, Western Tanager, and Red-breasted Nuthatch had higher densities in untreated stands. White-headed Woodpecker and Western Bluebird were only detected in the treated stands. Brown-headed Cowbird showed no response to treatments. We detected changes in the density of four of five foraging guilds in response to restoration treatments. Tree seedeaters, low understory and ground insectivores, and aerial insectivores all increased in density in treated stands. Overall, bark insectivores showed no density response to treatments. Tree foliage insectivore density was lower in treated than in untreated stands. Overall avian density, density of neotropical migrants, and density of some focal species were higher in treated stands. Monitoring should be continued to understand the longer-term (5-10 year) responses of land birds and to guide future forest restoration efforts.

Ants were sampled using pitfall traps in 6 sites for the elevation study and in 2 sites for the tree cover study, representing paired burn and control sites in a ran domized block design. Vegetation and ground cover variables were also sampled to determine how variation in ant populations was correlated with differences in vegetation and ground cover. Ant species richness remained unchanged for all treatments. Tree cover had no significant effect on ant populations. Significantly more ants were trapped after the burn treatment on burn plots. Variation in ant populations was not directly correlated with any of the vegetation or ground cover variables. According to ANOVA and multivariate analyses, elevation had the greatest effect on changes in ant communities, likely due to increased moisture availability Our results suggest that management for conservation of sagebrush-steppe ecosystems in this and similar watersheds should include a range of elevations to ensure maximum ant species diversity.

These species are now common in upland sites as a result of past land use and disruption of fire regimes. We investigated the effect this invasion had on breeding bird diversity in upland mixed pine (Pinus spp.) stands based on 90 point counts conducted in spring 2005. Half of these stands had no water oak or sweetgum (open stands) and half had a minimum of 25% of their basal area as water oak and/or sweetgum (invaded stands). Bird species richness and abundance were 42 and 41 % lower, respectively, in invaded stands. Thirty-five bird species had more than 20 records and were tested for an association with invaded stands. No species were positively associated with invaded stands while 10 were negatively associated with invaded stands; these were mostly grassland pine savanna and shrubland bird species of high conservation value. Invasion of upland pine forest by these native tree species is similar to invasion by exotic species, and appears to disrupt ecosystem function causing declines in bird diversity.

We applied bootstrap procedures to evaluate whether the observed data were true or just produced by chance, and then examined the emerging patterns at three levels: community, guild and species levels. At the community level, fire acted on breeding bird communities by altering especially the total abundance patterns: the species abundance decreased in the burnt pinewood compared to the residual one, but other parameters were not significantly affected by fire. As a consequence of fire, the destruction and structural simplification of the canopy and shrubby component, as well as the increase of edge habitat and patchiness at landscape scale, induced a turnover in species between pinewoods. Species turnover was higher at the burnt than at the residual pinewoods, during all the 3 years of study. At the guild level, the forest species decreased strongly in terms of richness and abundance in the burnt pinewoods, contrary to the edge and open habitat species which increased in terms of richness, abundance and evenness. Edge species showed the highest turnover in burnt pinewood during the whole period of study. At species level, after an a priori subdivision (based on bibliographic search) of the various species in two ecological guilds (forest versus edge species), it was found that an a posteriori statistical analysis confirmed the expected trend, i.e. that the species which decreased significantly in burnt pinewood were essentially the forest species, whereas the species which increased were essentially the edge/open habitat ones. Overall, in order to investigate the effects of fire catastrophes on birds, the guild approach seems more exhaustive than the taxonomic community approach, where intrinsic confounding trends are present.

Accordingly, it is necessary to work out methodological approaches for the assessment of biodiversity in forests. In the study presented here, we focus on the total plant species pool (563 vascular plant and bryophyte species) of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests in NE Germany to identify indicators for plant species richness. We distinguished several groups like "herb", "grass-like", "woody", "endangered", and "exotic species", for which we detected indicators for low (class #1), intermediate (class #2), and high (class #3) species numbers. From a total of 84 species, which were identified by a three-step procedure, most indicators were found for class #3. Only few indicators have been revealed for intermediate species numbers, i.e. class #2. With help of Ellenberg's ecological indicator values and information on the main occurrence in Central European vegetation types and plant communities, respectively, we characterized the indicator species ecologically. The ecological site preferences of the indicator species in general reflect the fact that species richness is highest in base-rich, light, and anthropogenically disturbed pine forests. On the contrary, species-poor forests were revealed by indicators, which mainly occur on acidic sites. It is concluded that a considerable set of indicators for species richness can help facilitate biodiversity assessments in forestry and ecosystem restoration practice.

Response of bird species densities to habitat structure and fire history along a Midwestern open-forest gradient	CONDOR			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	bird density, fire frequency, nonparametric multiplicative regression, oak savanna, restoration, seasonal effects, tree density	OAK SAVANNAS, ECOLOGY, CONSERVATION, MODELS	Oak savannas were historically common but are currently rare in the Midwestern United States. We assessed possible associations of bird species with savannas and other threatened habitats in the region by relating fire frequency and vegetation characteristics to seasonal densities of 72 bird species distributed across an open-forest gradient in northwestern Indiana. About one-third of the species did not exhibit statistically significant relationships with any combination of seven vegetation characteristics that included vegetation cover in Five vertical strata, dead tree density, and tree height. For 40% of the remaining species, models best predicting species density incorporated tree density. Therefore, management based solely on manipulating tree density may not be an adequate strategy for managing bird populations along this open-forest gradient. Few species exhibited sharp peaks in predicted density under habitat conditions expected in restored savannas, suggesting that few savanna specialists occur among Midwestern bird species. When fire frequency, measured over fifteen years, was added to vegetation characteristics as a predictor of species density, it was incorporated into models for about one-quarter of species, suggesting that fire may modify habitat characteristics in ways that are important for birds but not captured by the structural habitat variables measured. Among those species, similar numbers had peaks in predicted density at low, intermediate, or high fire frequency. For species suggested by previous studies to have a preference for oak savannas along the open-forest gradient, estimated density was maximized at an average fire return interval of about one fire every three years.

Landscape use by hairy woodpeckers in managed forests of northwestern Washington	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	cavity-nesting communities, cavity-species management, Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis, habitat use, hairy woodpecker, home range use, landscape use, managed forests, Picoides villosus	CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS, HOME-RANGE, HABITAT USE, WESTERN OREGON, ABUNDANCE, SNAGS, AVAILABILITY, PASSERINES, CLEARCUTS, MOVEMENT	The hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus) is a keystone species in forest ecosystems of Washington, USA, providing nesting and roosting cavities for many species of wildlife. Therefore, management practices that promote healthy populations of this bird will help to conserve cavity-nesting communities as a whole. The objective of this study was to determine patterns in forest type and landscape use by hairy woodpeckers, and thus, provide landscape-level recommendations to forest managers. We documented the ranging patterns and habitat use of 23 hairy woodpeckers on the Olympic Peninsula using radiotelemetry and a Geographic Information System analysis. Use patterns of stand age, type, and size, as well as distance-from-edge analyses revealed that the hairy woodpecker is a relative generalist in its use of the managed forest landscape. However, certain features, such as older stands with large trees, were used more heavily by nesting pairs. Hairy woodpeckers used 61-80-year forest stands significantly (P < 0.05) more than expected relative to their availability within the birds' home ranges. We also documented significant underuse of 6-10-year and 11-20-year stands, whereas the birds used 41-60-year stands, >80-year stands, and clear-cuts (<5 yr) equivalent to their availability. We suggest that hairy woodpeckers select older stands with larger, dying trees for foraging, but also use clear-cuts proportionally due to the residual snags, decaying trees, and remnant dead wood available. Higher use (P < 0.001) by hairy woodpeckers of small forest patches (0-5 ha) and intermediate-sized stands (5-30 ha) than large patches (>30 ha) may be a result of the older, higher-quality habitat available in small stands in the managed forest landscape. We recommend that land managers interested in maintaining healthy managed forest ecosystems with a full complement of cavity-using species in forests of western Washington and northwestern Oregon maintain a landscape mosaic with approximately 45% of the landscape in stands >40 years, and >30% of the landscape in stands >60 years.

Upland dry forest on southerly aspects was dominated by open ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plant associations. Upland mesic forest on northerly aspects was dominated by closed-canopy Douglas-fir or dry grand fir (Abies grandis) plant associations. Riparian overstory vegetation was dominated by black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) plant associations with a prominent hardwood tree and shrub component. We quantified bird assemblages, diversity, and abundance from parallel point transects on riparian and adjacent dry and mesic upslope forests. We detected 80 bird species from >12,000 point-transect observations during 1998-1999. Eighteen species accounted for 75% of all detections. Species richness and evenness were similar in all 3 forest types, with approximately 35 species and high evenness (0.85) in each forest type. Bird species assemblages differed among dry, mesic, and riparian forest types, with the greatest differences between riparian and both dry and mesic upland forests. Riparian forest had the greatest number (9) of strong characteristic, or indictor, species among the 3 forest types. Upland mesic forest was characterized by 7 indicator species. Upland dry forest had 4 indicator species. Our results indicate that current standards and guidelines for riparian buffers zones would allow for avian refuge and corridor functions along these streams. Forest managers could use our indicator species to predict and monitor shifts in upland forest species composition from thinning and prescribed burning practices that are used to reduce fuels in uplands and to reduce continuity of fire effects between riparian and upland zones.

This study compared 39 quantitative or qualitative characteristics and various widely accepted biodiversity indicators of a stand, its understorey and the forest floor in old-growth and conventionally managed mature stands of dry alvar and fresh boreo-nemoral forests. This study has to produce a statistically supported set of indicators for evaluating of forest "naturalness". We examined 154 stands over a wide biogeographical range in Estonia.Many forest structural characteristics, including stand basal area and composition, amount of dead wood, and coverage of understorey layers (shrub, herb and moss layers) followed productivity and/or biogeographical gradients. Old-growth forests had higher proportions of deciduous trees, a larger amount of coarse woody debris (CWD, consisting of logs and snags), a higher frequency of logs in each decay class, a denser understorey and herb layer, and a more heterogeneous pattern of herb layer diversity than mature managed forests. We found a correlation between live trees greater than 40 cm in diameter and forest age. The effects of forest management on the forest floor are both direct and indirect. Anthropogenic disturbance directly decreased shrub and herb layer coverage. Indirectly forest management increased herb layer coverage, proportion of graminoids, and species richness of the herb layer by improving light conditions as stand canopy was opened.The sets of indicators for assessing ecosystem quality in each forest site-type have overlapping features, such as the amount of dead wood, canopy closure of the stand and the presence of woodpeckers and specific lichens. Several other old-growth or disturbance indicators are forest-type specific, related to the composition of shrub and herb layer vegetation.Results suggest that stands managed with an extended rotation can be compositionally very similar to old-growth forests. Stands differ quantitatively in structural features, but these differences are confounded by other environmental factors, such as soil productivity, forest age or biogeography. Mature and old-growth forests still enclose features created by the mid-term (decades) and long-term (centuries) history of forest management practices. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Avian community structure among restored riparian habitats in northwestern Mississippi	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	avian communities, riparian zones, gully erosion, habitat restoration, erosion control, Mississippi	BIRD COMMUNITIES, UNITED-STATES, ENGLAND, EROSION, FORESTS, STRIPS, SCALE	Riparian zones and agricultural fields adjacent to incised streams in northwestern Mississippi are impacted by gully erosion initiated by runoff flowing over unstable streambanks. Currently, installation of erosion control structures (drop pipes) at the riparian zone-agricultural field interface halts gully erosion and simultaneously establishes one of four riparian habitat types. Avian communities were compared among four types of restored habitats and among four seasonal periods in northwestern Mississippi from June 1994 to May 1996. Fifty-seven species were observed among riparian habitats, of which 49% were neotropical migrants. Habitat type and season significantly affected species richness, abundance, and diversity. Species richness, abundance, and diversity increased as habitat area, pool volume, and vertical structure of woody vegetation increased among riparian habitat types. Additionally, species richness, abundance, and diversity increased during spring and fall. The influence of habitat type on avian species richness, abundance, and diversity did not differ among seasons. Present drop pipe installation practices focus on erosion control without consideration of habitat creation. Installation practices can be altered to more effectively incorporate habitat creation to provide the greatest ecological benefits for avian communities within impacted riparian zones.

For at least five months after burns we followed the changes in bird species composition, species richness and densities of two controlled burns and one accidental fire at the Barberspan Nature Reserve in grasslands that had not been burned or grazed in 10 years, Compared with the control areas, species richness and densities increased in the burned areas immediately following the burns, with more species and birds recruited to the burned areas than were lost. Immediate post-burn opportunists tended to be larger species, and the biomass increase mirrored the increases in species richness and densities in burned areas. Avian species richness, densities and biomass tended to return to the initial conditions after a number of months. Although the bird communities from two controlled-burns differed before the burns, they converged to a characteristic immediate post-burn composition. Five months after the burns however, the bird communities reflected a pre-burn composition. Indications were that birds in an area larger than that burned were affected. Mosaic burning, with shifting large and small patches, should be considered on a landscape scale.

The study habitats were Plantation (Pinus trees in riparian zone), Bushland (recently harvested), Grassland (cleared of broadleaf plants), and Woodland (control). At seven sampling sites per habitat, a vegetation assessment was conducted, while birds were caught with mist nests. Plant species richness increased from Plantation to Woodland, whereas most bird species and individuals were found in Bushland. Plant and bird species composition differed significantly between habitats. Bushland and Grassland birds were closely associated with exotic forbs. Grassland attracted birds with diverse habitat and nesting-site associations, and Woodland birds associated with woody plants. It is recommended that the majority of riparian zones be managed as grasslands, although the exact affect of the biennial summer burning and presence of exotic plants on birds needs to be investigated. To attract cavity-nesting birds to the Estate, some suitable riparian zones should be rehabilitated to Woodland by planting Ficus and Acacia trees, as these trees are the most abundant and frequently occurring in this habitat. Rather than manage avian diversity per se, the African stonechat in Grassland and lesser honeyguide in Woodland can be employed as indicators of the rehabilitation state of the riparian zones.

Over the past three decades, native eucalypt trees and shrubs have been planted extensively in a part of this region to provide a range of environmental benefits. Our aim was to determine the extent to which these plantings could improve biological diversity in agricultural landscapes in south-eastern Australia and to identify the variables influencing their effectiveness. We sampled birds at 120 sites encompassing the range of available patch sizes, stand ages, floristic and structural conditions, and habitat attributes for revegetated areas and remnants of native vegetation, and we compared these to nearby paddocks. Eucalypt plantings were found to provide significant improvements in bird population density compared with cleared or sparsely treed paddocks, and mixed eucalypt and shrub plantings had similar bird communities to remnant native forest and woodland in the region. Birds displayed a strong response to patch size, with both larger (>= 5-20 ha) eucalypt plantings and larger (>= 5-20 ha) remnants having more species and more individuals per unit area than smaller (< 5 ha) patches of these vegetation types. Older (10-25 years) plantings had more bird species and individuals than young (< 10 years) plantings. The distance from remnant forest and woodland (habitat connectivity) appeared to be an important variable influencing bird species richness in eucalypt plantings. The main differences were due to the greater numbers of species classified as woodland-dependent in the larger-sized patches of plantings and remnants. Eucalypt plantings provided useful habitat for at least 10 declining woodland-dependent species, notably for the Speckled Warbler, Red-capped Robin and Rufous Whistler. The Brown Treecreeper and Dusky Woodswallow appeared to be the species most limited by the extent of remnant forest and woodland in the region. Plantings of all shapes and sizes, especially those larger than 5 ha, have an important role to play in providing habitat for many bird species. Restoration efforts are more likely to be successful if eucalypt plantings are established near existing remnant vegetation.

Restoration of montane wet forest is in progress at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hawaii, using plantations of Acacia koa (koa), a canopy tree of montane wet forest. We used longhorned beetles (Plagithmysus claviger and P. varians) as indicator species to assess restoration. The beetles feed by boring into dead koa branches and are food for the endemic forest bird Hemignathus munroi. We quantified density of beetles in branches of koa from trees of 3 age categories: young plantations (3-8 y; 222 branches), older plantations (12-15 y; 212 branches), and canopy trees of intact forest (167 branches). We sampled by breaking dead branches into short pieces and counting the beetles within. Density of beetles was greater in canopy trees (4.89 beetles/branch) than in planted trees and was greater in older plantations (3.24 beetles/branch) than in younger plantations (0.90 beetles/ branch). Beetles were clumped in distribution among branches (coefficient of dispersion = 5.17). Mean basal diameter of branches in canopy trees (32.6 mm) was greater than in planted trees and was greater in older plantations (29.3 mm) than in young plantations (19.0 mm). In young and older plantations, branches that harbored beetles were larger than branches that did not, but in canopy trees there was no difference. Branch diameter had a positive effect on number of beetles per branch in all age categories. Koa plantations promote recovery of plant and animal biological diversity in degraded habitats formerly occupied by montane wet forest.

In Hawaii, elevation on volcanic mountains affects temperature, rainfall, vegetation, and fauna. The effect of elevation on animal distribution and abundance can be direct through effects on climate or, in the case of phytophagous insects, indirectly mediated through climatic effects on host plants. In montane wet forests dominated by Metrosideros polymorpha (ohia lehua) and Acacia koa (koa), longhorned wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae, Plagithmysus) play an important role as decomposers of wood and as food for higher trophic levels. The beetles I studied feed exclusively on dead wood of koa. I assessed the effect of elevation on the density of longhorned beetles in plantations of koa at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hawaii. Density per branch of longhorned beetles was more than twice as great in the low-elevation sample (1,620-1,650 m; 3.49 beetles/branch, n = 200) as in the high-elevation sample (1,8801,970 m; 1.61 beetles/branch, n = 200; t = 5.08, P < 0.001). Beetles were contagiously distributed among branches at both low and high elevations (CD = 5.71). Size of branch had a consistent positive effect on density of beetles, although this effect was more pronounced at low elevation. Elevation affects biological diversity directly through climate and seasonality, and indirectly through climatic effects on key habitat features. Effects of seasonality and habitat features on longhorned beetles need further study in Hawaiian montane forest.

The proposed method further allows identifying the best potential new sites to be included in the network, to reach target population sizes and so to test whether a network extension is realistic or not. We used data from the French Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and spatial interpolation models known as kriging to predict the relative abundance of species at a national scale. We applied the proposed methodology to Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and a sample of 20 bird species concerned by the Directive of the Council of the European Community on the Conservation of Wild Birds. We estimated which relative part of the national population is included within the boundaries of all national SPAs. Our results suggest that the current SPA network is probably not efficient to ensure favorable national conservation status for the most widespread species, but allows reaching a 5% target value for more localized ones. Consequently, we discuss the limit of such a protected area network to ensure the global conservation of widespread species, and therefore the need for other large-scale conservation measures.

Biodiversity and multiple disturbances: boreal forest ground beetle (Coleoptera : Carabidae) responses to wildfire, harvesting, and herbicide	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences		PITFALL TRAPS, NATURAL DISTURBANCE, BIRD COMMUNITIES, FIRE, ASSEMBLAGES, MANAGEMENT, CONSERVATION, REGENERATION, ECOSYSTEMS, MIXEDWOOD	Rising societal demands for forest resources along with existing natural disturbance regimes suggest that sustainable forest management will increasingly depend on better understanding the cumulative effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In North America, for example, there is increasing economic pressure to salvage log burned forests, although the ecological consequences of combining fire and harvesting on the same sites are unclear. We examined the short-term (2 year) responses of boreal forest ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) to the individual and combined effects of wildfire, harvesting, and herbicide. Ground beetle responses to wildfire and forestry-related disturbances differed strongly and suggested that, although some species may appear to benefit from disturbance combinations (e.g., Sericoda quadripunctata (DeGeer)), these effects are detrimental to others (e.g., Sericoda bembidioides Kirby). Species compositional variability was significantly reduced by disturbance combinations suggesting that multiple disturbances may lead to a simplification of this entire assemblage. In addition, ground beetle responses were correlated with changes in several key habitat parameters such as amount of woody debris, exposed ground, and plant species richness suggesting avenues for future study. Overall, however, our results suggest that efforts to avoid compounding disturbances on any site should be considered when developing current and future forest management guidelines.

Four experimental units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of 3 replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, North Carolina, USA. Treatments were 1) prescribed burn, 2) mechanical understory reduction (chainsaw-felling of shrubs and small trees), 3) mechanical + burn, and 4) controls. We conducted mechanical treatments in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls. Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird species did not detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species richness, total bird density, and some species, including indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year delay; eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus) declined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions, and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open habitat while retaining many forest and generalist species, but may have short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.

This conversion has included riparian areas, which, as interfaces between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, are important to many wildlife species. Farm Bill programs have resulted in the reestablishment of millions of hectares of grasslands and wetlands nationwide, including >100,000 ha in riparian areas of the Midwest. We assessed plant and arthropod responses to burning and disking of riparian grasslands in east-central Iowa in 2001 and 2002. Burning altered the plant community by removing litter and standing dead vegetation and had negative effects on several arthropod taxa, including Hemiptera and Lepidoptera. However, we observed no differences in vegetation or arthropods between burned and unburned fields during the second year postburning (P > 0.05). Disking decreased the cover of grasses, litter, and standing dead vegetation and increased plant species richness and the cover of forbs and bare ground (P < 0.05). Arthropod abundance and dry biomass were greater on disked than undisked portions of fields (P < 0.05). Increases in the abundance and biomass of arthropods associated with changes in vegetation structure and composition likely improved habitat quality for a number of breeding bird species. Both burning and disking appear to be effective management options for maintaining or enhancing riparian grasslands for wildlife.

Visual representations of the management process can assist in conveying complex management treatments. A second trend has been the promotion of biological diversity as a management objective. Ecosystem managers and restoration ecologists are using pre-settlement landscape patterns and forest conditions as a reference point to encourage the recovery of rare or extirpated species and habitat types. The problem is that information about pre-settlement conditions is limited. Our research goal was to visualize pre-settlement forests in Wisconsin and compare them with current forest conditions. Pre-settlement vegetation conditions were derived from computerized U.S. Public Land Survey records. Current forest conditions were derived from USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data. We used World Construction Set software (3D Nature, LLC) for the visualizations. Our results focus on ecosystems that are (a) still widespread but altered in structure and species composition (northern hardwoods communities) or (b) Greatly diminished in extent (pine barrens communities). We found there are substantial visual differences between current and pre-settlement forests, most notably in species composition, density, and stand structural complexity. Our results highlight the potential of computer visualization as a tool to aid forest managers and restoration ecologists. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The study was based on comparison between six 'disturbed' (extracted) and four 'undisturbed' (non-extracted) sites that were delineated using quantitative disturbance indicators. Birds were sampled seven times over two different seasons utilising the fixed radius point count method. Six different variables related to vegetation structure (canopy cover, basal area, average forest height, tree density, tree height diversity and tree species richness) were quantified, as was tree species composition. There was no significant difference in number of recorded species or bird abundance between disturbed and undisturbed sites. However. bird species diversity was significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Overall, bird species composition also differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Nine of 38 locally abundant bird species (23.6%) showed significant selection for either disturbed or undisturbed habitats. Of these nine species, seven chose undisturbed habitats and two chose disturbed. All seven species adversely affected by disturbance are primarily insectivorous. Canopy cover, tree basal area and height of trees were significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. In both habitats, bird species composition was significantly dependent on these components of altered vegetation structure. Tree species composition was also significantly altered by disturbance in scrub forest. However, altered tree species composition did not significantly affect bird species composition. Partial Mantel's tests confirmed that there were no significant residual effects of tree species composition on bird composition after the effects of vegetation structure were accounted for. Our study indicates that rural biomass extraction can have significant effects upon bird species composition of tropical scrub forest which is caused principally by alteration of vegetation structure, rather than by changes in forest tree composition.

Further diversifying this "lexicon zoo" are the ecological roles of rare species and refugia, and measures of surrogates and indicators of biodiversity parameters. To impart order on this lexicon zoo, a "concept map" framework is suggested for clearly defining biodiversity parameters and related terms, relating biodiversity to ecosystem services and sustainability, describing how disturbance affects biodiversity, and identifying biodiversity parameters for management and monitoring. Many relations among these concepts are poorly understood in managed forest environments and are presented here as testable tenets. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Jungle rubber gardens are low-input rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforests that structurally resemble secondary forest and in which wild species are tolerated by the farmer. As primary forests have almost completely disappeared from the lowlands of the Sumatra peneplain, our aim was to assess the contribution of jungle rubber as a land use type to the conservation of plant and bird species, especially those that are associated with the forest interior of primary and old secondary forest. Species-accumulation curves were compiled for terrestrial and epiphytic pteridophytes, trees and birds, and for subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds. Comparing jungle rubber and primary forest, groups differed in relative species richness patterns. Species richness in jungle rubber was slightly higher (terrestrial pteridophytes), similar (birds) or lower (epiphytic pteridophytes, trees, vascular plants as a whole) than in primary forest. For subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds, species richness in jungle rubber was lower than in primary forest. For all groups, species richness in jungle rubber was generally higher than in rubber plantations. Although species conservation in jungle rubber is limited by management practices and by a slash-and-burn cycle for replanting of about 40 years, this forest-like land use does support species diversity in an impoverished landscape increasingly dominated by monoculture plantations.

We evaluated the ecological distinctiveness and conservation value of savannas and woodlands by examining bird distributions across a fire-maintained woody-vegetation gradient in northwest Indiana encompassing five habitats-open habitats with low canopy cover, savannas, woodlands, scrublands, and forests-during migration, breeding, and overwintering. Savannas and woodlands were significantly different in overall bird species composition from open and forest habitats but were often intermediate between open and forest in guild densities. Few bird species were consistently and highly concentrated in savannas or woodlands, and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) was the only species significantly more abundant in savannas and woodlands than in open, scrub, and forest habitats. Fire frequency over a 15-year interval was a significant predictor of bird community composition and was positively related to species diversity, spring transient migrant density, and density of the most threatened species. Each habitat type had characteristics potentially important for avian conservation. Scrub had the highest density of transient migrants, which suggests it plays an important role as migration stopover habitat. More species were significantly concentrated in open or forest habitats than in the other habitats. Lack of species concentration and intermediate community composition suggested that birds experienced savannas and woodlands more as ecotones than as habitats distinct from forests or grasslands. However, this intermediate character can benefit conservation, as evidenced by savannas and woodlands having the highest density of the most threatened species along this woody-vegetation gradient.

Habitat structure long has been identified as a primary factor influencing local assemblage composition. Most evidence has been in the form of correlations of species occurrence and assemblage composition over a range of habitats, with experimental verification of relationships being relatively uncommon because of the difficulties of enacting precise manipulations of habitat structure.2. Fallen timber (also known as coarse or large woody debris) is one of the few habitat-structural elements in forests and woodlands that can be manipulated with relatively high precision. We report on manipulations of wood-loads on 30 experimental 1-ha plots in floodplain forests of northern Victoria, Australia, over 4 years (one pre- and three post-manipulation).3. We show that very high wood-loads (80 Mg ha(-1)) and intermediate wood-loads derived from tree crowns (40 Mg ha(-1)) increase species richness (all species and ground-foraging species) and numbers of birds (all species and ground-foraging species) relative to the control plots.4. Three bird species consistently increased most following manipulations: white-plumed honeyeater Lichenostomus penicillatus (Gould 1837) (fam. Meliphagidae), brown treecreeper Climacteris picumnus (Temm. & Laug. 1824) (fam. Climacteridae) and yellow rosella Platycercus elegans flaveolus (Gould 1837) (fam. Psittacidae). The honeyeater is not considered as a ground or fallen timber dependent species, while the treecreeper and rosella both are regarded as being dependent on ground-layer structure.5. Fallen timber management needs to be considered in a landscape and temporal context for improving conservation of avian biodiversity.

A majority of depredation events (83%) were caused by 4 species: coyote (Canis latrans), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), southern fire ant (Solenopsis xyloni), and badger (Taxidea taxus). Observed bobwhite nest fates for the study period were 0.50 successful, 0.34 depredated, and 0.16 abandoned or undetermined. A universal approach to mitigating nest predation is not likely to be applicable in regions similar to southern Texas, with high nest-predator diversity (e.g., fire ants, rodents, and mammalian carnivores). We believe that infrared video surveillance is a valuable tool for documenting baseline information on predator context and nest fate for many avian species, considering the limitations of past methods (e.g., postfate evidence).

The perpetual forest: using undesirable species to bridge restoration	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	canopy conversion, canopy gaps, canopy retention, longleaf pine, reference sites, restoration, species functional redundancy, species richness	PINE PINUS-PALUSTRIS, SOUTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES, ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION, ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT, PRESCRIBED FIRE, PONDEROSA, CONSERVATION, BIODIVERSITY, IMPLEMENTATION, SILVICULTURE	1. Conversion of established forests of undesirable species composition or structure to a multi-age, native forest community is a common restoration goal. However, for some ecosystems, the complexity of multiple disturbances and biotic factors requires unique approaches to advance community development. We use the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Miller) ecosystem as a model of such a restoration paradigm with an approach that utilizes the undesirable species as a functional or structural bridge to foster ecological processes.2. In the conversion of adult slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) plantations to the biologically diverse longleaf pine forests that once dominated the south-eastern US Coastal Plain, we examine techniques for restoring and maintaining critical structural and functional components. Through partial and variable retention of the undesirable slash pine canopy, establishment of longleaf pine seedlings is facilitated, while maintaining fuels essential for prescribed fire, a necessary management practice for longleaf pine. Furthermore, we project that with subsequent fires, fine fuels and species richness will be encouraged in the ground cover, and with future slash canopy harvest, established longleaf pine seedlings will be released.3. In this study, we present a statistical approach that examines the compositional movement of vegetation in restoration sites over time relative to the reference conditions that are also changing through time.4. Synthesis and applications. Restoration efforts that remove undesirable species initially may actually hinder rather than facilitate restoration. Restoration of fire-maintained ecosystems in which the production of adequate fuels is an important consideration may require the retention of a portion of the existing canopy to provide fuels during the restoration process, even if the canopy is comprised of less preferred species. Individual species often provide similar structural features and influences on function within an ecosystem; thus, systems other than longleaf pine may also benefit from retention of the undesirable species through the restoration process. We conclude that a gradual approach to restoration may be advantageous when legacies of past management have altered complex ecological dynamics and promoted development along a successional pathway strongly differing from that of the reference conditions.

Species richness, evenness, and diversity of bird communities were highest in old-growth and mid-successional juniper (22.9 species/transect and 23.6 species/transect, respectively) but lowest in the grasslands (17.6 species/transect). Bird species diversity was positively correlated with physiognomic cover diversity (r = 0. 74, P = 0.001). Density of breeding birds was greatest in old-growth juniper (6.6 birds/ha) and lowest in postburn grasslands (3.6 birds/ha) but similar in shrub-steppe and sagebrush-steppe-juniper (6.0 birds/ha and 5.5 birds/ha, respectively). Old-growth juniper had the highest total densities of both tree and cavity nesters. Mountain chickadees (Parus gambeli), Cassin's finches (Carpodacus cassinii), chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), mountain bluebirds (Sialia currucoides), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), Empidonax flycatchers, ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens), and northern flickers (Colaptes auratus) were more abundant in cover types dominated by junipers. Vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus), western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), green-tailed towhees (Pipilo chlorurus), and horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) were associated with grassland communities. Brewer's sparrows (Spizella breweri), sage sparrows (Amphispiza belli), sage thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus), and horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) were most abundant in sagebrush cover types. Management strategies should restore or maintain the desired proportions of the different successional states to maintain populations of grassland and sagebrush birds while providing habitat for tree and cavity nesting species.

The effects of natural and human-caused disturbance on density of nesting pairs, reproductive success, and traditional home ranges were compared over 30 years in two areas and over 15 years in five additional areas. In one study area, density of nesting pairs of pileated woodpeckers decreased from five to one after extensive regeneration cuts eliminated most of the stands of mature and old-growth grand fir (Abies grandis) and reduced the density of nest and roost trees and foraging substrate since 1990. Density of nesting pairs, reproductive success, and home range location remained fairly consistent over 30 years in a second study area with extensive tree mortality resulting from insect outbreaks but without regeneration harvests. The amount of unharvested stands and closed canopy stands in home ranges were positively correlated with reproductive success, and the amount of area in harvested stands was negatively correlated with reproductive success in 2003-05. High tree mortality and subsequent loss of canopy closure in stands of grand fir and Douglas-fir from insect outbreaks did not appear to be detrimental to pileated woodpeckers provided that dead trees and logs were abundant and that stands were not harvested.

Impacts of clearing, fragmentation and disturbance on the bird fauna of Eucalypt savanna woodlands in central Queensland, Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	bird, corridor, exotic pasture grass, grazing, miner, remnant	HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, SPECIES RICHNESS, NORTHERN-TERRITORY, CONSERVATION, FORESTS, LAND, FIRE, VEGETATION, BIODIVERSITY, COMMUNITIES	This study reports on the responses of bird assemblages to woodland clearance, fragmentation and habitat disturbance in central Queensland Australia, a region exposed to very high rates of vegetation clearance over the last two to three decades. Many previous studies of clearing impacts have considered situations where there is a very sharp management contrast between uncleared lands and cleared areas: in this situation, the contrast is more muted, because both cleared lands and uncleared savanna woodlands are exposed to cattle grazing, invasion by the exotic grass Cenchrus ciliaris and similar fire management. Bird species richness (at the scale of a 1-ha quadrat) was least in cleared areas (8.1 species), then regrowth areas (14.6 species), then uncleared woodlands (19.9 species). Richness at this scale was unrelated to woodland fragment size, connectivity or habitat condition; but declined significantly with increasing abundance of miners (interspecifically aggressive colonial honeyeaters). At whole of patch scale, richness increased with fragment size and decreased with abundance of miners. This study demonstrates complex responses of individual bird species to a regional management cocktail of disturbance elements. Of 71 individual bird species modelled for woodland fragment sites, the quadrat-level abundance of 40 species was significantly related to at least one variable representing environmental position (across a rainfall gradient), fragment condition, fragment size and/or connectivity. This study suggests that priorities for conservation management include: cessation of broad-scale clearing; increased protection for regrowth (particularly where this may bolster connectivity and/or size of woodland fragments); control of miners; maintenance of fallen woody debris in woodlands; increase in fire frequency; and reduction in the incidence of grazing and exotic pasture grass.

In Spain, Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests are mainly subjected to three sylvopastoral management systems which determine variations in the forest structure: (i) "young forests" subjected to frequent disturbance by fires and clear-cuttings; (ii) "Pyrenean oak dehesas", subjected to a traditional sylvopastoral system exclusive to Spain which favours the development of both old oaks and pasture; (iii) largely undisturbed "mature forests". We examined the effects of these sylvopastoral management systems on habitat use and reproduction of the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius), a forest specialist bird, at the south-western edge of its distribution range. Habitat use was examined at multiple spatial scales. Within the territories, woodpeckers preferred large diameter oaks for foraging and decay oaks with holes for nesting. Within the forest tracts, no significant relationships between territory density and habitat structure in the forest tracts were found. At the landscape scale, dehesas and mature forests, both with high densities of important foraging and nesting trees, were occupied by woodpeckers. Young forests, with low densities of those trees, were avoided. No significant differences in territory density or reproductive success were found between dehesas and mature forests. The maintenance of viable woodpecker populations requires conservation actions at several spatial scales. Within the forest tracts, suitable densities of important foraging and nesting trees must be maintained. At the landscape scale, management decisions must consider the maintenance of traditional sylvopastoral systems in dehesas and mature forests. At the regional scale, taking into account a habitat cover in the landscape of the 7% for the Cantabrian Mountains, we estimated an area of 285,000 ha to be included in the conservation planning unit for the middle spotted woodpecker.

Boreal woodpecker assemblages in recently burned forested landscapes in Alberta, Canada: Effects of post-fire harvesting and burn severity	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences	burn severity, dead wood, landscape, mixed-wood forest, Picoides, salvage logging, transect count method, wildfire, woodpeckers	STAND-REPLACEMENT FIRE, CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS, 3-TOED WOODPECKERS, FORAGING ECOLOGY, HABITAT USE, HOME-RANGE, COMMUNITIES, AVAILABILITY, MANAGEMENT, CARABIDAE	Canadian boreal forests are increasingly modified by post-fire removal of trees (salvage logging), yet the ecological consequences of this practice are little studied. As mixed-wood forests have recently become accessible for salvage operations, we studied woodpeckers in mixed-wood (trembling aspen Populus tremuloides and white spruce Picea glauca) and adjacent coniferous (black spruce Picea mariana and jack pine Pinus banksiana) areas to examine the effects of salvage logging and burn severity on these species. During 2003-2004 we carried out transect counts in 24 landscape units (625 ha each) that varied in pre-fire amount of merchantable mixed-wood (low=7-15% and high=25-35% of the unit area), salvage logging intensity (from control=no salvaging to high=60-70% of merchantable mixed-wood harvested) and burn severity (estimates based on tree survival after fire). Six main findings are presented: (1) in mixed-wood areas subjected to salvage, total woodpecker abundance and woodpeckers of the genus Picoides (most notably black-backed woodpecker Picoides arcticus) responded negatively to increasing salvage logging intensity; (2) northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) showed a marginally significant positive response to salvage in the mixed-wood areas; (3) the salvage response of the black-backed woodpecker was season dependent (first post-fire summer, winter and second post-fire summer compared); (4) in coniferous but not in mixed-wood areas, black-backed woodpecker responded positively to increasing burn severity. Moreover, the response in coniferous habitat was stronger in the first post-fire summer, compared to the subsequent winter and the second post-fire summer. In the retained mixed-wood areas, northern flicker responded positively to increasing burn severity; (5) the majority of the detected 73 woodpecker nests with chicks were in trembling aspen trees or in mixed-wood stands; (6) among coniferous tree species, dead standing jack pine and white spruce trees had much greater evidence of woodpecker foraging than had black spruce (ca. 65-75% versus 15% of trees). These results indicate the crucial influence of salvage logging, the amount of retained mixed-wood forests and burn severity on woodpecker abundance. Hence we recommend retention of large, burned mixed-wood areas during salvage harvesting to support these dead-wood dependent birds. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Responses of plant and bird communities to prescribed burning in tallgrass prairies	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, grassland birds, grassland plants, prairie restoration, prescribed burning, tallgrass prairie	NORTH-AMERICA, GRASSLAND, DIVERSITY, SPARROW, AREA, FIRE	Historic losses and fragmentation of tallgrass prairie habitat to agriculture and urban development have led to declines in diversity and abundance of plants and birds associated with such habitat. Prescribed burning is a management strategy that has potential for restoring and rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, and through such restoration, might create habitat for birds dependent upon prairies. To provide improved data for management decision-making regarding the use of prescribed fire in tallgrass prairies, we compared responses of plant and bird communities on five burned and five unburned tallgrass prairie fragments at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, Iowa, USA, from 1995 to 1997. Overall species richness and diversity were unaffected by burning, but individual species of plants and birds were affected by year-treatment interactions, including northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), which showed time-delayed increases in density on burned sites. Analyses of species/area relationships indicated that, collectively, many small sites did make significant contributions to plant biodiversity at landscape levels, supporting the overall conservation value of prairie fragments. In contrast, most birds species were present on larger sites. Thus, higher biodiversity in bird communities which contain area-sensitive species might require larger sites able to support larger, more stable populations, greater habitat heterogeneity, and greater opportunity for niche separation.

Explanatory variables were composed of three data sets derived from GIS habitat mapping: (1) spatial variables (polynomial terms of geographical coordinates of samples), (2) landscape composition as the percentage cover of the six main habitats, and (3) landscape structure metrics including indices of fragmentation and spatial heterogeneity. We used canonical correspondence analysis with variance partitioning to evaluate the joint and independent effects of the three sets of variables on the ordination of species assemblages. Moran's I correlograms and Mantel tests were used to assess for spatial structure in species distribution and relationships with separate landscape attributes.Results Landscape composition was the main factor explaining the distribution patterns of birds and carabids at the mesoscale of 400 X 400 m. Independent effects of spatial variables and landscape structure were still significant for bird assemblages once landscape composition was controlled for, but not for carabid assemblages. Spatial distributions of birds and carabids were primarily influenced by the amount of heathlands, young pine plantations, herbaceous firebreaks and deciduous woodlands. Deciduous woodland species had positive responses to edge density, while open habitat species were positively associated with mean patch area.Main conclusions Forest birds were favoured by an increase in deciduous woodland cover and landscape heterogeneity, but there was no evidence for a similar effect on carabid beetles. Fragmentation of open habitats negatively affected both early-successional birds and carabids, specialist species being restricted to large heathlands and young plantations. Several birds of conservation concern were associated with mosaics of woodlands and grasslands, especially meadows and firebreaks. Conserving biodiversity in mosaic plantation landscapes could be achieved by the maintenance of a significant amount of early-successional habitats and deciduous woodland patches within a conifer plantation matrix.

Avian nest box selection and nest success in burned and unburned southwestern riparian forest	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	ash-throated flycatcher, Bewick's wren, Middle Rio Grande, riparian vegetation, secondary cavity-nesting, vegetation structure, wildfire	CENTRAL NEW-MEXICO, RIO-GRANDE, REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, BIRDS, ECOSYSTEMS, PREDATION, HABITAT, FIRE, FRAGMENTATION, CONSERVATION	Riparian forest communities in the southwestern United States were historically structured by a disturbance regime of annual flooding. In recent decades, however, frequency of flooding has decreased and frequency of wildfires has increased. Riparian forests provide important breeding habitat for a large variety of bird species, and the effects of this altered disturbance regime on birds and their breeding habitat is largely unknown. To evaluate effects of high-intensity spring and summer wildfire on the quality of breeding bird habitat in the Middle Rio Grande valley, we measured vegetation structure and composition, avian nest use, and nest success at 4 unburned plots and 4 wildfire plots over a 3-year period. We measured avian nest use and success at nest boxes located in unburned riparian forest plots and plots recently burned by wildfire. Recent wildfire plots (< 7 yr after fire) had a much different vegetation structure than unburned plots; an older (> 7 yr after fire) wildfire plot more closely resembled its paired unburned plot than did recently burned plots. Ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens) and Bewick's wrens (Thryomanes bewickii; hereafter, flycatchers and wrens, respectively) used nest boxes in most of the plots. A model selection procedure applied to logistic regressions showed that frequency of nest box use by flycatchers was positively associated with wildfire, although flycatchers used boxes in unburned plots as well. Wrens showed a preferential use of nest boxes that were in unburned sites and in close proximity to vegetative cover. Growth rates, feeding rates, and fledging mass of flycatchers were similar in wildfire and unburned plots. Growth rates for wrens were slower in wildfire plots, while feeding rates and fledging mass were similar. Nest predation varied between years, was higher for flycatchers than for wrens, and was not directly influenced by wildfire. Model selection showed that predation increased with grass cover, an indicator of forest openness, and decreased with distance to habitat edge. Recovery of dense vegetation appears important in maintaining populations of Bewick's wrens, whereas ash-throated flycatchers were less sensitive to vegetative structure and composition of postfire succession. Postfire management that maintains nest sites in large forest strips would enhance nesting density and success of these cavity-nesting birds in riparian zones.

The Brigalow Belt forests include some of the largest contiguous areas of native forest in the temperate and sub-humid zones of eastern Australia. Over I million ha of these forests are proposed to be converted from forestry to conservation tenure, yet the impacts on the avifauna of current and potential future forest management practices are not known. We investigated the influence of road edges and habitat type and structure on the avifauna of a 356 000 ha forest. Survey sites were either < 50 m or > 300 m from a road, and in either cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla forest, spotted gum Corymbia citriodora forest with a regenerating cypress pine/buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii understorey or spotted gum forest with an open understorey due to fuel-reduction burning. The avifauma differed significantly among vegetation types but not with proximity to a road, with the greatest differences between cypress pine and both types of spotted gum forest. The noisy miner Manorina melanocephala, an aggressive avian competitor, appears to be the factor mediating these assemblage-level differences. Noisy miners were rare in cypress pine forest but were three times more numerous than any other species in spotted gum forest. Spotted gum forest with a regenerating understorey had fewer noisy miners. Although total bird abundance was highest in open spotted gum forest, the species richness and abundance of passerines smaller than noisy miners was significantly lower in this forest type. Abundance of small passerines was eight times higher in sites where < 3 noisy miners were recorded. Only one species, the eastern yellow robin, was influenced by proximity to a road edge. Cypress pine forest is potentially an important refuge for smaller birds. The results suggest that burning regimes that reduce regeneration of the cypress pine and buloke subcanopy in spotted gum forest potentially are exacerbating the problem of noisy miner domination of the avifauna.

To quantify avian response patterns along a burn severity gradient, we sampled 49 random plots ( 2001 - 2002) at the 17351- ha Cerro Grande Fire ( 2000) in New Mexico, USA. Additionally, pre-. re avian surveys ( 1986 1988, 1990) created a unique opportunity to quantify avifaunal changes in 13 pre-. re transects ( resampled in 2002) and to compare two designs for analyzing the effects of unplanned disturbances: after- only analysis and before - after comparisons. Distance analysis was used to calculate densities. We analyzed after- only densities for 21 species using gradient analysis, which detected a broad range of responses to increasing burn severity: (I) large significant declines, (II) weak, but signi. cant declines, (III) no signi. cant density changes, (IV) peak densities in low- or moderate- severity patches, (V) weak, but signi. cant increases, and (VI) large signi. cant increases. Overall, 71% of the species included in the after- only gradient analysis exhibited either positive or neutral density responses to. re effects across all or portions of the severity gradient ( responses III - VI). We used pre/ post pairs analysis to quantify density changes for 15 species using before - after comparisons; spatiotemporal variation in densities was large and confounded. re effects for most species. Only four species demonstrated signi. cant effects of burn severity, and their densities were all higher in burned compared to unburned forests. Pre- and post-. re community similarity was high except in high- severity areas. Species richness was similar pre- and post-. re across all burn severities. Thus, ecosystem restoration programs based on the assumption that recent severe. res in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have overriding negative ecological effects are not supported by our study of post-. re avian communities. This study illustrates the importance of quantifying burn severity and controlling confounding sources of spatiotemporal variation in studies of. re effects. After- only gradient analysis can be an efficient tool for quantifying. re effects. This analysis can also augment historical data sets that have small samples sizes coupled with high non- process variation, which limits the power of before - after comparisons.

Wintering shorebird assemblages and behavior in restored tidal wetlands in southern California	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	behavior, diversity, habitat heterogeneity, landscape matrix, mudflats, restoration, shorebirds	BIRD COMMUNITIES, HUMBOLDT BAY, SALT MARSHES, HABITAT, RESTORATION, HETEROGENEITY, ABUNDANCE, USA, MUDFLATS, ECOLOGY	Habitat restoration can partially compensate for the extensive loss of coastal wetlands, but creation of functional habitat and assessment of restoration success remain challenging tasks. To evaluate wintering shorebird use of restored coastal wetlands, we quantified shorebird assemblages and behavior of selected focal species at five restored sites and paired reference sites in Mugu Lagoon, southern California, United States. The Shannon-Wiener index of species diversity (for all birds in order Charadriiformes) was higher in the restored than in the reference portion of three of the five sites, higher in the reference portion of a fourth site, and similar between reference and restored areas of the fifth site. Species diversity was lower in sites closer to man-made structures. The four most abundant species groups across the five sites were selected for detailed analysis of site use and behavior: Willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus), Marbled Godwits (Limosa fedoa), Dowitchers (Limnodromus spp.), and Sandpipers (Calidris spp.) (Western, Least, and Dunlin). Each focal species group exhibited distinct site preferences, and densities in restored sites were often as high or higher than in reference sites. Willets and Dowitchers preferred habitats with more extensive tidal flats, a characteristic of restored sites. Godwits and Sandpipers preferred heterogeneous habitats with a mix of water and tidal flats. Most birds were engaged in feeding activities during the ebb tides surveyed, and there were no apparent differences in behavior between reference and restored sites. Though not all restored sites were used equally by all species, the creation of multiple restored sites with varied habitat characteristics attracted a diverse assemblage of shorebirds and may have contributed to the integrity of the regional wetland landscape.

We monitored the use and characteristics of 12 winter roosts used by nine radio-marked Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona that had experienced wildfire in 1996 and 2000. Roost trees were larger in diameter than 95% of non-roost trees and on average 2.5 times larger within burned areas of similar severity. Roost trees were within patches less dense than 95% of measured patches across study sites, which were on average 1.5 times as dense. Two-thirds of roost trees were created by fire and were smaller than those created by other means. Six birds each used one roost and three males each used two roosts. Two-thirds of the roosts were outside or on the edge of estimated home ranges. Maximum straight-line distances traveled, from roost to farthest point of home range, were > 1 km for 8 of 9 birds. Woodpeckers have a significant role in providing cavities for secondary cavity nesters. Thus, understanding habitat requirements for winter roosts could provide managers with essential tools to maintain or enhance populations of this species.

Nest densities of cavity-nesting birds in relation to postfire salvage logging and time since wildfire	CONDOR			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	cavity-nesting birds, nest densities, nest survival, ponderosa pine forests, postfire salvage logging, wildfire	STAND-REPLACEMENT FIRE, BOREAL FOREST, SIERRA-NEVADA, HABITAT QUALITY, CONIFER FORESTS, POPULATIONS, WOODPECKERS, COMMUNITIES, NORTHERN, SUCCESSION	We monitored the nest densities and nest survival of seven cavity-nesting bird species, including four open-space foragers (American Kestrel [Falco sparperius], Lewis's Woodpecker [Melanerpes lewis], Western Bluebird [Sialia mexicana], and Mountain Bluebird [S. currucoides]) and three wood-foragers (Hairy Woodpecker [Picoides villosus], Black-backed Woodpecker [P. arcticus], and Northern Flicker [Colaptes auratus]), after two wildfires (one partially salvage-logged and one unlogged) in western Idaho from 1994-2004. We estimated the relationship between nest density and time since fire, tested for statistical differences in nest densities and nest survival in the partially salvage-logged vs. unlogged wildfires, and tested for differences in nest survival between early (1-4 years after fire) and late (5-12 years after fire) postfire periods. Nest densities of open-space foragers and Northern Flickers generally increased with time since fire, whereas nest densities of Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers peaked 4-5 years postfire. Nest densities of wood-foraging species and Mountain Bluebirds were significantly higher in the unlogged burn, whereas Lewis's Woodpeckers had significantly higher nest densities in the partially logged burn. Kestrels tended to favor the partially logged burn, while Western Bluebird nest densities were nearly equal in both burned areas. For most species, postfire period and treatment (partially logged vs. unlogged) had little influence on nest survival. However, Hairy Woodpecker nest survival was significantly lower in the partially logged burn versus the unlogged wildfire in the early postfire period, and Lewis's Woodpecker nest survival was significantly reduced in the later postfire period versus the early postfire period in the partially logged burn. Importantly, the salvage logging was designed to retain more than half of the snags over 23 cm in diameter, which provided suitable nesting habitat for open-space foragers during the decade following fire.

However, current knowledge about patterns of vegetation variability across large regions that is spatially explicit (i.e., mapped) tends to be general and qualitative. We used spatial predictions from gradient models to examine the influence of environment, disturbance, and ownership on patterns of forest vegetation biodiversity across a large forested region, the 3-million-ha Oregon Coast Range (USA). Gradients in tree species composition were strongly associated with environment, especially climate, and insensitive to disturbance, probably because many dominant tree species are long-lived and persist throughout forest succession. In contrast, forest structure was strongly correlated with disturbance and only weakly with environmental gradients. Although forest structure differed among ownerships, differences were blurred by the presence of legacy trees that originated prior to current forest management regimes. Our multi-ownership perspective revealed biodiversity concerns and benefits not readily visible in single-ownership analyses, and all ownerships contributed to regional biodiversity values. Federal lands provided most of the late-successional and old-growth forest. State lands contained a range of forest ages and structures, including diverse young forest, abundant legacy dead wood, and much of the high-elevation true fir forest. Nonindustrial private lands provided diverse young forest and the greatest abundance of hardwood trees, including almost all of the foothill oak woodlands. Forest industry lands encompassed much early-successional forest, most of the mixed hardwood-conifer forest, and large amounts of legacy down wood. The detailed tree- and species-level data in the maps revealed regional trends that would be masked in traditional coarse-filter assessment. Although abundant, most early-successional forests originated after timber harvest and lacked legacy live and dead trees important as habitat and for other ecological functions. Many large-conifer forests that might be classified as old growth using a generalized forest cover map lacked structural features of old growth such as multilayered canopies or dead wood. Our findings suggest that regional conservation planning include all ownerships and land allocations, as well as fine-scale elements of vegetation composition and structure.

It is even more difficult when the species of interest is also cryptic. We censused a population of one such species, the Western Ground Parrot ( Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), over several years to develop a monitoring protocol to assist in future management, extend understanding of its response to fire, and provide a model that could be used with other cryptic bird species. Abundance of Western Ground Parrots, monitored by means of calling frequencies, varied from year to year at a study site in Fitzgerald River National Park, south- western Australia. Frequency of calling increased significantly from 1996 to 2000. During this time, frequency of calling peaked in 1998 in part of the study site that had been unburnt for more than 40 years, and remained high in 2000. Frequency of calling was similar in a more recently burnt part of the study area except in May 1998, when frequency was lower following a fire that burnt part of this area five months previously. Frequency of calling dropped significantly in both the long unburnt and recently burnt areas between 2000 and 2004; exact reasons for this are unknown. Western Ground Parrots can use recently burnt vegetation where it is immediately adjacent to an established population, but do not need fire to create habitat, at least in the timescale of 40 years. The current monitoring protocol, where eight listening posts are counted approximately three times each, is capable of detecting an annual change in frequency of calling of similar to 13%. The number of listening posts would need to be increased to 14 in order to detect an annual change of 10%, and would need to be increased to 40 in order to detect an annual change of 5%.

The system is based on a simple multivariate linear model that uses four landscape characteristics as independent variables: canopy species type, distance from the nearest ridgeline, time since the last fire and canopy stem density. The model is shown to provide statistically significant estimates of richness when using observed independent variables. We developed models for estimating the four landscape characteristics from geospatial data consisting of remotely sensed imagery and a digital elevation model. We ran the model at the stand scale and the pixel scale and found that stand scale predictions were be more accurate that pixel scale predictions. We produced a map of vegetation species richness for Prince Alberta National Park in central Saskatchewan Canada that is consistent with our expectations. We also estimated the uncertainty in the four landscape characteristic estimates and developed a methodology for propagating this uncertainty through the system to produce estimates of uncertainty in the pixel-based richness predictions. While the uncertainty. is significant, the estimation and management of uncertainty in a mapping system of this type represents an innovation.

Successful restoration requires clearly defined objectives and the means to assess progress in meeting them. Often this includes monitoring population trajectories (changes in population size over time) of focal species. Unfortunately, population trajectories in and of themselves are often ambiguous and open to interpretation. Incorporation of additional information can increase the information content of such monitoring programs. Here we advocate using behavioral indicators, particularly the giving-up density (GUD) of food in experimental foraging patches, to complement more traditional monitoring programs that track changes in population sizes over time. We use the results of two field studies to demonstrate how GUDs reflect changes in environmental quality (background food abundance), changing physiological costs of maintenance over an annual cycle, and risk of predation. We then illustrate, through hypothetical examples, how knowledge of changes in GUDs over time can inform interpretation of actual population trajectories (based on 12 years of monitoring) of four bird species of conservation concern at the United States Forest Service Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois, USA. We conclude with a prospectus providing guidelines for incorporating behavioral indicators like the GUD in monitoring programs. Integrating behavioral indicators with more traditional population monitoring approaches provides an effective means of acquiring useful information in a timely and efficient manner.

However, placement of nest-holes within the same tree species differed among woodpecker species. Great Spotted- and Grey-faced Woodpeckers nested three meters lower (9 m) compared to Middle Spotted and Black Woodpeckers (12 m). Lesser Spotted- Woodpeckers excavated breeding holes relatively the highest in respect to tree height. With the exception of Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers, all specie used live trees as nest sites.

Efficiency of playback for assessing the occurrence of five bird species in Brazilian Atlantic Forest fragments	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS			English	Article	Physical, Chemical & Earth Sciences (PCES)	MULTIDISCIPLINARY	Science & Technology - Other Topics	playback, birds, forest fragments, methodology development, Atlantic forest, Sao Paulo State	TAPE-RECORDED CALLS, BROADCAST VOCALIZATIONS, PATCH-OCCUPANCY, ABUNDANCE, CONNECTIVITY, AUSTRALIA, RAILS, SIZE, SONG	Playback of bird songs is a useful technique for species detection; however, this method is usually not standardized. We tested playback efficiency for five Atlantic Forest birds (White-browed Warbler Basileuterus leucoblepharus, Giant Antshrike Batara cinerea, Swallow-tailed Manakin Chiroxiphia caudata, Whiteshouldered Fire-eye Pyriglena leucoptera and Surucua Trogon Trogon surrucura) for different time of the day, season of the year and species abundance at the Morro Grande Forest Reserve (South-eastem Brazil) and at thirteen forest fragments in a nearby landscape. Vocalizations were broadcasted monthly at sunrise, noon and sunset, during one year. For B. leucoblepharus, C. caudata and T surrucura, sunrise and noon were more efficient than sunset. Batara cinerea presented higher efficiency from July to October. Playback expanded the favourable period for avifaunal surveys in tropical forest, usually restricted to early morning in the breeding season. The playback was efficient in detecting the presence of all species when the abundance was not too low. But only B. leucoblepharus and T surrucura showed abundance values significantly related to this efficiency. The present study provided a precise indication of the best daily and seasonal periods and a confidence interval to maximize the efficiency of playback to detect the occurrence of these forest species.

The paper examines the influence of environmental variables, human distribution and ornithological preferences of birdwatchers on past avian sampling effort in Catalonia, a contrasting region in the north east of Spain.Location: Catalonia (Spain).Methods: The relationship between time (field days) devoted to sampling birds in 10 x 10 km UTM squares (from the records of VertebraCat database, across 5 study periods from 1900 to 2002) and a set of environmental, human distribution and bird species richness variables was analysed. These relationships were analysed by means of Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and multiple regression analyses.Results: A partial least squares regression analysis accounted for 39.4 % of the spatial variation in time devoted to avian sampling per UTM 10 x 10 km square in the most recent (1983 - 2002) period. The major pattern shows that large visit frequencies were mainly associated with coastal areas with a large cover of wetlands, marshes and sand dunes, high human population density, dense transportation, and also high covers of irrigated croplands, urban and industrial environments. Another group of highly visited UTM squares was also covered with a large surface of protected areas, mostly located in mountainous Catalonian sectors, as opposed to those UTM squares in lowland areas mainly covered by non-irrigated extensive croplands. Catalonian ornithologists and birdwatchers also showed an uneven preference for different groups of bird species, as they mainly relied on migratory and endangered species.Conclusions: The illustrated biased pattern of ornithological field work in Catalonia casts doubts about the usefulness of biodiversity indices obtainable from databases of observation records without a random-stratified sampling approach. However, these problems might be overcome by including a variable of sampling bias such as the number of records or days of field work.

Bird community changes in response to single and repeated fires in a lowland tropical rainforest of eastern Borneo	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	bird-habitat associations, disturbance, forest fire, guilds, lowland rain forest, repeated burning, southeast Asia, species composition, species diversity	CENTRAL BRAZILIAN AMAZONIA, SPECIES COMPOSITION, SURFACE FIRES, EL-NINO, LANDSCAPES, WILDFIRES, SUMATRA	Our current understanding of bird community responses to tropical forest fires is limited and strongly geographically biased towards South America. Here we used the circular plot method to carry out complete bird inventories in undisturbed, once burned (1998) and twice burned forests (1983 and 1998) in East Kalimantan (Indonesia). Additionally, environmental variables were measured within a 25 m radius of each plot. Three years after fire the number of birds and bird species were similar for undisturbed and burned forests, but species diversity and turnover were significantly lower in the burned forests. The bird species composition also differed significantly between undisturbed and burned forests, with a strong decline of closed forest preferring bird species accompanied by a strong increase in degraded forest preferring species in burned forests. These differences were strongly related to differences in environmental conditions such as shifts in vegetation cover and layering and differences in ground and understorey vegetation structure. We also found significant shifts in body mass distribution, foraging height and feeding guilds between the bird communities in unburned and burned forests. Surprisingly, repeated burning did not lead to increasing impoverishment of the avifauna, and both once and twice burned forests still contained most of the bird species that were also present in undisturbed forest, even though their densities were considerably lowered.

Rapid avifaunal collapse along the Amazonian deforestation frontier	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	birds, Brazil, habitat quality, remote sensing, rainforest, species-area relationships	HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, FOREST FRAGMENTATION, BRAZILIAN AMAZONIA, BIRD ASSEMBLAGES, EXTINCTION, AREA, BIOGEOGRAPHY, UNDERSTOREY, LANDSCAPES, RESPONSES	The combined effects of rapid habitat loss, fragmentation and disturbance on tropical forest avifaunas have not been examined to date. The southern Amazonian 'arc of deforestation' marks the boundary of the most aggressive agricultural frontier in tropical forests worldwide. We sampled 21 disturbed and undisturbed primary forest patches, ranging in size from 1.2 to 14,476 ha, to elucidate the synergistic effects of both forest disturbance and fragmentation on bird community structure, and pinpoint which species were the "winners" and "losers" from this process. A number of forest patch metrics, derived from an independent remote sensing approach, explained much of the resulting presence/absence matrix. The bird community exhibited a highly nested structure, with small patches being most dissimilar from one another. Bird species differed in their response to both forest patch size and forest canopy perforation according to their dependence on closed-canopy primary forest. Forest patch geometry, which clearly modulated the shape of species-area relationships accounted for 83-96% of the variation in species richness, but forest habitat quality resulting from logging and surface-fire disturbance was also a significant predictor of species richness for the most forest-dependent taxa.

Silviculture that sustains: the nexus between silviculture, frequent prescribed fire, and conservation of biodiversity in longleaf pine forests of the southeastern United States	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences		RED-COCKADED WOODPECKERS, PLANT-SPECIES DIVERSITY, NORTHWEST FLORIDA, COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, WIREGRASS SAVANNAS, STAND STRUCTURE, CAVITY TREES, PALUSTRIS, ECOSYSTEM, GROWTH	The longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forest ecosystems of the US southeastern Coastal Plain, among the most biologically diverse ecosystems in North America, originally covered over 24 x 106 ha but now occupy less than 5% of their original extent. The key factor for sustaining their high levels of diversity is the frequent application of prescribed fire uninterrupted in time and space. Pine fuels, critical to application of fire and regulated by canopy distribution, provide the nexus between silviculture and fire management in this system. Typical silvicultural approaches for this type were, in large part, developed to maximize the establishment and growth of regeneration as well as growth and yield of timber, with much less regard to how those practices might influence the ability to sustain prescribed burning regimes or the associated biodiversity. However, many landholdings in the region now include conservation of biodiversity as a primary objective with sustained timber yield as an important but secondary goal. This review synthesizes the literature related to controls of biodiversity for longleaf pine ecosystems, and silvicultural approaches are compared in their ability to Sustain natural disturbance such as fire and how closely they mimic the variation, patterns, and processes of natural disturbance regimes while allowing for regeneration.

The effects of postfire salvage logging on cavity-nesting birds	CONDOR			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	Black-backed Woodpecker, cavity-nesting birds, fire, healthy forests, salvage logging	PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS, BOREAL FOREST, CONIFER FORESTS, FIRE, COMMUNITIES, MANAGEMENT, WILDFIRE, PSEUDOREPLICATION, POPULATIONS, WASHINGTON	We investigated the effects of postfire salvage logging on cavity-nesting birds by comparing nest densities and patterns of nest reuse over a three-year period in seven logged and eight unlogged patches of mixed-conifer forest in the Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife Management Area, Montana. We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots, but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots. Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in the salvage-logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent species in the northern Rocky Mountains-American Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters, which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots, nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially populations of primary cavity-nesting species.

Reliable indicators would be useful when doing such assessments. In order to explore the potential indicators for species richness in boreal forests, we studied (1) the co-variation of species richness and composition of species assemblages among beetles, polypores, birds and vascular plants, (2) the relationships between species richness and four boreal forest site types, (3) the relationship between species richness and forest physical structure and (4) the suitability of potential indicator groups within the four taxa to predict the species richness generally. The data show that there are probably not a single taxonomic or forest structural characteristic to be used as a general biodiversity indicator or surrogate for all the species. The correlations in species richness among the four taxa studied were low. However, group-specific indicators were obvious: forest site type was a good surrogate for vascular plant richness, and quantity and quality of dead wood predicted the species richness of polypores. The results support the view that different indicators shall be used for different forest types and taxonomic groups. These indicators should facilitate relatively rapid methods to assess biodiversity patterns at the forest stand level. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hairy woodpecker winter ecology in ponderosa pine forests representing different ages since wildfire	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	Arizona, foraging behavior, hairy woodpecker, home range, Picoides villosus, Pinus ponderosa, ponderosa pine, prey resources, wildfire, winter ecology	CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS, FORAGING BEHAVIOR, HOME-RANGE, PILEATED WOODPECKER, NORTHERN ARIZONA, SAMPLE-SIZE, FIRE, DYNAMICS, BEETLES, HABITAT	We investigated how changes in vegetation structure and prey resources following wildfire affected the winter ecology of hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona, USA. Using point-counts, radiotelemetry, and focal bird observation, we assessed the relative abundance, home range size and composition, and habitat use by foraging hairy woodpeckers in 3 stands that had experienced wildfire in 1996, 2000, or 2002. Because we conducted the study over 2 years, we used the 1996 fire to represent 6 and 7 years after fire, while we used the 2000 fire to represent 2 and 3 years after fire in a space-for-time substitution chronosequence analysis. We also assessed bark beetle and woodborer density by x-raying bark samples collected from a subset of trees within burned areas. We detected significantly greater hairy woodpecker relative abundance in burned forests representing 1 and 2 years after fire, and bark beetle and woodborer density was highest in these stands as well. Woodpecker home range size increased across stands representing increasing time since fire. Within a burn, hairy woodpeckers used high-severity burned areas more than moderate-severity burned areas representing 2 and 3 years after fire, but not in areas representing 6 and 7 years after fire. Bark beetle and woodborer densities were also higher in high-severity burned stands representing 2 and 3 years after fire. Hairy woodpeckers used edges of high-severity burned areas more than the interior. We hypothesize that an initial increase in bark beetle and woodborer density following fire allowed for higher woodpecker abundance and smaller home ranges, but as burned forests aged, bark beetle and woodborer density within trees decreased, killed trees fell, and, in response, hairy woodpecker relative abundance decreased and home range size increased. These patterns suggest that high-severity burned areas provide important but ephemeral resources to this dominant primary cavity-nester. The higher bark beetle and woodborer densities and greater use of edges of high-severity burned areas by woodpeckers suggests that salvage logging of these areas could remove potential prey and preferred foraging areas for hairy woodpeckers, especially when trees are removed along severely burned edges.

Plants and breeding bird response on a managed Conservation Reserve Program grassland in Maryland	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	Ammodramus savannarum, Conservation Reserve Program, grasshopper sparrow, grassland restoration, habitat, invasive species, management, prescribed burning, species richness, vegetation structure, warm-season grasses	NEST PREDATION, HABITAT-AREA, PRAIRIE, COMMUNITIES, FIRE, PHYSIOGNOMY, FLORISTICS, VEGETATION, INDICATOR, PATTERNS	Currently over 14.6 million ha of land at an annual cost of US$1.76 billion are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CPP). The habitat benefits of CRP frequently are lauded, but documentation that wildlife is responding as hoped is urgently needed. We evaluated plant and breeding bird responses to 92.4 ha of CPP grasslands at China Farms in northeastern Maryland, USA. In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and facilitate stand establishment. In 6 years cumulative plant species richness increased to 261, 105 of which were species exotic to the region. During the third growing season, we initiated a schedule of prescribed burning on a 3-year rotation to remove accumulated litter and to retard woody succession, and in 2003 we added additional management to control aggressive plant species. Several at-risk bird species colonized the restored grasslands in the first year and established sustainable breeding populations. We implemented a comprehensive observation and banding program, which included mapping male territories for selected bird species and recording nest locations. We marked 1,985 grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; GRSPs) in 7 years. Breeding GRSP populations ranged annually from 70 to 90 socially monogamous pairs with an additional 40 non-territorial males. Annual return rates in the last 5 years were 57% for adult males, 41% for adult females, and 12% for hatch-year individuals. Adults and young birds exhibited high site fidelity, but overgrown fields left unburned for 2-3 years were unpopulated by GRSPs but attracted several shrub-land bird species. Habitat preference for territories was influenced more by vegetation structure than by plant species composition. We recommend the management of grasslands restored for birds include spatial and temporal rotation of prescribed fire and herbicide applications to sustain vegetation physical structure rather than species composition.

Image-derived data for live softwood shrub density, standing dead-tree basal area, distance to nearest fir-shrub cover type, along with a digital elevation model and point-count data, were used to supply regressor estimates in a multivariate logistic habitat model that was constructed from field vegetation sampling and point-count data. Spatially explicit predictions of probability of Bicknell's Thrush presence were made for each 28.5 x 28.5 m-pixel covering 70,000 ha. A model validation procedure using observations independent from model calibration revealed no difference (P > 0.05) between modeled and observed estimates of Bicknell's Thrush presence within probability deciles 0 to < 0.1, 0.1 to < 0.2, 0.2 to < 0.3, 0.3 to < 0.4, 0.5 to < 0.6, and 0.6 to < 0.7 with respective densities (40 ha(-1)) of 0.5, 1.6, 2.8, 4.1, 7.3, and 9.4. Transforming probabilities into relative abundance produced an estimated 4,900 Bicknell's Thrushes across the study area. Habitats supporting the highest density of Bicknell's Thrushes were predicted to be at the uppermost elevations. However, abundance estimates decreased even as density increased, owing to decreasing amounts of habitat area with increasing elevation, and suggested that lower-elevation, low-density habitats may support a significant fraction of Bicknell's Thrushes.

Associations of breeding birds with fire-influenced and riparian-upland gradients in a longleaf pine ecosystem	AUK			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	breeding birds, fire, longleaf pine, Pinus palustris, riparian habitat	PRESCRIBED FIRE, COMMUNITIES, FORESTS, FLORIDA, STANDS, RESTORATION, POPULATIONS	We determined the effects of fire history and a riparian-upland gradient on the breeding bird community at Fort Bragg Military Installation in North Carolina, one of the largest remnant areas of the endangered longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. Study sites were classified into two treatments: fire-intense (areas experiencing growing-season burns) and fire-suppressed (areas lacking fires). Within each treatment, bird and vegetation data were recorded at point-count stations positioned at three distances from streamhead pocosins to characterize the riparian-upland habitat gradient: 0, 75, and >= 150 m. Total bird abundance and species richness varied significantly along the riparian-upland gradient, with pocosins contributing greatly to avian biodiversity. Our data revealed strong effects of fire history and riparian-upland gradient on bird species, which we described in terms of breeding-bird assemblages. Members of the open longleaf assemblage (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker [Picoides borealis], Bachman's Sparrow [Aimophila aestivalis]) were most common in fire-intense areas and at upland locations. Members of the fire-suppressed assemblage (e.g., Wood Thrush [Hylocichla mustelina], Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapilla]) were confined to pocosins in fire-intense areas, but became more abundant in fire-suppressed areas. Members of the pocosin assemblage (e.g., Eastern Towhee [Pipilo erythropthalamus], Common Yellowthroat [Geothlypis trichas]) were largely confined to pocosins and, in some cases, were most abundant in fire-intense pocosins. Fire suppression increased structural diversity of vegetation and promoted one breeding-bird assemblage (fire-suppressed), but at the expense of two others (open longleaf, pocosin). Continued management of Fort Bragg to promote longleaf pine restoration is essential for supporting conservation of the open-longleaf bird assemblage; in addition, it will benefit the pocosin assemblage.

Antbirds is a large group of mainly insectivorous Neotropical passerines, usually well represented in bird communities from forested landscapes in Neotropical region. Territory sizes for three Antbirds, Thamnophilus caerulescens (Vieillot, 1816) (Variable Antshrike), Dysithamnus mentalis (Temmink, 1823) (Plain Antvireo) e Pyriglena leucoptera (Vieillot, 1818) (White-shouldered Fire-eye), were mapped and their area estimated by the convex polygon method in a 50 ha forest fragment, in southeastern Brazil. The three species presented small territories of similar sizes (:5 2 ha) both during the non-reproductive and the reproductive seasons of 2000-2001. Territories overlapped considerably among species but not intraspecifically. Territory sizes increased with body mass of the three species studied (P. leucoptera > T. caerulescens > D. mentalis). We failed to find any effect on territory size for the three species associated with forest edge or distance to the dirt road.

Leaving residual live trees in harvested areas is an important component of this strategy. However, the influence of this approach on songbird communities is largely unknown. We surveyed songbirds in 166 stands in the Rocky Mountains in BC, Canada, that had been logged or burned by wildfire. Stands were located in mid or high elevation biogeoclimatic zones, and varied from 7 to 45 years since disturbance and in density of residual trees from 0 to 320 conifer overstory, 0 to 832 conifer understory, and 0 to 68 broadleaf trees/ha. Although differences in bird communities between burned and logged stands of similar ages were detected, these differences were not consistent between biogeoclimatic zones, nor did they explain a large amount of the variation in bird communities. Logged stands had a higher density of birds, but expected species richness did not differ between logged and burned stands. All but a few rare species were detected in both disturbance types. Of 26 species analysed in detail, densities of 14 were greater in logged stands, 6 were greater in burned stands, and 6 were not significantly different between disturbance types. The bird community, bird abundance and densities of individual species were influenced by residual tree density and type. As time since disturbance increased, bird communities in burned and logged stands in the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir zone became more similar, but those in the Montane Spruce zone became less so, likely due to differences in residual tree density. Results suggest differences in bird communities in logged and burned stands >= 7 years post-disturbance are mainly in abundance rather than community composition, but abundances of individual species can be significantly influenced by residual tree density and type. Managers can influence the abundance of some species in harvested areas by manipulating the type and density of residual trees. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Distribution and relative abundance of forest birds in relation to burn severity in southeastern Arizona	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	Arizona, birds, burn severity, forest fire, fire suppression, J. T Marshall Jr.	POPULATIONS, PINE	The frequency of wild and prescribed fires in montane forests of the southwestern United States has increased after a century of fire suppression and subsequent fuels accumulation. To assess the effects of recent fires (median time since fire = 6 yr) on the montane forest bird community, we surveyed birds in 8 Sky Island mountain ranges in southeastern Arizona, USA, and examined how the distribution (i.e., presence-absence) of 65 species and relative abundance of 16 species correlated with evidence of severe and less severe fire at > 1,500 survey points. We detected associations between fire and bird presence-absence for 17% of the 65 species analyzed and between fire and bird relative abundance for 25% of the 16 species analyzed. Most species (73%) were positively associated with burned areas and displayed stronger associations (i.e., more extreme odds ratios) with survey points that had evidence of severe as opposed to less severe fire. Positive associations with severe fire were strong (> 3 to 1 odds) for western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and house wren (Troglodytes aedon), and negative associations with severe fire were strong for warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus) and red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis). Although recent fires appear to have had a positive effect on the distribution and relative abundance of several montane forest bird species in the region, these species are not the open-woodland birds that we would have expected to have benefited from fire based on previous research. Nevertheless, our results confirm associations between fire and bird presence-absence and relative abundance reported previously for 7 species of birds. Our results also provide new information for Grace's warbler Dendroica graciae) and greater pewee (C. pertinax), 2 species for which fire data were formerly lacking. Managers can use these data to make and test predictions about the effects of future fires, both severe and less severe, on montane forest birds in the southwestern United States.

Effects of environmental heterogeneity and disturbance on the native and non-native flora of desert springs	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	biodiversity, conservation, disturbance, intermediate disturbance, invasive species, management, nestedness, restoration, Spring Mountains, springs	NESTED SPECIES SUBSETS, BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, CONSERVATION, ECOLOGY, BIODIVERSITY, COMMUNITIES, ASSEMBLAGES, PATTERNS, PLANTS, BIRDS	Vegetation often is used as a decision variable for conservation and resource management. Because time and money are limited, it is useful to identify predictable relationships between measures of vegetation diversity or status, the physical environment, and disturbance; native and non-native plants may have different functional responses. Working towards development of effective, practical strategies for management and ecological restoration in the Spring Mountains, an isolated mountain range in the eastern Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA) that is a focus of regional conservation planning, we examined whether native and non-native assemblages of spring-associated perennial plants have predictable relationships with elevation, springbrook length, and various land uses. We also tested whether elevation, springbrook length, and overall disturbance were associated with the degree of predictability of local species presence and absence. Consistent with work in other systems, species richness and cover of native plants tended to decrease as intensity of disturbance increased, whereas species richness (but not cover) of non-native plants tended to peak with intermediate disturbance. Our results may suggest that invasions of non-native plants at springs in the Spring Mountains are relatively recent, and that rapid restoration and management actions may help protect ecological processes and viability of native plants. Ability to predict the order in which individual species are likely to be extirpated from or colonize springs was limited, perhaps reflecting considerable environmental heterogeneity among springs.

Phrygana differed significantly from maquis, in regard to the community metrics, composition and the homogeneity of bird assemblages. Moreover, detrended correspondence analysis ordered the census plots along a continuum of increasing vegetation height. On the other hand, within-maquis differences were few, while no significant differences were found within phrygana stages. Based upon the observed patterns, we recognise three vegetation groups: (1) phrygana, with low alpha-diversity and abundance and homogenous bird assemblages; (2) low maquis with relatively high alpha-diversity and heterogenous bird assemblages; and (3) tall maquis with relatively high alpha-diversity and heterogenous assemblages in which "woodland" bird species contribution is prominent.

In 2000 we conducted fixed-radius point count surveys at 172 sites encompassing burned and unburned sagebrush habitat and a range of juniper densities. For each bird species we developed habitat models using local variables measured in the field and landscape variables derived from remotely sensed data. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC(c)) was used to select the best-approximating model from a suite of a priori candidate models. Brewer's Sparrows, Sage Thrashers, and Green-tailed Towhees were positively related to increasing local sagebrush cover or percent sagebrush in the landscape, whereas Vesper Sparrows were negatively associated with sagebrush cover and positively related to increases in sagebrush fragmentation at local and landscape scales. Including a measure of juniper encroachment Substantially improved models for all species in the analysis. Green-tailed Towhees showed a curvilinear response to the amount of juniper in the landscape. All other species showed a strong negative relationship with juniper. Our results indicate that, although changes in sagebrush habitat associated with fire had a negative influence on sagebrush birds, juniper encroachment due to fire suppression also impacted this high-elevation sagebrush bird community.

We used avian ecological diversity as a proxy for evaluating the functionality of different types of urban green space. The urban landscape of the municipality of Orebro in Sweden was stratified into four strata (City centre, Residential, Greenway and Periphery). Bird species found in these strata were classified into four ecological groups with decreasing degree of specialisation (woodpeckers, hole-nesters, forest birds and urban birds). Overall there was lower bird species richness in the City centre and Residential areas compared to the Greenway and Periphery. Woodpeckers, hole-nesters and forest birds showed an increasing trend in the number of species as well as individuals from the City centre to the Periphery while urban birds showed the opposite trend. The amount and quality of green space as well as natural vegetation increased from the City centre to the Periphery. Species richness of woodpeckers, forest birds and hole-nesters were positively correlated with tree density while urban birds showed an inverse correlation. There was no dead wood in City centre, Residential and Greenway in contrast to the Periphery, which held some dying trees, stumps and old windthrows. Our findings emphasise the importance of urban green space with natural structures to maintain high ecological diversity. Finally, we discuss how conflicts between habitat for biodiversity maintenance and other functions of green space could be handled by zoning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, relatively little is known about the effects of fire on faunal biodiversity in savannas. We conducted a short-term study to examine the effects of a replicated experimental burn on bird diversity and abundance in savanna habitat of central Kenya. Twenty-two months after the burn, Shannon diversity of birds was 32% higher on plots that had been burned compared with paired control plots. We observed no significant effects of burning on total bird abundance or species richness. Several families of birds were found only on plots that had been burned; one species, the rattling cisticola (Cisticola chiniana), was found only on unburned plots. Shrub canopy area was negatively correlated with bird diversity on each plot, and highly correlated with grass height and the abundance of orthopterans. Our results suggest that the highest landscape-level bird diversity might be obtained through a mosaic of burned and unburned patches. This is also most likely to approximate the historical state of bird diversity in this habitat, because patchy fires have been an important natural disturbance in tropical ecosystems for millennia.

The mean 95% minimum convex polygon home-range size for males and females combined (n = 14) was 2.95 ha +/- 0.57 SE, across all habitats. Mean homerange size for males in mature pine stands (4.79 ha +/- 0.27, n = 4) was significantly larger than that in 4-year-old (3.00 ha +/- 0.31, n = 3) and 2-year-old stands (1.46 ha +/- 0.31, it = 3). Home-range sizes of paired males and females (it = 4 pairs) were similar within habitat type; mean distances between consecutive locations differed by habitat type and sex. We hypothesize that a gradient in food resources drives home-range dynamics.

The present study addresses the question of the conservation value for birds of clearcutting-related open areas in European temperate forest, in the context of a mixed woodland-farmland landscape. The point count technique was used to census the breeding birds on 300 sampling plots, distributed in the eight main habitat types of the Ardenne region (southern Belgium), including agricultural land, edge habitats, closed forest habitats and open areas in forest. Most of these open areas in forest derive from clearcutting practices, rapidly planted with young Norway Spruce (Picea abies). We quantified the conservation value of a given habitat type by using a "conservation value index", integrating the frequency of occurrence of each species in the considered habitat and their conservation status in Europe or in southern Belgium. Both conservation value index and species richness were higher for edge habitats and open areas in forest, compared to forest interior and agricultural land. Detrended Correspondence Analysis of the plot species lists showed that bird assemblages from open area in forest are not intermediate between forest and agricultural open land, as opposed to external edge habitats. Hence, open areas in forest do not contain bird assemblages composed of forest species mixed with colonizing agricultural species but rather shelter specific bird assemblages. An Indicator Species analysis further emphasized this specificity and identified seven species, which, in the Ardenne context, form a group of species specific to open areas in forest. Due to major changes of land use in the Ardenne during the 20th century, which leads to a tremendous decrease of moor, heath and fallow land areas, clearcut openings in the plantation forest progressively gained high conservation value at the regional scale. Further studies about habitat requirement of the conservation interest species inhabiting these open areas is needed, including a better understanding of how early-successional species react to forest planning. If plantation forestry evolves to an uneven-aged and more permanently closed forest, then other options, including semi-natural habitat restoration, are urgently required to save early-successional bird communities.

Primary conservation management goals for the Pinus palustris ecosystem include the perpetual regeneration of the fire-maintained forest and conservation of the characteristically high biological diversity and rare species. Several attributes, such as a sustained population of Picoides borealis (red-cockaded woodpecker), Aristida stricta (wiregrass)-dominated ground cover, and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones, can predict a diverse and ecologically functional ecosystem. Such indicators are linked to critical structural and functional features of the system and reflect previous land management histories that suggest sustainable approaches.Conclusions: A traditional definition of 'old-growth' relying on overstorey may be limited in describing important features of healthy, diverse Pinus palustris ecosystems. Some characteristics are significantly more important for maintenance of diversity than age of the trees and these features may be present in old- or second-growth forests. We advocate that the management history, structural characteristics and landscape context of stands that harbour desirable conservation attributes (red-cockaded woodpeckers, wiregrass, gopher tortoises and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones) can be used as indicators to identify important conservation and forest management principles.

Changes in bird communities throughout succession following fire and harvest in boreal forests of western North America: literature review and meta-analyses	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences		BRITISH-COLUMBIA, SONGBIRD COMMUNITIES, MIXEDWOOD FOREST, 3-TOED WOODPECKERS, MANAGED FORESTS, SIERRA-NEVADA, HABITAT, DYNAMICS, ALBERTA, POPULATIONS	Within boreal forests of western North America, the dominant large-scale natural disturbance is wildfire. Thus, harvesting that is as similar as possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities. We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds) from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies. Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a single forest type.

First, the breeding avifauna derived from standardized point counts was analysed using Stone & Roberts'C-score, and by a null model algorithm (fixed/equiprobable). Secondly, the analysis was repeated using all vertebrate species recorded in the succession.Results Sixty-five species were recorded in the 2-year study period in the four sample treatments. Birds were found to make up the largest component (63%) of the recorded assemblage. The BA treatment had the lowest species richness, followed in order by the small, medium and large FFs, and then by the CNBs. For both analyses (birds and total vertebrates), the C-scores were quite small and not significantly different from those that could be expected by chance in the BA and INT burned areas; this indicates a random co-occurrence among vertebrates of those assemblages. Contrariwise, for both analyses in the CNBs, the C-scores were large and significantly different from the simulated indices, thereby indicating a non-random co-occurrence pattern (segregation) of vertebrates in the undisturbed woodlands. In addition, C-score values for the surviving FFs show a significant aggregation of species.Main conclusions The null model analyses highlighted a new aspect of fire disturbance in Mediterranean woodland ecosystems: the disruption in patterns of co-occurrence in the terrestrial vertebrate community. Wildfire alters community organization, inducing, for at least 10 years, a random aggregate of species. Communities re-assemble themselves, showing the occurrence of species segregation at least 50 years after fire.

We considered habitat loss, the breaking apart of habitat patches, and habitat structural alteration critical processes that affect species distribution and abundance. We evaluated the effects of these processes by considering the response of selected indicator species to isolation (landscape scale), patch size and edge effect (patch scale), and habitat structure (plot scale). We used broadleaf forests as our case-study ecosystem and birds as indicator species. Faunal data came from a georeferenced, long-term, breeding-bird database, and environmental data were obtained from field surveys and land-use digital cartography. Birds, grouped according to their sensitivity to patch isolation, patch size, edge effect, and habitat structure, indicated how environmental conditions affected species abundance. The most sensitive group to the above-mentioned processes included the Marsh Tit (Parus palustris), Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), and Short-toed Treecreeper (Certhia brachydactyla). We evaluated the umbrella effect of these species for the conservation of the other co-occurring birds and found that their effectiveness varied according to the criterion used to select sites for protection. Site selection based on indicator species identified forest patches with greater species abundance than an alternative criterion that chose sites based on patch isolation and size, edge effect, and forest structure. The alternative criterion, although not as efficient as indicator species, may nevertheless be useful and effective for conservation when faunal data are lacking and guidelines for habitat management or restoration are needed. Our method is applicable to other ecosystems and taxa because the processes we considered occur in many ecosystems and may have significant effects on species from all taxonomic groups.

The different disturbance treatments had distinct effects on avian guild structure, and fire disturbance and the isolation of forest patches resulted in bird communities that were most divergent from those in continuous, undisturbed forest in terms of their species composition. Although low-intensity logging treatments had the least noticeable effects, the composition of understorey birds was still markedly different from the composition in undisturbed forest. This analysis demonstrates the importance of preventing habitat fragmentation and the spread of fires in humid tropical forests, and highlights the need for more research to determine the long-term suitability of large areas of degraded forest for forest birds.

We tested factors affecting nest survival, parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), and species abundance in shrubland habitat in rural and urban landscapes. We found no support for our hypothesis that nest survival was lower in urban landscapes, but strong support for the hypothesis that survival increased with nest height. We found strong support for our hypothesis that cowbird parasitism was greater in urban than rural landscapes; parasitism in urban sites was at least twice that of rural sites. We found strong support for an urban landscape effect on abundance for several species; Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Brown-headed Cowbirds were more abundant in urban landscapes, whereas Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla) and Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora pinus) were more abundant in rural sites. There was support for lower abundances of Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea) and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) with increased housing density. For six other species, edge and trail density or vegetation parameters best explained abundance. Lower abundances and greater parasitism in habitat patches in urban landscapes are evidence that, for some species, these urban landscapes do not fulfill the same role as comparable habitats in rural landscapes. Regional bird conservation planning and local habitat management in urban landscapes may need to consider these effects in efforts to sustain bird populations at regional and local scales.

Peatlands have suffered great losses following drainage for agriculture, forestry, urbanisation, or peat mining, near inhabited areas. We evaluated the faunal and vegetation patterns after restoration of a peatland formerly mined for peat. We assessed whether bog pools created during restoration are similar to natural bog pools in terms of water chemistry, vegetation structure and composition, as well as amphibian and arthropod occurrence patterns.2. Both avian species richness and peatland vegetation cover at the site increased following restoration. Within bog pools, however, the vegetation composition differed between natural and man-made pools. The cover of low shrubs, Sphagnum moss, submerged, emergent and floating vegetation in man-made pools was lower than in natural pools, whereas pH was higher than in typical bog pools. Dominant plant species also differed between man-made and natural pools.3. Amphibian tadpoles, juveniles and adults occurred more often in man-made pools than natural bog pools. Although some arthropods, including Coleoptera bog specialists, readily colonised the pools, their abundance was two to 26 times lower than in natural bog pools. Plant introduction in bog pools, at the stocking densities we applied, had no effect on the occurrence of most groups.4. We conclude that our restoration efforts were partially successful. Peatland-wide vegetation patterns following restoration mimicked those of natural peatlands, but 4 years were not sufficient for man-made pools to fully emulate the characteristics of natural bog pools.

We used a replicated landscape study to evaluate relationships between forest structure and avian diversity at both stand and landscape-levels. We used data on bird communities collected under comparable sampling protocols on four managed forests located across the Southeastern US to develop logistic regression models describing relationships between habitat factors and the distribution of overall richness and richness of selected guilds. Landscape models generated for eight of nine guilds showed a strong relationship between richness and both availability and configuration of landscape features. Diversity of topographic features and heterogeneity of forest structure were primary determinants of avian species richness. Forest heterogeneity, in both age and forest type, were strongly and positively associated with overall avian richness and richness for most guilds. Road density was associated positively but weakly with avian richness. Landscape variables dominated all models generated, but no consistent patterns in metrics or scale were evident. Model fit was strong for neotropical migrants and relatively weak for short-distance migrants and resident species. Our models provide a tool that will allow managers to evaluate and demonstrate quantitatively how management practices affect avian diversity on landscapes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Two control plots were monitored in each of 2 yr. Food was Supplemented on five plots over 2 yr with piles of cut oranges distributed around plots, which served as a direct source of carbobydrates and water, and an indirect Source of ground arthropods due to increased above-ground activity. We reduced ants on five plots over 2 yr; however, We found no difference in total ground arthropod biomass between control and reduction treatments, so we pooled these plots For analysis. We selected nine focal resident bird species for study of relative abundance, body condition, and breeding condition. Birds were sampled prior to, and 5 to 6 weeks after the initiation of treatments. Seven of nine species had higher relative abundance following food supplementation. Three species were recaptured more frequently in supplementation plots than in control plots. These abundance and persistence responses did not Cause any changes in body condition. In one species, Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), food supplementation resulted in higher concentrations of individuals in breeding condition. These results demonstrated Functional response to dry-season food availability and suggest a limiting mechanism. This Study helps explain mechanisms by which bird populations respond to resource availibility, and is the first Successful plot-level food supplementation experiment for tropical forest birds.

A 5-year field experiment was carried out at a rural, mid-elevation site at Le Mouret (Switzerland) to investigate the effect of elevated O(3) on yield and species composition of a permanent, extensively managed, species-rich old pasture. Using a free-air fumigation system, circular plots of 7 m diameter were exposed to either ambient air (control plots) or to air containing O(3) of approximately 1.5 x ambient concentrations. The resulting accumulated O(3) exposure over the threshold of 40 ppb for one season ranged from 13.3 to 59.5 ppm h in the elevated O(3) plots, and from 1.0 to 20.7 ppm h in the control plots. Subplots in each ring were harvested three times each year, and harvested biomass was separated into functional groups (FGs) (grasses, legumes, forbs). Productivity in both treatments decreased over time, but the yield of O(3)-exposed plots decreased faster than that of the control plots, with the reduction being twice as large by the end of the fifth season. Compared with the ambient air control, loss in annual dry matter yield was 23% after 5 years. The change in annual biomass production because of O(3) stress was accompanied by a change in the fractions of FGs, with the legume fraction showing a strong negative response. Such long-term effects of O(3) stress could have negative implications for the maintenance of biological diversity in rural landscapes across large areas of Europe. The results from this first long-term experiment show that a moderately elevated O(3) level reduces the productivity of intact grasslands during a 5-year exposure under real field conditions.

The effects of vegetation structure on the birds in a tropical savanna woodland in north-eastern Australia	RANGELAND JOURNAL			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	avian species richness, clearing, composition, thickening, thinning	SPECIES-DIVERSITY, ATMOSPHERIC CO2, NATIONAL-PARK, SOIL TEXTURE, TERRITORY, FOREST, FIRE, VERTEBRATES, GRASSLANDS, FAUNA	Management of the dynamics of woody vegetation in Australia's tropical savannas is a vexing issue for both pastoralists and conservation biologists. In savanna regions around the world, increasing density of woody vegetation contributes to declines in pastoral productivity, but its effects on native fauna are largely unknown. In this paper we examine the avifauna in savanna woodlands of varying structure in the Desert Uplands bioregion, Queensland. Vegetation cover maps derived from aerial photographs were used to choose 60 sites, across 4 cattle stations. We sampled sites mapped at 30-45% and 45-60% foliage cover, and areas which previously had these levels of cover but had been mechanically modified, both by broad scale clearing and selective thinning. Between May and June 2004, we measured a range of habitat variables and sampled the birds at each site. Bird species composition varied significantly between treatments. Bird richness and frequency was greatest in intact vegetation. Thirteen species of birds were most frequently encountered in sites with 30-45% canopy cover, compared with 10 species in the 45-60% cover sites, 4 species in the thinned sites and 7 in the cleared sites. Our results suggest that increasing density of woody vegetation in savanna woodland may be to the advantage of some savanna bird species. Mechanical modi. cation to reduce woody vegetation appears to also benefit some common, widespread species, but has a generally negative overall effect on bird species richness.

Species richness was 25% greater in forested stands compared to clearcut areas, yet total bird density was 50% greater in clearcut areas. Bird communities ranged from open-habitat assemblages in clearcut areas to forest-obligate assemblages in ST stands. Little overlap of avian community composition was observed between ST stands and clearcut areas. PT and SS stands supported avian communities where most species were observed at intermediate abundance values compared to ST or clearcut areas. Highly fragmented, closed-canopy stands embedded within the silvicultural landscape of HSNF do not support large populations of species traditionally associated with detrimental edge effects on forest-obligate songbirds. Intensively managed PT and SS stands appear to provide suboptimal habitat for forest and grassland species. Land managers in HSNF could maximize regional avian diversity by maintaining a mosaic of large closed-canopy, oak-pine stands, and fire-maintained open areas embedded among other silvicultural stand types.

In this study, spatial patterns of bird diversity in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, were examined and associated with local-scale (habitat structure and heterogeneity) and landscape-scale (logging, slope position and elevation) environmental variables. Within the study area (c. 196 km(2)) local habitat structure and heterogeneity varied considerably, largely due to logging. In total 9747 individuals of 177 bird species were recorded. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) revealed that the best explanatory models of bird community similarity and species richness included both local- and landscape-scale environmental variables. Important local-scale variables included liana abundance, fern cover, sapling density, tree density, dead wood abundance and tree architecture, while important landscape-scale variables were elevation, logging and slope position. Geographic distance between sampling sites was not significantly associated with spatial variation in either species richness or similarity. These results indicate that deterministic environmental processes, as opposed to dispersal-driven stochastic processes, primarily structure bird assemblages within the spatial scale of this study and confirm that highly variable local habitat measures can be effective means of predicting landscape-scale community patterns.

Partners in Flight guidelines recommend painted bunting conservation as a high priority with a need for management by state and federal agencies. Basic information on home range and survival of breeding painted buntings will provide managers with required habitat types and estimates of land areas necessary to maintain minimum population sizes for this species. We radiotracked after-second-year male and after-hatching-year female buntings on Sapelo Island, Georgia, during the breeding seasons (late April-early August) of 1997 and 1998. We used the animal movement extension in ArcView to determine fixed-kernel home range in an unmanaged maritime shrub and managed 60-80-year-old pine (Pinus spp.)-oak Quercus spp.) forest. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we estimated an adult breeding season survival of 1.00 for males (n = 36) and 0.94 (SE = 0.18)for females(n=27). Painted bunting home ranges were smaller in unmanaged maritime shrub (female: kernel (x) over bar = 3.5 ha [95% CI: 2.5-4.51; male: kernel (x) over bar = 3.1 ha [95% CI: 2.3-3.9]) compared to those in managed pine-oak forests (female: kernel (x) over bar = 4.7 ha [95% CI: 2.8-6.6]; male: kernel (x) over bar = 7.0 ha [95% CI: 4.9-9.1]). Buntings nesting in the managed pine-oak forest flew long distances (>= 300 m) to forage in salt marshes, freshwater wetlands, and moist forest clearings. In maritime shrub buntings occupied a compact area and rarely moved long distances. The painted bunting population of Sapelo Island requires conservation of maritime shrub as potential optimum nesting habitat and management of nesting habitat in open-canopy pine-oak sawtimber forests by periodic prescribed fire (every 4-6 years) and timber thinning within a landscape that contains salt marsh or freshwater wetland openings within 700 m of those forests.

An individual-based spatially explicit population model was developed to investigate these factors using the distribution of nuthatches in an area of eastern England as an example. The effects of immigration and increasing the area of breeding quality habitat were explored. Predictions were compared with observed population sizes in the study area. Our model combined a nuthatch population simulator based on individual behaviour with a grid-based representation of the landscape; nuthatch life cycle and immigration parameters were user selectable. A novel aspect of the model is user-selection of habitat perceptual range. Using a realistic set of parameters, the number of breeding pairs predicted by the model matched observed numbers. According to model simulations, the main cause of nuthatch scarcity in the study area was the inability of patches to support viable populations without immigration from elsewhere. Modelled habitat management, which increased breeding quality habitat in existing woods, lowered the threshold above which the study area population became self-sustaining. The existence of a large core habitat area was critical in producing a self-sustaining population in this landscape, the same area in dispersed small woods failed to sustain populations.

We took advantage of a unique opportunity to use a before-after/control-impact (BACI) approach to analyze changes in bird assemblages after the severe fires of 2000 in the Bitterroot Valley, Montana. Observers surveyed birds using 10-minute point counts and collected vegetation data from 13 burned and 13 unburned transects for five years before fire and three years after fire. We compared changes in vegetation variables and relative bird abundance from before to after fire between the set of points that burned and the set of points that did not burn. The magnitude of change in vegetation variables from before to after fire increased with fire severity. The relative abundances of nine bird species showed significantly greater changes from before to after fire at burned points compared with unburned points. Moreover, when burned points were separated by whether they burned at low, moderate, or high severity, an additional 10 species showed significant changes in relative abundance from before to after fire at one or more severities. Overall, almost twice as many bird species increased as decreased significantly in response to fire. We also found changes in abundance between one year after and two years after fire for most species that responded to fire. Thus, species that have been termed "mixed responders" in the literature appear to be responding differently to different fire severities or different time periods since fire, rather than responding variably to the same fire conditions. These findings underscore the importance of fire severity and time since fire and imply that both factors must be considered to understand the complexities of fire effects on biological communities. Because different bird species responded positively to different fire severities, our results suggest a need to manage public lands for the maintenance of all kinds of fires, not just the low-severity, understory burns that dominate most discussions revolving around the use of fire in forest restoration.

We monitored dynamics of snag populations on 1-ha plots in southwestern mixed-conifer (n = 53 plots) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa, n = 60 plots) forests in north-central Arizona from 1997 to 2002. Of 2,240 snags marked in 1997, at least 76% remained standing in 2002, 17% had fallen and were relocated as logs, 0.5% were cut down, and the remainder (6%) were unaccounted for. Snag density increased significantly in mixed-conifer forest but not in ponderosa pine forest. Snag density increased mainly in the smaller size classes in both forest types. Density of large snags (>= 46 cm in diameter and 9 m in height) increased slightly but non significantly from 1997 levels in both forest types, and fell below current targets for retention. Species composition of snags differed between 1997 and 2002 in ponderosa pine forest, but not in mixed-conifer forest, and decay-class distributions differed among years in both forest types. A classification-tree analysis indicated that a ratio of height to diameter, species, and diameter were key variables in predicting whether a snag survived from 1997 to 2002. These results provide empirical data on snag populations and dynamics in this area and establish a basis for longer-term monitoring of snag populations and dynamics.

This study examined the assemblage of polypores and polypore-associated beetles at the edge of mature managed spruce-dominated forests and clear-cuts. The highest number of polypore occurrences and the greatest diversity of polypore species occurred at the clear-cut. In south-facing edges polypores occurred closer to the edge both in clear-cut and in forest than in the north-facing edges. The number of polypore-associated beetle individuals was greatest in the clear-cut, but there was no effect of edge on species richness of beetles. Orientation of the edge had no effect on the distribution of beetles in clear-cut, but in the forest beetles were closer to the edge in south-facing edges than in north-facing edges. The higher density of individuals and greater diversity of species in clear-cut may result from the rapid, short-term increase in dead-wood resource.

This study describes a number of structural and compositional parameters in Vaccinium vitis-idaea pine forest over a wide range of stand age and management intensity values. A robust index was developed to describe management intensity: area-weighted sum of anthropogenic activities, based on the forest management database. After the removal of forest age effect, forest management intensity had a negative influence on spruce abundance, number of diameter classes, basal area and number of decay classes of dead wood. Stepwise logistic regression analysis produced the optimal set of indicators for the evaluation of dry boreal forest naturalness: basal area of lying dead wood, structural variation of the tree layer, herb-layer species composition and presence/absence of woodpeckers.

Wildfires can increase or decrease the availability of snags to wildlife by killing live trees or incinerating snags. Our objectives were to describe dynamics and spatial patterns of fire-killed snags in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona and predict the probability of snag use by cavity nesters. We established six 1-ha plots following two recent fires that occurred in northern Arizona (Hochderffer fire of 1996 [H96] and Pumpkin fire of 2000 [P00]) to determine ponderosa pine snag availability and use by wildlife as evidenced by presence of excavated cavities. For comparison, six paired 1-ha plots in nearby unburned areas were sampled with burned plots. For the twelve 1 ha plots, field methods included mapping and measuring 15 characteristics for 668 snags (630 in burned and 38 in unburned plots) 4 years post-fire on the H96 fire, and 1010 snags (996 in burned and 14 in unburned plots) 1 year post-fire on the POO fire. We remeasured characteristics of all snags in 2003. Most burned snags were standing 3 years after fire, but 7 years after fire, 41% had fallen. Snags in burned plots were clumped when initially measured and remeasured. After 7 years, snags in burned plots that were still standing were straight, large diameter trees in denser clumps. Density of excavated cavities was similar between burned (3.0 ha(-1)) and unburned (2.2 ha(-1)) plots, even though burned areas produced much higher densities of snags. Snags (both burned and unburned) that were most likely to contain excavated cavities were large diameter with broken tops. This evidence of cavity nester use indicates that in ponderosa pine forests in the southwest, retaining large diameter snags is important to cavity nesters regardless of snag origin. If salvage logging is to occur in severely burned ponderosa pine in the southwest, retaining straight, large diameter snags in clumps will help maintain snags for cavity-excavating species.

Surveys were conducted on permanent, 25 ha mine and control plots. Five metrics (relative density of individual species, relative density of all birds, species richness using rarefaction curves, and species diversity using two indices) were used to assess potential impacts up to a distance of 1 km from the mine. Six species were more common on mine plots, and three were more common on control plots. Species diversity was slightly higher on mine plots when measured with Fisher's alpha index. No other metrics suggested strong impacts. This study suggests that the mine has had a relatively limited impact on the upland breeding bird community within 1 km of the footprint but has provided habitat for at least one synanthropic bird species. Further monitoring of breeding birds on the tundra should include pre-development control data and demographic variables such as reproductive success and survival.

In particular, there is no information on the effects of widespread biomass extraction such as grazing and firewood collection. A study was carried out in Sariska Tiger Reserve in northern India, to investigate the effects of biomass extraction on forest vegetation composition, diversity and structure. Biomass extraction caused significant changes in forest vegetation structure and species composition in the tree layer but the extent of these changes varied across the three major vegetation types found in the Reserve. Anogeissus-dominated slope forest showed significantly lower mean canopy cover, tree density, tree basal area and height of trees in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Riparian forest showed lower mean canopy cover, tree basal areas and number of recorded tree species in disturbed sites. Scrub forest had lower mean canopy cover, tree basal area and tree height. There were fewer tall trees but greater number of short trees in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types. Girths of trees similarly shifted towards lower values in riparian and scrub forest. In Anogeissus-dominated forest, disturbed and undisturbed sites did not differ in proportions of trees in various girth-classes. Tree species richness was substantially lower in disturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated and riparian forest in comparison to undisturbed sites, but was not affected by disturbance in scrub forest. Understorey species richness was higher in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types but understorey changed structurally only in Anogeissus-dominated forest. Overall tree and understorey species composition was significantly different between disturbed and undisturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated forest, but was unchanged in scrub and riparian forest. Observed changes in vegetation structure, diversity and composition of the different vegetation types due to biomass extraction have implications for biodiversity conservation in tropical dry forest ecosystems, and need to be addressed in future forest management planning.

However, little is known about the within-season, short-term response of wetland birds to prescribed burning, especially during spring migration. We surveyed use of 19 burned and 19 unburned (reference) wetlands by migratory birds in the Rainwater Basin region of Nebraska, USA during three spring migrations, 2002-2004. We calculated the change in avian abundance and species richness, as well as generating the Sorenson's similarity index for burned and reference wetlands in the weeks immediately before and after burning. We compared Sorenson's index values and percent change in abundance and species richness between burned and reference wetlands using an analysis of covariance with week and wetland area as covariates to account for migration chronology and differences in the area of experimental units. Following removal of effects due to wetland area and week, burning had no effect on the percent change in avian abundance and species richness. Sorenson's index also did not differ between burned and reference wetlands. Prescribed burning did not improve use of wetlands by migratory birds in the short term. Understanding the immediate and long-term effects of prescribed burning on migratory avian abundance, species richness, and community composition is imperative for management decisions.

Activities must be guided by sound scientific principles, practical conservation tools, and clear priorities. With perhaps one-third of the world's flora facing extinction, scientists and conservation managers will need to work rapidly and collaboratively, recognizing each other's strengths and limitations. As a guide to assist managers in maintaining plant diversity, six pragmatic models are introduced that are already available. Although theoretical models continue to receive far more space and headlines in scientific journals, more managers need to understand that pragmatic, rather than theoretical, models have the most promise for yielding results that can be applied immediately to plant communities.Six Pragmatic Models For each model, key citations and an array of examples are provided, with particular emphasis on wetlands, since 'wet and wild' was my assigned theme for the Botanical Society of America in 2003. My own work may seem rather prominent, but the application and refinement of these models has been a theme for me and my many students over decades. The following models are reviewed: (1) species-area: larger areas usually contain more species; (2) species-biomass: plant diversity is maximized at intermediate levels of biomass; (3) centrifugal organization: multiple intersecting environmental gradients maintain regional landscape biodiversity; (4) species-frequency: a few species are frequent while most are infrequent; (5) competitive hierarchies: in the absence of constraints, large canopy-forming species dominate patches of landscape, reducing biological diversity; and (6) intermediate disturbance: perturbations such as water level fluctuations, fire and grazing are essential for maintaining plant diversity.Conclusions The good news is that managers faced with protecting or restoring landscapes already have this arsenal of tools at their disposal. The bad news is that far too few of these models are appreciated.

At the species level, the relationship was explored between habitat breadth, distribution extent and the ability to occupy recently burned areas.Location: Iberia and Southern FranceMethods: Fieldwork and bibliography were assembled to obtain breeding bird inventories for 21 burned areas, mostly large wildfires (135-23,800 ha). The sampling effort was standardized in relation to the area in the I I fire locations surveyed using transects.Results: Single burned areas contained 0 to 15 open-habitat species (mean = 7.6), and in all the areas combined there were 22 species, including 17 with an unfavourable conservation status in Europe. The most frequent were Carduelis cannabina, Lullula arborea, Alectoris rufa, Oenanthe hispanica and Emberiza cia, but characteristic steppe-land birds such as O. leucura, Calandrella brachydactyla and C. rufescens also bred in particular burned areas. After controlling for the extent of the species range in the Spanish distribution Atlas, passerine occurrence in burned areas was positively related to the species' habitat breadth in a gradient of unburned habitats. Cluster analysis separated a species-poor group of fire locations from a species-rich group, and showed that some neighbouring areas had a similar species composition. However, there was no spatial autocorrelation between burned areas, and species composition was correlated with the fire extent (Mantel test). Species richness tended to increase with increasing fire area. From the regression equation 5, 9, 12-13 and 16-17 open-habitat species may be expected to occur in burned areas of 100, 1000, 10,000 and 100,000 ha, respectively.Conclusions: This study stresses the importance of biogeographical constraints on colonisation of new habitat patches created by disturbances. The extent of the fire rather than the proximity between burned areas influenced species richness and composition of open-habitat birds in recently burned areas. The best post-fire colonisers were generalists regarding habitat structure. The role of large wildfires in the conservation of threatened open-habitat birds seems to be significant and merits further study.

We found that forests that were selectively logged at least 30 years ago contained only 73-75% of the 159 species of extant primary forest birds, with an increased proportion of dominant species. We estimated that only 28-32% of the primary forest species utilized the mixed-rural habitat, and that the number of species that bred in the agricultural landscapes might be even lower. The microhabitat of different species most affected their vulnerability to disturbance. Most small, arboreal frugivores and omnivores, and insectivores that fed from tree trunks, showed greater persistence in the mixed-rural habitat than ground dwelling bird species, which were affected most by disturbance. Resource abundance and variables that were closely related to forest disturbance such as the density of large trees, density of dead trees, canopy cover density and shrub volume influenced the distribution of the primary forest birds. Large primary forest reserves and a revision of short-cycle logging regimes (ca. 30 years) are needed if we are to conserve the lowland rainforest avifauna of Peninsular Malaysia and other parts of Southeast Asia.

This paper briefly reviews the scientific literature on the impacts of sprawl on biological diversity, with specific emphasis on the influence of sprawl on non-native species richness. We then explore the relationship between sprawl and biodiversity using a data set of ant species collected from 46 habitat patches located in the increasingly suburbanized Florida Keys, USA. We quantified sprawl as the proximity of roads and amount of development surrounding a habitat patch. Using bait transects, we identified 24 native and 18 non-native species of ants. Neither the overall number of native species nor the number of rare native species were significantly affected by the amount of development or proximity to roads, however, the number of non-native species was significantly correlated with the amount of development. Surprisingly, the number of native species and rare native species was significantly positively correlated with the number of non-native species. Areas that supported many species of native ants also supported a diverse non-native ant fauna, and the species distribution was highly nested. Currently, the native ant fauna of the Florida Keys does not appear to be dramatically influenced by sprawl, however, if development increases, the number of non-native ants may increase, and many of these species have been documented as decreasing native ant diversity. If development plateaus, there is evidence that the native ant fauna could persist and could decrease non-native species richness through competition or predation.

Birds were censused by point counts at Ankarafantsika, one of the largest remnants of the severely reduced dry deciduous forest. The original forest was dominated by foliage insectivores. A few years after wildfire, regrowth was dense, most forest bird species were still present and additional understorey species appeared. As a result, species richness and abundance per point count increased. In contrast, when forest was transformed into savanna, the avian assemblage became poor, dominated by granivores and aerial insectivores, with only seven species shared with the original forest. Foliage volume, grass volume and bare ground cover explained most of the bird community variation by means of canonical correspondence analysis. Birds tended to increase their habitat breadth along the forest-savanna gradient. An index of bird conservation value, including abundance, endemism and the threatened status of the species, was highest in burned forests (1.12), intermediate in unburned forests (1) and lowest in savanna (0.44). The results emphasise the urgent need to protect not only the undisturbed fragments, but also the burned dry forests, because of their high value for biodiversity.

Forest bird assemblages in a natural grassland matrix displayed a nested non-random species distribution. Species loss was significantly area-dependent and predictable. Assemblages in the plantation-dominated matrix were also nested but were neither area- nor isolation-dependent and these potential processes had equal influence over bird species composition. Forests patches <50 ha in plantation were more species rich than those in a grassland matrix and visa versa for patches >50 ha. The effect of the matrix is revealed here with arboreal plantation cover promoting dispersal across the landscape, favouring abundant generalist bird species in smaller patches than expected in the plantation matrix, and the loss of some specialists and species living at low densities from large (>50 ha) patches. Because of a significant species-area relationship and possible area-dependent extinction, the largest forest patch in the nested series in a grassland matrix protects most bird species (89%). However, in a plantation matrix the absence of a species-area relationship requires the combination of many larger forest patches to protect most bird species. Plantation forests in the matrix significantly alter forest bird assemblage structure and composition. To avoid the effects of insularisation and to maintain the viability of bird communities in Afromontane forests requires conservation of the larger forests in a natural matrix. However, for forests in a plantation matrix, the management of dispersal processes by manipulation of the matrix may be as important to conserving species and communities as is minimising extinctions. Avoiding placing plantations near large forests, increasing the size of small patches, and where afforestation is unavoidable, placing plantations in the vicinity of small rather than large. forest patches, are preferable management practices.

First, post-disturbance colonization is not limited by the dispersal ability of the species to reach the newly created open areas and, secondly, colonization is limited by dispersal. Under the first hypothesis, we expect, at a regional scale, to find similar post-disturbance communities to develop on recently burned sites. However, colonization limited by dispersal will lead to strong between-site variations in species composition.Location To test these hypotheses, we studied the post-fire colonization patterns of nine open-habitat bird species in eight distantly located wildfires in the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula.Methods We censused post-fire bird composition by means of field transects and identified potential colonization sources from species-habitat suitability maps derived from atlas data.Results Our results showed strong significant differences in post-fire species composition between burnt areas. Burnt areas located in areas with low probability of species presence before the fire event showed lower species occurrence and richness after the fire.Main conclusions These results do not support the idea that early successional stages and open habitats have a homogeneous community structure at regional scales and suggest that dispersal is a key constraint determining bird colonization of post-fire habitats. Further attention should be paid to landscape heterogeneity as a key factor in determining population dynamics of open-habitat species in the light of current and future land-use changes in Mediterranean regions.

Yet exurban development is an increasingly prevalent form of human settlement in many parts of the world. Moreover because such development often occurs near the periphery of protected areas, it may have a disproportionate influence on native species. We examined bird community patterns in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado across a gradient of exurban development to determine how avifauna responded to this form of settlement. Using fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed the occurrence and abundance of breeding birds in 11 developed sites and in 6 nearby undeveloped sites, all occurring in a forested matrix. We sampled ground-level habitat features at each survey point and derived digital land-cover maps from aerial photographs to characterize and quantify road development and building density. We found little evidence that land-cover varied with development intensity, yet bird abundance increased significantly with building density. Patterns of species richness were equivocal due to a highly influential observation. Principal components analysis (PCA) distinguished two axes that explained nearly 50% of the variation in the bird community and were strongly associated with road and building density. Weighted average analysis showed a marked decline in the abundance and richness of species that were insectivorous or nested in snags, suggesting that reductions in dead wood may have influenced the bird community. However, no conclusions could be drawn because dead wood was confounded with building density. Logistic regression of species occurrence and building density indicated that the incidence of some generalist species increased with building density, whereas the incidence of specialists decreased. Overall, our results suggest that development at low densities can favor habitat generalists. Similar patterns have been observed in more urbanized areas. If exurban development persists as a popular form of settlement in the Rocky Mountains, a regional plan for protecting avian habitat and limiting development dispersion will be necessary to maintain native bird communities.

Over the last quarter of the 20th century, dramatic declines in both range and abundance of many species associated with farmland have been reported in Europe, reading to growing concern over the sustainability of current intensive farming practices. Purportedly 'sustainable' farming systems such as organic farming are now seen by many as a potential solution to this continued loss of biodiversity and receive substantial support in the form of subsidy payments through ELF and national government legislation. This paper assesses the impacts on biodiversity of organic farming, relative to conventional agriculture, through a review of comparative studies of the two systems, in order to determine whether it can deliver on the biodiversity benefits its proponents claim. It identifies a wide range of taxa, including birds and mammals, invertebrates and arable flora, that benefit from organic management through increases in abundance and/or species richness. It also highlights three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilisers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming, and that are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife. However, the review also draws attention to four key issues: (1) It remains unclear whether a 'holistic' whole-farm approach (i.e. organic) provides greater benefits to biodiversity than carefully targeted prescriptions applied to relatively small areas of cropped and/or non-cropped habitats within conventional agriculture (i.e. agri-environment schemes); (2) Many comparative studies encounter methodological problems, limiting their ability to draw quantitative conclusions; (3) Our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming in pastoral and upland agriculture is limited; (4) There remains a pressing need for longitudinal, system-level studies in order to address these issues and to fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming, before a full appraisal of its potential role in biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems can be made.

Bird surveys were started in 1996 on two burned and two unburned sections of the park to determine what effects the burning and subsequent changes in vegetation were having on bird populations. Birds were sampled at 17 60-m radius point counts on each study area; each point was sampled twice per year during the main breeding period from 1996 through 2002. Total abundance and species richness differed among the four areas but no differences could be attributed to burning. Some individual species, however, differed in abundance and frequency of occurrence between burned and unburned areas. For example, Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), and several species of woodpeckers were more abundant on burned areas; Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vemivorous), Wood Thrush (Hylocicla mustelina) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) were among the species more abundant on unburned areas. As a consequence, overall community composition differed significantly between burned and unburned areas of the park, but did not differ between burned areas or between unburned areas. Prescribed burning was instituted to restore vegetation to presettlement conditions and has started to achieve that objective. Restoration also has affected and likely will continue to affect bird populations. Future maintenance of a full complement of bird species, including a number of neotropical migrants, will be dependent on presence of both burned and unburned forest habitat. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Coffee is produced in tropical regions of the world, largely in Latin America. Coffee cultivation techniques range from traditional systems, where coffee grows under a diverse canopy of shade trees (shade-coffee plantations), to modern systems, where coffee grows without any type of shade (sun-coffee plantations). Shade-coffee plantations provide refuge for forest fauna in otherwise deforested landscapes. The conservation value of these agro-ecosystems depends upon their structural and floristic diversity.2. The way coffee producers manage the vegetation, including the epiphytic component, may profoundly affect the value of plantations for conserving biological diversity. Shade-coffee certification programmes have emerged to verify that coffee advertised as 'shade grown' is actually grown on highly biodiverse plantations. Although these programmes universally encourage epiphyte protection from pruning (a common practice), there has been no experimental evaluation of the importance of epiphytes in supporting faunal diversity. We report the effect of experimentally removing epiphytes on the bird assemblage in a shade-coffee farm near Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico.3. We established two matching pairs of epiphyte removal and control plots. We compared bird diversity and abundance, based on daily censuses during the breeding and non-breeding season. We used existing information on the way in which birds use epiphytes as foraging and nesting substrates to explain the presence of different species in plots with epiphytes.4. Plots without epiphytes tended to be less diverse than plots with epiphytes, but rarefaction analysis and ANOVA showed no significant differences in species richness between treatments in any of the seasons. Mean bird abundance was significantly higher in plots with epiphytes during both seasons, and a multidimensional scaling analysis showed that bird community structure differed between the two treatments.5. Eighteen forest bird species were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. Three non-forest species were more common in plots without epiphytes. Resident bird species that used epiphytes as a nesting substrate were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes.6. When epiphytes are removed, canopy cover, foraging substrates, nest sites and nest materials are eliminated and microclimatic conditions change. This could increase predation on adult birds and nests, increase intra- and interspecific competition, and decrease individual survivorship.7. Synthesis and applications. This is the first experimental assessment of the importance of epiphytes for birds. Shade-coffee plantations with epiphytes maintain higher abundance and diversity of the inhabitant bird fauna than plantations without epiphytes. This study reinforces the value of positive epiphyte management as an important factor in shade-grown coffee certification, where the goal is to promote biodiversity conservation.

Observations of birds from the interior region add to our knowledge of the distribution and richness of Suriname's avifauna. The Sipaliwini savanna harbors a number of bird species that are not found elsewhere in the Guianas. The savanna itself has a low human population density and is relatively unaffected by the large-scale cattle grazing and frequent fires that have degraded other savanna regions throughout the Neo-tropics. The Sipaliwini appears to contain healthy populations of several species that require late-successional post-fire habitats or are otherwise sensitive to human activity, including the San Parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis) and Rufous-sided Pygmy-Tyrant (Euscarthmus rufomarginatus). Continued protection of the savanna from extensive fire and grazing is urged.

Abundance of birds was determined using fixed-radius point counts. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to compare plant community composition and canonical correspondence analysis was used to examine the relationships between plant species composition and vegetation structure with the bird community. Plant species composition differed distinctly between seeded grassland and native mixed prairie, but the differences were not reflected in habitat structure. bird community composition, or abundance of bird species. Seeded grassland was inferior to native mixed prairie in terms of diversity of plant species. but that difference did not translate into meaningful differences in structure that drove habitat selection by breeding bird. Conservation programs that promote establishment of seeded grassland and do not allow for suitable disturbance regimes will selectively benefit a narrow suite of birds regardless of plant species composition.

Although targeted species such as sport fish may benefit, increasingly there are concerns over nontarget species. We assessed the impacts of a drawdown of Lake Kissimmee on Florida apple snails. Prior to the drawdown, we found apple snails at significantly higher densities in sites dominated by sandy substrates and emergent macrophytes: no snails were found in sites with deep layers of unconsolidated organic material and dominated by Nuphar luteum. Following the drawdown. some of the sites containing this unconsolidated organic material were also scraped with heavy equipment (e.g., bulldozer) to remove the organic layer. We monitored the response of 31 snails from one site. most of which were stranded in the dry littoral zone during the 1995-1996 drawdown. Mortality rates of stranded snails were high due to the dry conditions of the littoral zone., but also indirectly due to increased vulnerability to predation by several avian species. The Survival data was corroborated by the 1996 and 1997 funnel trap data wherein our catch declined by 80 % from 1995 (pre-drawdown) levels. The proportion of juveniles also declined significantly, indicating an impact on recruitment. Snail abundance did increase. albeit marginally. in some sites. indicating potential benefits of drawdown and organic Substrate removal in some types of littoral zone habitats. However, the timing of drawdown events appears critical, as evident in poor recruitment and relatively low abundance following completion of lake restoration activity. In order to avoid substantial losses to non-target species such as apple snails, we suggested that natural resource managers give greater consideration to the potential negative impacts of deviating from the natural hydrologic regime in terms of timing, duration, and frequency.

However, these plantations can have adverse environmental effects if improperly managed. To evaluate the effect of forest management practices on biodiversity, the diversity, species richness, dominance and frequency of understory woody plant species in different forests of the Basque Country (northern Spain) were compared. Plantations of exotic conifers (Pinus radiata [D.] Don) of different ages were compared with deciduous forests of Quercus robur L. and Fagus sylvatica L. The effects of different types and intensities of management were taken into account. The differences observed were mainly conditioned by the intensity of forestry management, although the response varied according to forest type and age. In unmanaged pine plantations, the diversity and species richness of the understory increased rapidly after planting (while dominance decreased), remained stable in the intermediate age range, and reached a maximum in plantations more than 25 years of age. Management practices resulted in decreased understory diversity and species richness, as well as greater dominance. This was more pronounced in younger than in older stands. Moderate management, however, favored a greater diversity of the understory in deciduous forests. The species composition of the plantations and deciduous forests were different, the latter having a wider range of characteristic species. Knowledge of how forestry practices influence biodiversity (in terms of diversity, richness, dominance, and species composition) may allow predictions to be made about the diversity achievable with different management systems.

Mowing and burning are alternative management strategies for restoring and rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, but their specific, comparative effects are the subjects of ongoing evaluation. We compared the responses of plant and bird communities on four sets of mowed, burned, and untreated sites of small (3-10 ha), fragmented tallgrass prairies at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR), Iowa, U.S.A., during May-July in 1998 and 1999. Species richness and diversity of plants, resident grassland birds, and communities of birds associated with grassland edges (edge species) were independent of treatment. Although not affecting species richness and diversity in plant communities, mowed sites ranked lower in total plant coverage and total forb coverage than burned sites or untreated sites. In contrast, untreated sites had more coverage by shrubs, suggesting that mowing and burning did retard shrub encroachment. Overall, abundance and diversity of plants and birds were generally insensitive to management strategies. Small, fragmented sites of rare habitat may not respond in the short term to management treatments and may not be capable of supporting highly diverse communities, no matter how intensively manipulated. It is more probable that diversity of native prairie communities can be enhanced and restored only through long-term efforts, acquisition of large land units capable of supporting stable populations, and deliberate reintroduction of species of high conservation value.

This paper discusses their perceptions of six metropolitan wetlands (four recent restorations and two reference sites), how cultural measures of their perceptions compared with selected site characteristics and biodiversity measures, and what results suggest for wetland design and management. Overall, sites that were perceived as more well-cared-for and as a good place to enjoy nature were perceived as more attractive. In addition, objective site characteristics, like cultural cues and natural landscape context, were related to perceived attractiveness. While plant species richness was not significantly related to perceived wetland attractiveness for our sites, bird species richness was related to attractiveness.

However, increasing use of herbicides in forest management has caused widespread concerns among the public and biologists about direct toxicity to wildlife and indirect effects through habitat alteration. Abundant research has indicated that forest herbicide treatments target biochemical pathways unique to plants, do not persist in the environment, and have few toxic effects when operationally applied. Herbicides affect forest biodiversity by creating short-term declines in plant species diversity, altering vegetative structure, and potentially changing plant successional trajectories. For wildlife species, effects vary but generally are short-term. Despite these findings, public opinion against forest herbicides often has limited or restricted their use, likely due to people's values associated with forests and a lack of technical knowledge. Future research efforts on relationships between forest herbicides and biodiversity should address landscape and site-specific issues, be based on rigorous experimental design, be relevant to public concerns, include comparisons of herbicide treatments with alternative treatments excluding herbicides, examine use of chemical mixtures, and determine the social, economic, and possible long-term ecological consequences of treatments.

These factors, as well as increased disturbance and trampling, have reduced the number and diversity of forbs and thus the diversity and abundance of invertebrates, in particular of foliar species. Associated with these changes in management, there has been a large decline in the abundance of many species of farmland birds in pastoral areas and more local extinctions compared with arable areas. To understand the impact of these management changes on bird populations, and design measures to reverse the declines, it is necessary to identify the key factors influencing bird usage of fields. We review results from five studies, which have related fertilizer and grazing management to bird usage of grass fields. Species that fed on soil invertebrates tended to show a positive response to the amount of nitrogen fertilizer added and increased grazing pressure, although there was a high degree of correlation between these two variables. In summer, many species, including corvids, Common Blackbird Turdus merula, Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris, Pied Wagtail Motacilla alba and Hedge Accentor Prunella modularis, showed a negative relationship with sward height, and in winter more species showed a positive relationship with bare ground. Taller sward heights are associated with a greater abundance and diversity of bird invertebrate food resources, and accessibility of food items or a lower risk of predation (actual or perceived) are likely to be the reasons for birds choosing to forage on shorter swards and in areas with more bare ground. Birds feeding on soil invertebrates were found to be generally tolerant of modern management practices that maintain short swards short, as accessibility to the soil has been increased. Species that feed on foliar invertebrates or forb seeds have been affected negatively by modern grassland agricultural practices.

The effect of these changes for bird species wintering in this agricultural landscape has been rarely analyzed. Here the effects are studied of farming changes in traditional holm oak dehesas on population size, social structure and time budget of common cranes Grus grus in eight traditional wintering sites in Spain. The role of acorn availability, the principal winter food of the species, in relation to management is also assessed. The number of cranes in each wintering area was not related to degree of agricultural intensification, nor to the availability of acorns. However, crane flock size decreased, and the relative occurrence of isolated family groups increased in less intensively transformed wintering areas characterized by the predominance of fallow lands. The age composition of crane flocks varied with acorn availability since more juveniles were reported in areas with relatively lower acorn availability. Time budget was also related to acorn availability, since cranes spent relatively more time preening in those wintering areas with higher availability of acorns. Globally evidence suggests the need to maintain the fallow land (posios) to sustain the wintering populations of cranes in Iberia, since this agro-grazing system maintains most of the juvenile cranes using the western migratory route.

A comprehensive analysis of the factors that influence species distributions should include variables measured at multiple scales because species-environment relationships are known to vary with the scale of observation. The pitch pine-scrub oak (Pinus rigida-Quercus ilicifolia) communities, or pine barrens, of the northeastern USA are severely threatened by development and fire suppression. They also provide critical habitat for many species of rare moths. We used partial canonical correspondence analysis to assess the relative effects of three levels of environmental variables (plot, patch, and landscape) on the distribution and abundance of 10 species of rare moths in a pine barrens community in southeastern Massachusetts, USA. We also used a set of spatial variables to quantify and partial out the effects of spatial autocorrelation of species composition among sampling locations. All three levels of environmental factors combined, independent of spatial factors, accounted for virtually half (48.4%) of the total variation in the moth community. Sequential partitioning of the variance explained by each level of environmental factors indicated that landscape level factors explained more than twice as much variance as plot and patch level factors. Another environmental model that included only landscape level variables explained 53% of the total variation in the moth community. Patch density and percentage of the landscape comprised of open and sparse canopy, scrub oak habitats were the most significant variables. These results suggest that the presence of scrub oak habitat within relatively large, heterogeneous landscape mosaics may be more important for the maintenance of many rare pine barrens associated moth populations than plot or patch level characteristics.

The availability of suitable microhabitat corresponded strongly with woodpecker abundance, and snags were the most highly preferred foraging substrate across species and study sites. Large amounts of necromass, including snags, were present in 5-y-old logged and unlogged forest, but dead wood was in low abundance in 10-y-old logged forest. The absence or scarcity of large, snag-foraging woodpeckers from older logged stands suggests that this resource may remain in low abundance for a considerable time.

Over the past 46 years, it has not only insured the smooth operation of the Baotou-Lanzhou railway in the sand dune section but has also played an important role in the restoration of the local eco-environment; therefore, it is viewed as a successful model for desertification control and ecological restoration along the transport line in the arid desert region of China. Long-term monitoring and focused research show that within 4-5 years of establishment of sand-binding vegetation, the physical surface structure of the sand dunes stabilized, and inorganic soil crusts formed by atmospheric dust gradually turned into microbiotic crusts. Among the organisms comprising these crusts are cryptogams such as desert algae and mosses. In the 46 years since establishing sand-binding vegetation, some 24 algal species occurred in the crusts. However, only five moss species were identified, which was fewer than the species number in the crust of naturally fixed sand dunes. Other results of the planting were that near-surface wind velocity in the 46-year-old vegetation area was reduced by 54.2% compared with that in the moving sand area; soil organic matter increased from 0.06% in moving sand dunes to 1.34% in the 46-year-old vegetation area; the main nutrients N, P, K, etc., in the desert ecosystem increased; soil physicochemical properties improved; and soil-forming processes occurred in the dune surface layer. Overall, establishment of sand-binding vegetation significantly impacted soil water cycles, creating favorable conditions for colonization by many herbaceous species. These herbaceous species, in turn, facilitated the colonization and persistence of birds, insects, soil animals, and desert animals. Forty-six years later, some 28 bird species and 50 insect species were identified in the vegetated dune field. Thus, establishment of a relatively simple community of sand-binding species led to the transformation of the relatively barren dune environment into a desert ecosystem with complex structure, composition, and function. This restoration effort shows the potential for short-term manipulation of environmental variables (i.e., plant cover via artificial vegetation establishment) to begin the long-term process of ecological restoration, particularly in arid climates, and demonstrates several techniques that can be used to scientifically monitor progress in large-scale restoration projects.

We examined avian community response to pine-grassland restoration for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and traditional United States Forest Service pine sawtimber management at Homochitto National Forest, Mississippi from 1994-1996. Thirteen species were more abundant in pine-grassland restoration stands, whereas 5 species were more abundant in traditionally managed pine sawtimber stands. Mature restored pine-grassland stands had greater avian species richness, total bird abundance, and avian conservation value than traditionally managed pine sawtimber stands. We used logistic regression models in an exploratory analysis to predict occurrence of selected species using stand- and landscape-scale habitat characteristics. Probability of red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus) occurrence increased with increasing hardwood canopy cover, and probability of yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) occurrence increased with increasing grass ground cover. Species richness, total avian abundance, and occurrence of red-eyed vireos and Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) increased with increasing values of Shannon's Habitat Diversity Index. Pine-grassland restoration for red-cockaded woodpeckers created vegetation composition and structure at the stand and landscape scales that may benefit numerous avian species of regional conservation concern.

As a basis for local conservation planning in a pitch pine-scrub oak community in southeastern Massachusetts, we developed logistic-regression models based on multiscale landscape and patch variables to predict hotspots of rare and declining bird and moth species. We compared predicted moth distributions with observed species-occurrence records to validate the models. We then quantified the amount of overlap between hotspots to assess the utility of rare birds and moths as indicator taxa. Species representation in hotspots and the current level of hotspot protection were also assessed. Predictive models included variables at all measured scales and resulted in average correct classification rates (optimal cutpoint) of 85.6% and 89.2% for bird and moth models, respectively. The majority of moth occurrence records were within 100 m of predicted habitat. Only 13% of all bird hotspots and 10% of all moth hotspots overlapped, and only a few small patches in and around Myles Standish State Forest were predicted to be hotspots for both taxa. There was no correlation between the bird and moth species-richness maps across all levels of richness (r = -0.03, p = 0.62). Species representation in hotspots was high, but most hotspots had limited or no protection. Given the lack of correspondence between bird and moth hotspots, our results suggest that use of species-richness indicators for conservation planning may be ineffective at local scales. Based on these results, we suggest that local-level conservation planning in pitch pine-scrub oak communities be based on multitaxa, multiscale approaches.

We investigated whether the source-sink concept Could help to clarify the influence of habitat potential (scrub ridge characteristics), population density, and fires (shrub heights) on Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) demography and dispersal. We mapped territories and measured survival, recruitment, emigration, immigration, and shrub heights annually for 12 years. We classified territories as oak if they overlapped well-drained ridges, oak-palmetto if they overlapped poorly drained ridges >0.4 ha, and palmetto-oak if they only overlapped poorly drained ridges <0.4 ha. Territory size differed little among these categories but was negatively correlated with the annual number of breeding pairs, which ranged from 12 to 27. Scrub ridge characteristics influenced the locations of sinks and potential sources, whereas population density and fires caused temporal variation in demographic success. Oak territories were usually sources because they were net exporters of individuals and because recruitment exceeded mortality. Oak-palmetto territories sometimes functioned as sources but were often pseudo-sinks because density dependence caused mortality to exceed recruitment. Palmetto-oak territories were true sinks because they were net importers of individuals and mortality exceeded recruitment regardless of population density. All scrub was short (<1.2 m) or medium height (1.2-1.7 m), but the spatial arrangement of these height classes changed regularly because fires occurred every 2-7 years. We observed a quadratic relationship between demographic success and the area of medium-height scrub within territories. Territories that had 0.9-1.2 ha of medium-height scrub had the highest demographic success. Applying source-sink concepts at the territory scale was useful to quantify habitat variation at a spatial scale relevant to population processes, reserve design, and habitat management. Our approach can be applied by using territory maps or geographic information systems to partition heterogeneous landscapes into territories and then by classifying territories into potential sources and sinks using scrub ridge characteristics and shrub heights.

We compared species richness and distribution in forest fragments imbedded in shrub-lands to those in continuous forests or in continuous shrublands. We examined the consistency of our data with the predictions of two hypotheses: 1) the Habitat fragmentation hypothesis which states that fragmentation has negative effects on the species from the original continuous habitat; 2) the Habitat supplementation /complementation hypothesis which stipulates that the presence of a matrix habitat around the fragments will mitigate negative effects on the species from the original habitat (supplementation) or allow the presence of species that depend on the presence of both the fragment and matrix habitats (complementation). We show that: 1) species richness in forest fragments did not differ from species richness in segments of continuous forests of equal area; 2) the bird community of forest fragments got impoverished in some forest species but a higher proportion of species common in continuous forests were not affected by fragmentation; 3) fragment communities had a significant proportion of common species that were scarce in, or absent from both continuous forests and shrublands. While, a few forest species supported predictions from the fragmentation hypothesis, occurrence patterns observed in several other species were consistent with either the supplementation or the complementation hypotheses. Our results suggest that there is no single hypothesis that properly captures the consequences of a shift from continuous forests to a mosaic of forest fragments and shrublands and that different ecological mechanisms act in conjunction to determine species pools in habitat mosaics.

Habitat use was quantified by measuring 24 habitat variables in 461 bird-centered quadrats, each 0.04 ha in size. Using discriminant function analysis, we differentiated between habitat used by 14 bird species along 3 habitat dimensions: (1) variation in shrub cover, overstory juniper cover, mature tree density, understory height, and decadent tree density; (2) a gradient composed of elevation and forb cover; and (3) variation in grass cover, tree height, seedling/sapling cover, and bare ground/rock cover. Of 14 species considered, 9 exhibited substantial habitat partitioning: Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura), Bewick's Wren (Thryomanes bewickii), Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides), Plumbeous Vireo (Vireo plumbeus), Green-tailed Towhee (Pipilo chlorurus), Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri), Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis), and Cassin's Finch (Carpodacus cassinii). Our results indicate juniper bird communities of southwestern Wyoming are organized along a 3-dimensional habitat gradient composed of woodland maturity, elevation, and juniper recruitment. Because juniper birds partition habitat along successional and altitudinal gradients, indiscriminate woodland clearing as well as continued fire suppression will alter species composition. Restoration efforts should ensure that all successional stages of juniper woodland are present on the landscape.

Using buffer strips of varying widths and a control from undisturbed riparian forest, I tested the hypothesis that vegetation differs in buffer strips of varying width. I selected 10 summary variables to represent broad-scale vegetation attributes of riparian habitat. Deciduous tree density was higher, and shrub richness was lower in wide buffers compared with narrow buffers. I then used Akaike information criterion to examine whether vegetation structure or buffer width best explained patterns of bird richness and abundance in riparian habitats. Species richness and abundance in several foraging guilds were explained better by buffer width than by vegetation. Abundances of three bird habitat guilds: riparian specialists, forest-interior, and open-edge species, and 6 of 10 species were best explained by specific vegetation features. Differences in vegetation, particularly deciduous tree density and shrub cover, explained part of the variation in abundance of several riparian forest-dwelling species and may be useful in evaluating specific forest management practices. Because deciduous tree density is also positively correlated with buffer width, wide buffers (>100 m) may benefit not only those species associated with coniferous upland forests and forest generalists sensitive to buffer width, but also those species whose abundance is associated with deciduous trees.

We color-banded 52 birds for individual recognition, and we radiomarked 25 adults from this sample. We analyzed 142 feces of 30 adults and 588 feces of 40 nestlings from 15 nests. Additionally, we took samples from 20 trees recently used for foraging in 10 woodpecker territories to estimate local prey availability. Based on relative abundance and relative frequency of food items (i.e., importance value), overall diet composition of adult three-toed woodpeckers was dominated by spiders (Araneidea), larvae of longhorn beetles (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae), and bark beetles (Coleoptera, Scolytidae). Adults ate longhorn beetle larvae primarily during nesting, while imagines (fully developed adults) and larvae of various bark beetles appeared to be the main food resource outside the nesting season. Nestling diet was dominated by spiders and longhorn beetle larvae that were gathered 247 +/- 122 m ( (x) over bar +/- SD) from the nest. Our results demonstrated that consumption of bark beetles by three-toed woodpeckers varies throughout the year, being lowest during the nesting season, while longhorn beetle larvae are preferred throughout the year. Securing habitat requirements of both bark and wood-boring beetle communities is a critical step to maintaining viable three-toed woodpecker populations.

The total population of 60-80 individuals achieved a reproductive output of only 0.74 young per breeding pair in 2002. Brood parasitism by Shiny Cowbird Molothrus bonariensis was a major factor reducing breeding success, affecting 38.5% of broods. Parasitism rates reached 50% in an ungrazed reserve, but only 14% on an adjacent grazed plot. The resulting difference in breeding success was not, however, attributable to vegetation parameters used to describe microhabitat use. Cowbird parasitism rates therefore seem to be influenced largely by factors operating at the landscape level. These may include grazing scheme, topography, humidity and host availability. It is suggested that lower species diversity and bird abundance rendered the grazed site less attractive to cowbirds. Current parasitism rates are of great conservation concern due to the low population size of Pale-headed Brush-finch, and the initiation of controlling measures is pressing. Management options described from intensive cowbird control programmes in North America are reviewed and evaluated for their applicability here. To. combine the possibility of further data collection with commencement of immediate conservation action, we consider two alternative approaches. Nest monitoring and cowbird egg removal would enable the study of the distribution of parasitism in relation to landscape and vegetation variables, whereas cowbird shooting and nest monitoring might provide a larger short-term benefit to reproductive output. Habitat management, resumption of some grazing in the reserve and cowbird removal should be considered for the intermediate future.

Therefore, structure changes caused by management practices can influence avian communities. The salt marshes of the pampas region of Argentina have experienced an increase in fire use as a management tool to improve cattle forage and to avoid accidental fires. A spring burn of 200 ha of salt marsh in Mar Chiquita Biosphere Reserve, Argentina, in September 1995, allowed us to compare the response of birds associated with two vegetation communities, one dominated by Spartina densiflora (Spartina marsh) and another dominated by Juncus acutus (Juncus marsh) from one month to one year post-burn. We recorded changes in plant species composition and vegetation structure (height and cover) at 40 days after the burn and every season for the subsequent year. Fire reduced total cover of both plant communities. Juncus marsh recovered pre-burn structure and bird community by one year post-fire. However, Spartina marsh recovery was incomplete in that period. Relative abundances of bird species that used unburned Juncus marsh were similar to those in burned Juncus marsh in the spring period one year after the burn. Plant height at the burned Spartina marsh did not reach that of the unburned Spartina in 12 months; red-capped wren-spinetail (Spartonoica maluroides), a rare tall-grass-dependent species, settled burned parcels at lower relative abundances than in unburned habitat. Because species that first use the burned patches are very common and widespread in other habitats, and excessive burning may reduce available habitat for endangered or rare species, prescribed burns should be avoided in this region.

In addition to waterbirds previously studied. I recorded 56 bird species in rice fields. Of these, five were more abundant in flooded fields, ten were more abundant in unflooded fields. no difference was detected for 19, and the remainder were too rare to draw any conclusions. Species that Were snore common in unflooded fields were all carnivorous or granivorous in winter, whereas species that were snore common in flooded fields were mostly insectivores commonly associated with aquatic habitats. The net effects of the responses by individual species were fewer raptor species in flooded fields, but no difference in the species richness of other landbirds. Winter flooding potentially has negative effects for some birds, but has no discernible effects on most species studied and may benefit some passerines. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although hawk owls use burned forest, reports of this association have been primarily anecdotal and outside the breeding season. We present the first comparison of hawk owl relative abundance between burned and unburned conifer-dominated boreal forest in North America. Hawk owls were detected only in postfire forest and were not detected in nearby unburned coniferous forest. There was a significant negative exponential relationship between hawk owl abundance and burn age, suggesting that burns were only suitable up to 8 years postfire. A conservative estimate of a peak in breeding density was three nests per 100 km(2) for a 2-year-postfire forest. Wildfire and newly burned forests may be an important feature for hawk owls in the Nearctic boreal forest. This raises the question whether management of this species through improved forestry techniques is a sufficient conservation measure.

Here we explore the potential effects of managing eastern Ontario deciduous forests for the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea) by examining its potential as a biodiversity indicator species and as an umbrella species. Our results indicate that the Cerulean Warbler would not be an effective biodiversity indicator, as its distribution across the studied landscape did not coincide with areas of high avian species richness. However, the Cerulean Warbler may be effective as an umbrella species for the maintenance of populations of other canopy-nesting species that require mature deciduous forest habitats. It is hoped that the conclusions reached in Ontario, while perhaps not directly transferable to all parts of the breeding range, encourage other Cerulean Warbler researchers to ask similar questions in their study areas.

Data on the structure and diversity of its breeding avifauna have mostly been collected in primeval old-growth stands, preserved within the Bialowieza National Park (BNP). Mapping censuses repeated in space (plots, replicated in riverine, oak-lime-hornbeam and coniferous stands) and time (permanent plots, 28 years) reveal that the breeding bird assemblages are rich in species (29-52/season in a 25 to 33-ha plot), but of moderate overall density (40-120 pairs/10 ha). The latter is due to low, lower than in man-transformed areas, densities of the majority of particular species. Despite marked changes in vegetation structure, the composition of the breeding bird assemblage does not vary much across different primeval forest types, with a single breeding bird community inhabiting all of them, including treefall gaps. High richness of the BF avifauna stems from the Forest's geographical locality, as well as from a high level of the primeval avifauna retention. Over 95% of the 135-140 pristine species still breed there. Especially species-rich groups are birds of prey, owls, woodpeckers and Sylvinae warblers. Bird communities in the BNP and primeval tropical rain forests share many features, suggesting that natural differences between temperate and tropical forests were less pronounced in the past. The combination of high species richness with low densities of individual species is probably a feature of all pristine forests, independent of climatic zone. The BF avifauna must once have been typical of the ancient European forests and it has become so exceptional chiefly because it has preserved most of its pristine features. The BF thus constitutes an indispensable reference site for future studies of woodland bird biology. To ensure its survival should become a priority. Commercial logging, taking place over 80% of the Polish BF part, severely changes the Forest's structure and strongly affects the birds, especially species which depend on dead wood (Dendrocopos leucotos, Picoides tridactylus) and on old-growth stands. The small area protected as the BNP becomes an increasingly isolated "island", in which preservation of the primeval forest features seems to be impossible. In order to retain them, it is necessary to protect the whole BF area.

The relationship assumed is usually one of woodpecker dependence or preference for partially decayed wood in which to excavate cavities, but the woodpecker is also sometimes suggested as a vector for the fungus. In this paper we review such associations and describe patterns evident among woodpecker nest sites that suggest microclimatic and microhabitat characteristics favoring fungal colonization of trees, wood-pecker-favorable responses of trees to fungi, and ultimate use of the trees for woodpecker cavity excavation. Factors that favor fungal invasion and tree use by woodpeckers include tree species, growth history, site characteristics such as proximity to water and exposure to sun or shade, nature and position of tree injury, local climate, forest age and species composition, fire frequency, and human management activities. Woodpecker cavity height and entrance orientation may be related to the dispersal dynamics of fungi, which in turn may be related to forest vegetation, thermal, and hydric characteristics.

At Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (LNWR) in northwestern North Dakota, we monitored breeding bird occurrence, abundance, and habitat during successive annual grazing treatments (1998-2000) on 5 prescribe-burned, mixed-grass prairie management units (range = 50-534 ha, each burned 3-6 times in the previous 10-20 years). All breeding passerine species characteristic of upland, northern mixed-grass prairie were common (> 10% occurrence) during at least 1 of 3 years on burned and grazed units, except Chestnut-collared Longspur (Calcarius ornatus), which was uncommon. Vegetation was generally shorter and sparser than that found on 4 nearby units treated by fire only (1999; density, visual obstruction, and height, all P < 0.01). Regardless, occurrences of individual bird species resembled those previously documented on prairie units at LNWR with similar fire histories but no grazing; however, Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) occurred 2.4 times more frequently on burned and grazed units studied. Our data suggest that species diversity of breeding grassland passerines changes little during initial years of rotation grazing at moderate stocking rates in fire-managed, northern mixed-grass prairie at LNWR.

We experimentally examined the link between fruit availability and habitat use by manipulating winter abundance of Myrica cerifera L. (Myricaceae) fruits in managed longleaf (Pinus palustris) and loblolly (P. taeda) pine stands in South Carolina. Myrica cerifera is a common understory shrub in the southeastern United States and provides lipid-rich fruit in late winter (February and March), when insects and other fruits are scarce. On treatment plots, we covered fruiting M. cerifera shrubs with netting in early winter to prevent birds from eating their fruits. In late February, when M. cerifera fruit crops were largely depleted elsewhere on our study site, we uncovered the shrubs and documented the response of the bird community to those patches of high fruit availability. Relative to control plots, total bird abundance (excluding the most common species, Yellow-rumped Warbler [Dendroica coronata]) and species richness did not change after net removal. Yellow-rumped Warblers, however, became significantly more abundant on treatment plots after net removal, which suggests that they track M. cerifera fruit abundance. We suggest that M. cerifcra plays a role in determining the local distribution of wintering Yellow-rumped Warblers at our study site. To put these results into a management context, we also examined the effect of prescribed fire frequencies on M. cerifera fruit production. Across pine stands with different fire regimes, M. cerifcra fruit abundance increased with the number of years since burning. It takes 4-6 years for individuals to recover sufficiently from a burn to produce large quantities of fruit. Thus, shorter intervals between burns will reduce winter fruit availability. Taken together, these results suggest that within those pine plantations, the local winter distribution of at least one common migratory bird is closely tied to fruit abundance, which in turn is tied to the frequency of prescribed fires.

We compared the response of vascular plants to environmental gradients to that of seven other plant, fungal and animal groups within a forest reserve in western Norway using data from 59 plots of 0.25 ha. We also examined whether the spatial changes in species (beta-2 index) of vascular plants matched that of the other groups. All seven groups responded to the same gradients in nutrient richness and humidity as the vascular plants. Furthermore, changes in species composition of vascular plants were reflected in comparable degrees of change among the "target" groups. The lower the degree of change in species composition between plots in the "target" groups relative to that of vascular plants, the higher the percentage "target" species encompassed in a complementary selection of sites based on vascular plants. We conclude that in practical site selection of small scale sites of conservation value, such as woodland key habitats, vascular plants may be used in combination with an inventory of important habitats for rare and/or redlisted forest species, such as dead wood, old trees, deciduous trees, and Cliffs.

Our goal was to determine which landscape features are important controls on species richness, to establish how these constraints are expressed at different levels of organization, and to identify hotspots of biological diversity for a particular locality. We examine the following questions: 1) How is the variance in patterns of plant species richness and diversity partitioned at different scales, or classification units, of the hierarchical ecosystem classification developed for the study area? 2) What are the compositional similarities among ecosystem types? 3) For our study area, what are the sites expected to harbour highest species richness? We used a spatially explicit map of biodiversity to project abundance of species-rich communities in the landscape based on a previously developed ecological classification system for a lower Gulf Coastal Plain landscape. The data indicate that high species richness in this ecosystem was found in sites with frequent fire and high soil moisture. Sites in fire-maintained landscapes with lower frequency of fire were associated with geomorphological characteristics, suggesting a dependence of the diversity-disturbance relationship with soil type. With more frequent fire on some sites, high diversity shifts from canopy component to ground flora, with an overall increase in total species richness. Our approach demonstrates how potential species richness can be identified as a restoration goal and that multiple vegetation endpoints may be appropriate vegetation objectives. We identify basic management needs for the maintenance of biodiversity in this ecosystem that can be derived from an understanding of the combination of factors that most strongly predict diverse plant communities.

In this paper we analysed the dynamics of the bird community in chestnut stands that represent a gradient from woods impacted by domestic firewood collecting to abandoned and derelict coppice interspersed with mature fruiting cultivars. Bird diversity, density, species richness and the abundance of six out of the sixteen commonest species were positively affected by the occurrence of mature fruiting sweet chestnuts in the study stands. These old trees (>100 years) are rich in cavities and support many dead branches and thus call take the place of dead standing wood for birds, offering food. nesting and roosting sites. We also found a significant trend of increasing bird abundance. species richness and diversity with increasing stand age; heterogeneity in vegetation structure and composition following natural regeneration possibly created more forest-like conditions than uniform younger woods, thus supporting a richer bird community. The present findings are discussed in terms of conservation of bird diversity in old coppiced woods.

A total of 184 vertebrate species was recorded from this sampling, of which 92 species were recorded from five or more quadrats. There was substantial change in the reported species composition of these quadrats between these two periods: the mean Bray-Curtis index for similarity in species composition from the baseline to subsequent sampling of a quadrat was only 22.1 (for an index that varies from 0 for complete turnover in species to 100 for unchanged composition). For individual species, correlations across quadrats in the abundance scores from baseline to resampling varied from -0.12 to 0.85. Matched-pairs testing showed that there was significant change in abundance for 18 species from the baseline to repeat sampling, and significant increase in total bird species richness and total native mammal abundance, but significant decrease in reptile species richness.Fire history was recorded biannually for 40 of the 47 quadrats. Fire was very frequent, with quadrats being burnt in an average of 3.65 years of the six years between fauna samples. Three aspects of this fire history (total number of years of fires, number of fires in the late dry season, and interval from the last fire to the date of resampling) were related to change in the fauna composition of quadrats. Neither the similarity in species composition, nor change in richness or total abundance of all vertebrates or of the four taxonomic classes considered (frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals) were significantly correlated with these components of the fire history of sampled quadrats. This lack of association was possibly because the monitoring period was too short to show pronounced directional change, because the system was responding to many factors other than fire, because the variations in abundance were too large and the number of samples too small to detect true associations, or because fire histories preceding baseline sampling were not considered.The apparent instability of fauna species and communities in this system provides a considerable challenge for broad-brush (that is, vertebrate community-wide) monitoring. Power analysis demonstrated that, for most species, more than 1000 sample sites are needed to be 90% certain of detecting a 20% change in abundance, and with a 10% chance of accepting a Type I error. This level of sampling effort is commensurate with the current level of vertebrate sampling in this region. Broad-brush monitoring approaches such as described here are valuable, but need also to be complemented by more targetted monitoring for individual threatened species or species of particular management interest.

This study provides decision makers critical tools for highlighting pieces of land worthy of conservation in Spain. We studied four taxa-amphibians, reptiles, nesting birds and mammals-in a 50 x 50 kin grid (n = 259 cells). We used five criteria for identifying areas of high-value diversity: species richness, rarity, vulnerability, a combined index of biodiversity, and a Standardized Biodiversity Index that measured all four taxa together. As far as we know, the combined index of biodiversity and the Standardized Biodiversity Index are original. Areas of high-value diversity were defined as those cells within the 15% top segment of ranked values for the different criteria. Congruence of areas of high-value diversity for taxa pairs was moderate to low, and averaged 38.5% for areas of high-value diversity based on the combined index of biodiversity. The performance based on the average proportion of threatened species excluded from areas of high-value diversity followed the rank combined index of biodiversity = rarity (0.3%) > vulnerability (9.9%) > species richness (13.8%). The areas of high-value diversity identified according to the Standardized Biodiversity Index included all amphibian and mammal species, all but one reptile species (categorized as rare) and all but six bird species (three of which were categorized as threatened). About 70% of the areas of high-value diversity identified based on the Standardized Biodiversity Index included natural protected areas. However, they average only 274.6 km(2), thus occupying a small fraction of the areas of high-value diversity, and there is no guarantee that the species found in an area of high-value diversity site will be present in its protected fraction. Consequently, we urge managers of natural protected areas to conduct diversity surveys. We also urge that additional natural protected areas be established to include the gap of 30% of areas of high-value diversity not currently protected. We took an step for biodiversity conservation planning in the studied region, and discuss the usefulness of maps of areas of high-value diversity for conservation, ecological restoration, and environmental impact assessment and mitigation.

Point counts, corrected for different probabilities of detection in different swamps, suggested that the species richness of bird communities in stands of papyrus disturbed by burning, grazing or pollution was higher than in nearby stands that were not disturbed. However, there were fewer species and individuals of highly specialized birds or species characteristic of papyrus, in disturbed stands than in undisturbed swamps. At < 1 ha(-1), the density of Papyrus Gonolek Laniarius mufumbiri in Ugandan swamps was, for example, significantly lower in polluted and burnt sites than in undisturbed papyrus where up to 13 ha(-1) were recorded in the centre of swamps. White-winged Swamp Warbler Bradypterus carpalis was only recorded in undisturbed papyrus. In the papyrus that fringes Lake Naivasha in Kenya, outside the geographical range of species restricted to papyrus, disturbance in the form of grazing selects against species classified as swam 9, p-reliant. Species classified as generalist users of papyrus were much less sensitive to disturbance than specialists. The density of swamp specialists was also lower near the edge of swamps, where total species richness was higher. These results are discussed in relation to conservation management of papyrus swamps in East Africa.

We used multivariate analysis of covariance to test the hypothesis that the species richness of plants, arthropods, herpetofauna, and breeding birds are correlated and increase with soil fertility (silt and clay content in sandy soils), soil variability, and hardwood midstory reduction in subxeric, nutrient-poor longleaf pine sandhills at Eglin Air Force Base in northwest Florida. During 1994-1995 and 1998-1999, we sampled 30 81-ha plots with varying fire-exclusion histories and at two spatial scales of resolution (10 x 40 m and 81 ha). The relationship between the number of plant species and percent silt and clay and its coefficient of variation was significant and positive at the plot level (81 ha) but not at the subplot level (10 x 40 m). Herpetofaunal species richness was the only faunal variable that increased with silt and clay content, but the coefficient of variation did not. Multivariate effects of hardwood reduction were significant in 1998-1999 but not in 1994-1995, which suggests that the reintroduction of fire increased species richness across taxa. Univariate effects of hardwood reduction were marginally significant for plant species richness at the subplot level and not significant for herpetofaunal species richness at either scale. Plant and arthropod species richness were not correlated. Herpetofaunal species richness was not correlated with that of other taxa (plant and animal). The species richness of plants and arthropods were each significantly positively correlated with the richness of breeding bird species at the subplot level during 1994-1995, whereas only arthropod species richness was positively correlated with bird species richness at the plot level in either year. Our results suggest that the restoration of fire regime may be the most effective tool with which to increase diversity in pyrogenic areas considered for conservation protection.

Montados are exploited for three main uses: forestry, agriculture, and extensive grazing, in proportions that vary according to local conditions (more or less productive land) and historical circumstances. Because these ecosystems occur over a large geographic area (they occupy some 6 million ha), biodiversity would be expected to vary among montados. However, differences in management practices may also influence species distribution. In this paper, we investigate differences in plant and bird species diversity among 60 montados distributed all across southern Portugal. The environmental variables studied included geographical coordinates, climatological data, soil type, and altitude. We also investigated agro-economic variables that could describe human activities at each site: animal husbandry (breeds, stock density, grazing rotation, etc.), agriculture (fallow rotation frequency, use of fertilizers, etc.), and forestry (cork harvesting, thinning, etc.). Finally, land-use type and metrics were assessed from rectified aerial photographs. Species richness among these two groups was not correlated, sites with high or low numbers of plant species not necessarily having high or low numbers of bird species. However, both plant and bird communities exhibited a similar pattern of species composition and turnover. This pattern was ecologically based, rather than a result of biological similarities between groups: direct gradient analyses and variance partitioning revealed strong correlations between species distribution and spatial gradients, namely longitude and latitude. In trying to distinguish anthropogenic from biophysical processes, we found that both were equally important as drivers of montado, biodiversity. Plants and birds exhibited a similar ecological pattern, although environmental conditions were slightly more important in the case of plants, and human activities were slightly more important in the case of birds.

Changes in the shoreland ecosystem concomitant with this development have been little studied. In this study, we compared the structural and floristic characteristics of vegetation at 97 developed and 85 undeveloped (reference) shoreland sites in northern Wisconsin, USA. Quantitative comparisons of vegetation structural characteristics (percent cover of canopy, subcanopy, and understory vegetation layers; percent of shoreline overhung by trees and shrubs; and amount of coarse woody debris) showed significantly greater complexity and cover at undeveloped versus developed sites. We classified plant communities and described plant species composition along three belt transects parallel to shore (upland, shoreline, and shallow water) using ordination techniques to describe the differences between developed and undeveloped sites, as well as among undeveloped sites. The mean number of plant species and the percent of native species were both greater at undeveloped than at developed sites along all three transects. Undeveloped upland sites could be grouped by plant species composition into three types: Northern Wet Forest (bog species), Northern Mesic Forest, and Northern Xeric Forest. Undeveloped shoreline vegetation was also clustered into three categories: bog species, upland species with an abrupt transition to aquatic species, and wet meadow species. Soil characteristics further distinguished the upland and shoreline categories. No distinct vegetation categories emerged in the shallow water ordination. We recommend that appropriate species for shoreland restoration efforts be selected based on the native plant communities present at the undeveloped sites, their relative location along an upland to shallow water gradient, and, in some cases, soil characteristics.

For comparison, we also estimated bird density in ROW managed by cutting in New Hampshire and New York and in shrublands managed by fire in the Finger Lakes National Forest (FLNF), New York. On herbicide-managed ROW, we detected a mean of 14.3 individuals and 12.2 species per point count, including many species of early-succession habitat that are declining throughout northeastern United States. Nesting success in forested landscapes of New York, Maine, and Massachusetts was 55% on the ROW, 69% in forests within 20 m of the ROW, and 63% in forests more than 20 m from the ROW. Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitized 5.3% of the nests and reduced host recruitment by even less. This suggests that ROW in forested areas support high production of shrubland birds and do not exert a measurably harmful effect on forest-nesting birds. Selective herbicide application on ROW sustained shrubland vegetation and supported high densities and high nesting success. Mechanical cutting lowered the structural diversity of vegetation the following spring and was associated with fewer individual birds and species. Cool burns in early spring produced a high structural diversity of herbs, shrubs and trees and supported a high density of birds and bird species. Long-term maintenance of shrublands by burning will require supplemental cutting to remove saplings. As reforestation continues to reduce shrubland habitat, probably below pre-colonial levels, active management for early-succession habitat will be necessary to sustain current population levels of numerous species.

We experimentally manipulated stands using a randomized block design to evaluate influences of two thinning intensities on populations of diurnal breeding birds in western Oregon. We conducted point counts of birds seven times each year in 1994 (prior to treatment) and from 1995 through 2000 (subsequent to treatment). We analyzed data using multiple linear regression and information-theoretic approaches to model selection. Of the 22 species for which we had sufficient data for analysis, detections of nine species decreased and eight species increased in thinned stands relative to controls, and there was no strong evidence that thinning influenced numbers of five species. Of the 17 species that responded to thinning, the magnitude of response of eight species varied with thinning intensity; for each of these species, response was greatest in the more heavily thinned stands. Although no species was extirpated from stands following thinning, detections of Hutton's Vireos (Vireo huttoni), Golden-crowned Kinglets (Regulus satrapa), Brown Creepers (Certhia americana), Black-throated Gray Warblers (Dendroica nigrescens), and Varied Thrushes (Ixoreus naevius) decreased to less than half of the detections in controls in one or more treatment types, suggesting thinning significantly reduces their numbers. In contrast, American Robins (Turdus migratorius), Townsend's Solitaires (Myadestes townsendi), and Hammond's Flycatchers (Empidonax hammondii) were rare or absent in controls but regularly present in thinned stands, and detections of Western Tanagers (Piranga ludoviciana), Evening Grosbeaks (Coccothraustes vespertinus), and Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) increased by threefold or more in thinned stands relative to controls. Only Pacific-slope Flycatchers (Empidonax difficilis), Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus), and Western Tanagers showed strong evidence of temporal trends in response. For these species, differences between numbers in controls and treated stands became more extreme through time. Our findings suggest that thinning densely stocked conifer stands in landscapes dominated by younger stands enhances habitat suitability for several species of birds, but that some unthinned patches and stands should be retained to provide refugia for species that are impacted by thinning.

We surveyed fruit-feeding butterfly species richness and vegetation structure on different shade coffee management systems in Chiapas, Mexico, that ranged from intensive commercial to traditional, rustic systems. The impact, of management on the diversity and structure of the shade canopy in each coffee production system was quantified and compared using a Management Index. This Management Index revealed statistically significant differences between management systems that previously were distinguished by researchers using qualitative, "gestalt" categories. Butterfly species richness was found to decline as management intensity increased, but a significant drop was found between the rustic system and the other more intensive systems, corroborating the importance of preserving rustic, shade coffee production for the conservation of biodiversity. Fruit-feeding butterflies were found to be very sensitive to the intensification of management of the shade canopy, so they may be an effective way to monitor ecological changes that accompany intensification within the coffee agroecosystem. Additionally, the vegetation Management Index may prove useful for quantifying management practices to evaluate certification criteria for conservation benefits.

One area had been unintentionally burned 4 years prior and selectively harvested (DIS) 1 year prior to sampling. A second area had been selectively harvested 1 year prior to sampling and had no recent history of fire (HAR). Species richness, as assessed by species-time curves and rarefaction, was higher in both altered areas than in undisturbed forest (INT). In general, frugivores and omnivores were more abundant in both altered areas compared to intact forest. Canopy frugivores, understory omnivores and multiple-strata omnivores were most abundant in HAR. Canopy frugivores, near-ground insectivores, understory and multiple-strata omnivores were least abundant in INT, although INT had the highest abundances of canopy insectivores and near-ground omnivores. Richness and abundance of widespread species with low habitat specificity was higher in both areas that experienced disturbance compared to intact forest. Differences in bird community structure between disturbed and intact forest at this site are attributed primarily to the addition of widespread species with less narrow habitat requirements, and possibly to changes in the distribution of different food types.

The EAR guidelines mandate the retention of at least 12 trees/ha and 24-36 m(2)/ha of basal area, representing a diversity of overstory and understory species. During summer 1998, we compared the temporal (breeding season vs. mid-sununer) and spatial (edge versus interior) use of EAR stands by birds. In addition, we compared observed vs. expected use of overstory trees in EAR stands. In each of ten representative EAR stands, we sampled birds twice per season along two-edge and two-interior transects. Total species richness and abundance (all species combined), species richness and abundance of ground-shrub foragers, and species richness of canopy-sallier foragers were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the breeding season than in mid-suminer. Eight of 20 common bird species analyzed also were significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant during the breeding season (e.g., black-and-white warbler and chestnut-sided warbler), and one species was significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant during mid-summer. Total species richness, total abundance, and abundance of ground-shrub foragers were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in interiors compared to edges of EAR stands. Five species also were significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant in interiors of EAR stands, whereas no species was more common in edges. All species combined and three foraging guilds showed differential use (P < 0.05) of overstory tree species; eight species also differed significantly in their use of abundant tree species. Based on our findings, we believe that EAR stands are excellent substitutes for clearcuts on state forestlands, although we caution that our findings were based only on one yr of data. We recommend the continued retention of a diversity of overstory, trees, especially snags and rough-barked trees, in both edges and interiors of EAR stands for use by a variety of bird species during both the breeding season and mid-summer.

In the deserts of the south-western United States of America, as in many ecoregions around the world, invasion of non-native plants is modifying the structure and composition of riparian vegetation.2. Restoration of native plant species frequently proves to be ecologically and economically difficult. In the Muddy River drainage in the Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA), eradication of one the most aggressive invasive plants, Tamarix ramosissima (salt-cedar), often reduces the structural and compositional diversity of the remaining vegetation. This can have negative effects on native animals, including birds.3. The objectives of our work were (i) to examine relationships between avian diversity and measures of vegetational diversity (species richness, dominance of non-native plants and vegetation structure [total vegetation volume]), (ii) to explore the extent to which avian community composition was associated with vegetation composition (floristics) or vegetation structure (physiognomy), and (iii) to consider the potential effects of alternative land management and ecological restoration strategies on the biodiversity of birds and other native fauna in watersheds in the arid south-western USA.4. Species richness of all birds and of breeding birds was best modelled by total vegetation volume alone. Neither species richness of plants nor dominance of non-native plants had a statistically significant effect on species richness, abundance or evenness of birds.5. Species composition of birds between sites was more similar when floristics was more similar, and vice versa. Species composition of birds was not correlated with physiognomy.6. Species richness of native birds in the Muddy River drainage appears not to suffer from invasion of non-native plants, provided that the vegetational community retains sufficient structural diversity.7. The composition of the bird community is closely related to floristics, and other taxonomic groups may exhibit different responses to vegetation structure and composition. Therefore, explicit strategies for landscape-scale management, restoration and maximization of native faunal diversity should consider how removal of invasive plants may affect physiognomy and floristics of the vegetational community as a whole.

Less than 1% of the original longleaf pine forests remain as old-growth stands. Eglin Air Force Base (Eglin) in northwest Florida contains the largest remaining extent of longleaf pine, but much of this habitat has been degraded through fire suppression, selective logging, and planting off-site species of pines. We examined the distribution of bird species among habitats during spring and fall 1994-1995 to assess the influence of large-scale habitat restoration on bird communities across the landscape. During both spring and fall, species richness and relative abundance of neotropical migrants were greatest in oak hammocks and riparian habitats. During spring, the abundance of resident species was greatest in barrier island scrub and flatwoods, but species richness of residents also was high in oak hammocks. During fall, both species richness and abundance of residents were greatest in oak hammocks and flatwoods. Analyses of abundance for individual species (both neotropical migrants and residents) suggested that each habitat examined was important for greater than or equal to1 species. An analysis examining the importance of habitats for conservation found that oak hammocks and riparian habitats were important for species of high management concern, but burned sandhills along with oak hammocks and riparian habitats were very important for species of the greatest management concern. Our results suggest that habitat modifications resulting from restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem will benefit many species of management concern. Bird species negatively affected by habitat modifications for longleaf pine restoration were abundant in other habitats.

IBIS			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology		HABITAT STRUCTURE, PINE PLANTATIONS, VEGETATION, MANAGEMENT, SUCCESSION, DROUGHT, PATTERN, FORESTS, NUMBERS	The occurrence of large burnt areas has increased considerably in southern Europe in recent years. In order to design management plans to prevent large wildfires while preserving biodiversity, understanding of the ways in which birds respond to these fires is required. We investigated the spatial variability of both avifauna and habitat structure in three zones: unburnt, burnt in 1982, and burnt in 1994. The habitat structure of the unburnt zone was the most variable spatially. However, bird species composition between sampling points was very homogeneous in space. In contrast, the bird communities inhabiting burnt zones were more spatially heterogeneous. This pattern was caused by distinct specific responses to variations in habitat structure. Open-space species responded to small changes in habitat structure with large changes in local abundance, whereas the response of forest species to these structural variations was much less. We suggest that land managers should select specific zones with limited vegetation recovery within large burnt areas and maintain them as open space to keep combustibility low and provide an appropriate habitat for several open space species that are of conservation concern.

Density estimates were calculated from primary forest and secondary habitats using the variable circular plot method. Eight of the nine restricted-range or threatened species resident on Karakelang were recorded and density estimates calculated for five of these. Two species of rail are endemic to Karakelang, Talaud Bush-hen Amaurornis magnirostris and Talaud Rail Gymnocrex talaudensis. The bush-hen was encountered in secondary habitat but occurred at higher densities in primary forest and the estimated population was 2,350-9,560 birds. The less vocal, cryptic G. talaudensis was noted just twice, in primary forest close to rivers. Both have small populations, are threatened by habitat degradation, hunting, and possibly predation by introduced rats and should be classified as threatened. Population densities of the Endangered, endemic Red-and-blue Lory Eos histrio had remained stable since the last survey in 1997. They occurred at higher densities in primary forest, but were also common in human-made habitats. The estimated population was 8,230-21,400 birds, threatened by habitat loss and trapping for the wild bird trade. Although more commonly encountered in forest, the Near Threatened Blue-naped Parrot Tanygnathus lucionensis was found at higher densities in secondary habitats, and the population was estimated at 8,130-20,700 birds. The Restricted-range Blue-tailed Imperial Pigeon D. concinna was very common on Karakelang (14,500-27,700 birds), whilst the Vulnerable Grey Imperial Pigeon D. pickeringii was recorded rarely; both species were more frequently recorded in primary forest. The endemic Talaud Kingfisher Halcyon enigma occurred at low densities (5,290-8,690 birds), in primary forest and adjacent disturbed areas. It is heavily dependent on primary forest and threatened by habitat loss, and should be classified as Vulnerable. Approximately 350 km(2) of primary forest on Karakelang is protected, 250 km(2) as a wildlife reserve. However, at present, management is absent and forest is threatened by agricultural encroachment, illegal logging, and fire. Given that all endemic and threatened species were encountered more frequently or occurred at higher densities in primary forests, future conservation efforts should target these protected areas. Management of reserves should involve local stakeholders from government and representatives of island communities. Wildlife trade is a major threat to Eos histrio and strict enforcement of the species' protected status should include monitoring of roost sites, patrols of harbours and markets in Talaud, Sulawesi and the Philippines, and the control of Philippine fishing boats involved in the wild bird trade. Further species-specific research and monitoring is also required.

Although many studies have quantified bird response to riparian buffer harvest, we are unaware of any study that examined the response of breeding birds to riparian forest harvest using different cutting practices. We compared community composition, total abundance and species richness, as well as abundance of six individual species on plots within four treatments (three plots/treatment) completed within 30 in on both sides of the stream. Treatments in the riparian area (30 m on both sides of the stream) were: (1) riparian control (no harvest); (2) reduction of basal area to an average of 7-10 m(2)/ha with full tree harvest system; (3) reduction of basal area to an average of 7-10 m(2)/ha with CTL harvest system; and (4) control (no harvest in riparian area or upland). For treatments 1, 2, and 3, adjacent upland forests on the plots were clearcut. Bird surveys were completed I year prior to, and 3 years after harvest and revealed a significant response of the bird community to timber harvest in the riparian area. Bird communities were most affected by tree removal with both harvest methods, but harvest type also affected bird communities. Early-successional species, e.g. song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), mourning warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), and chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica) were associated with harvested plots, whereas forest species, e.g. scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea) and black-throated green warbler (Dendroica virens) were associated with riparian control and control plots. Of six individual species tested for response to riparian harvest treatment over time, only the ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) showed a significant time by treatment interaction. Ovenbird numbers decreased in both the CTL and full tree harvest plots through 2000, when no individuals were observed. Two other forest-dependent species, black-throated green warbler and hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus), showed similar responses to treatment as the ovenbird. The winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) responded positively to the greater amount of slash that was left on-plot with the CTL harvest system. However, with the exception of the winter wren, we found that bird species and communities did not differ in their response to harvest system. ((C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

These variable responses represent potential opportunities for using fire to conserve the biodiversity of Fescue Prairie. Fire can be reintroduced as a process to create temporal and spatial variation in composition, structure, and functioning in a mosaic. This variability can be achieved by reintroducing fire throughout the year, altering the frequency and the proportion of prairie remnants burned, and by using many types of fires. In most cases specific burning prescriptions are not needed to reintroduce fire as a process that is essential for maintaining structure, functioning and composition in Fescue Prairie remnants. A primary goal for conserving Fescue Prairie remnants should be to reintroduce fire as a process to create and maintain patterns and diversity in species assemblages and species composition.

The most extreme logging treatment ( gap release) involved removal of most of the overstorey from patches no larger than 10 ha, followed by a regeneration fire. In the other logging treatment ( shelterwood), less wood was removed from a larger area, also followed by a fire. This study examined the impact of these disturbances on the avifauna by monitoring species richness and abundance of birds one year before logging, one year before burning, and for five years after burning. Although 68 bird species were recorded during the seven years of the study, 29 of these were detected fewer than 15 times. Of the other 39 bird species recorded, only two ( Gerygone fusca and Acanthiza apicalis) showed a statistically significant treatment effect over time on their abundance. The abundance of G. fusca initially declined in the disturbed treatments and by Year 7 of the study ( 5 years post-fire) in the gap-release treatment had not recovered its original abundance. A. apicalis increased its abundance in both shelterwood and gap-release treatments. By Year 7, both species in the logged treatments had abundances similar to those in the unlogged treatments. Total abundance of all species varied little across treatments. Species richness was highest by Year 7 in the shelterwood and lowest in the gap-release treatment. In some years community structure varied more at the external-reference sites ( not recently logged or burnt) than at the gap-release sites. In particular, there was little overlap in community structure in the external-reference treatment between the first and final years, whereas the pre-logging and final year in the gap-release treatment showed a high degree of overlap. These differences are suggestive of overriding short-term annual variation in broad-scale factors rather than local factors. Yearly variation in rainfall and temperature was documented; during low rainfall periods, populations of foliage arthropods may have been reduced.

We compared bird populations in 15 paired organic and nonorganic sites ( cornfields plus edges, 30 sites total) that were similar in environment and edge habitat but that differed in use of fertilizers, herbicides, cultivation, and crop rotations. At each site, we used one strip transect to sample birds and vegetation in the bordering edge and cornfield perimeter (0-25 m from the edge) and another to sample in the cornfield (50-150 m from the edge). During the 1995 and 1996 growing seasons, we recorded 54 bird species, 51 in organic and 39 in nonorganic sites. On average, bird abundance on organic sites was 2.6 times higher than on nonorganic sites, and mean species richness per visit was 2.0 times greater. When analyzed separately, organic edge, perimeter, and field transects supported higher bird abundance and greater richness than did their nonorganic counterparts. Abundance and richness were higher on organic sites for insectivores, omnivores, and granivores, and for each of three migratory groups. Twelve species were individually more abundant on organic sites, and one regularly observed species was observed only on organic sites. No species had greater abundance on nonorganic sites. More non-crop vegetation on organic cornfields, most likely a result of no herbicide use, may have provided better foraging opportunities for birds. The plant food, cover, and invertebrate prey in organic cornfields appeared to augment birds not only in the field but also in the uncropped edges. Organic fields appear to benefit birds, but reproductive success needs further study. Modifying farm-management practices, especially near field edges where bird activity is concentrated, may enhance the conservation of birds and their potential predation on crop pests.

We studied the patterns of bird densities across heath-wood edges at replicated sites in three locations in southeastern Australia. Multivariate analysis showed that the bird community in the ecotone was intermediate between the heath and wood communities, indicating that the ecotone contained a mixing of species rather than a unique bird community. ANOVA showed a modest increase in bird density at the wood side of the ecotone, which may be partly due to sampling biases rather than to some inherent habitat value in the ecotone. The outstanding pattern was that bird density and species richness in the wood habitat were twice as high as in the heath habitat. Of a total of 86 species, 31 occurred in sufficient numbers to categorize according to their habitat association (generalist, or heath or wood specialist) and their density at the ecotone (ecotone neutral, ecotone shy, or ecotone conspicuous). Three of these were habitat-generalist-ecotone-neutral. Fourteen species were ecotone neutral but were habitat specialists on either the wood (13 spp.) or the heath (1 sp.). Three species were ecotone shy. Although 11 species were ecotone conspicuous, they also occurred in either heath or wood or both. Thus, no species could be categorized as entirely ecotonal. We conclude that there is little evidence from this or other studies of avian communities to support an edge effect of increased density and species richness, and no evidence,of entirely ecotonal species.

We discuss potential ecological benefits associated with these terrestrial vegetation "islands", giving special attention to islands in disturbed shrub systems dominated by big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.). Shrub habitat islands provide important refugia for plant and animal species that are associates of shrubs-from those that generally require shrub cover to those that have evolved obligate symbioses with a particular shrub species. Even if islands are not able to support breeding populations, they may provide essential temporary habitat for maintaining a plant or animal metapopulation or for dispersing animals. Habitat islands are likely to enhance local biological diversity of plants and animals, because they harbor species that are lacking in disturbed areas, and because abrupt structural changes from disturbed to undisturbed vegetation provide a habitat mosaic that facilitates high levels of species turnover. A previous study confirmed that small mammal species richness in sagebrush islands is intermediate to the high species richness in undisturbed sagebrush "mainlands" and the low richness associated with burned sagebrush habitats. In re-analyzing some of the data from the latter study, we found that small mammal richness in sagebrush islands increases with time since the surrounding habitat burned. Finally, habitat islands provide more evenly dispersed seed sources for re-establishment of decimated vegetation within disturbed areas, and they may harbor animal species that provide seed dispersal services. Thus, they should accelerate vegetation recovery after disturbance. Managers, fire crews, and others who may influence how disturbance patterns affect habitat heterogeneity should be aware of these ecological benefits of habitat islands.

I compared four forest treatments: unlogged native forest (UL), two that were selectively logged Lit low (LL) and high (HL) intensities in the 1960s, and a conifer plantation (PL). Forest-dependent birds were best represented at UL. LL was similar to UL in both vegetation structure and bird community cornposition, although some forest-dependent bird species were missing from the former. HL had significantly less canopy closure and lower tree density than other plots as a result of the combination of extensive secondary damage and natural disturbance patterns that prevented the reclosure of the forest canopy. Thirty-one percent of the forest-dependent bird species observed during the study were not detected Lit HL. At PL, bird species richness and bird abundance were about a third of those observed in other plots. There were significant correlations between heterogeneity of tree distribution (horizontal heterogeneity) and abundance and species richness of birds across plots. Abundance and species richness of all, forest-dependent, and forest generalist birds were highest in plots with intermediate measures of horizontal heterogeneity, which were mostly unlogged or lightly logged. If reduced-impact logging practices are not implemented during selective logging operations in tropical forests, consequent long-term changes in vegetation structure may result ill significant declines in the populations of some forest-dependent species, as was observed in Kibale National Park.

Data were collected on species abundance and habitat structure of dry sclerophyll production forest at 36 sites with known logging and fire histories. Sixteen bird species were recorded with most being resident, territorial, obligate hollow nesters that used hollows that were either small (<10 cm diameter) or very large (>18 cm diameter). Species densities were typically low, but combinations of two forest management and three habitat structural variables influenced the abundances of eight bird species in different and sometimes conflicting ways. The results suggest that habitat tree management for biodiversity in production forests cannot depend upon habitat structural characteristics alone. Management histories appear to have independent influence (on some bird species) that are distinguishable from their impacts on habitat structure per se. Rather than managing to maximize species abundances to maintain biodiversity, we may be better off managing to avoid extinctions of populations by identifying thresholds of acceptable fluctuations in populations of not only hollow-nesting birds but other forest dependent wildlife relative to scientifically valid forest management and habitat structural surrogates.

We test for the factors most important in determining the availability of snags (dead standing trees) in fire-origin boreal forests of northwestern Ontario. The strongest correlate of snag basal area (m(2)/ha) was the amount of live tree basal area, which accounted for 68% of variation in the production of snags. The relationship between live and dead tree basal area followed a 3/4 power law with a slope of 0.74 for the forest community and differing slopes for forest stands and forest age. A relationship between tree mortality and metabolic rate is consistent with rate of self-thinning theory. This invariance indicates that total community biomass is likely to be insensitive to species diversity. Mixed hardwood forest types produced the greatest basal area of snags, followed by poplar, mixed conifer, jack pine and spruce stands. The percentage of stems that were dead was greatest in young forests (18% of stems in 0-60-year-old forests), decreased to a low percentage of 12% in 61-80-year-old forests, and thereafter increased with age of forests from 15 to 16% in 81-100, >100-year-old forests, respectively. In contrast, the number of small diameter (10-22 cm dbh) snags (stems/ha) was greatest in 61-100-year-old forests, whereas medium diameter (22-30 cm dbh) snags and large diameter (>30 cm dbh) snags were greatest in old-growth (>100 years) forests. The management implications are that increased live tree density due to environmental conditions, or possibly intensive forest management practices following clear cutting, may secondarily result in greater snag production and the structural complexity that favors wildlife biodiversity. Forest management guidelines that incorporate allometric relationships are needed to ensure maintenance of biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity following timber harvesting.

State and federal agencies have responded to this habitat loss with programs and land acquisition that have increased the amount of grassland on the landscape by restoring grassland from other land-Use practices. We assessed the effects of habitat restoration and the relative contribution of local habitat and landscape factors on breeding grassland birds in northern Iowa. During the 1999 and 2000 breeding seasons, we Surveyed grassland birds in 10 tallgrass prairies and 10 restored grasslands that contained a wide diversity of habitat and landscape conditions. Densities of common bird species were similar between habitat types, except for grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), which were 4 and 9 times more dense in restored grasslands, respectively. Species richness of breeding birds was similar between habitat types. Habitat structure was different in prairies and restored grasslands; restored grasslands had 7% less total vegetation cover and 3% more bare ground. A nested, multiscale analysis indicated that habitat structure explained some variation in species richness and bird density of all common species, yet addition of landscape structure improved models for species richness and for density of 4 of 8 species considered, explaining an additional 10-29% of the variation. Edge-density metrics were the most common variables entering into landscape models; most species had lower densities in landscapes with high edge density. Our results indicate that restored grassland habitats contain bird communities generally similar to those in native prairie habitats in northern Iowa, suggesting that restored grasslands may provide similar habitat suitability for most grassland birds. In addition, both local habitat and landscape factors can be important for managing breeding grassland birds.

To determine northern bobwhite (hereafter, bobwhite) population response in untreated control, thinned, and thinned and burned stands either 1, 2, or 3 growing seasons (Mar to mid-Oct) post-burn, we used whistling-male counts and covey-call counts as indices of population abundance. We estimated woody stem density, understory and overstory canopy cover, conifer and hardwood basal area, and the disc of vulnerability to characterize habitat response. Relative abundance of whistling males in the spring was greatest in thinned stands 3 growing seasons post-burn and in thinned but unburned stands. These stands had the smallest disc of vulnerability and the greatest understory shrub cover <2 in in height compared with other treatments. A threshold-like increase in bobwhite abundance was observed as a function of woody structure <2 in. Pine-grassland restoration provided suitable structure for bobwhites in spring, summer, and fall, but may not be adequate in winter. Further, data suggested that bobwhite density within a stand also was related to the amount of suitable habitat Surrounding the stand. Bobwhite management efforts in similar shortleaf pine forests should include thinning to reduce midstory and overstory cover and frequent fire to maintain open woodland conditions-i.e., low basal area stands with limited midstory.

The impact of these management practices on the fauna is poorly known. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of reed cutting in the Mediterranean region through a comparative analysis of water regime, vegetation structure, arthropod distribution and passerine assemblage at cut and uncut reedbeds in southern France. Cut reedbeds were characterised by a lower salinity, higher water level in spring, and higher reed biomass than uncut reedbeds. Arthropod distribution differed consistently between cut and uncut sites, leading to a higher index of food available to passerines in cut reedbeds. Cut reedbeds had a similar bird species richness but a lower bird abundance, due to the significant decrease in Moustached Warblers and Bearded Tits at cut sites. The mild Mediterranean winter favoured early growth of reed in spring, making harvested reedbeds suitable for breeding of long-distance migrants such as the Great Reed Warbler and Reed Warbler. However, for the resident species that breed earlier in the season, cut reedbeds presumably lack sufficient vegetation cover to provide adequate nesting and feeding sites. Although biennial cutting (double wale) is considered as a good compromise between conservation and commercial interests in the UK, the juxtaposition of annually cut and never cut reed patches appears as the only sustainable alternative for the Mediterranean region. We further hypothesise that an optimal mosaic design of cut/uncut reed patches could provide as high a conservation value as unmanaged reedbeds.

Plant species' richness in plantations was significantly greater than in secondary forests; there were, however, fewer tall-tree species in plantations than in secondary forests. Plantations also contained fewer tall-tree species with animal-dispersed seeds. Although some studies have shown that some species with animal-dispersed seeds can colonize plantations, this study did not. These results suggest that differences in management practices cause various responses according to species type and affect the ecological process of seed dispersal. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Intensive management for pine specialists such as the Red-cockaded Woodpecker may negatively impact both Nearctic-Neotropical and Temperate Zone migrants associated with hardwood vegetation. To evaluate possible positive and negative associations, we surveyed avian communities from 1995-1997 using point counts within managed Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavity tree clusters and mature forest control sites in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and loblolly (P. taeda)-shortleaf (P. echinata) pine habitats. In general, sites managed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers supported more diverse and numerous bird populations than mature forest control sites. During the breeding season in loblolly-shortleaf and longleaf pine habitats, respectively, species richness was 47% and 23% greater, avian abundance was 57% and 65% greater, and bird species diversity was 25% and 21% greater within managed Red-cockaded Woodpecker cluster sites than within control sites. During winter, species richness and avian abundance each were 52% higher within managed Red-cockaded Woodpecker cluster sites than control sites in loblolly-shortleaf pine habitat.

BSP) sites, after 5, 14, and 27 years of succession. Total bird density was lower in clear-cut sites resulting from fewer hermit thrushes, yellow warblers, Swainson's thrushes, and fox sparrows. Hermit thrushes were positively correlated with snag density while yellow warblers and Swainson's thrushes were positively associated with deciduous tree cover and negatively correlated with conifer cover. Only yellow-rumped warblers had higher densities on clear-cut sites, likely due to greater conifer cover. Bird densities and species richness peaked in the 14-year-old burns and exceeded that of mature forests reported for Labrador. This demonstrates the importance of natural early successional forests for birds. Although logged areas support several species found in natural young burns, logging does not precisely mimic fire. This suggests that forest managers should allow some forests to burn naturally.

Variations of the distribution and abundance of birds were related to changes in the plant-species composition and structural attributes of their habitat. Bird species occurred in plantations in levels of abundance and diversity similar to that of reference forest, although community composition was highly dissimilar. Species of reference stands were typical of mature, mixedwood forest. Species of younger plantations were typical of open, early successional, upland habitats. Once the plantations became older than 13 years and the tree height exceeded about 5 in, birds typical of conifer forest began to invade the habitat, resulting in a mixed-species composition. Although cavity-containing snags were rare in the plantations, if they did occur in them or near their edge they were used by hole-nesting birds. Although we could not study a complete rotation, the field data and habitat trajectory suggest that the plantations will not support some elements of the avian biodiversity of the natural forest in the study area. The mature plantations will be highly depauperate in coarse-woody debris, snags, and cavities, and will not support species dependent on these critical habitat elements. In addition, birds requiring habitat containing trees of larger size and of various species, including hardwoods, will not find the mature plantations to be suitable. To accommodate the needs of species potentially at risk from the extensive development of plantations, the following changes in forestry management practices should be instituted: (1) retention of natural cavity-trees, snags, coarse-woody debris, and hardwood trees and shrubs in residual non-harvested "islands" within clear-cuts and plantations; (b) retention of a patchy angiosperm component by leaving some areas untreated during herbicide applications; and (c) setting aside large areas of natural forest as non-harvested protected areas. Although we believe that these mitigations would help sustain elements of indigenous biodiversity that are at risk in an extensive industrial forest, we stress that these predictions would have to be tested through additional research and monitoring.

Although initially designed to assess the influence of fragment area on Amazonian biotas, the project has yielded insights that go far beyond the original scope of the study. Results suggest that edge effects play a key role in fragment dynamics, that the matrix has a major influence on fragment connectivity and functioning, and that many Amazonian species avoid even small (<100-m-wide) clearings. The effects of fragmentation are highly eclectic, altering species richness and abundances, species invasions, forest dynamics, the trophic structure of communities, and a variety of ecological and ecosystem processes. Moreover, forest fragmentation appears to interact synergistically with ecological changes such as hunting, fires, and logging, collectively posing an even greater threat to the rainforest biota.

In each of four blocks, we established four experimental units: (1) DCWD removed, (2) snags and DCWD removed, and (3) and (4) unmodified control plots. We quantified vegetation layers to determine their effects on the experimental outcome. Total breeding bird abundance, abundance of resident species, breeding bird diversity, breeding species richness, and abundance of Great Crested Flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus ) were reduced by the removal of DCWD and snags. Total woodpecker and Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus ) breeding territories were reduced by snag removal. Weak excavating and secondary cavity-nesting species, Neotropical migrants, and Eastern Towhees (Pipilio erythrophthalmus ) had fewer breeding territories on plots where DCWD was removed. Red-headed Woodpeckers ( Melanerpes erythrocephalus ) and midstory and canopy-nesting species were at lowest densities on plots where all CWD had been removed. The CWD removal had no effect on the nonbreeding bird community. Most breeding and nonbreeding species used habitats with sparse midstory and well-developed understory, whereas sparse canopy cover and dense midstory were important to some nonbreeding species. Snag and DCWD retention, and practices that maintain a dense understory and sparse midstory and canopy, will create favorable breeding habitat for many bird species of loblolly pine forests.

Most researchers of riparian forest avifauna have used riparian woodland width as an index of forest area. We conducted point counts at 135 locations along Big and Little Darby creeks in Ohio and used Landsat Thematic Mapper data to determine woodland area and width surrounding each point-count station. Probability of detection was positively correlated with area for 11 bird species and negatively correlated with area for 8 species. Thus, along Big and Little Darby creeks, woodland area appeared to better predict bird-species presence than woodland width. The proposed Little Darby National Wildlife Refuge located within the study area includes restoration of riparian forest habitat along the two creeks. If the riparian habitat zones are not sufficient in area, already common species, rather than declining Neotropical migrants, may be the only species to benefit from restoration efforts.

We surveyed birds and sampled vegetation along 1-km line transects bisecting 14 (7 control, 7 burn) 25-ha Plots located randomly within a burn and adjacent, control unit. Following a spring burn that was moderate in intensity and patchy ill areal extent, we observed that ground Cover was affected more strongly by burning than mesquite (Prosopis) cover, smaller mesquite were affected more strongly by burning than larger mesquite, and mortality of mesquite was low. No change in total abundance of birds was detected oil the burn unit following fire for either wintering or breeding birds; however, species richness of breeding birds decreased in the first war post-burn. During the breeding season, mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) increased, whereas Botteri's sparrows (Aimophila botterii), Cassin's sparrows (Aimophila and cassinii), and (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus) decreased in relative abundance following fire. During the wintering season, ladder-backed woodpeckers (Picoides scalaris) and vesper sparrows (Pooeceles gramineus) increased and cactus wrens decreased in relative abundance following fire. Beyond species-level trends, we found stronger evidence of trends and greater magnitudes of relative change for breeding species associated with open grasslands compared to those associated with shrubs. The use of spring burns on the Refuge will likely improve conditions for open-grassland species that were historically more abundant by killing smaller mesquite and reducing mesquite recruitment. However, more intense and extensive fires will be required to reduce the presence of larger mesquite. Such fires would likely have a greater impact oil birds associated with shrubs, and consequently, a greater impact oil the avian community as a whole.

Habitat characteristics (water depth, vegetation height and density, and plant-species composition) and abundance of all passerine species were measured at each of the 68 sampling points. The sampled area included most of the reedbeds in the Ebro Delta. Sampling points were classified according to the habitat parameters measured using cluster analysis. The resulting four habitat types differed in the composition and attributes of their passerine communities. The abundance of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) was greatest in tall, permanently inundated and almost monospecific Phragmites reedbeds. In contrast, the numbers of the reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and Savi's warbler (Locustella luscinioides) were greatest in areas of drier soils and a denser basal stratum. Finally, the fan-tailed warbler (Cisticola juncidis) showed no clear habitat association, In the Ebro Delta, reedbed management includes freshwater inputs and burning of standing reeds. These practices promote tall, permanently inundated reedbeds with minimal detrital accumulation. Bird species richness and diversity were greater in less intensely-managed habitats, but only diversity was significant (p < 0.001). We conclude that, since reedbeds are important habitats for several scarce bird species, and the abundance of these species seem to be influenced by vegetation structure, bird conservation considerations should be incorporated into future reedbed management practices.

Recent incentives have led to increased interest in longleaf pine restoration. These restoration efforts often emphasize reestablishing native groundcovers, yet there have been no studies that address the role of native groundcover on breeding bird communities within longleaf pine forests. Therefore, we studied breeding bird communities in mature longleaf pine stands with either native or disturbed groundcovers to determine the likely effects of groundcover reestablishment associated with longleaf pine reforestation. Avian species richness and diversity did not differ (P=0.823, P=0.571, respectively), and avian community similarity was high (Morisita's index=0.98) between native and disturbed groundcover. However, pine warblers (Dendroica pinus), gray cat-birds (Dumetella carolinensis), eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) were more abundant (Pless than or equal to0.10) in areas with native groundcover, whereas indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) were more abundant (P=0.058) in areas with disturbed groundcover. Although groundcover restoration may benefit some avian populations, overall avian species richness, diversity, and community composition may be unaffected. Restoration of native groundcover may be best justified for aesthetic values and as a tool to facilitate long-term stand management using prescribed fire.

In an effort to understand how avian communities may be affected by a regional change in forest composition from oak to maple dominance, we compared bird communities in both Oak- and maple-dominated forest stands in three seasons (winter, spring, and fall). In 1998 and 1999, birds were surveyed and habitat characteristics were measured in six mature forest woodlots in central Pennsylvania. Total abundance of birds was greater within Oak- than maple-dominated stands in all seasons, whereas species richness was greater in oak stands only in the spring. Resident species, long-distance migrants, woodpeckers, bark-gleaners, and 11 individual species were more abundant within oak than maple stands in at least one season. Differences in avian community structure between oak and maple stands were greatest in the fall when oaks produced hard mast and in the spring when insectivorous birds gleaned arthropods from tree substrates. This pattern was consistent with our expectations based on mast characteristics and tree physiognomy of maples and oaks as well as the diet and foraging behavior of birds. Our results suggest that a regional change from Oak- to maple-dominated forests may strongly affect avian community structure and populations of some common bird species associated with eastern deciduous forests.

Historically, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities were characterized by frequent, cool ground fires. Intensive fire suppression and timber harvest throughout the past century have drastically altered the structure of existing forests. Today, much of the area has been harvested using shelterwood logging resulting in open even-aged stands. The goal of this study was to compare bird communities in treated (areas that have recently been harvested) and untreated (areas receiving minimal silvicultural treatment) in the past 40 yr. Of the 20 commonly observed bird species, 3 species [red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta Canadensis), brown creeper (Certhia Americana), and ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus)] were conspicuously less abundant in treated than in untreated stands. Eleven other species were more abundant in treated stands, while six species showed no response to treatment. Although bird species diversity and the abundance of birds were highest in treated stands, this does not imply that logging is beneficial to the entire bird community. The abundance of particular bird species may appear to have increased, but the composition of the bird community has been altered. As more of the forested areas are harvested, the bird community will shift from one with birds typical of both open pine and dense pine forest to one dominated by ground foraging species.

Field margin management is frequently proposed as a way of enhancing bird populations but there have been few attempts to assess the relative value of different management options. This paper aims to provide a preliminary assessment of the relative value of six different cereal field margin management practices in providing foraging habitats for farmland birds. It also briefly compares these with the benefits afforded by field and whole farm approaches such as set-aside and organic farming, to wildlife conservation on arable land. The field margins considered are: grass margins (separated into grass-only strips and grass/wildflower strips), naturally regenerated set-aside margins, uncropped wildlife strips, game cover crops and conservation headlands. Sympathetically managed field margins can provide a range of plant and invertebrate food resources for birds both in summer and winter. In general, the best winter food supplies (mainly seeds) will be provided by game cover crops and naturally regenerated rotational set-aside strips. The most abundant summer food supplies (invertebrates and seeds) will be provided by a diverse sward; grass/wildflower strips, uncropped wildlife strips and naturally regenerated rotational set-aside strips followed by conservation headlands. Field margin swards that are less diverse in terms of species composition and structural heterogeneity and that consequently support fewer invertebrates, can, nonetheless, provide higher quality foraging habitats for birds than an intensively managed crop up to the hedge base. A number of bird species such as yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) and tree sparrow (Passer montanus), prefer to forage in margins in winter and summer and many of the benefits of whole field approaches such as set-aside, overwinter stubbles and undersown cereals. could be gained from margins under the same management, Whole-field approaches are, however, required for boundary-avoiding species such as skylark (Alauda arvensis) and lapwing (Vanellus vanellus). Less is known about the use other birds make of margins, relative to their use of field centres in winter. Whole farm approaches such as organic farming, whilst being highly beneficial to birds, are likely to remain rather localised in the UK, whereas field margin management can be relatively easily incorporated into the farmed landscape on an extensive scale.

However, our study of understorey plant species in various plantations of single exotic or indigenous species has shown that more plant species grew within stands near a natural forest than within grasslands in Sakaerat, northeastern Thailand. These forests contribute to the acceleration of the secondary succession from grassland, which before reafforestation was achieved by recurrent fires. In the natural regeneration of understorey tree species in planted forests, large tree species in the natural forest seem to be the major common seed source among the stands studied. The small leaf biomass in these planted forests generated enough shade to prevent the invasion of 2 fire-adapted competitive grasses and to provide a suitable light environment for seedling establishment at an early stage of forest development. These factors facilitated the establishment of other species within the plantations of single tree species. Faster-growing exotic species accumulated larger amounts of understorey biomass than indigenous species. The most suitable species was Acacia mangium. The association of forests planted with single tree species with a high species richness in the ecosystems may enable to achieve a high biological diversity at the landscape level, which could bring various benefits to the forests of Sakaerat.

Predation is not only an important ecological process in the population dynamics of red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, but also has conservation implications for their predators such as hen harrier Circus cyaneus and peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus. It has been suggested that habitat management might reduce the susceptibility of grouse to predation and thus reduce conflicts between grouse management and raptor conservation.2. We investigated whether habitat characteristics influenced predation on red grouse on a managed moor near Langholm in southern Scotland during 1992-96. We combined demographic studies of the grouse population with radio-telemetry of individual grouse to assess the influence of habitat on mortality rates. Systematic observations of hen harriers were also used to assess the effect of habitat characteristics on their encounter rates and strike success with grouse and other prey.3. There was no evidence that habitat characteristics directly influenced grouse mortality rates at the scale of the grouse population. However, grouse densities were higher and overwinter losses of grouse were lower on areas with greater cover of heather Calluna vulgaris. The most likely explanation for the observed pattern of winter loss was that grouse dispersed into areas with more heather, to some extent locally compensating for losses to predators.4. Individual radio-tagged grouse that survived the winter had more blaeberry Vaccinium myrtillus in their home ranges than grouse that were killed in winter by predators. There was, however, no effect of heather cover, vegetation height or vegetation density on the likelihood of individual grouse survival.5. Hen harriers were more likely to encounter grouse broods in a mixture of heather and grass than expected from the observed distributions of grouse broods on moorland. However, having encountered a grouse brood, there was no effect of habitat type or vegetation height on the strike success of the harriers.6. We conclude that the direct effects of habitat on the susceptibility of red grouse to predation are limited under current predator control regimes on managed moorland. Habitat management aimed at mitigating conflicts between raptor conservation and grouse management should focus on reducing the availability of passerine and small mammal prey for hen harriers and thus reducing harrier abundance on grouse moors. Further research is required, however, to assess the consequences of such management for biodiversity.

We hypothesized that bird communities undergo greater seasonal changes in burnt areas than in unburnt ones. Using the point-count method we assessed bird species composition and abundance in three zones (unburnt, burnt in 1982, and burnt in 1994) during the breeding and wintering seasons of 1997 and 1998.From the breeding to the wintering seasons, burnt zones showed an increase in forest species, whereas the bird community of the unburnt zone remained stable in the gradient open-forest species. Moreover, the seasonal turnover of communities was higher in burnt zones than in the unburnt ones, although this did not imply that the former varied in richness through the year. The pattern of bird abundance in the unburnt zone was similar during the two study years, in contrast with that of burnt zones, suggesting higher annual cyclicity in resource availability in unburnt areas. These findings suggest that fire increases the seasonal variability of bird communities.

Unmanaged old-growth and unmanaged second-growth forests provided baselines for comparing the effects of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on selected aspects of biological diversity. Three replications of each condition were located on the Winegar Moraine in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Old-growth forests were multistoried, dominated by a few, large trees with well-developed crowns extending over a subcanopy stratum 10-15 m in height and an abundance of woody vegetation (mostly sugar maple seedlings) at 2-3 m. This complex stand structure contrasts with the relatively uniform structure of unmanaged second-growth forests with a closed overstory canopy and limited understory development. Forest management, both even- and uneven-aged, created forest structures that were more complex than their unmanaged second-growth baselines, yet managed forests lacked some of the structural complexity characteristic of old-growth. Managed forests had fewer large trees (stem diameter at 1.37 m > 50 cm) and considerably less basal area in dead trees when compared with old-growth. There were fewer tree species in managed forests because commercially important tree species were favored for retention and, when present, early successional species (e.g., Populus grandidentata Michx., Populus tremuloides Michx.) were harvested. A subcanopy comprised of large shrubs and small trees characteristic of old growth was absent in managed forests, but this structural element may develop with time under management. As expected, thinning the overstory and disturbing the forest floor through tree harvesting promoted understory development in managed forests, Most of the added species, however, were common in the landscape and thus added little to overall species richness.

The effects of Red-cockaded Woodpecker management on winter birds in longleaf pine sandhill forests are largely unknown. Examining habitat use of winter migrants, some of which are declining, may influence the selection of habitat management techniques used for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers to benefit overwintering migrants. During the winters (December-February) of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999, we tested experimentally the effects of hardwood reduction treatments applied in 1995 on winter birds at Eglin Air Force Base in fire-excluded northwest Florida longleaf pine sandhills. Treatments were (1) prescribed spring burning, (2) herbicide application, (3) mechanical felling and girdling, and (4) a control where decades of fire exclusion was maintained. We also sampled winter bird flocks in frequently burned, nonexperimental reference plots to measure management success. Hardwood reduction techniques had no effect on flock species richness, which averaged 7.9 and 7.2, respectively, during 1997-1993 and 1998-1999. Larger flocks in felling and girdling and in herbicide plots were primarily due to significantly higher numbers of overwintering Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina), as well as resident Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and an influx of temperate migrant Pine Warblers (Dendroica pinus). In contrast, flocks in control plots were smaller (flock size and species composition in spring burn plots were intermediate) and composed of hardwood-associated species, such as Tufted Titmouse (Bacolophus bicolor) and Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). The relative uses of longleaf pines and hardwoods by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, Pine Warblers, and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) during both winters best explained that winter birds present in herbicide, felling and girdling, and reference plots were more likely to forage on the same tree species and substrates than birds in spring-burned plots, and least likely to forage on the same species and substrates as birds in the control plots. Those differences corresponded to the following increasing order of hardwood stem mortality among treatments: control, spring burn (41%), felling and girdling (62%), and herbicide (92%). Repeated burning is recommended to restore the reference foraging condition because it was eight times less expensive than other techniques, which favored mostly Chipping Sparrows.

The objective of this study was to compare the value of these habitats as a repository of plant biodiversity in agricultural areas of southern Quebec. The overall plant diversity was higher in natural hedgerows and they contained more plant species of conservation values than other hedgerow types. Plant species richness per quadrat was, however, higher in planted woody hedgerows, and together with the species composition, lead to the conclusion that planted hedgerows in their entirety consisted of an ecotone type of vegetation such as is found in field edges which usually support high plant diversity and productivity but where transient plant species predominate. Consequently, this study indicated that natural hedgerows fare better than planted hedgerows in terms of diversity of plants of conservation interest. In spite of that, planted woody hedgerows contained plant (and bird) species of some interest and should be favoured over more desolate herbaceous hedgerows. In areas where hedgerows were removed and are not re-establishing naturally, a mixture of deciduous trees and conifers should be encouraged in further windbreak planting programs so as to conciliate both the conservation and agronomic objectives. Furthermore, management practices should optimise the growth of establishing plants of conservation values.

This area has higher fertility, flat topography, high water table and better access than the surrounding Boreal Forest, and therefore has greater potential for increased waterfowl production through habitat management. Overall breeding density averaged 112.5 indicated breeding pairs per 100 km(2), 68% being of the four most common species [Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Ring-necked Duck (Aythya collaris), American Black Duck (Anas rubripes), and Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula)]; 13 other species were encountered. The average total of breeding waterfowl for the region was estimated at 59330 pairs. Distributions of the species were related to ecodistrict and to surficial geology. The more northerly of the two main ecodistricts had higher densities of American Black Ducks, Ring-necked Ducks, Common Goldeneyes, and Canada Geese (Branta canadensis). Mallard and Hooded Merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus) distributions correlated with presence of surficial clay and moraines, respectively. Less common species including Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca) and American Wigeon (Anas americana) appeared to be concentrated in smaller-scaled habitat features (beaver pond sequences and estuarine marshes, respectively). Results generally agreed with those of earlier Clay Belt surveys. Total breeding density of waterfowl is slightly higher than that of surrounding regions.

To investigate possible changes in bird communities, we compared species richness and composition in six forest types (mature spruce plantations, ecotones, mixed forests, and three birch forest types) in two regions over two years. In the southern region, birch forests tended to host a higher number of species than spruce plantations, but species composition differed between forest types. The species composition in rich birch forests was particularly distinguished from spruce plantations, but also from the less productive birch habitats. Furthermore, there were dissimilarities in species richness and composition between regions. Ground nesters and species nesting on their northern margins occur-red most frequently in the southern region, whereas cavity-nesters were most abundant in the northern region. Some species declined in abundance from 1998 to 1999, whereas three species shifted their main distribution from birch forests to mixed forests/ecotones. Possible factors underlying these results are discussed. We recommend that researchers and managers pay attention to habitat qualities within forest types (i.e., other than tree species composition in overstory) as well as to regional variations in species assemblages when addressing outcomes of management practices.

We studied songbirds 5-6 years post-fire in a large burn (9600 ha) in the boreal mixedwood forest of north-eastern Alberta. In the spring of 1995 and 1996 we estimated abundance of songbirds in four areas, each with four replicate sites: unburned patches within the fire (Isolates); burned patches (Burns); patches that had been clear-cut prior to burning by wildfire (Cut-Burns); and the unburned, continuous forest adjacent to the burn (Peripherals). We also sampled shrub-based arthropods with sweep-nets at each site. To investigate the role of Isolates, we compared them to Peripherals and to Burns. We compared Cut-Burns to Burns to examine the effect of logging prior to burning. In general, Isolates supported higher numbers of species and individuals than Peripherals, mainly due to higher numbers of aerial-foraging birds. Isolates and Burns had similar species richness and abundance, but Burns supported more aerial foragers while Isolates had more foliage gleaners. Cut-Burns generally supported fewer individuals than Burns, in particular fewer shrub-nesters, aerial foragers, and neotropical migrants. More bird species reached their highest densities in Burns than in any other area. Songbird species richness and abundance were positively related to dry arthropod biomass, with Burns and Isolates having the highest arthropod biomass. These patterns indicated that, 5-6 years post-burn, the patchy mosaic created by this wildfire supported more species than the mature forest surrounding the fire. Clear-cut logging prior to burning resulted in a diminished songbird community compared to that found in burned stands.

For example, several birds (Crex crex, Numenius arquata) as well as plant species (Gratiola officinalis, Inula britannica, Teucrium scordium, Ranunculus lingua and Mentha pulegium) which have declined seriously in France in recent times are found in the upper Meuse floodplain. Phytosociological studies and water level measurements have shown that the floristic diversity is mainly influenced by hydrological fluctuations and agricultural practices. The plant communities are structured along a topographical gradient in the high water bed reflecting the duration of floods and the ground water table depth. Agricultural practices have influenced the vegetation changes by selecting species adapted to particular management practices (e.g., fertiliser use, grazing, cutting regime). The data collected in this study from the upper Meuse as enabled 13 grassland and wetland ecotopes to be defined which are correlated with different environmental factors. Fertiliser use, grazing and reduction in the frequency of the cutting lead to a lower species richness because they encourage competitive species. However, it is also demonstrated, that maximum biodiversity is not always synonymous with high conservation value because some impoverished ecosystems, e.g., sedges and tall forb formations, may contain endangered plant and bird species. Knowledge of the boundaries between the different plant communities enables likely changes in floristic composition after modification of one or more site factors to be forecasted. Such factors include, water table depth and flood frequency, cutting regime, fertiliser use and grazing pressure. Thus, the definition of these ecotopes, corresponding to correlations between water regime, agricultural practice and vegetation composition, could lead to the establishment of guidelines for water and agricultural managements that could be involved in restoration projects.

Variable retention harvests or 'green-tree retention systems' are important to the management of coniferous forests in the temperate zone. Green-tree retention leaves large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand and provide mature forest habitat that develops sooner than in typical even-aged management by clear-cutting. The seed-tree system is one method of harvesting that leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally. Green-tree retention may increase biological diversity and help to enhance functional links among forest structures or ecological processes.2. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the abundance (e.g. basal area and density of residual trees and amount of vegetation) and diversity (e.g. species diversity and structural diversity of the herb, shrub and tree layers) of various aspects of stand structure will decline with lower levels of tree retention. In particular, abundance and diversity should be greater in sites with green-tree retention than in clear-cut sites.3. Stand structure attributes were measured from 1996 (immediately after harvesting) to 1999 in replicated clear-cut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada.4. In terms of abundance, clear-cut, single seed-tree and group seed-tree sites had similar mean basal areas of residual trees, ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 m(2) ha(-1), with significantly higher levels on patch-cut (23.4 m(2) ha(-1)) and uncut forest (39.0 m(2) ha(-1)) sites. Mean densities of residual trees also followed this pattern, ranging from 0.7 to 16.3 stems ha(-1) on the clear-cut to group seed-tree sites, to 769.4 and 2050.0 stems ha(-1) on the patch-cut and uncut forest sites, respectively. However, mean volume (m(3) ha(-1)) of fallen wood (i.e. dead wood or woody debris) was similar among sites, ranging from 116.7 in the single seed-tree to 210.2 in the patch-cut sites. Contrary to our hypothesis, the mean index of total crown volume of herbs, shrubs, mosses and lichens was similar among sites.5. Mean species richness of herbs, shrubs and total plants was similar among sites. Mean richness of trees in seed-tree sites was similar to that in uncut forest in three of four post-harvest years. The mean species diversity of herbs was similar among sites, but that of shrubs and trees was generally lowest in the patch-cut sites and similar among the other sites.6. The mean structural richness and diversity of herbs was lowest in the uncut forest and similar at the other sites 3 and 4 years post-harvest. The mean structural richness of trees and total plants in the patch-cut and uncut forest sites had more vegetation layers than the other sites.7. Our hypothesis was partly supported in terms of basal area and density of residual trees and structural richness of total vegetation layers across a gradient of tree retention from uncut forest to clear-cut sites. However, this pattern was not supported for abundance or diversity of understorey vegetation. Thus, the structural attributes of residual trees and layers of vegetation, but not the abundance, species richness or species diversity of understorey vegetation, lend support to the aims of variable retention harvesting, at least up to 4 years post-harvest.

In the UK conservation is centred on management of the warbler's lowland heath habitat. This study analysed the warbler's habitat requirements in Dorset, its UK population centre. Maps of breeding territories from 1974, 1984 and 1994 were linked to maps of heathland vegetation and adjacent land use from 1978, 1987 and 1996. Logistic regression showed territories were positively associated with the area of dry/humid heath, mature Ulex europaeus, bare soil, and more rarely with wet heath, young U. europaeus, U. gallii and Pinus scrub. There were negative responses to fragmentation (isolation and area of a heath), and the proximity of woodland, urban areas and intensive agriculture, Sub-optimal habitat was used in years of high population size. Habitat management for this species should consider not only heathland vegetation but also landscape factors such as fragmentation and the proximity of avoided land use types.

We counted birds during the 1990 breeding season on 72 field sites in southern Ontario, Canada, paired between 10 organic and 10 conventional farms for local habitat to enhance our ability to detect effects of agricultural practices. Of 68 species recorded, 58 were on organic sites, 59 on conventional. Species richness and total abundance were significantly greater on organic than conventional sites based on log-linear regression. Of 43 species analyzed with log-linear regression, eight (18.6%) were significantly (P <0.05) more abundant on organic than conventional sites and four (9.3%) approached significance (0.05 <P <0.10). Eight of these 12 species had negative population trends for 1967-1998 Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS) in this region. Two of the 43 species analyzed (4.7%) were significantly more abundant on conventional than organic sites and three (7.0%) approached significance. Two of these five species had negative BBS population trends. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of 13 practices and 13 habitat variables explained 44% of total variation (TV) accounted for in a detrended correspondence analysis of bird species composition and abundance. Practices contributed 23.7% of TV, habitat 26%; habitat and practices shared 5.7% with each other and 12% with farm ownership (i.e. clustering of field sites within farms). CCA ordinations indicated considerable mixing of organic and conventional sites across a gradient from sites with many birds species associated with greater habitat heterogeneity and more pasture, winter grain, farmstead and other non-crop habitats (hedgerow, woodland) to sites with few bird species associated with larger fields, more rowcrop and spring grain, more passes and tilling, and use of herbicides and chemical fertilizers. Our results re-emphasize the importance of non-crop habitats, more permanent crop cover, and less intensive management practices to the conservation of avian biodiversity on farmland.

We studied the effects of repeated burning (1-4 years of annual burning) and recovery (1 year after burning) on the breeding bird community. Burning resulted in incremental but temporary reductions in the availability of leaf litter, shrubs, and saplings, but it did not affect trees, snags, or understory vegetation cover. Of 30 bird species monitored, 4 were affected negatively and 2 were affected positively by burning. Population densities of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus), and Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina) declined incrementally in response to repeated burning and did not recover within 1 year after burning, suggesting a lag time in response to the changes in habitat conditions. Densities of Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) fluctuated among years in the control units, but remained low in the burned units. Densities of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and Eastern Wood-Pewees (Contopus virens) increased in response to burning, but these increases were apparent only after several years of repeated burning. In general, burning resulted in short-term reductions in the suitability of habitat for ground- and low-shrub-nesting birds, but it improved habitat for ground- and aerial-foraging birds. Overall, there were no changes in the composition of the breeding-bird community. Total breeding bird population levels were also unaffected by burning. Our results suggest that prescribed burning applied on a long-term basis or across large spatial scales is likely to have adverse effects on ground- and low-shrub-nesting bird species, but other changes in the composition of the breeding-bird community are likely to be minimal as long as the closed-canopy forest structure is maintained within the context of prescribed burning.

The influence of this land management practice on grassland birds has not been evaluated in relation to more traditional agricultural land management systems in Midwestern riparian areas. This study compared the grassland bird community in riparian areas in Wisconsin that were rotationally grazed to common land use practices along streams in Wisconsin: continuously grazed pastures and rowcrop fields with 10-m-wide ungrazed buffer strips located along the stream. We calculated total number of birds, the Berger-Parker Index of Dominance, and number of birds ha(-1) for each site. Vegetation variables used were height-density, litter depth, and percent bare ground. Bird species richness, species dominance, and density did not differ among land use types. In contrast, grassland bird species of management concern [Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis Gmelin), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna L.), and Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus L.)] were found on continuous and rotational pastures but very rarely or never occurred on buffer strips. Contrary to previous research, however, rotationally grazed pastures did not support more of these species than continuously grazed pastures. Bird density was related to vegetation structure, with higher densities found on sites with deeper litter. Within the pasture land use types, there were no consistent differences between species richness and density near the stream (< 10 m) and away (> 10 m).

Snag surveys were used to describe habitat, and both breeding bird surveys and nest surveys were used to characterize the bird community. Stands with the medium snag density treatment had the highest abundance, species richness, and nesting population of cavity nesters. The reasons for this may be: 1) snags were not evenly distributed within a stand such that both clumped and dispersed snag density habitats were interspersed in this treatment, and 2) a greater proportion of ponderosa pine snags in medium density treatments may have attracted species that prefer ponderosa pine for nesting and foraging. Ponderosa pine was preferred for nest sites and large snags (> 48 cm dbh) provided nesting habitat for more species than smaller snags. However, smaller snags were used for nesting and foraging by some species.

Non-breeding birds formed a flock and ranged doily between communal roosts and foraging areas. Roost sites were tall eucalypt trees (20-30 m) situated outside the forests, and the some trees were used repeatedly. Roosting flock size decreased during the breeding season, from October to December, due to the departure of breeding individuals. Mean sizes of daily home range and of foraging area were 68.6 ha (45-100 ha) and 14.1 ha (6-25 ha), respectively; much larger than those of breeding birds (3 ha). Sickle-billed Vangas foraged by probing their long and slender curved bills into holes and cracks in tree trunks or large branches, Dead trees or dead sections of live trees were preferred. The high abundance of large trees or dead trees in the deciduous forests allowed the flock to forage exclusively in this habitat. We suggest that communal roosts are located outside forests to avoid disturbance or predation by mammals. A foraging flock of Sickle-billed Vangas makes a round trip doily between the safe roosting sites and good foraging areas.

However, habitat restored with the right structural elements can still fail to support the species due to insufficient space and spatial contiguity (e.g., movement corridors) with nearby habitat. The spatial extent of habitat determines its capacity to support various demographic units, such as a breeding pair of individuals, a true population, or a metapopulation. In scatter-plots of published density estimates and their corresponding study area sizes, I found consistent patterns that appeared to represent spatial scale domains, in which subpopulations, populations, and multiple populations exist for each species. These spatial scale domains can help guide habitat restoration by indicating the minimum area needed to support a population. The effectiveness of restored habitat, considered alone or in combination with existing habitat, should be judged by the habitat's capacity to sustain a functioning population, which includes the population's membership in a metapopulation. Additionally, the evidence increasingly demonstrates that habitat must include sufficient space for the population(s) to periodically relocate as resources are depleted locally. The spatial extent of proposed habitat restoration can now be linked to the likely demographic unit of the species that can be supported there. I provide two examples of proposed habitat conservation and their likely effectiveness based on their spatial areas.

WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	fire-maintained ecosystems, Picoides borealis, red-cockaded woodpecker, wilderness	EASTERN TEXAS, FOREST, POPULATION, REINTRODUCTION, FRAGMENTATION, DYNAMICS	The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) is well adapted to fire-maintained pine ecosystems of the southeastern United States. Management practices vary greatly among land ownerships. In some wilderness areas and state parks, a "no management" policy has eliminated use of prescribed fire, artificial cavities, and woodpecker translocation, tools that have proved effective elsewhere in recovering woodpecker populations. We compared forests with essentially "no management'' to actively managed forests of similar tree ages and similar red-cockaded woodpecker population demographics. We also compared sites that had received no management in the past to the same sites after management. In every case, populations in forests that did riot use state-of-the-art management for woodpeckers declined severely compared to those in managed forests. Because managed forests typically used all available management techniques concurrently, it was not possible to separate and rank effectiveness of specific management activities. One exception was the Wade Tract in Georgia, where prescribed fire was the primary activity for herbaceous layer and hardwood management in a high-density, stable woodpecker population. Wilderness areas, which are intended to be pristine places that preserve biodiversity, are losing red-cockaded woodpeckers, a keystone species in the ecosystem, at an alarming rate. Collectively, 9 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers were present in 4 wilderness areas in Texas national forests in 1983. At the close of the millennium, only one woodpecker group remained and its continued existence is unlikely without management. The very fragmented features of present-day landscapes and intervention by humans impair the effectiveness of natural disturbance processes, primarily growing-season fire, that historically produced and maintained open pine savannas with grass-forb herbaceous layers in the pre-Columbian forests of the southeastern U.S. therefore, active management must be used if the red-cockaded woodpecker is to persist.

We investigated how terrestrial bird communities varied with, different land management practices (levels of grazing by domestic livestock and extent of clearing) and with habitat quality on the floodplains of the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers. Bird community composition in ungrazed and lightly grazed sites was significantly different to that in more heavily grazed sites, and these differences were related to tree and shrub cover, as well as tree species diversity and abundance of standing dead trees. Crazing appeared to have an effect on bird communities separate from that caused by clearing. Indicator species were identified for the effects of grazing and clearing. Grazing by livestock has had negative impacts on riparian birds through degradation of habitat quality. A combination of lower stocking rates, strategic placement of off-river watering points for stock, and the introduction of rotational grazing practices may be used to restore riparian habitat quality. The grazing-sensitive species we identified could be used as indicator species for the success of rehabilitation efforts. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Silvicultural management of the the remaining fragmented forests has changed to reflect the altered hydrology of the forests, current economic conditions of the area, and demand for forest products. Because forest type and silvicultural management impact forest birds, differences in avian productivity within these forests directly impact bird conservation. To assist in conservation planning, we evaluated daily nest survival, nest predation rates, and brood parasitism rates of forest birds in relation to different forest cover types and silvicultural management strategies within this floodplain. Within bottomland hardwood forests,, nest success of blue-gray gnatcatcher (Poliptila caerulea, 13%), eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalamus, 28%), indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea, 18%), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis, 22%), and yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus, 18%) did not differ from that within intensively managed cottonwood plantations. However, average daily survival of 542 open-cup nests of 19 bird species in bottomland hardwoods (0.9516 +/- 0.0028, similar to 27% nest success) was greater than that of 543 nests of 18 species in cottonwood plantations (0.9298 +/- 0.0035, similar to 15% nest success). Differences in daily nest survival rates likely resulted from a combination of differences in the predator community - particularly fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) - and a marked difference in species composition of birds breeding within these 2 forest types. At least 39% of nests in bottomland hardwood forests and 65% of nests in cottonwood plantations were depredated. Rates of parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were greater in managed cottonwoods (24%) than in bottomland hardwoods (9%). Nest success in planted cottonwood plantations for 18 species combined (similar to 14%). and for yellow-breasted chat (Iteria virens, 7%), eastern towhee (14%), indigo bunting (14%), and northern cardinal (17%) did not differ from nest success in cottonwood plantations that were coppiced from root sprouts following pulpwood harvest. Within bottomland hardwood forests, uneven-aged group-selection timber harvest reduced the combined daily nest survival of all species from 0.958 to 0.938, which reduced nest success by about 14%. Specifically, timber harvest reduced nest success of species chat nest in the forest midstory and canopy such as Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) - from 32% before harvest to 14% after harvest. Conversely, those species that nest primarily in the shrubbery understory - such as northern cardinal - were not affected by timber harvest and maintained an overall nest succcess of about 33%. Thus, birds nesting in the understory of bottomland hardwood forests are not adversely imparted by selective timber harvest, but there is a short-term reduction in nest success for birds that nest in the canopy and midstory.

Using multivariate analyses we describe the main patterns of bird species abundance and composition in relation to local habitat variables. According to canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), 17 of 43 explanatory variables accounted for significant variation in the bird species matrix: stand age, tamarack Larix laricina canopy cover, percentage shrub Alnus glutinosa, canopy closure (6-30%). percentage herbs, maximum canopy height, percentage shrub Alnus viridis. percentage moss, percentage shrub Betula nana, minimum and mean shrub height, percentage litter, white birch Betula papyrifera canopy cover, white spruce Picea glauca canopy cover, mean canopy height, canopy closure (71-100%), and zero shrub canopy closure. Habitat and stand identity (clustering of sites within stands) explained 55.5% of the total variation; 16.3% was unique to habitat alone (29.4% of the total variance explained - TVE) and 17.2% (31.0% TVE) was shared with stand identity. Stand identity accounted for 22.0% (39.6% TVE) of the variation. Neotropical migrants associated with "overmature" mixed-wood stands included Cape May Dendroica tigrina, bay-breasted D. castanea and Tennessee Vermivora peregrina warblers. Conversely, orange-crowned C: celata, palm D. palmarum. and Nashville V. ruficapilla warblers were found in young stands. The presence of several Neotropical migrants was associated with mixed-wood attributes (ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus with aspen, red-eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus with shrub alder, and Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus with canopy white birch). Jack pine stands older than commercial rotation age must be maintained in a managed landscape because their bird communities differ from younger stands. Because of the limited avian diversity in pure jack pine stands, sufficient mixed-wood stands must be regenerated to sustain populations of characteristic bird species. We recommend that jack pine mixed-woods be managed using shelterwood or selective cuts, and that rotation age of some stands be increased. Without the extensive fires necessary for regeneration. cutting patterns at the landscape level should approximate natural disturbance patches both in size and frequency of disturbance.

Litter volume on and near the ground was estimated on a nine-point scale during 1994 to 1999. The relative importance of management type (rotational burning, rotational haying, or a combination of both) and litter volume on relative abundance was analysed for three declining grassland songbirds: Henslow's Sparrow Ammodramus henslowii, Grasshopper Sparrow A. savannarum, and Dickcissel Spiza americana. Haying resulted in significantly higher abundance than burning for all species except Dickcissel, for which few significant management effects were detected. Henslow's Sparrow increased in abundance from light to heavy litter, Grasshopper Sparrow peaked in low to intermediate litter, and Dickcissel showed little pattern relative to litter. Litter scores recorded in each management type increased with number of years since last treatment. Although litter profoundly affected bird abundance, independent and equally important was whether that litter was obtained via haying or burning. Greater consistency among years in hayed vegetation structure may help explain these birds' preference for haying over burning or haying + burning. Rotational haying should be employed more than burning in the management of these declining birds, especially for the sharply declining, fire-sensitive Henslow's and Grasshopper Sparrows.

We studied the Crested Caracara (Caracara cheriway), a threatened bird of prey, to learn the role of private lands in sustaining the population We investigated patterns of distribution and reproductive activity of breeding pairs of caracaras in relation to patterns of land ownership and use. Eighty-two percent of 73 active nest sites found were on privately owned cattle ranches. We rarely found breeding pairs on Publicly owned lands most of which are managed as natural areas (no agricultural production and limited livestock grazing) to support native plant and animal communities, in 46 breeding areas with 4 years of known histories of occupancy and reproduction, pairs nesting on lands where the major land use was cattle ranching exhibited higher rates of breeding-area occupancy, attempted breeding during more years, initiated egg laying earlier exhibited higher nesting success, and attempted a second brood after successfully fledging a first brood more often than pairs nesting on lands managed as natural areas Compositional analysis suggested nonrandom selection of habitats by breeding pairs of caracaras in their establishment of a home range in the current landscape of southcentral Florida. Compared with random areas and available habitat in the overall study area, caracara home ranges had higher proportions of improved pasture and lower proportions of forest, woodland, oak, scrub and marsh. Which management activities favor and do not favor caracaras is uncertain, and hypotheses should be formulated and tested to guide future conservation applications. Particular grazing and fire management practices on privately, and publicly owned lands may affect the structure of vegetation and prey communities in ways that influence caracaras. Or replacement of native by exotic grasses may retain structurally suitable plant communities, where as fertilization and grazing may increase productivity and nutrient cycling in ways that favor caracaras. Given continued conversion of natural habitats and agricultural lands to urban development, it is important to recognize that cattle ranches may provide important resources for wildlife conservation. Although cattle ranching is not likely to benefit all species historically associated with the native prairie ecosystem in Florida finding ways to retain this land use may be important for the conservation of Flolida's population of Crested Caracaras and other organisms of Florida's dry prairies.

Analyses of the covariation between demographic and habitat features can reveal a trajectory toward this optimal state. To help identify new criteria for foraging-habitat guidelines for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in the Apalachicola National Forest, we examine seven years of demographic data for the woodpecker population and habitat in core stands, the naturally regenerated prime habitat in the centers of their territories. For both districts of the forest, two compound habitat variables are highly related to the average number of adult birds per social group, the average number of young fledged per group, and the density of groups. These variables are, first, the difference between the density of trees > 35 cm dbh and that of trees 15-25 cm dbh and, second, the difference, in the ground cover, between the percentage of wiregrass and that of woody-plus-palmetto vegetation. Although the birds require a few old relict trees for their cavities, a regression analysis shows that including data for variation in the availability of relict trees in this forest does not improve the power of the above habitat variables to account for variation in the demography of the birds.Because covariation between demographic variables and the recommendations in the current federal guidelines for the management of foraging habitat of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker is low, we conclude that experimental tests of whether causal mechanisms underlie the much higher correlative relationships we have found are warranted. Such tests should use differing levels of prescribed fire, which has dramatic effects on the ground cover. Smaller size classes of trees in closed-canopy stands should be thinned, creating patchy openings in the forest that will promote natural pine regeneration. Traditional unevenaged silvicultural management could adopt a target tree distribution similar to that on the Apalachicola Ranger District, which supports a population of woodpeckers that is deemed to have recovered. We think that in addition to being beneficial for the birds the proposed program of habitat management is more likely to promote the long-term restoration of the longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem within Red-cockaded Woodpecker habitat than are alternative scenarios.

Bird abundance in terraces ((x) over tilde = 463.0 birds/100 ha, se = 33.0) was less than that in other strip-cover habitats such as grassed waterways and roadsides, but greater than that in rowcrops. Five species nested in terraces. We found 64.8 nests/10 ha of which 76% were red-winged blackbird nests. Predation resulted in failure of 73% of all nests. The relative contribution of terraces to grassland bird conservation is minor, and changes in current terrace management practices would not likely improve conditions for birds nor be economical.

With the dramatic loss of riparian habitats, restoring them has become a priority among conservation practitioners. Diversity and density of avian species tend to increase following riparian restoration, but little is known about holy restored habitats function to meet particular species' needs. Habitat structure is an important factor affecting species diversity and density and can influence nest-site selection and reproductive success. To evaluate habitat restoration, rye examined interactions between habitat structure, nest-site selection, and nesting success in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) nesting in restored, mature, and young naturally regenerating stands of riparian forest. We found that stand types differed markedly in structure, and that habitat structure influenced both nest-site selection and rates of nest loss to predation. Comparison of habitat structure among the three stand types indicated that restored stands offered fewer acceptable nest sites and poorer protection from nest predation. Concordant with those differences in habitat structure, Song Sparrows showed trends toward less density in restored stands than in mature forest, and had poorer nesting success as a result of predation.

The abundance of meadow pipits appears to be a good indicator of the breeding density of hen harriers on moorland managed for red grouse in Scotland. High densities of hen barriers can limit grouse populations at low density and reduce shooting bags, with repercussions for grouse moor management and conservation. We therefore examined the habitat characteristics of managed grouse moors, asking whether changes in vegetation could alter the ratio of pipits, and thus harriers, to grouse.2. We examined grouse abundance and habitat on 69 sites of 1 km(2) in upland Britain,. of which pipit abundance was studied on 36. Similar data were collected on 73 sites of 25 ha within the Langholm estate in south-west Scotland, in order to make a within-estate and among-moor comparison.3. The distribution of pipit abundance on the Langholm estate was similar to that seen in the extensive among-moor study. Pipit and grouse abundance were related to habitat in similar ways in the two data sets.4. Pipits were the most frequent passerine, but their abundance was not related to grouse abundance. Pipit abundance declined with increasing muirburn and heather, but increased with grass cover. In a linear regression model Calluna, Sphagnum and muirburn cover accounted for 42% of the variation in pipit abundance across Britain.5. Grouse abundance was influenced by the regional location of the grouse moor and to a lesser extent by its altitude. There were more grouse on English moors with less patchy habitats. Bird species declined with increasing Calluna and Sphagnum cover and habitat patchiness. Bird species diversity increased from west to east and on moors with more muirburn.6. This study provides evidence that meadow pipits are influenced by habitat characteristics on moorland managed for grouse. This work also illustrates how habitat management may be able to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts: long-term increases in heather cover and management of this habitat by muirburn on grouse moors may reduce pipit numbers and thus reduce the ratio of hen harriers to grouse. However, the effects of such vegetation change on other components of the upland bird assemblage requires further investigation.

However, little information is available on effects of these management practices on plant or bird communities during summer. We conducted experimental burns in 4 types of impounded and unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Louisiana. We recorded vegetation characteristics and species composition and relative abundance of plants and birds during April-lune 1996-1998. We found that vegetation characteristics in burned marshes did not differ from those of unburned marshes by the first summer post-burn and that winter burning did not affect bird species richness or species composition. Birds/survey for all species combined and for sparrows (primarily seaside sparrows [Ammodramus maritimus]) did not differ between burned and unburned marshes during the first or third summers post-burn, but were 2 times greater in burned than in unburned marshes during the second summer post-burn. Our results indicate that winter burning for waterfowl is compatible with management for other marsh birds, provided that measures ensuring sufficient winter cover for passerines are included in management plans. Number of icterids/survey was greatest and sparrows/survey was least in intermediate impounded marshes compared to other marsh-management types. Sparrows generally were most abundant in brackish and saline unimpounded marshes, indicating that continued loss of unimpounded marsh habitat could impact coastal sparrow populations.

Enhancing wildlife habitat has become an explicit objective of existing agricultural policy. Thus, there is renewed focus on field borders and the use of shelterbelt agroforestry systems to achieve conservation goals in the Midwest. Two Representative Farms - a 283-ha dryland and 510-ha irrigated farm were created in Saunders County, Nebraska. The Habitat Analysis and Modeling System (HAMS) was used to describe the composition and spatial pattern of the existing farms and surrounding landscape, as well as for the landscapes surrounding selected Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. Simulated land use changes resulting from the implementation of two shelterbelt scenarios, Agricultural and Wildlife, were incorporated on each Representative Farm and surrounding landscape. Landscape variables which influence breeding bird species richness and community composition as determined from BBS routes were measured on simulated farm landscapes. A more heterogeneous landscape results from implementing either scenario. The percent total woods was a significant determinant of bird species richness on the BBS routes and was important in influencing bird communities at the farm- and landscape-level. Other landscape metrics which influenced the bird community composition on BBS routes were woody edge percentages and edge density values. Policies promoting shelterbelts create edge habitats which ultimately favor birds within the Forest-edge/generalist guild while bird species in need of conservation such as grassland-field species would potentially be negatively affected.

The response to intensity of selective logging varied among species of lizards. The local abundance of M, nigropunctata increased with the intensity of logging damage, while the relationships for R calcarata and A. ameiva were not statistically significant. The three species used plots cut four years before more frequently than control plots, but the density of A. ameiva in gaps in blocks cut 9-10 years before was similar to that in undisturbed vegetation. The girdling treatments had a significant negative effect on K. calcarata, but not M. nigropunctata or A. ameiva. We suggest that differences in numbers of lizards reflect a behavioral choice for microhabitats created in the logging areas, because the spatial scale of this study was too small to confidently detect the effects of the silvicuture treatments on populations of the species.

Understanding the causal bases for such patterns of habitat use can help to elucidate mechanisms of habitat selection and, therefore, community organization and structure. I experimentally tested the hypothesis that fine-scale foliage structure of two deciduous tree species influences the foraging behavior of three small, insectivorous bird species. On sugar maple (Acer saccharum), with its orbicular leaves elevated above the branch, Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens) and American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) captured prey predominantly from lower leaf surfaces, whereas Black-throated Green Warblers (Dendroica virens) captured prey predominantly from upper leaf surfaces. In contrast, on yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), with its oblong-ovate leaves held within the plane of the supporting branch, all three bird species captured prey disproportionately from upper leaf surfaces. Overall, aerial maneuvers were used more frequently to capture prey from upper than from lower leaf surfaces on sugar maple, but the opposite occurred on yellow birch, where non-aerial maneuvers were used more frequently to capture prey from upper than from lower leaf surfaces. Those results indicate that the leaf surface from which prey are more easily captured (with less energetically costly non-aerial maneuvers) differs between those tree species. Experimental manipulation of leaf dispersion and distance to prey demonstrated that leaf dispersion is the chief determinant of prey capture location (upper vs. lower leaf surfaces), and that distance to prey is the chief determinant of prey capture maneuver (aerial vs. non-aerial). When foraging on artificial branches in which vertical distance between branches was systematically increased experimentally, Black-throated Green Warblers captured a significantly smaller proportion of prey from lower surfaces of leaves on the upper branch than did Black-throated Blue Warblers. Taken together, these results indicate that different tree species, as well as different locations within tree species, present insectivorous birds with distinct foraging environments and, therefore, constitute distinct foraging microhabitats. Furthermore, even closely related bird species that are generally similar morphologically respond in behaviorally unique ways to differences in foliage structure. For those reasons, forest management practices that enhance tree species diversity could concomitantly enhance foraging opportunities (niche diversity) for forest insectivores and may thus help to promote high bird species diversity and maintain abundant populations.

Three species, dark-eyed junco, white-throated sparrow and ruby-crowned kinglet: accounted for 50% of all bird records. Bird density and species richness peaked in 2-year-old burns and mature forest stages. High bird densities in 2-year-old burns were likely due to high snag densities. Most species were not unique to a particular age since disturbance, but there were different species in early, < 40-years-old burns, and later stages. Some birds such as yellow-bellied flycatcher and Swainson's thrush were exclusive to white birch forests, a rare forest type in western Labrador.

The bird community then changes progressively during the cutting cycle, according to an ecological succession roughly similar to those observed in other analogous plantations (e.g. pines, beech). Schematically, this ecological succession goes through three main stages: (1) a pioneer phase (during the first ten years) when spontaneous vegetation develops vigorously among young Douglas-firs: open-space and low vegetation birds such as pipits, Stonechat, Yellowhammer, then Dunnock, Bullfinch and warblers, enter such places: (2) an intermediate phase defined by Douglas-fir very strongly dominant over all other vegetation and pioneer species disappearing; at that stage (which lasts several dozens of years) the bird community is reduced both in species and individual numbers and is mainly based on generalist (e.g. Song Thrush, Robin) or conifer-specialist (e.g. Gold- and Firecrests, Coal and Crested Tits) forest birds; (3) in old stands (rare), the bird community becomes rich again because Douglas-firs are well grown and allow grasses and bushes to recover. The ornithological poverty of the intermediate stages (which is also observed in other similar types of even-aged plantations) seems best explained by the sylvicultural treatment (i.e. almost single-cohort stands) than by Douglas-fir per se. The phenomenon is however more pronounced with Douglas-fir because of its very important domination over grassy and bushy vegetation. Moreover one observes that in these dense stands of intermediate age the smallest edge effect (either on edges or in gaps) goes with an increase in bird species richness. These observations allow one to expect better conditions for birds in Douglas-fir plantations if they were harvested in less dense, mixed-species or uneven-aged stands.

A high proportion of these species is forest living, and large numbers are dependent on decaying wood. Biodiversity can be assessed at various scales using two different principles. One is to use features. such as ancient and dead trees, known to be important for a large number of species. The other method is to choose species or groups of species known to indicate high biodiversity or presence of many red-listed species. We argue that any serious biodiversity assessment method should include the most species rich organism groups, for example insects. In the present paper we point out the most important features for high biodiversity (old trees and large dead trees), and review the quantities of these features in near-virgin forests. The natural disturbance regime of a region should be the basis for defining a suitable scale and the appropriate features for biodiversity assessment. Possible indicator species for high biodiversity in northern Europe are suggested. based on previous investigations. Among epiphytic lichens and wood-living beetles there are many potentially useful species in addition to vascular plants in the nemoral forest. Among vertebrates, woodpeckers and grouses seem to be the most useful. Validation tests for indicator structures and species are largely lacking but urgently needed. The implications of possible delayed local extinctions tire important to bear in mind when managing for sustainable forestry. The knowledge of forest history is useful when developing cost-efficient measures.

Although the Black Hills National Forest is removing conifers (primarily ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa]) to increase the aspen communities in some mixed stands, Forest Plan guidelines allow four conifers per hectare to remain to increase diversity in the remaining aspen stand. We compared bird species richness in pure ponderosa pine, mixed stands dominated by ponderosa pine with quaking aspen, mixed stands dominated by aspen with ponderosa pine, and pure aspen stands. Stands dominated by ponderosa pine had lower (P < 0.01) bird species richness than stands dominated by aspen. Aspen in ponderosa pine stands or pine in aspen stands did not increase bird species richness (P greater than or equal to 0.68) over the respective pure stands. Thus, leaving ponderosa pine in aspen stands will not have the desired effect of increasing bird diversity but may h a ve the negative effect of speeding successional processes that replace aspen with conifers.

WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology		FOREST, CONSEQUENCES, HONEYEATERS, LANDSCAPES, MANAGEMENT, QUEENSLAND, COMMUNITY, PATTERNS, DYNAMICS, AVIFAUNA	This study investigated the effects of habitat clearance and fragmentation on birds of coastal heathlands in subtropical eastern Australia. Abundance and species composition were compared among two types of cleared habitat (residential suburbs and sugar cane cropland) and four sizes of heathland remnant (1-2 ha, 5-10 ha, 20-50 ha and >500 ha) in summer and winter. Cleared land contained a distinctly different bird species assemblage from heathland remnants. Residential sites contained a distinct suite of species consistent with that described for 'open/developed land' habitat elsewhere in the region. In contrast, cane cropland supported very few species. Heathland remnants >500 ha contained high densities of 'natural-vegetation-dependent' species, whereas species of 'open/developed land were absent. Remnants of 1-2 ha had lowered densities of many natural-vegetation-dependent species, and a relatively high abundance of open/developed land species. Some of the avifaunal differences in the >500-ha remnants and 5-50-ha range are probably due to confounding of remnant size with habitat, resulting from selective clearing of the landscape. Most of the heathland birds were intolerant of the matrix habitat (residential and cane cropland), but tolerant of decreased remnant area, down to a threshold of about 5 ha. However, the distinctive floristic associations of heathland vegetation are dependent on an environmental regime (low nutrient, low pH, fire, in some cases inundation) that is unlikely to persist in remnants tens of hectares in size, and longer-term declines in heathland birds, are predicted.

We studied avian foraging behavior and patterns of occurrence in the highly fragmented agricultural landscape of the Kellerberrin district of Western Australia to better understand the factors underlying species declines and losses. We conducted three surveys of 30 wandoo woodland patches that ranged in size from 1.3 to 101.3 ha. Some patches were part of larger remnants of native vegetation, ranging in size from 3.5 to 1204.8 ha and including other habitat types. We examined the extent to which patterns of species richness, the occurrence and composition of foraging guilds, and the occurrence of individual species varied with features of woodland patches, remnants, and the surrounding landscape.Using multiple regression analyses, the best model for species richness included terms for the log of remnant area, the patch diversity of each remnant, and woodland patch condition. We delineated eight foraging guilds based on similarities in the substrate/method dimension and also using multidimensional scaling analyses. The best model for the number of foraging guilds present in a patch included a single variable representing shrub density. Analyses of nestedness based on guilds and on individual species were both significant; and for the latter, 11 of 13 species made a significant contribution to the overall pattern. We derived separate models for the occurrence of each of eight species and one guild using multiple logistic regression. Significant models included, either separately or in combination, the following variables: the log of remnant area, patch area, the total area of woodland in a remnant, and the distance to other woodland patches. For four species that had sufficient records to examine shifts in foraging behavior, we observed significant differences in both foraging methods and substrates with changes in remnant size and/or the presence of other species or guilds.Our analyses indicated that remnant area was the best single variable for measures of community structure, in part because it was strongly correlated with other variables, such as total woodland area, patch area, remnant patch diversity, number of corridor connections, and measures of isolation. For foraging guilds and for individual species, variables other than remnant area assumed greater importance. The strong patterns of nestedness for foraging guilds by remnant area may reflect the diminished availability of certain prey items in small, degraded remnants. This notion is reinforced by the relatively high species and guild richness recorded in small patches that were either fenced from grazing or embedded in large remnants. The nested pattern of species within some foraging guilds, however, indicates the importance of additional aspects of their ecology. A focus on richness alone may mask the unique responses of bird species to fragmentation and may divert attention from important considerations in the development of land-use policy and reserve acquisition.

We use examples from contemporary studies in eastern deciduous forests. Scientific methods, observational versus experimental studies, replication and randomization, choice of factors and models, and response variables are important elements in designing research approaches that address effects of forest management. There are significant gaps in our knowledge on the effects of forest management on birds. Many studies have addressed effects of management on species abundance, but we can make only limited inferences from most of these. The design of studies is complicated because of the range of forest management practices, variation in bird species responses, differences among forest types, and the effects of confounding factors such as landscape effects. Few studies have addressed effects of forest management on the reproductive success of forest songbirds. We believe the reliability of our knowledge in this area will be improved most quickly if we use current knowledge to generate hypotheses, use a mix of well-designed observational and manipulative experiments to test them, and more frequently measure reproductive success in addition to bird abundance.

Field observations were conducted at three forested locations on coastal cheniers for three years (1993-95) in the spring and at one: location for three years (1996-98) in autumn to determine species presence and diet. One hundred and twenty-eight species were present during the spring and 103 species in autumn. The majority of these species were migrants (103 species in spring and 89 species in autumn) and the majority of these: were Nearctic/Neotropical species (73 species in sprint: and 66 species in autumn). The diet of these migrants was more variable than expected. Many insectivorous species were observed to consume seeds, fruit and nectar as well as insects. Because of these varied diets, many species serve as seed dispersers, occasional pollinators and important predators of herbivorus insects. Wooded areas were found to be important in providing food, cover and water for migrating species. A review of historical changes in the landscape of this area is presented and management practices designed to restore wooded habitat to this area are proposed.

To determine the effects this harvesting strategy might have on communities of breeding forest birds, we conducted point counts in young forests regenerated from clear-cutting (15-25 years), and mature (50-60 years), and old (80-110 years) forests regenerated from fire. Avian species richness was highest in old stands at the point-count station, forest stand, and landscape level. Increased species richness with forest age was associated with increases in the relative abundance of canopy- and cavity-nesting species. At local scales (station and stand), species richness of ground- and shrub-nesting birds was similar among forest age-classes. However, as determined by rarefaction analyses appropriate at the landscape scale, ground-nesting species were more common in young and old forests, while shrub-nesting species were more common in young and mature forests. Density of deciduous shrubs was an important factor influencing the abundance of species like American redstart, Canada warbler, and chestnut-sided warbler. An increase in conifer in old stands resulted in greater use by conifer- or mixedwood associated species such as bay-breasted warbler, magnolia warbler, and ruby-crowned kinglet. Our data indicate that vegetation and structural characteristics such as shrub density should be considered when prescribing sustainable forestry objectives. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Clearcutting on Pennsylvania state forests recently has been replaced by a new forest management practice termed even-aged reproduction stands with reservation guidelines thereafter, EAR stands), in which high densities of trees in multiple crown and size classes (101 live trees/ha +/-28 SE on study sites) of both commercially and non-commercially important tree species are permanently reserved to maintain species and structural diversity. We compared habitat structure and breeding-bird communities between EAR stands (harvested) and reference stands (unharvested) in 2 state forests of Pennsylvania in 1997-98 and related bird abundance within harvested stands to differences in habitat characteristics among EAR stands and the surrounding landscapes. Total abundance of all bird species combined, abundances of early-successional and edge-habitat guilds, and abundances of many early-successional bird species were significantly higher in EAR stands than in reference stands, but abundances of the forest habitat guild and of 8 forest-associated species were lower in EAR stands. Although EAR stands provide suitable habitat for bird species associated with early-successional forests, abundances of species associated with mature forests were lower in EAR stands than in reference stands despite retention of residual trees. However, some species of forest birds (e.g., red-eyed vireos [Vireo olivaceus]), which usually are absent from recent clearcut stands until 12-20 years post-harvest, were often detected in EAR stands. Thus, residual trees in EAR stands provide to forest birds habitat components that are generally lacking in clearcut stands. Because abundances of both forest habitat and forest-canopy nesting guilds declined and abundance of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) increased with size of EAR stands (especially when >20 ha), managers should consider limiting the size of EAR stands.

Prescribed fires were set in 1993 and 1995 in a mature hardwood forest in southern Indiana, USA, to reduce shade-tolerant understory woody vegetation and thereby increase the abundance and diversity of ground layer vegetation and seedlings of tree species that require moderate light levels (e.g., Quercus L. spp.). The objective of this study was to determine if prescribed fires reduced the abundance or reproductive success of ground- and shrub-nesting Neotropical migrant bird species. The burned area and an adjacent unburned area were studied during the summers of 1996 and 1997. An unlimited-radius point count method was used to determine relative abundance. Nests were monitored to determine fledging success. Vegetation structure was quantified at nest sites and at random points to assess fire effects and bird nest-site selection. Abundance of birds in this nesting guild was greater in the unburned area during both years. The greatest difference in abundance was for ovenbird (Seiurus aurocappilus Linnaeus). The probability of nest success for all bird species in this nesting guild combined, determined by the Mayfield method, was significantly lower in the burned area (0.125) than in the unburned area (0.291). Abundance of the brood parasite brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater Boddaert) did not differ between burned and unburned areas. However, the probability of nest success for parasitized nests (0.140) was lower than that of unparasitized nests (0.735). The mean number of host young fledged from successful nests was significantly lower in parasitized nests (1.3) than from unparasitized nests (3.0). Prescribed fires significantly reduced vegetative cover in the burned area. Nest sites in the burned area had higher vegetative cover than random points, indicating that birds may have selected nest sites that were less affected by the fire. While prescribed fires that burn in a "natural" hit-or-miss pattern may retain nesting habitat for bird species in this nesting guild, lower nest success in the burned area indicates that management for desirable vegetation and for this nesting guild may not be compatible within the same forest. stand at the same time.

We investigated avian use of irrigated Habitat Management Units (HMUs), compared to non-irrigated sites and streams that entered the river. We conducted bird surveys at 25 sites in summer and fall 1997 and in spring 1998. We compared avian abundance, species richness, and species diversity among habitats and seasons. We detected an average of 169 birds and 33 species at HMUs, 120 birds and 28 species at non-irrigated sites, and 63 birds and 23 species along streams in all three seasons. We detected an average of 29 species/site in summer, 31 in fall, and 22 in spring. Species diversity, as measured by the Shannon-Wiener function, was higher in summer, indicating that large flocks of a few species were common in fall and spring. These data demonstrated that the lower Snake River is an important stopover site for migrating birds. We detected an average of 30 more bird species than a study conducted on the same area in 1974. The increase in species richness is attributed to the development of HMUs and to natural succession of palustrine vegetation since dam construction. Future potential changes in reservoir levels, such as breaching of dams, will undoubtedly affect bird communities along the lower Snake River in all seasons. However, our data demonstrated that habitat perturbations can be partially mitigated by habitat enhancement and management.

Relative hedgehog density was determined by means of footprints in specially designed tunnels. The relative density was closely correlated with the total number of individual hedgehogs that were caught in trays in five of the plots immediately after the tunnels were removed. A power analysis indicated that, with the resources available, we could only detect an effect greater than 35%. We were unable to demonstrate a significant effect, i.e. hedgehog density in areas adjacent to roads is not reduced by more than 35%. However, we did find about 30% fewer tracks in road plots when compared to control plots and the P-values were marginally insignificant at the P less than or equal to 0.05 significance level. These results suggest that roads and traffic are likely to reduce hedgehog density by about 30%, which may affect the survival probability of local populations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We surveyed birds from a range of patch sizes (1 to > 3000 live residual trees), at four ages (2, 15, 30, 60 years), following two disturbance types (harvest, fire) in mixedwood boreal forest. Bird communities varied among patch sizes, forest ages, and disturbance types. Immediately post-disturbance, bird communities from large patches (> 100 residual trees) were more similar to those from old forest than were communities from small patches ( less than or equal to 10 residual trees). Birds that nest or forage in open or riparian habitats had highest densities in small patches 2 years post-harvest, whereas birds that nest in large snags had highest densities in small patches 2 years post-fire. Throughout the chronosequence following both disturbance types, birds from small patches became more similar to those from old forest. Birds that nest and forage in small trees and shrubs were common 15 and 30 years post-disturbance, and generalist forest birds were common 60 years post-disturbance. Birds associated with old forest were present in all patch sizes 15, 30, and 60 years post-disturbance, although larger patches had higher densities of these species.

Ecologists and forest resource managers need measures to judge the success or failure of management regimes designed to sustain biological diversity. The relationships between potential indicator species and total biodiversity are not well established. Carefully designed studies are required to test relationships between the presence and abundance of potential indicator species and other taxa and the maintenance of critical ecosystem processes in forests. Other indicators of biological diversity in forests, in addition or as alternatives to indicator species, include what we call structure-based indicators. These are stand-level and landscape-level (spatial) features of forests such as stand structural complexity and plant species composition, connectivity, and heterogeneity. Although the adoption of practices to sustain (or recreate) key characteristics of forest ecosystems appear intuitively sensible and broadly consistent with current knowledge, information is lacking to determine whether such stand- and landscape-level features of forests will serve as successful indices of (and help conserve) biodiversity. Given our limited knowledge of both indicator species and structure-based indicators, we advocate the following four approaches to enhance biodiversity conservation in forests: (1) establish biodiversity priority areas (e.g., reserves) managed primarily for the conservation of biological diversity; (2) within production forests, apply structure-based indicators including structural complexity, connectivity, and heterogeneity; (3) using multiple conservation strategies at multiple spatial scales, spread out risk in wood production forests; and (4) adopt an adaptive management approach to test the validity of structure-based indices of biological diversity by treating management practices as experiments. These approaches would aim to provide new knowledge to managers and improve the effectiveness of current management strategies.

The stands were of even age (6 - 300 yr), stocked with the first or second tree generation after wildfire. The view of Siren and several authors after him, that the vegetation of old-growth boreal Picea forests is homogeneous on a broad scale. was examined by applying, in parallel, the partial variants of two ordination methods (DCA and PCA) to Siren's vegetation data. Two main vegetation gradients were found: a major gradient running from recently burnt plots with prominence of pioneer species to plots with stand age > 100 yr, a well stocked tree layer and a thick humus layer, dominance of feather-mosses and ample occurrence of shade-tolerant as well as light-preferring vascular plant species, and a second gradient along which first- and second-generation plots segregate. The more prominent element of Betula trees in first- than in second-generation stands < 100 yr contributed to the latter. A minor third gradient related to humus-layer thickness was recovered by partial DCA only. The main vegetation gradient reappeared in separate ordinations of data from 47 mature forest stands (> 100 yr), but without being correlated with forest age. Variation among mature-forest stands in the importance of pioneer species is considered mainly to be brought about by fine-scale disturbance processes such as tree uprooting. Increasing importance of factors operating on within-stand scales [development of a varied gap structure and stronger gradients in tree influence (radiation at ground level), soil moisture, soil depth and nutrient availability] with time is also reflected in the second and third mature-forest ordination axes. Possible implications of the results for conservation of biological diversity and monitoring of changes in boreal forests are discussed.

The magnitude and spatial extent of impact was assessed from sample points in five bands parallel to the edge between clearfelled areas and mature forest (unburnt-forest, burnt-forest, forest-edge, gap-edge and gap). A total of 24 748 birds of 53 species were detected within 30 m of the observer during the study. Bird species abundance, and diversity, were similar in the five bands prior to treatment, and observed differences could be attributed to spatial patterns of flowering in the overstorey. Following logging, 19 of the 40 species that were detected more than five times showed changes in relative abundance (including both, increases and decreases) in one or more bands. Gaps showed the greatest number of significant changes (15) and these were typically of the greatest magnitude over the four years studied post-treatment. Gap-edges showed fewer changes (six), while both, the burnt-forest (three) and forest-edge (nil) bands showed few changes in relative abundance. Both, the number of species detected (for a given sampling effort), and species diversity declined in gap and gap-edge bands following logging. Nevertheless, variation in bird counts between successive seasons and years necessitates considerable replication before changes can be reliably assigned to disturbance impacts. In addition, the long period before maturation of the overstorey suggests that me local impact of logging and burning is likely to extend well beyond the life of experimental studies. Our results support the implementation of a well-dispersed system of retained mature forest along road, river and stream zones within the regeneration mosaic. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The objective was to assess the ecological recovery of unrestored and minimally restored mine plots compared with surrounding reference forest. Unrestored mines had not been mined or used for any other purpose for 14-30 years; plots in their first, second, and third year since restoration were old mines planted with Acacia mangium (Leguminosae) at a density of 400 trees/ha. Natural secondary forest plots 20 or more years since the last disturbance were immediately adjacent to both unrestored and restored plots. Bird surveys on 4-ha plots were performed during the 1995 breeding season. A comparison of data from unrestored plots of widely varying ages showed no significant differences among them for species richness, diversity (Shannon-Wiener index, H'), or individual abundance, indicating that little natural bird community recovery had occurred over time in the plots. However, increases did occur in restored sites over only 3 years for both species richness (r(2) = 0.29, p = 0.04) and diversity (r(2) = 0.45, p = 0.009). All values for third-year restored plots, however, were still significantly lower than corresponding values for adjacent natural secondary forest plots. The quick return of bird activity on the plots after minimal efforts at restoration supports the idea that simple, inexpensive restoration can be effective for "jump starting" degraded systems at large scales. Such a restoration strategy might be of particular value for degraded land in developing nations, where scientific, professional, and financial resources might be in short supply. Using this strategy, a small number of restoration professionals could mobilize the labor of many local people in many areas, serving to both improve ecological systems and to educate and engage local populations in restoration and conservation projects.

Wood Warbler (Phyloscopus sibilatrix) and Red-breasted Flycatcher (Ficedula parva) were significantly more abundant at non-gaps. Warblers (Sylviidae), ground insectivores, ground nesters, and short-distance migrants were significantly more abundant at gaps, but no species groups were more abundant at non-gaps. Eight species breeding in forest edges and young plantations in eastern Poland were not recorded in natural treefall gaps. The proportion of tropical migrant passerines was considerably higher in closed-canopy stands (0.47) than at gaps (0.29), which contrasts with the situation in most managed European forests where the highest proportions of tropical migrants typically occur in young-growth forests.

Such changes may affect numerous soil, plant, and ecosystem properties in grasslands and ultimately impact their productivity and biological diversity. Rainout shelters are useful tools for experimental manipulations of rainfall patterns, and permanent fixed-location shelters were established in 1997 to conduct the Rainfall Manipulation Plot study in a mesic tallgrass prairie ecosystem in northeastern Kansas. Twelve 9 x 14-m fixed-location rainfall manipulation shelters were constructed to impose factorial combinations of 30% reduced rainfall quantity and 50% greater interrainfall dry periods on 6 x 6-m plots, to examine how altered rainfall regimes may affect plant species composition, nutrient cycling, and above- and belowground plant growth dynamics. The shelters provided complete control of growing season rainfall patterns, whereas effects on photosynthetic photon flux density, nighttime net radiation, and soil temperature generally were comparable to other similar shelter designs. Soil and plant responses to the first growing season of rainfall manipulations (1998) suggested that the interval between rainfall events may be a primary driver in grassland ecosystem responses to altered rainfall patterns. Aboveground net primary productivity, soil CO(2) flux, and flowering duration were reduced by the increased interrainfall intervals and were mostly unaffected by reduced rainfall quantity. The timing of rainfall events and resulting temporal patterns of soil moisture relative to critical times for microbial activity, biomass accumulation, plant life histories, and other ecological properties may regulate longer-term responses to altered rainfall patterns.

In the virgin forest remnant the proportion of canopy gaps is smaller, there are no stands in the developmental phase of a pole stand (10 < cm d.b.h. < 30 cm), and both the growing stock and the proportion of less vigorous trees are considerably greater. In addition, there is a higher percentage of dead trees, a smaller proportion of minor tree species and a considerably lower diversity of plants. The diversity of bird species is similar for each forest type, but rare bird species are confined to the virgin forest remnant. The biological differences between the two types of forest have led to changes in the physical site conditions. The results of the research are valuable in assessing the consequences of near-to-nature forest management.

It is not always cleat, however, if spatial and temporal variability leads to instability in communities. Instability may result from strong biotic interactions or from stochastic processes acting on small populations. I used 10-15 yr of annual data from the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research site to examine whether plant, breeding bird, grasshopper, and small mammal communities in tallgrass prairie exhibit stability or directional change in response to different experimentally induced fire frequencies. Based on ordination and ANOVA, plant and grasshopper communities on annually burned sites differed significantly from plant and grasshopper communities on less frequently burned sites. Breeding birds and small mammals differed among sites as well, but these differences were not clearly related to disturbance frequency A modified time series analysis indicated that plant communities were undergoing directional change (unstable) on all watersheds, regardless of fire frequency. Contrary to expectations, directional change was greatest on the annually burned sites and lowest on the infrequently burned sites. Unlike the plant communities, breeding bird. grasshopper, and small mammal communities were temporally stable, despite high-compositional variability from 1 yr to the next. Stability among the consumer communities within these dynamic plant communities occurs because three-dimensional vegetation structure does not change over time, despite changes in plant species composition. Evidence suggests that instability in the plant community results from strong biotic interactions among temporally persistent core species and stochastic dynamics among infrequent satellite species. Overall, community stability cannot be assessed if the pattern of temporal dynamics is unknown. Long-term empirical studies of different taxa under different disturbance regimes are needed to determine over what time frames and spatial scales communities may be stable.

Females occupied nest holes in March-April, after which two or three eggs are laid. Although cooperative breeding is suspected for the genus, at two nests no helpers were recorded. Nest-concealment behaviour was observed in the adult male. After a nestling period of 55-58 days, the adult female and one juvenile left the nest simultaneously. Immature birds resemble their respective sex. Nest site characteristics of 24 nests of the Tarictic Hornbill and two of the Writhed-billed Hornbill Aceros waldeni, respectively, were recorded on Mt Balabag, Panay Mountain Range. Tarictic Hornbill nests were situated in living as well as dead trees, at an average height of 11 m. Cavity compass direction was uniformly distributed around the circle. Nests are aggregated within the habitat, with a mean nearest-neighbour distance of 190 m. Writhed-billed Hornbills may require larger trees for nesting than Tarictic Hornbills. Nest density was calculated to be around three Tarictic Hornbill nests and 0.2-0.3 Writhed-billed Hornbill nests per square kilometre. Given a total amount of suitable hornbill habitat on Panay of 225-450 km(2), about 750-1,000 Tarictic Hornbill breeding pairs and 60-100 Writhed-billed Hornbill breeding pairs may remain on Panay.

Disturbance treatments included wildfire, natural regeneration after harvest and several methods of silvicultural site preparation. Relative to undisturbed forest, all disturbance treatments increased plant diversity to about the same extent. The abundance of plant growth-forms differed significantly between disturbance treatments. Silvicultural treatments involving soil disturbance (disk-trenching, drum-chopping and blading) had higher cover of grasses and annual forbs; naturally regenerated and Bracke-cultivated treatments contained more perennial forbs and shrubs. Thus, different post-disturbance plant communities established following contrasting types of disturbance. Plant community biomass and tree growth varied among disturbance treatments. Shoot mass of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and the root mass of all species declined significantly with increasing soil disturbance intensity. Aspen and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) differed in their response to disturbance. Aspen growth was similar among disturbance treatments. In contrast, aspen density was significantly lower in disk-trenched and bladed treatments than in burned or naturally regenerated treatments, and aspen basal area was significantly lower only in drum-chopped treatments. White spruce grew fastest in drum-chopped sites. Burned treatments had the highest recruitment of volunteer spruce seedlings (up to 3200 ha(-1)), but not significantly higher than in other disturbance treatments. Taken together these results suggest that the most intensive silvicultural treatments had the expected effects of reducing aspen abundance and increasing the growth of spruce, but also contained more grasses and forbs and had lower total root mass than burned or naturally regenerating sites. Further work is needed to examine long-term productivity and the persistence of both native and persistent weedy species following contrasting types of disturbance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We address this issue by examining the conflict between raptor conservation and management of Red Grouse (Lagopus l. scoticus) in Britain. Heather moorland is a distinctive habitat that supports an important assemblage of breeding birds. Large areas of moorland are managed by private landowners for shooting grouse. Although grouse shooting benefits conservation by retaining heather moorland, it is currently unclear whether grouse management directly benefits other upland birds. Human persecution has greatly restricted the range and abundance of most raptor species in Britain. Following the introduction of bird protection laws, the decline in gamekeeping, and the restriction of organochlorine pesticides, raptor populations have started to recover. Persecution of raptors on grouse moors is widespread and limits the range and abundance of Hen Harriers (Circus cyaneus), Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). In some circumstances, raptor predation can reduce both the breeding density and productivity of Red Grouse. Limitation of grouse populations through raptor predation is most likely to occur where raptors are at high density because of the abundance of alternative prey, and grouse are at low density either because of poor management or the cyclic nature of some grouse populations. In the long term, habitat management may reduce densities of alternative prey, leading to reductions in raptor densities and their predation on grouse. More active intervention may be required, however, if grouse moors are to remain viable in the short-term. Current research is focused on manipulating harrier diet through diversionary feeding. Complementary research is needed to investigate methods to reduce raptor numbers locally while ensuring their national status.

In Quebec, where the boreal forest is largely dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands, we surveyed 140 point-count stations in 3 postlogging and 4 postfire development stages determined according to the height of the regenerating spruce trees. Species richness did not vary among forest development stages, but bird abundance was higher in recent clearcuts. Recently disturbed areas were characterized by open-land bird assemblages dominated by Neotropical migrants, which reached their highest abundance in clearcuts. Moreover, logged stands were distinguished from burned sites by the absence of cavity-nesting birds. Forest-bird assemblages reestablished themselves as soon as young spruces reached the sapling stage. However, the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), and Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) were restricted to mature stands or recent burns and are thus likely to be negatively affected by modern forestry, which involves fire suppression and short logging rotations. We suggest that retention of larger areas of continuous mature forest might be essential to maintain these species in managed regions.

A study of the bird populations using fallows in the Castro Verde region during the breeding season was made during spring 1996, with the objective of characterizing the bird community and describing relationships between bird density and vegetation structure, for selected species. For each of 50 transects, birds were counted once and variables related to vegetation structure were measured. Multivariate analyses were used to explore the relationships between bird density and habitat characteristics. The bird community of fallows was characterized by the numerical abundance of two species - Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra (8.5 birds/km) and Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax (4.5 birds/km) - which represented 60% of the total number of birds detected. Of the 28 bird species observed, only four others reached average relative densities greater than 1 bird/km: Great Bustard Otis tarda, Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis, Corn Bunting Miliaria calandra and Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla. The variables influencing bird density were related mainly to vegetation height, cover by bare ground and presence of shrubs. The results suggest that agricultural management practices which promote the simultaneous presence of fallouts with different habitat characteristics will increase species diversity at the local level. The models built were also used to predict changes in bird populations as a consequence of changes in grazing intensity and land abandonment.

The communal area has twice the recommended stocking rate of sheep and goats, and has less perennial plant cover and more annual plants than neighbouring commercial rangelands. Commercial rangelands supported a larger and more diverse assemblage of small mammals and birds. Small mammal species composition on communal lands was a subset of that on adjacent commercial rangelands, with only one species equally abundant in both treatments. Diurnal mammals were scarce in communal rangelands, apparently due to the lack of cover for predator avoidance and herbivory. Management to maintain a diversity of small mammals requires a minimum level of effective cover. Bird richness and diversity was also reduced on communal rangelands, with many species, especially insectivores, less abundant. A few bird species, notably granivores, were more abundant on communal rangelands, probably because of the increase in annual plant cover. The absence of some large bird species regularly found in Namaqualand, but absent from both treatments (e.g., bustards), suggests that neither management practice is optimal. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

Therefore, we examined bird-habitat relationships on mixed-grass prairie at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in northwestern North Dakota, where prescribed fire has been used as a habitat management tool since the 1970s. We sampled bird abundance on upland prairie at 310 point count locations during 1993 and 1994 breeding seasons. We also measured vegetation structure and composition at each location. Complete fire histories were available for each point, with over 80% having been burned one to four times in the previous 15 years. Post-fire succession generally transformed vegetation structure from short, sparse, and grassy with few forbs and low litter immediately after fire, to increasing and moderate:amounts of forbs, litter, and shrubs two to eight years postfire, to tall, dense, shrubby prairie with little forb, grass, or litter understory when fire was absent (>80 years). Most grassland birds (six of nine species examined) at Lostwood NWR were absent from prairie untreated with fire. Species richness and abundances of Baird's Sparrows (Ammodramus bairdii), Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum), Le Conte's Sparrows (A. leconteii), Sprague's Pipits (Anthus spragueii), and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) were positively related to an index of amount of fire, and these species were absent from unburned units. In contrast, Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) and Clay-colored Sparrows (Spizella pallida) both reached highest abundance on unburned prairie. To provide maximum grassland bird diversity, managers of mesic, mixed-grass prairie generally should provide areas with short (2-4 year), moderate (5-7 year), and long (8-10 year, or more) fire return intervals. Because long-term rest may create habitat unfavorable for most species of grassland passerines in mesic, northern mixed prairie, periodic defoliations by disturbances such as fire should be considered essential to restore and maintain native biodiversity.

We investigated the impacts of burning aspen-dominated habitats on landbird community structure in the western foothills of the Wind River Range, Wyoming. Habitat structure, breeding bird species composition, richness, and relative abundance were compared in 1994 and 1995 between six independent pairs of sites, each pair consisting of a recently burned aspen site and a control site. Burned sites typically had lower canopy cover and depth, greater snag densities and aspen regeneration, and less shrub growth. We observed 45 diurnal woodland bird species overall. Western Wood-Pewees (Contopus sordidulus) and Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus) were detected significantly less often in the burned sites, while Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) and Pine Siskins (Carduelis pinus) were detected significantly more often in the burned sites. Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivora celata), Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), and chickadees (Poecile spp.) were significantly less abundant in the burned aspen when burn size or year was factored into the analysis. For many other commonly detected species, we had relatively low power to detect meaningful differences in abundance between recently burned and unburned aspen stands. Bird species richness was similar between treatments. Bird species composition differed consistently among burned-control pairs, but our data suggested that intersite variability in species composition in aspen is the norm in the absence of burning.

We obtained historical and present land use, vegetation cover types, and landscape structure of both landscapes from high-resolution aerial photography. Avian community composition in the low density rural population landscape was primarily related to the amount of land in deciduous forest and land treated with fire or herbicides, In contrast, avian community composition in the high density rural population landscape was primarily related to the amount of land in deciduous forest, native grassland, and roads, Changes in vegetation cover type were related to changes in the avian community composition by increasing prairie habitat associated species in the low density rural population and generalist habitat associated species in the high density rural population landscapes. Loss of neotropical migrants and increased number of generalist species in the high density rural population landscape was related to decreased native vegetation, road development, and increased landscape fragmentation, Biologists and conservationists in this region should focus attention on preserving biological diversity of rural ecosystems by maintaining native plant communities.

Many of these marshes are managed intensively through a combination of fall/winter burning and construction of impoundments to improve wintering waterfowl habitat, reduce wetland loss, and create emergent wetlands. Little information is available on effects of this management on wintering birds, particularly passerines. We conducted experimental burns in impounded and unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwest Louisiana and recorded species composition and abundance of birds during the 1996 and 1997 winters. We found that burning and impoundment influenced vegetation structure, which in turn influenced bird abundance and species composition. Blackbirds (Icteridae) preferred recently burned plots. Sparrows (Emberizidae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) avoided recently burned plots but recolonized these plots after one year of vegetation recovery. Sparrows and wrens present in burned plots during the first winter following burning generally were observed in scattered patches of unburned vegetation. Suitability of Chenier Plain marshes as winter habitat for several bird species was reduced during the winter in which burning was conducted, particularly if a high proportion of the plot was burned. We recommend that patchy burns be used, at both the landscape level and within specific burned areas, to achieve management objectives and still provide suitable winter habitat for non-target species. Although many groups of birds depend on Chenier Plain marshes for winter habitat, these groups differ in their specific habitat requirements. We recommend that a diverse wetland complex (e.g., impoundments managed for waterfowl foraging habitat interspersed with those managed for passerine winter cover) be maintained.

We developed a population risk model to examine influence of population size, catastrophes (epidemics and hurricanes), and habitat management scenarios on Florida scrub-jay populations. Extinction risk declined rapidly when initial population sizes increased from 20 to 100 breeding pairs. Hurricanes increased extinction risk for coastal populations by 10-30% compared to inland populations. Our results suggested that habitat in poor condition was unlikely to support a population for more than a few decades. Poor habitat quality conditions were common throughout the species' range because of fire suppression or inadequate fire management. Habitat management was more effective than habitat restoration because population recovery occurred slowly after restoration and only if habitat was restored to optimal conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed that fecundity and survival of experienced breeders without helpers (adult nonbreeders) were the most important model parameters. Slow recovery rates occurred because helpers were the only rapid source of colonists in restored habitat and because an absence of helpers reduced breeder survival and fecundity. Small population sizes and habitat degradation make the Florida scrub-jay vulnerable to rangewide decline and extinction unless habitat is protected, restored, and managed to maintain optimal conditions.

Although the species counted have marked differences in size and weight, density (individuals/km(2)) and estimated population size in 23 500 ha of well-preserved forests were similar: Amazona farinosa (13.82 +/- 5.94; 3247 +/- 1395), Pionus maximiliani (15.79 +/- 7.04; 3712 +/- 1654), Brotogeris tirica (15.05 +/- 4.87; 3537 +/- 1143) and Pyrrhura frontalis (13.06 +/- 5.53; 3068 +/- 1298). Encounter rates of Forpus crassirostris and Pionopsitta pileata were very low, which suggests that there is only a small population of these species on the island. The Sao Sebastiao forests still support healthy populations of parrots. Although woodpecker population estimates on the island are large enough to provide nesting sites for parrots, competition for holes with other secondary cavity nesters such as toucans, flycatchers and tytiras, and the selective cutting of dead trees for canoe construction, which is a common practice on the island, may limit hole availability for parrots.

We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having greater than or equal to 95% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with I-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfire than on postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Redstart (Setophaga rutticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of standing dead trees on the landscape.

This conflict could be mitigated by the identification of safe classes of snags, those with low rates of fall, that can be easily identified and retained in forest operations. I outline an approach to estimating rates of fall of identifiable decay classes of snags based on static life-table analysis of the current age distribution and relative abundance of classes of snags in a stand, applying the analysis to subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) snags. The two most recent classes of snags, identified by the presence of fine branches and intact bark, showed fall rates of 0.17-0.20%/yr, similar to or lower than live subalpine fir trees. Fall rates increased to 0.70%/yr for the third class of snags, identified by loss of fine branches and cracking of bark, and to 3.79% and 6.16%/yr for the fourth and fifth classes, respectively, identified by increasing loss of bark and incipient softening of outer wood. Snags in the two earliest classes could be retained during forest operations without substantial increase in risk to workers. The static life-table approach to estimating fall rates of snags can complement long-term monitoring of snags in older forests where the assumption of a stationary age distribution is met.

The elements of the decision support system are an ecological simulation model and a data management system. In boreal forests, decaying wood is important from the standpoint of biological diversity. Many organisms, such as saproxylic beetles and polypores, live in decaying wood. The structure of a forest determines which species select it as a habitat, because the habitat requirements vary between species. In this study, the stand structure includes living and dead trees, their diameter distribution by tree species and the stage of decay. Forest management strongly modifies stand structure. We used the simulation model to investigate the stand structure and databases on the habitat requirements of beetle and polypore species to assess the number of species in a stand. We tested our system with four management examples and compared the results to experimental results. Both our study and the experimental results showed that intensive forest management decreases the number of large deciduous trees in boreal forests and therefore reduces the number of beetle and polypore species.

A large nongovernmental organization hastened restoration with a development process that outlined restoration goals and management objectives to satisfy a dual mandate of wastewater treatment and wildlife habitat creation. In 1995, after five years of wastewater additions, the basins had been refilled and the surrounding uplands had been acquired and restored. The Frank Lake Conservation Area currently provides high-quality habitat for a variety of wildlife in a region where many of the native plants and animals species have been lost due to habitat loss and fragmentation. The success of upland and water management strategies is reflected in the increase of target species' abundance and richness: 50 shorebird species, 44 waterfowl species. 15 raptor species, and 28 other new bird species have returned to the marsh since restoration. As well, significant N and P reduction occurs as waters flow through the first basin of the marsh. The management strategies of this project that satisfied a dual mandate serve as a model to guide managers of other large-scale wetland restoration projects.

However, at times, management for threatened and endangered species precludes consideration of other species. We investigated how managing for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and biodiversity at the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, affected communities of bird species that use early-successional scrub habitat thereafter, scrub-successional species). Management for red-cockaded woodpeckers at the SRS involved both (1) manipulating mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-wiregrass (Andropogon spp.) stands via canopy thinning, removal of midstory trees, and prescribed bunting; and (2) even-aged timber harvesting. The former management practice encouraged red-cockaded woodpeckers to establish new colonies in previously unoccupied stands thereafter, "recruitment" stands). The latter management practice is used to remove offsite planted pines and replant with preferred longleaf pines. We conducted a constant-effort mist net study in recruitment and regenerating stands (stands clearcut and planted with longleaf pine) during the breeding seasons of 1995-96. We hypothesized that the scrub-successional bird community in recruitment stands would have greater species richness and higher survival and reproductive rates per species than in regenerating stands. However, recruitment stands always had fewer scrub-successional species (1995: 36 species: 1996: 31 species) than regenerating stands (1995: 54 species; 1996: 55 species), and all species that occurred in recruitment stands also occurred in regenerating stands. Species which commonly occurred in both recruitment and regenerating stands had similar adult:juvenile ratios (P > 0.15) and relative proportion of adults in breeding condition (P > 0.05). We detected no difference in survival rates of Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis). indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), and of "combined" scrub-successional birds between stand types (P > 0.05). We found that even-aged forestry is an important management practice for maintaining and increasing avian biodiversity on public lands, as well as an acceptable management practice for red-cockaded woodpeckers.

Compared to breeding bird censuses conducted in secondary stands of the same forest type, total breeding-season density of birds was 63% higher in the Savage Gulf old growth. Large, widely distributed softwood snags enhanced the abundances of both primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds. Like other eastern old-growth forests with complex canopies, the Savage Gulf oak-pine forest contained high densities of arboreal Parulinae: yellow-throated warbler (Dendroica dominica [L.]) and pine warbler (D. pinus [Wilson]). Two raptors more commonly associated with riparian and mesic forests, the red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus [Gmelin]) and barred owl (Strix varia Barton), were unexpected breeding residents in this well-drained, upland forest site. Two species of pines-shortleaf (Pinus echinata Miller) and Virginia (P. virginiana Miller)-comprised 29% of the total basal area and 40% of stem density of trees greater than or equal to 7.6 cm dbh. Pines formed a dispersed emergent canopy (to 39 m) over a lower canopy dominated by white oak (Quercus alba L.) and northern red oak (Q. rubra L.). Individual shortleaf pines exceeded 84 cm dbh and were 230-270 years of age. Measurements of eight attributes of vegetation structure generally met or exceeded values proposed independently for old-growth condition in this forest type.

To date, few optimality models have been presented to optimize this trade-off, especially when the common currency cannot be easily measured in dollars. We use a population simulation model (e.g. spatially explicit individual-based model) to model a hypothetical forest bird population's response to different cutting and planting regimes. We then link these results to a dynamic programming model to determine the optimal choice a manager should make at each time step to minimize revenue foregone by not harvesting timber while maintaining a given population of birds. Our results show that if optimal management choices are made further back in time, future (terminal) reward may be greater. As the end of the management period approaches, past management practices influence the terminal reward more than future practices can. Thus if past revenue lost is high, the future reward will be low as compared to when past revenue lost is low. The general strategy of setting some minimum viable population size and then using a population simulator linked to a dynamic programming model to ask how to maintain such a population size with minimum economic loss should have nearly universal applicability in conservation biology.

We estimated species abundance, richness, and evenness using data from 312 point counts in 18 burned sites and sis unburned sites. We measured gross habitat features in 0.04-ha circles centered on each point count station. We calculated productivity estimates at nests of seven of the most common nesting species. Habitat components we measured in 1-, 2-, and 3-yr post-burn sites were similar, but most components differed between burned and unburned sites. Although 98 species were detected during point counts, we report only on the 46 species that nested in the area and were detected greater than or equal to 10% of the counts in either habitat class. Twenty-one species preferred burned sites and six preferred unburned sites. Avian species richness and evenness were similar for burned and unburned sites. Burned sites were preferred for nesting over unburned sites. Only nine nests of six species were found in unburned sites. Productivity; estimates were low in burned sites. One or more eggs hatched in only 59 of 187 nests monitored, and an avenge of only 0.82 chicks per nest were estimated to have fledged. Predation was the most common probable cause for nest failure, ranging from 45% in the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) to 64% in the Summer Tanager (Piranga rubra). Because the sources of predation at the refuge are unknown, future research should address this issue.

We compared bird composition and foraging behavior during the winter in burned and unburned forests. We conducted point counts during four consecutive winters immediately following a stand replacement fire. Burned and unburned forests had similar numbers of bird species, yet species composition was distinctly different. Trunk and branch foraging species were 2.5 times more abundant in burned forest than in unburned forest. Within burned forests, trunk and branch foraging species significantly decreased from the first winter post-fire to the fourth winter post-fire. We conducted foraging observations of four woodpecker species within burned forests only. Woodpeckers used western larch (Larix occidentalis), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) snags that were greater than 23 cm in diameter. Stand replacement fires may play an important role in maintaining populations of trunk and branch foraging species in mixed coniferous forests in northeastern Washington.

The WBW's home ranges were situated mostly in a sessile oak forest (proportion of sessile oaks > 80%) growing on steep slopes (> 40 degrees) with a higher proportion of dead trees (> 6%) and with a lower crown cover of an upper tree layer (60-80%). Mean home-range size during breeding was 8.5 ha (6.3-9.9 ha). Nestlings appeared between 25-30 April and fledglings between 20-25 May, i.e. about 2-3 weeks sooner compared to other Dendrocopos species within the study plot. During the incubation and the nestling period the adults were extremely inconspicuous, so that only two nest holes were found. Both cavities were excavated into trunks of living sessile oaks with crown defoliation less than 10% at a height of 7 and 15 m. The food of adults during the growing season consisted mostly of the Scolytidae and Cerambycidae larvae (59.7% of foraging records), that of nestlings mostly of Geometridae, Noctuidae, and Tortricidae larvae (60.5% of foraging bouts, 70.4% of prey items). Food was taken only from oaks in the upper tree layer (100% of records) from the surface of the bark and leaves (47% of records) or excavated from trunks and branches of dying and dead oaks (51% of records).

However, little is known about the use of riparian buffers by terrestrial wildlife, particularly how buffer width may affect abundance and species composition of wildlife communities. In this study, I compared bird assemblages in logged and unlogged riparian areas along headwater streams and assessed the relations between bird abundance and riparian buffer width. The abundances of 4 species of forest-associated birds that were more abundant in unlogged than in logged headwater riparian stands (Pacific-slope flycatcher [Empidonax difficilis], brown creeper [Certhia americana], chestnut-backed chickadee [Poecile rufescens], winter wren [Troglodytes troglodytes]) increased with increasing width of riparian buffers. However, 4 other species that also were more abundant in unlogged than logged riparian stands (Hammond's flycatcher [Empidonax hammondii], golden-crowned kinglet [Regulus satrapa], varied thrush [Ixoreus naevius], hermit warbler [Dendroica occidentalis]) were rarely observed in even the widest buffers sampled (40-70 m on 1 side of the stream). Although riparian buffers along headwater streams are not expected to support all bird species found in unlogged riparian areas, they are likely to provide the most benefit for forest-associated bird species if they are >40 m wide, and density of large trees within buffers is not reduced by harvesting.

We compared bird use of riparian buffers along main stem rivers, tributary streams, and reference riparian zones having intact, upslope forests. Community composition differed considerably between buffers and references, and also between main stems and tributaries. Density of the more common species (those detected >20 times) was significantly higher along main stems than along tributaries. Four species (bay-breasted warbler, black-throated green warbler, blue jay, Cape May warbler) were more abundant along main stems than along tributaries; no species was more abundant along tributaries. The overall density of less common species was significantly higher in buffer strips than in reference sites, but four of the more common species (bap-breasted, blackburnian, black-throated green, and Cape May warblers) were more abundant in reference sites than in buffer strips. We did not detect differences in species diversity or richness among the different site types, but edge-species were significantly more common in buffer strips than in reference sites. Interior-species, in contrast, were significantly more common in reference sites.

Although several studies have characterized the habitat requirements of breeding Henslow's Sparrows, winter habitat requirements for the species remain poorly known. The purpose of our study was to identify habitat variables associated with occupancy by Henslow's Sparrow on silvicultural lands in the core of its winter range in the Gulf Coastal Plain. Forty-one study sites were chosen on lands managed for timber production in Baldwin County, Alabama. Henslow's Sparrows selected moist sites that occurred as pitcher plant bogs or as transition areas between wet pitcher plant bogs and drier upland areas. A multiple logistic regression model identified the density of the grass Panicum verrucosum and the density of pitcher plants as the variables best able to explain the presence of Henslow's Sparrows. Sites occupied by Henslow's Sparrows had higher herbaceous vegetation densities and had been disturbed by timber harvest and/or fire more recently than unoccupied sites. Within occupied sites, Henslow's Sparrows chose areas with higher densities of herbaceous vegetation, especially P. verrucosum.

We collected pre-treatment data in 1995, burned experimental plots in January 1996, and collected post-treatment data in 1996. Data were analyzed in a randomized, complete-block design with winter-burn and control treatments replicated 3 times each within 2 blocks (i.e., herbicide and non-herbicide). Relative abundance (P = 0.246) and species richness (P = 0.622) of breeding birds were not different between treatments. Relative abundance of wintering birds was greater (P = 0.002) in burned treatments, but species richness was not different (P = 0.602). Prescribed burns on mesquite grasslands had minimal effects on bird communities in the year following treatment. We recommend maintaining unburned areas adjacent to burns to provide habitat for bird species that declined after winter prescribed burning (i.e., grasshopper sparrow [Ammodramus savannarum], Le Conte's sparrow [Ammodramus leconteii], and sedge wren [Cistothorus platensis]).

Weak cavity nesters tend to be smaller and may be less limited by the availability of large trees but more dependent on suitably softened wood. In this paper, we describe availability, use, and preference for nesting habitat of a small cavity-nesting bird, the red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), in mature coniferous forest in southeastern British Columbia. We describe nesting habitat at 3 spatial scales: (1) the level of forest stands proposed for logging (cutblocks), which ranged from 8.1 to 18.4 ha in size; (2) the level of 0.04-ha patches of forest centered on nest trees (nest plots); and (3) the level of individual nest trees. In addition to considering basic structural habitat features, we analyzed the relation between nesting use and several factors related to forest health, including Armillaria root disease (Armillaria ostoyae), stemwood decay, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestation, and dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.). Red-breasted nuthatches nested at higher densities on cutblocks with more dead trees (snags) and higher levels of root disease. Within nest plots, we also detected a preference for nesting in Armillaria-infected trees. Cavity nesting of nuthatches was influenced by both forest structure and the disease agents that contribute to it. We recommend that standing diseased and dead trees be retained in patches during logging operations. Retention of such trees in distinct patches more likely satisfies requirements for worker safety and for limiting the spread of diseases than does retention of single dead and diseased trees throughout cutblocks. Wildlife values not only should be incorporated into timber harvesting regulations but also should be considered when planning activities designed to improve forest health for timber production.

The purposes of our study were to test for differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek fire near Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2 years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ ha. Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts, woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986. Our results suggest the black-backed woodpecker is extremely specialized in its foraging niche, exploiting outbreaks of wood-boring beetles in dying conifers for only 2-3 years after fires. Consequently, this species may be particularly vulnerable to local and regional extinction as fire suppression intensifies and programs of intensive salvage logging are pursued following fires.

We surveyed early-successional forests created by fire or logging for birds and their habitat during the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons. We found that overall bird species richness and number of individuals (territorial males/ha) were higher (P < 0.05) in burned forests than in logged forests. The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), house wren (Troglodytes aedon), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), Lincoln's sparrow (M. lincolnii), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were more abundant in burned areas. The Nashville warbler (Vermivora ruficapilla), chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica), black-throated green warbler (D. virens), and mourning warbler (Oporornis agilis) were present in greater numbers in the logged areas. We related these differences in bird presence and abundance to vegetation differences in the burned and logged habitat types. Burned areas had higher densities of dead trees, wider size ranges of dead trees, and greater heterogeneity in the shrub layer. Logged areas had higher densities of live trees, more live tree species, and wider size ranges of live trees. Red maple (Acer rubrum) was the live tree species found in greatest abundance in logged areas. If management goals include simulating natural disturbances like fire and maintaining bird populations, more dead trees should be left within logged habitats and the variability among logged areas should be increased.

However, it is unclear if restored systems replace the habitat functions of natural wetlands, and few direct comparisons of multiple sites have been made. Three years after restoration, we compared the relative abundance and density of birds using 18 restored wetlands and 8 natural wetlands located in northern New York. Birds were classified as wetland dependent. wetland associated or nonwetland. Abundances of species and of individuals in all 3 groups did not differ (P > 0.05) between restored and natural wetlands in any year. Densities of species in all 3 groups were consistently but not significantly lower at restored sites. Densities of individuals in the wetland-associated category and nonwetland category were significantly lower at restored sites for the first 2 years following restoration. Bird communities were significantly less similar between restored and natural sites than among restored sites. However, many of these differences may not persist following natural successional development of the restored sites. The long-term persistence of appropriate plant communities will determine whether or not restored sites provide bird habitat comparable to natural wetlands. The restoration program successfully increased the amount of bird habitat available in the region. However, hectare-for-hectare, the restored wetland sites did not replace the habitat functions of natural wetlands during the time period of this study.

Only some of these are able to recover unaided. Where attempts are being made to restore such forests, the scale of the attempts is usually small. Timber plantations are one of the few means by which large areas of cleared or degraded landscape can be reforested. These usually restore the productive capacity of the landscape but do little to recover biological diversity. But a number of approaches might be used to redesign such plantations so that they would both yield the timber needed to justify the investment and also contain some proportion of their former biodiversity. These approaches include using indigenous species rather than exotic species, creating species mosaics by matching species to particular sites, embedding the plantation monocultures in a matrix of intact or restored vegetation, using species mixtures rather than monocultures, or encouraging the diverse plant understories that can often develop beneath plantations. The degree of ecological restoration possible using these alternatives ranges from modest to significant, although none is likely to achieve complete restoration. Any improvements in regional biodiversity brought about by these changes might be seen as being at the expense of plantation productivity, But many of these approaches have advantages other than just restoring former biodiversity, I discuss some of the trade-offs and implications for plantation managers and restorationists.

Fire suppression and fuelwood harvest likely have reduced oak abundance within the pine-oak type. Gambel oak occurs in multiple age-related growth forms, from small shrubs to large, old trees, and may provide important foraging and nesting habitat for breeding birds. I compared attributes of breeding bird communities in 16 northern Arizona ponderosa pine stands from 1993-1995, that were structurally similar except for the presence or absence of Gambel oak. Overlap in bird species composition was high; pine and pine-oak stands had a mean Jaccard similarity value of 0.67. Five species were unique to pine stands, whereas 10 species were largely restricted to or only found in pine-oak stands. Overall bird diversity was significantly higher in pine-oak stands, which also had more species of Neotropical migrants, ground nesters, primary cavity excavators, and secondary cavity users than did pine stands. Pine and pine-oak stands had similar species evenness and similar rates of annual species turnover. Total bird abundance did not differ between cover types; however, primary cavity excavators were more abundant in pine-oak stands. Because of the apparent positive influence of oak on breeding birds, forest managers are encouraged to use treatments that retain and enhance the various growth forms of Gambel oak found in pine-oak stands.

Based on mining history, we selected 28 sites (12 natural, 9 abandoned after blockcut extraction, and 7 abandoned after vacuum extraction) in 15 bogs. We estimated percent cover for six vegetation strata in 106 plots with 100 m radius, on which bird point counts were conducted in 1993 and 1996. Vegetation structure differed significantly between natural, post-blockcut and post-vacuum sites. While vegetation cover was almost complete in natural sites, abandoned sites, especially post vacuum, were less vegetated, even after 20 years. Bird species richness and abundance were similar in natural and post-blockcut sites and both were higher than in post-vacuum sites. Ten of the 28 species studied in detail responded to site perturbation. Among them, the Palm Warbler was most closely associated with natural sites. Bird communities were closely associated with vegetation structure. Communities of post-blockcut sites were more similar to those of natural bogs than were bird communities of post-vacuum sites. Since the blockcut method of peat mining is no longer economically feasible, we conclude that bog habitat restoration should be accompanied by a preservation "safety net" area to counteract the lasting effect of vacuum peat mining on bird species assemblages.

We measured ecosystem properties (metrics) that were clearly linked to ecosystem processes. We focused on conservation of soil and water as key processes in healthy ecosystems, and on maintenance of biodiversity and productivity as important functions of healthy ecosystems. Measurements from which indicators of rangeland health were derived included: sizes of unvegetated patches, cover and species composition of perennial grasses, cover and species composition of shrubs and herbaceous perennials, soil slaking, and abundance and species composition of the bird fauna. Indicators that provided an interpretable range of values over the gradient from irreversibly degraded sites to healthy sites included: bare patch index, cover of long-lived grasses, palatability index, and weighted soil surface stability index. Indicators for which values above a threshold may serve as an indicator of rangeland health include: cover of plant species toxic to livestock, cover of exotic species, and cover of increaser species. Several other indicator metrics were judged not sensitive nor interpretable. Examples of application of rangeland health indicators to evaluate the success of various restoration efforts supported the contention that a suite of indicators are required to assess rangeland health.

Here, we consider the analysis of species composition when multiple sites are followed through time.Analyses of temporal trends in species composition either summarize species composition into a few metrics (indices or axis scores) or analyze the similarity among sites. We develop and illustrate the similarity approach. Each pair of samples represents a pair of replicates, a pair from the same site at different times, a pair from different sites at the same time, or an unrelated pair. Differences among times can be estimated by comparing average temporal dissimilarity to average replicate dissimilarity. Temporal trends can be described by one of three statistics that measure progressive change, the correlation of temporal dissimilarity with the length of time between samples. These methods are illustrated using data on changes in a South Carolina zooplankton assemblage following disturbance, and changes in bird species composition on Skokholm Island, Wales.It is difficult to define and interpret temporal trends. Some definitions of interesting trends, like increasing divergence from another set of sample plots, place additional requirements on the sampling design. Including replicate samples or clustering sample plots and including "control" plots for comparison with sentinel sites would contribute to an understanding of changes in species composition.

Concern has arisen over impacts of large-scale conversion of closed-canopy forests to open pine-grassland woodlands. We evaluated how an ecosystem approach to habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected small mammals. During 2 winters wee compared small mammal occurrence and abundance in untreated pine-hardwood stands to stands following wildlife stand improvement (WSI; midstory removal), and With WSI-treated stands in the first, second, and third dormant seasons following prescribed fire. Total abundance of small mammals was highest in WSI stands and was a more direct response to WSI (change in stand structure) than to fire. Increased species richness and diversity in the second year of this study was strongly related to both WSI and fire. No species was adversely affected by WSI or by fire. Rather, WSI and fire-reduced midstory, increased dead debris in the understory, promoted herbaceous production, and increased woody sprouting. Total community abundance, richness, and diversity were lowest in untreated stands. White-footed mice (Peromyscus spp.; primarily white-footed mouse [P. leucopus]) were the dominant species, accounting for 68% of the 611 individuals collected. Restoration efforts may be particularly beneficial to generalist species such as P, leucopus as well as to more specialized species, such as golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli) and fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens) that historically may have depended upon pine-grassland habitats. Restoration of pine-grassland communities may enhance small mammal communities by reestablishing a landscape element that was present during presettlement times.

Protection from habitat destruction atone cannot guarantee its conservation and the damage already sustained is not fully reversible Therefore, the ideal for conservation-maintenance or restoration of self-sustaining populations of all species in native ecosystems-is presently unattainable. We assessed three long-term strategies for maintaining and increasing populations of threatened native birds on the mainland and offshore islets of Mauritius, with respect to efficacy, sustainability, and side-effects. Rehabilitation of native vegetation on the mainland is likely to improve food availability over limited areas, but it can only form the basis of a long-term bird conservation strategy when population density of introduced animals, especially predators, can he reduced sustainably, at low financial cost, and without adversely affecting native wildlife. Marooning bird populations on ecologically rehabilitated islets can eliminate the predator problem, but they would be vulnerable to catastrophes (especially cyclones) and possibly disease and much habitat manage ment work is still needed. A third novel strategy-enhancement of mainland habitat using exotic plants-allows creation of source habitats, greatly reducing the predator threat. It also permits larger areas to be managed and at lower cost, than is the case with intensive rehabilitation. Habitat management regimes for conservation of threatened species or communities must be designed specifically to alleviate population-limiting factors. Ln altered environments certain exotic plants can be essential to the survival of native animal species. The most effective conservation measure must not be assumed always to be the rehabilitation of native vegetation.

We review literature pertaining to effects of fire-insect interactions on ecological succession, use of prescribed fire for insect pest control, and effects of fire on insect diversity from northern and boreal forests in North America. Fire suppression policies implemented in the early 1900s have resulted in profound changes in forest species composition and structure. Associated with these changes was an increased vulnerability of forest stands to damage during outbreaks of defoliating insects. Information about the roles that both fire and insects play in many northern forests is needed to increase our understanding of the ecology of these systems and to develop sound management policies.

The CRP replaced production agriculture fields with grassland habitat used by more than 90 species of birds. At least 42 bird species nested in CRP habitats. Bird species richness in CRP fields was similar to Chat in rowcrop fields, but relative abundance was 1.4 to 10.5 times higher in CRP plantings. Nest abundance was 13.5 times higher in CRP than crop fields, although nesting success of songbirds was only slightly higher in CRP fields (40% vs. 36% in crops). Limited evidence suggests that the CRP has positively affected the population growth rates of several nongame grassland bird species. Waterfowl nest densities and nesting success in CRP fields were similar to those occurring in grassland habitats managed specifically for waterfowl. The presence of CRP grassland has been postulated to have improved the quality of existing duck nest habitat by dispersing nests over a larger area. Ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus L.) populations seemingly increased substantially with CRP acres. Little evidence of positive population response by northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus L.) to the CRP is available. Overall, grassland birds known to be declining throughout North America were seemingly the most benefitted by the CRP.

Previous studies,however, have focused primarily on how nest predation can change when landscapes become fragmented by agriculture rather than by logging. To determine if predation on artificial nests in forest patches was influenced by the surrounding landscape, we placed ground and shrub ness along the edge and interior of forest patches located in agricultural, logged,and contiguous forest landscapes within a single region of the southern boreal mixedwood forest of central Canada. Nest predators were identified using remotely triggered cameras and by marks left in plasticine eggs, whereas the relative abundance of nest predators such as corvids and small mammals was estimated by surveys and live-trapping. The percentage of ground nests destroyed at the edge and interior of patches in the logged and contiguous forest landscapes was significantly lower than the edge or interior of patches in the agricultural landscape. No differences in predation rate were observed for shrub nests among landscapes. We attributed higher rates of predation in the agricultural landscape to higher densities of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in the interior and a greater diversity of predators along edges. The similarity in predation rate between logged and contiguous forest landscape suggest that fragmentation caused by logging may result in little change in predator communities and in this respect, might be similar to fragmentation caused by natural disturbance regimes such as fire. In contrast, fragmentation by agriculture seems to have more serious consequences for nesting birds. Policy changes that limit the growth of agriculture in the southern boreal mixedwood forest are required to conserve the diverse avifauna of this region.

Carmel, Israel. Consequently an interdisciplinary scientific effort in fire ecology was initiated in order to propose recommendations to the management authorities, Field data gathered on soil erosion in the Mt. Carmel site implied that erosion is severe only during the first winter after fire, but it does not seem to present a significant threat to longterm ecosystem recovery. The recovery of the natural vegetation mitigates erosion, and there is no special need for any precautions to be taken immediatly following fire. Salvage cutting of burned trees had no effect on pine seedling recruitment, on vegetation development and on plant species diversity. Salvage cutting did affect passerine bird community by slowing down succession rate. For successful regeneration of the pine forest the burned site need not to be planted, since the number of natural pine seedlings is sufficiently great, and there is a need to conserve the genetic and spatial variability of the forest. Although thinning has a positive effect on short-term pine survival and growth, such action is not recommended since pine seedlings are susceptible to pine bast scale (Matsococcus josephi) up to seven years, and to severe damage by porcupines. Selection caused by this bast scale might improve the resistance of the new pine forest stand. Pine seedling growing in the:microsites of the old burned pine trees should be treated carefully, since some of them, due to their fast development, appear to be the next generation of the forest. Thinning of these groups can be considered after seven years, accompanied by removal of Cistus dwarf shrubs. However, where porcupine damage is observed, thinning should be done at low rates and with no pruning of side twigs. Since animal succession is a consequence of the change and progress in vegetation structure, there is no need for animal resettlement. The concept of "fuel breaks", combining a single massive thinning of the woody vegetation and an annual short but heavy grazing, is a management option for decreasing fire danger and future fire damage.

This study examined whether distribution and breeding success of skylarks varied with the cropping of organically and intensively managed fields in southern England in accordance with the hypothesis that changes in agricultural land-use and intensity of management have contributed to this decline.2, Density was lowest on fields surrounded by tall boundary structures or unsuitable habitat, and those with tall, dense vegetation cover. After controlling for these effects, set-aside and organically-cropped fields supported significantly higher skylark densities throughout the breeding season than intensively cropped fields or grazed pasture. Nests were usually built in crops between 20 and 50 cm tall. In fast-growing broadleaved crops (e.g. oilseed rape, legumes), skylarks held territories, but no nesting activity was observed. Rapid crop growth probably allows too little time for nesting to begin.3. Breeding success was higher on set-aside than on intensively managed cereals. Predation caused most nest failures, but did not vary in frequency with crop type. Silage cutting and trampling caused many failures on grass fields, and all cases of apparent brood starvation occurred in cereal fields. These breeding success data, together with published estimates of survival rates, suggest that skylark pairs must make 2-3 nesting attempts per season in order for populations to be self-sustaining. A single crop type rarely provides a suitable vegetation structure for nesting throughout the breeding season. Skylarks therefore require structurally diverse crop mosaics in order to make multiple nesting attempts without territory enlargement or abandonment. Mixed farms are more likely to fulfil these requirements than those dominated by winter cereals and broad-leaved crops.4, These results are consistent with the hypothesis that loss of mixed farming and rotational cropping, and concomitant increases in autumn sowing of crops, agrochemical inputs, multiple silage cuts and grazing intensities since the 1950s have reduced the breeding productivity and population density of skylarks on lowland farmland in southern England.5, The following recommendations are made for changes in farming systems that would assist the conservation of breeding skylark populations on lowland farmland. Organic farming systems, set-aside and habitat management for gamebirds are all likely to improve nesting and feeding conditions for skylarks, More generally, breeding skylark populations are only likely to increase on farms that reduce agrochemical inputs, reduce grazing intensity and frequency of silage cutting, and increase the structural diversity of field vegetation by adopting mixed rotations of winter and spring cereals, root crops and grass. Traditional mixed farming systems of this kind are now rarely economically desirable. Only agricultural policy reforms motivated in part by environmental concerns rather than solely by production control are likely to direct subsidy support to reduced-intensity, mixed farming enterprises of this kind, and thus help to restore populations of breeding skylarks on lowland farmland.

I compared community structure (species richness and population abundances) among three forested sectors that varied in extent of clearcutting and among forested plot types of different age since clearcutting from 1993-95 (termed period 2). These results, which were obtained six-eight years subsequent to a third cutting cycle, were then contrasted to those from a previous study (1988-90, termed period 1). The Barrens Grouse HMA consisted of three distinct sectors: a contiguous uncut stand, a series of uncut strip corridors, and a mosaic of small (1 ha) forest patches (plots). I observed 12 wintering bird species in period 2; most species (67%) were trunk-bark foragers. Uncut plots were used more often (P < 0.05) by wintering birds than clearcut plots, perhaps because uncut plots contained rough-barked trees as foraging substrate and more favorable microclimatic conditions. Of the 40 breeding bird species noted in period 2, most were ground-shrub foragers occurring principally in forested corridor and patch sectors. Abundances of six ground-shrub foraging species were higher (P < 0.05) in the forested parch than in other sectors in period 2; these species were found primarily in recent clearcut plots, Abundances of sallier-canopy foragers were higher (P < 0.05) than expected in contiguous forest and forested corridor sectors in period 2. Species richness, abundances of all wintering species combined, and abundances of two foraging guilds (trunk-bark and ground-shrub foragers) were similar among sectors in periods 1 and 2 in both winter and the breeding season. Abundances of three wintering species, however, were greater (P < 0.05) in period 2 than in period 1. In contrast to winter, abundances of all breeding species combined, sallier-canopy foragers, and five species increased I:P < 0.05) between periods, whereas abundance of three species declined. Significant changes in abundances of wintering and breeding birds between periods at the Barrens Grouse HMA may be explained partially by plant succession or regional trends in population abundances.

Landscape cover types were modeled with logistic regression based on temporal changes between 1966 and 1990. Demographic-economic regression models also were used to predict landscape cover types in year 2014 based on selected independent variables. Logistic regressions were used to model probability of occurrence of selected avian species based on predicted area of landscape cover types in year 2014. Model output of vegetation cover types suggests the continued use of intensive agriculture management practices in the high density rural population landscape while extensive agriculture management practices will maintain the native vegetation component in the low density rural population landscape. Our models suggest continued intensive agriculture practices associated with the high density rural population landscapes will adversely affect native grassland bird species to a greater magnitude than extensive ranching practices in the low density rural population landscapes.

Edge and interior sites were chosen that were homogeneous with respect to habitat physiognomy i.e. influences of habitat structure and complexity were insignificant. There were no statistical differences in bird species diversity between the forest edge and interior. However, there was significantly greater species turnover at the edge. The difference in bird species composition between the forest edge and interior was due to various edge-effects: removal of dead wood for firewood, soil compaction by cattle, and generally greater levels of disturbance. We question the wisdom of the generally applied edge-effect principle in the conservation of forest biodiversity. We suggest that the principle be applied only once there has been critical appraisal of the extent, nature, and effect of an edge and a clear conservation objective with regard to forest birds.

We describe an experimental study of such mechanisms in a hybrid zone between the fire-bellied toad Bombina bombina and the yellow-bellied toad B. variegata. In this system, preference for different breeding habitats reduces the frequency of hybridization. A comparison of habitat ecology shows that the semi-permanent ponds in which B. bombina usually breeds have higher densities of aquatic predators than the temporary puddles typically used by B. variegata. We test for behavioural adaptations in tadpoles to these different levels of predation. B. bombina tadpoles are significantly less active than B. variegata, both before and after the introduction of a predator to an experimental arena; this reduces their vulnerability as many predators detect prey through movement. Behavioural differences translate into differential survival: B. variegata suffer higher predation rates in laboratory experiments with three main predator types (Triturus sp., Dytiscus larvae, Aeshna nymphs). This differential adaptation to predation will help maintain preference for alternative breeding habitats, and thus serve as a mechanism maintaining the distinctions between the two species.

Abundance of breeding birds was greater in thinned stands. Bird species richness was correlated with habitat patchiness and densities of hardwoods, snags, and conifers. During the breeding season, Hammond's flycatchers (Empidonax hammondii), hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus), red-breasted nuthatches (Sitta canadensis), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), warbling vireos (Vireo gilvus), and evening grosbeaks (Coccothraustes vespertinus) were more abundant in thinned than unthinned stands. Pacific-slope flycatchers (Empidonax difficilis) were more abundant in unthinned stands. Golden-crowned kinglets (Regulus satrapa), gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis), and black-throated gray warblers (Dendroica nigrescens) were more abundant in unthinned than thinned stands, but these patterns were inconsistent between seasons, regions, or years. Stand-scale habitat features were associated with the abundance of 18 bird species.

Height and size of live trees, density of large dead trees, and volume of downed woody material increased during succession, whereas density of live trees decreased. Canopy heterogeneity had a bimodal relationship with succession: old forests had the highest, mature forests the lowest, and young forests an intermediate canopy heterogeneity. Old forests had greater bird species richness than young forests, which in turn had greater richness than mature forests. Twenty-seven, 3, and 10 bird species had their highest abundances in old, mature, and young forests, respectively. Seven bird species that nest and forage in canopy gaps and three bird species that nest and forage in large trees and snags were more abundant in young and old forests than in mature forests. Contrary to our predictions, patterns of richness and abundance for bird species that nest and forage in the canopy or in tree cavities were similar to those for bird species that nest or forage in the lower strata. Bird species preferring coniferous forests tended to be more abundant in old than in young or mature aspen-dominated forests, possibly because old aspen forests had more conifers than younger aspen forests.
