Abstract = {{Since European settlement changes in the fire regime of eastern
   deciduous forests of North America have led to changes in biological
   diversity and stand structure These changes may be attenuated in xeric
   forests at the western limit of the eastern deciduous forest where woody
   plant species richness is low and dominance high due to the rigorous
   biotic and physical environment Effects of fire frequency on woody plant
   species richness and stand structure were studied in a xeric oak
   dominated (Quercus spp) old growth forest in eastern Oklahoma where
   prescribed burning had been conducted over 20 years at frequencies
   ranging from zero to five fires per decade Regeneration (stem height < 1
   4 m) cover was not affected by fire frequency Increasing fire frequency
   had a strong negative effect on species richness of saplings and shrubs
   (stem dbh < 5 cm) but no significant effect on small tree (stems 5 cm <
   dbh < 10 cm) and large tree (stems dbh > 10 cm) species richness While
   oak sapling density was not affected by fire frequency the density of
   non oak saplings and shrubs was very high at zero and one fire per
   decade and strongly reduced by fire frequencies of two or more per
   decade Although 20 years of treatment may not have been sufficient to
   show fire frequency effects on canopy trees the effect on species
   composition of saplings was strong and may have long term consequences
   for forest canopy composition These results suggest that without at
   least two fires per decade tree species richness of these forests will
   increase and oak dominance will diminish}},

Abstract = {{Information about the immediate and potentially prolonged impacts of
   salvage logging is needed to develop prescriptions that maintain forest
   productivity, reduce the risk of catastrophic fires, and conserve
   biological communities. Most salvage logging studies have investigated
   post-fire salvage, often clearcutting, and impacts documented in these
   studies may be more severe than selective logging prescriptions applied
   to forests affected by beetle outbreaks. We evaluated the effects of
   selective salvage logging on avian nest survival in beetle-killed
   lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests on the Fremont and Winema
   National Forests, south-central Oregon, USA, 1997-1999. Using
   logistic-exposure models, we found that nest survival for weak (period
   nest survival: 0.64; 95\% CL: 0.50, 0.75) and strong (period nest
   survival: 0.71; 95\% CL: 0.46, 0.87) cavity nesters was significantly
   higher than for ground nesters (period nest survival: 0.31; 95\% CL:
   0.18, 0.46), while nest survival for open cup nesting birds (period nest
   survival: 0.57: 95\% CL: 0.47, 0.66) was intermediate. We did not find
   significant differences in nest survival for American robin (Turdus
   migratorius), chipping sparrow (Spizella passerine), dark-eyed junco
   (junco hyemalis), dusky flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri), mountain
   chickadee (Poecile gambeli), or yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica
   coronata) (these six species comprised similar to 80\% of the sample).
   Our results suggest that, unlike post-fire salvage logging, selective
   harvesting prescriptions after beetle outbreaks may be suitable for
   meeting multiple management objectives, including generating a flow of
   commodities and maintaining avian nest survival rates. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mountains of south-eastern Nigeria are a western extension of the
   Cameroon mountain range, which is classified as an endemic bird area
   (EBA). Unlike its eastern extension in Cameroon, most of the
   ornithological surveys in the western extension of the Cameroon
   highlands in Nigeria have produced only limited checklists and
   inventories. There is a clear need for quantitative baseline data so
   that conservation problems can be identified. Twenty line transects
   covering a total transect length of 28.8 km were used to survey five
   sites (Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary, Oban Division and Okwangwo
   Division of Cross River National Park, Sankwala Mountains and Mbe
   Mountains) in the westernmost extension of the Cameroon Mountains EBA in
   south-eastern Nigeria. Vegetation measurements were taken to control for
   the potential confounding effect of variation in vegetation density and
   structure on detectability of birds between sites. The 193 bird species
   recorded in Afi, 158 in Sankwala, 124 in Oban, 100 in Mbe and 73 in
   Okwangwo Division included most of the Cameroon highlands restricted
   range species. The results show that the mountains of south-eastern
   Nigeria are important parts of the Cameroon EBA, particularly Afi
   Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary. However these sites are threatened by fire
   and livestock grazing on the hilltops, shifting agriculture on the
   hillsides and lowlands, and logging for timber in some parts, as well as
   wildlife hunting for bushmeat.}},

Abstract = {{Guadeloupe Woodpeckers (Melanerpes herminieri) are the only endemic bird
   species on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. These woodpeckers were
   classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List following a
   population survey in 1994. To reassess the Guadeloupe Woodpecker
   population, we conducted a new survey in 2007, with 21 transects
   distributed across eight habitats known to be used by the woodpeckers.
   Habitats with the highest estimated population densities were seasonal
   evergreen secondary growth forest, followed by swamp forest and
   rainforest. Surveys revealed an estimated population of 8469 pairs in
   2007 compared to 7368 pairs in 1994, a difference that was not
   significant. However, our 2007 survey revealed that Guadeloupe
   Woodpeckers had recolonized the last large patch of available forest on
   Basse-Terre, one of the two main islands in the Guadeloupe archipelago.
   Although our results suggest that the Guadeloupe Woodpecker population
   has remained relatively stable since 1994, deforestation remains a
   serious threat and we recommend that the IUCN Red List status of Near
   Threatened be retained. Management measures that would benefit
   Guadeloupe Woodpeckers include halting deforestation and providing
   financial support to people on private land to plant trees and leave
   dead trees standing. Regular monitoring will be important for
   determining the possible effects of such measures on the Guadeloupe
   Woodpecker population.}},

Abstract = {{Northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) are secondary cavity-nesters
   and their dependence on snags has potential repercussions on forest
   management practices. Descriptive studies exist regarding habitat
   characteristics around saw-whet nest and roost areas, yet few studies
   have examined associations within larger areas or relative to snag
   characteristics (e. g., density). We conducted owl broadcast surveys and
   snag sampling during the spring and summer of 2006 and 2007 in the Lake
   Tahoe Basin of the central Sierra Nevada; we measured additional habitat
   variables from Geographic Information System layers. We modeled
   detection and occupancy probabilities for saw-whets using sampling and
   site covariates at survey sites. In addition, we used stepwise logistic
   regression to compare habitat characteristics at owl use sites and
   nonuse sites at 2 spatial scales. Detection probability was low in 2006
   and decreased throughout the survey period; detection probability was
   slightly higher in 2007 and unaffected by day of survey. Probability of
   occupancy was affected by elevation and dominant tree species in 2007.
   Similarly, stepwise logistic regression indicated saw-whet occurrence
   was negatively correlated with the percentage of area dominated by white
   fir (Abies concolor) at both the macrohabitat (approx. 260 ha) and
   microhabitat (approx. 20 ha) scales and was positively correlated with
   the percentage of area containing open canopy at the microhabitat scale.
   We did not find correlations between saw-whet occurrence and snag
   characteristics. Current restoration projects in areas of the Sierra
   Nevada aim to decrease relative abundance of white fir and the number of
   snags in forest stands. We recommend continued monitoring of saw-whets
   to understand potential effects of these restoration activities. Our
   estimates of saw-whet occupancy and detection probabilities can be used
   by forest managers to determine necessary survey effort for reliable
   results when developing monitoring protocols.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how variation in fire severity (control or no fire; low,
   medium, and high severity fires) and interval (1-2 years vs. 3-6 years
   after fires) affected habitat and avian abundance, species diversity,
   richness, and evenness in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Fire
   severity and interval had significant implications for both habitat and
   avian communities. Species richness within 2 years of fires was on
   average 26\% higher in areas receiving medium and high severity
   treatments than in unburned control units. Species diversity and species
   richness were markedly greater 3-6 years after fires within high
   severity treatments (12 and 44\%, respectively), compared to unburned
   controls. Relative abundance and species evenness did not vary with fire
   severity or time since tire. The short-term effects of low severity
   fires, or high severity fires with short rotation periods (<= 2 years)
   may have limited positive effects on avian communities. Facilitation of
   disturbance regimes including mid to high severity fires, which foster

   An assessment of the potential benefits for forest biodiversity in

Abstract = {{Conifer dominated plantations in central and northern Europe are
   associated with relatively low ecological values, and in some cases, may
   be vulnerable to disturbances caused by anthropogenic climate change.
   This has prompted the consideration of alternative tree species
   compositions for use in production forestry in this region. Here we
   evaluate the likely biodiversity costs and benefits of supplanting
   Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures with polycultures of spruce and
   birch (Betula spp.) in southern Sweden. This polyculture alternative has
   previously been evaluated in terms of economic, recreational, and
   silvicultural benefits. By also assessing the ecological implications we
   fill a gap in our understanding of the range of socio-ecological
   benefits that can be achieved from a single polyculture alternative. We
   project likely broad scale changes to species richness and abundance
   within production stands for five taxonomic groups including ground
   vegetation, tree-living bryophytes, lichens, saproxylic beetles, and
   birds. Our research leads us to three key findings. First, the
   replacement of spruce monocultures with spruce-birch polycultures in the
   managed forest landscapes of southern Sweden can be expected to result
   in an increase in biological diversity for most but not all taxa
   assessed, but it is unlikely to improve conditions for many red-listed
   forest species. Second, modification of other aspects of forest
   management (i.e. rotation length, dead wood and green tree retention,
   thinning regimes) is likely to contribute to further biodiversity gains
   using spruce-birch polycultures than spruce monocultures. Third, the
   paucity of empirical research which directly compares the biodiversity
   of different types of managed production stands, limits the extent to
   which policy relevant conclusions can be extracted from the scientific
   literature. We discuss the wider implications of our findings, which
   indicate that some climate change adaptation strategies, such as
   risk-spreading, can be readily integrated with the economic,
   environmental and social goals of multi-use forestry. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{The influence of changes in habitat structure on the species composition

Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{581-592}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Land use management practices often change habitat structure, which in
   turn influence diversity and the composition of floral and faunal
   assemblages. In the southern Kalahari, southern Africa, heavy grazing
   after above-average rainfall has lead to bush thickening, and widespread
   use of arboricides and/or removal of large trees for firewood has also
   impacted habitat structure. At sites near Kimberley, in South Africa, we
   investigated the effects of these changes on bird species richness and
   which aspects of habitat structure most influenced bird assemblage
   diversity and composition. We also investigated correlations between
   bird life history traits and habitat characteristics using RLQ analysis.
   Bird species richness and abundance were both explained by vertical
   habitat heterogeneity and density of woody species between the heights
   of 0-2 m, with bird species richness also explained by the density of
   woody species at heights above 6 m. Large trees within bush-thickened
   areas dampened the effects of bush thickening on bird assemblages by
   enabling certain species to persist, consistent with the idea that large
   trees are keystone structures. Smaller insectivorous gleaners, ball-and
   cup-nesters, birds with parts of their range extending into arid areas
   and birds with long-wavelength plumage (i.e. red, orange or yellow
   plumage) dominated bush-thickened habitats. Seed-eaters, burrow-and
   ground-nesters, bark-foragers, birds that perch and sally, or perch and
   swoop to the ground, were all negatively associated with bush
   thickening. Cavity-nesters, bark-foragers, hawkers, frugivores, birds
   that perch and sally and species with iridescent plumage were negatively
   affected by the loss of large trees. Of the common species analysed,
   nearly 40\% of species had life history traits tied to large trees; and
   68\% had traits negatively associated with bush thickening and removal
   of large trees together, suggesting that where these changes in habitat
   occur simultaneously, bird diversity will be strongly affected.}},

Title = {{SPACE USE AND HABITAT SELECTION OF MIGRANT AND RESIDENT AMERICAN AVOCETS
   IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY}},
Journal = {{CONDOR}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{511-520}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{San Francisco Bay is a wintering area for shorebirds, including American
   Avocets (Recurvirostra americana). Recently, a new resident population
   of avocets has emerged, presumably because of the development of tidal
   marshes into salt-evaporation ponds. In habitat restoration now
   underway, as many as 90\% of salt ponds will be restored to tidal marsh.
   However, it is unknown if wintering and resident avocets coexist and if
   their requirements for space and habitat differ, necessitating different
   management for their populations to be maintained during restoration. We
   captured and radio-marked wintering avocets at a salt pond and a tidal
   flat to determine their population status (migrant or resident) and
   examine their space use and habitat selection. Of the radio-marked
   avocets, 79\% were migrants and 21\% were residents. At the salt pond,
   residents' fidelity to their location of capture was higher, and
   residents moved less than did migrants from the same site. Conversely,
   on the tidal flat, fidelity of residents to their site of capture was
   lower, and residents' home ranges were larger than those of migrants
   from the same site. Habitat selection of migrants and residents differed
   little; however, capture site influenced habitat selection far more than
   the birds' status as migrants or residents. Our study suggests that
   individual avocets have high site fidelity while wintering in San
   Francisco Bay, although the avocet as a species is plastic in its space
   use and habitat selection. This plasticity may allow wintering migrant
   and resident avocets to adapt to habitat change in San Francisco Bay.}},

Title = {{Effects of farm and landscape management on bird and butterfly
   conservation in western Honduras}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Previous research has indicated that a substantial portion of native
   flora and fauna may persist in agricultural mosaics in the Neotropics.
   However, understanding the relative importance of different habitat
   factors and management practices at different scales for sustaining this
   biodiversity has proven somewhat elusive. In addition, most such
   research has taken place in only a few fairly well-studied landscapes,
   thus limiting our ability to infer broader patterns that might be
   transferred to unstudied locales. This study expands the geographic
   breadth of prior research by evaluating bird and butterfly assemblages
   in an agricultural landscape in the Rio Copan watershed of western
   Honduras. The study also provides a systematic assessment of the
   relative influence of categorical and continuous habitat variables
   across a range of scales likely to be significant for birds and
   butterflies. Overall, we recorded 145 tree species, 139 bird species,
   and 119 butterfly species. Birds and butterflies displayed contrasting
   responses to land cover: birds were most strongly associated with dense
   vegetation in broadleaf forests, forest fallows, shade-grown coffee
   farms, and live fences, while butterflies were most abundant in live
   fences, pastures, and riparian forests. Bird assemblages were heavily
   skewed toward common and non-forest-dependent species, likely due to the
   young age and high disturbance level of forest plots. In contrast,
   butterfly assemblages contained a substantial proportion of
   forest-dependent species, which were observed in forests as well as
   pastures and live fences. Contrary to expectations, categorical land
   cover descriptors were more effective at explaining faunal assemblage
   patterns than continuous habitat descriptors related to vegetation and
   landscape context. In addition, plot scale (25-100 m) habitat features
   had a greater influence on faunal assemblages than did neighborhood
   scale (200-3000 m) landscape composition or structure, although
   differences in management intensity at the scale of the entire watershed
   (5-20 km) also exerted a strong influence on conservation outcomes.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{260}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Species distributions are determined by complex interplays between
   multi-scale factors. Conservation management, however, often occurs at a
   single scale of the site level. This is true for bird communities of
   restored savannas and mixed woodlands in the central U.S. In this
   region, many historic open-canopy oak savanna habitats have become
   closed canopy mixed woodlands due to loss of landscape-scale disturbance
   from fire and grazing. Site-level management efforts return some mixed
   woodland habitats back to savanna through fire and mechanical thinning.
   Savanna and woodland historically formed complex mosaic landscapes at
   the ecotone between prairies and Eastern deciduous forests and now exist
   within landscapes that vary in amount of open (e.g., perennial grassland
   and row crop agriculture) and woodland habitat. To understand the
   interplay between site and landscape level factors in savanna
   restoration, we sampled the breeding bird community in four combinations
   of site and landscape: restored savanna in open landscapes, restored
   savanna in woodland landscapes, and closed canopy woodland in both
   landscapes. We found that the outcome of site-level savanna restoration
   depended on the surrounding landscape. Compared to other treatment
   types, restored savannas in open landscapes supported a distinctive bird
   community characterized by high species richness, bird abundance, and
   percent of ground feeders, shrub nesters. and edge species. Both savanna
   and woodland sites in the open landscape had a higher percent of species
   of conservation concern, while at both site and landscape levels,
   woodland was associated with a higher percent of area sensitive species
   and habitat specialists. Our results suggest savanna restoration efforts
   should focus on sites that exist either in open country or on edges
   where closed canopy forest meets open country. This strategy would
   combine site and landscape level benefits of savanna restoration for
   avian diversity, while also preserving the conservation benefits of
   large tracts of intact forest. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   habitat}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{114}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Conservation of threatened and endangered species requires maintenance
   of critical habitat. The red-cockaded woodpecker Picoides borealis (RCN)
   is a threatened bird species, endemic to the mixed conifer forests of
   the southeastern United States. RCW nests and forages preferentially in
   mature longleaf pine Pin us palustris, but also uses mature loblolly
   pine Pinus taeda and shortleaf pine Pinus echinata forests. In the last
   century, the extent of mature pine forests has been greatly reduced by
   logging. The RCW, in contrast to other woodpeckers, excavates nest
   cavities in living trees and senescence symptoms (year round leaf
   chlorosis and leaf mortality) have been observed in mature pine stands
   across the southeast. Widespread mortality of the mature pine forests
   would threaten the long-term survival of the RCW. We used airborne
   hyperspectral data across a portion of Ft. Benning Military
   Installation, Georgia, U.S.A., to determine if senescent trees can be
   identified and mapped and assess the likely persistence of mature pines
   in the RCW habitat. Univariate analysis of variance showed good
   separation between asymptomatic, senesced and dead physiological
   conditions with asymptomatic trees having significantly higher
   reflectance for all bands in the wavelength range between 0.719 and
   1.1676 mu m, senescent trees having significantly lower reflectance for
   bands in the range between 1.1927 and 1.3122 mu m, and dead trees having
   significantly higher reflectance for bands in the range between 1.8151
   and 1.9471 mu m. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models
   achieved correct classification rates and kappa statistics above 70\%.
   CART models selected information from wavelength regions similar to
   those identified from the ANOVA, which likely explains their
   performance. Our aggregated CART model of tree senescence estimated that
   141.4 ha (3\%) of the study area is affected. RCW nests occurred in
   areas with significantly higher tree cover, and trees within foraging
   and home ranges did not have significantly more senescence than areas
   without RCW. These results indicate that although tree senescence is
   widespread, mortality is yet to significantly affect RCW habitat.
   Results and analysis of critical habitat similar to those exemplified in
   this study can extend our knowledge about the stressors of these
   important and imperiled components of biodiversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Broom matorrals are subjected to extensive burning in the Pyrenees to
   improve grazing value, despite being a habitat of conservation interest
   in Europe. Our aim here is to evaluate the impact of such management
   practices over the long term, and of fire severity over the short term,
   on avifauna. Bird-habitat stations were distributed in broom shrublands
   from a few months to 51 years after fire, at 1400-2100 m a.s.l. Overall,
   shrub cover was the main habitat variable affecting the bird community
   composition. The abundance trends of bird species for half a century
   after fire were varied, but population recovery seemed slower
   (especially in the Dartford warbler Sylvia undata) than it had been
   reported at a lower altitude. Three species of European conservation
   concern (Alauda arvensis, Lullula arborea and Lanius collurio) showed
   abundance peaks at 10-19 years after fire. This time interval showed the
   highest species richness, abundance and conservation value, whereas
   shrub cover continued to increase afterwards. The bird assemblage tended
   to impoverish with increasing fire severity in the first year after a
   fire. Our results emphasize: (1) the slow recovery of bird community of
   burnt mountain shrublands; (2) the need for long-term biodiversity
   assessments to help improve planning of fire intervals at different
   altitudes; (3) the relevance of reducing fire severity due to its impact
   on fauna.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate the impact of windthrow and two types of
   its management on the bird community of a managed, pine-dominated forest
   (NE Poland), where a windstorm event occurred in 2002. In 2007, the bird
   species composition was assessed using the point count method in three
   types of habitat: windthrow left undisturbed for natural regeneration,
   managed windthrow (all fallen trees removed), and intact forest
   (undisturbed by the windstorm, used as the control). In total, 2,365
   individual birds of 70 species were recorded in the three analyzed
   habitats. The mean number of individuals per point and species per point
   was significantly higher in the natural windthrow than in the two other
   habitats. The diversity of the bird community was higher in the natural
   and managed windthrow, as compared to the control. The bird community of
   the control was significantly more similar to that of the natural
   windthrow than to the one in the managed windthrow. These results lead
   to a conclusion that the bird community was affected more by the
   clearing and artificial replanting following the windthrow than by the
   windthrow itself.}},

Title = {{Experimental Test of Postfire Management in Pine Forests: Impact of
   Salvage Logging versus Partial Cutting and Nonintervention on
   Bird-Species Assemblages}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{There is an intense debate about the effects of postfire salvage logging
   versus nonintervention policies on regeneration of forest communities,
   but scant information from experimental studies is available. We
   manipulated a burned forest area on a Mediterranean mountain to
   experimentally analyze the effect of salvage logging on bird-species
   abundance, diversity, and assemblage composition. We used a randomized
   block design with three plots of approximately 25 ha each, established
   along an elevational gradient in a recently burned area in Sierra Nevada
   Natural and National Park (southeastern Spain). Three replicates of
   three treatments differing in postfire burned wood management were
   established per plot: salvage logging, nonintervention, and an
   intermediate degree of intervention (felling and lopping most of the
   trees but leaving all the biomass). Starting 1 year after the fire, we
   used point sampling to monitor bird abundance in each treatment for 2
   consecutive years during the breeding and winter seasons (720 censuses
   total). Postfire burned-wood management altered species assemblages.
   Salvage logged areas had species typical of open-and early-successional
   habitats. Bird species that inhabit forests were still present in the
   unsalvaged treatments even though trees were burned, but were almost
   absent in salvage-logged areas. Indeed, the main dispersers of mid-and
   late-successional shrubs and trees, such as thrushes (Turdus spp.) and
   the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius) were almost restricted to
   unsalvaged treatments. Salvage logging might thus hamper the natural
   regeneration of the forest through its impact on assemblages of bird
   species. Moreover, salvage logging reduced species abundance by 50\% and
   richness by 40\%, approximately. The highest diversity at the landscape
   level (gamma diversity) resulted from a combination of all treatments.
   Salvage logging may be positive for bird conservation if combined in a
   mosaic with other, less-aggressive postfire management, but stand-wide
   management with harvest operations has undesirable conservation effects.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of Predator Removal for Enhancing Bird Populations}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{820-829}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Predation pressure on vulnerable bird species has made predator control
   an important issue for international nature conservation. Predator
   removal by culling or translocation is controversial, expensive, and
   time-consuming, and results are often temporary. Thus, it is important
   to assess its effectiveness from all available evidence. We used
   explicit systematic review methodology to determine the impact of
   predator removal on four measurable responses in birds: breeding
   performance (hatching success and fledging success) and population size
   (breeding and postbreeding). We used meta-analysis to summarize results
   from 83 predator removal studies from six continents. We also
   investigated whether characteristics of the prey, predator species,
   location, and study methodology explained heterogeneity in effect sizes.
   Removing predators increased hatching success, fledging success, and
   breeding populations. Removing all predator species achieved a
   significantly larger increase in breeding population than removing only
   a subset. Postbreeding population size was not improved on islands, or
   overall, but did increase on mainlands. Heterogeneity in effect sizes
   for the four population parameters was not explained by whether
   predators were native or introduced; prey were declining, migratory, or
   game species; or by the study methodology. Effect sizes for fledging
   success were smaller for ground-nesting birds than those that nest
   elsewhere, but the difference was not significant. We conclude that
   current evidence indicates that predator removal is an effective
   strategy for the conservation of vulnerable bird populations.
   Nevertheless, the ethical and practical problems associated with
   predator removal may lead managers to favor alternative, nonlethal
   solutions. Research is needed to provide and synthesize data to
   determine whether these are effective management practices for future
   policies on bird conservation.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a frequent event in Mediterranean ecosystems, yet the effects on
   animal diversity are poorly understood. In this paper, the short-term
   effects of a severe fire on the tenebrionid beetles in a planted
   pinewood in Central Italy are investigated in comparison with those
   recorded in other animal communities, namely collembolans, isopods and
   birds. The use of statistical tests to compare values of dominance,
   diversity and equitability (measured with various indexes), between
   burned and unburned habitats, as well as the use of two major
   niche-based species abundance models (the geometric series and the
   MacArthur broken stick model), revealed a strong decrease in diversity
   and evenness in all investigated animal groups, including birds, for
   which previous research suggested minor effects. In particular,
   tenebrionids are proved to be particularly indicative of habitat
   transformations determined by fire, showing important changes in
   community structure, from that characteristic of woodlands to that of
   open habitats. Because most of the original vegetation of Mediterranean
   woodlands has been removed by the continued influence of man, mature
   pinewoods, even if artificial, represent an important surrogate habitat
   for most species of tenebrionids (and likely other animals of
   conservation concern, such as bird species), and their preservation from
   catastrophic fires is of paramount importance.}},

Abstract = {{To accurately measure the number of species in a biological community, a
   complete inventory should be performed, which is generally unfeasible;
   hopefully, estimators of species richness can help. Our main objectives
   were (i) to assess the performance of nonparametric estimators of plant
   species richness with real data from a small set of meadows located in
   the Basque campia (northern Spain), and (ii) to apply the best estimator
   to a larger dataset to test the effects on plant species richness caused
   by environmental conditions and human practices. Two non-asymptotic and
   seven asymptotic accumulation functions were fitted to a randomized
   sample-based rarefaction curve computed with data from three well
   sampled meadows, and information theoretic methods were used to select
   the best fitting model; this was the Morgan-Mercer-Flodin, and its
   asymptote was taken as our best guess of true richness. Then, five
   nonparametric estimators were computed: ICE, Chao 2, Jackknife 1 and 2,
   and Bootstrap; MMRuns and MMMeans were also assessed. According to the
   criteria set for our performance assessment (i.e., bias, precision, and
   accuracy), the best estimator was Jackknife 1. Finally, Jackknife 1 was
   applied to assess the effects of terrain slope and soil parent material,
   and also fertilization, grazing, and mowing, on plant species richness
   from a larger dataset (20 meadows). Results suggested that grass cutting
   was causing a loss of richness close to 30\%, as compared to unmowed
   meadows. It is concluded that the use of nonparametric estimators of
   species richness can improve the evaluation of biodiversity responses to
   human management practices.}},

Abstract = {{Lowland riparian vegetation in the southwestern United States is
   critically important for maintaining a high richness and density of
   breeding birds. Further investigation is needed within riparian
   corridors, however, to evaluate the relative importance of vegetation
   type and hydrologic regime for avian density and nest survival as
   targets for regional conservation or restoration efforts. We estimated
   the densities of 40 bird species and for species grouped on the basis of
   nest height and dependence on surface water in gallery cottonwood-willow
   (Populus spp.-Salix spp.) forests, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) shrub lands,
   and terrace vegetation types along a gradient in the hydrologic regime
   of the San Pedro River, Arizona, USA. We also assessed nest survival for
   shrub-nesting insectivores and herbivores. Canopy-nesting birds as a
   group and 14 individual bird species reached their greatest densities in
   cottonwood forests regardless of the hydrologic regime. Water-dependent
   birds as a group reached their highest density in both intermittent-and
   perennial-flow cottonwood stands, but certain species occurred almost
   exclusively in perennial-flow sites. Two shrub-nesting species and the
   brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were most abundant in saltcedar
   shrub lands, and the brown-headed cowbird was most abundant in saltcedar
   stands with intermittent flows. Mesquite (Prosopis spp.) and big sacaton
   (Sporobolus wrightii) grassland each maintained the highest densities of
   certain species within >= 1 hydrologic regime. Shrub-nesting
   insectivores had the greatest nest survival in cottonwood, including
   Arizona Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii arizonae), and also had lower
   proportions of nests parasitized and preyed upon, although 95\%
   confidence intervals among vegetation types overlapped. Nest survival
   for both shrub-nesting insectivores and herbivores was lowest in
   intermittent-flow saltcedar, although, again, confidence intervals
   overlapped. Nest survival was lower in parasitized than nonparasitized
   nests in mesquite and across vegetation types for Arizona Bell's vireo
   and in cottonwood for Abert's towhee (Pipilo aberti). Riparian
   management that maintains heterogeneous riparian vegetation types,
   including floodplain vegetation comprising cottonwood-willow gallery
   riparian forests with some stretches of perennial flow, are important
   for maintaining the high diversity and abundance of breeding birds on
   the San Pedro River and probably across the region. Cottonwood stands
   also appear to maintain highest nest survival for some shrub-nesting
   birds.}},

Abstract = {{Gray fox ecology is poorly understood within the longleaf pine
   ecosystem, despite the importance of these landscapes to conservation
   and biological diversity. During 2002-2006, we radio-monitored 42 gray
   foxes and estimated space use, habitat selection and survival within a
   managed longleaf pine forest. Sizes of home ranges and core areas were
   greater in winter than during other seasons, but were similar between
   males and females. Industrial agriculture field and residential areas
   were important. to foxes when selecting home ranges, but hardwood forest
   stands were selected when establishing core areas and were consistently
   used more than other habitats. Despite being captured within the
   longleaf pine community, most foxes either consistently were found
   outside of this system in other habitats, or used habitats along the
   periphery of the longleaf pine system. Mean annual survival was 0.61,
   and human-induced factors (vehicle collisions and trapping) accounted
   for most (63\%) fox mortalities. Longleaf pine forests did not appear to
   be important to gray foxes in this study, which is significant because
   natural ecosystems are often important for predator species. We provide
   evidence that sources of gray fox mortality are influenced by habitat
   selection patterns.}},

Title = {{A Multi-Scale Assessment of Avian Diversity Following Stream Rewatering,
   Owens River Gorge, California}},
Journal = {{NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{124-137}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We employed a multi-scale approach to examine the evolving spatial
   patterns of avian diversity following rewatering (1991-1999) of the
   Owens River Gorge in eastern California. We based our analysis on three
   independent data sets representing 18 canyon locations (4 reference and
   14 rewatered) consisting of bird counts, measures of landscape variation
   (canyon dimensions), and vegetation structure and composition (foliage
   height diversity, total vegetation volume, and plant species diversity).
   We analyzed our data by grouping sites according to bird diversity and
   environmental factors using Sorenson's similarity index and cluster
   analysis and by employing correlation (Spearman rank) and regression
   (multiple and backward stepwise) procedures to determine the relative
   importance of environmental factors on avian diversity at different
   spatial scales. Our results revealed: (1) that valley bottom width
   determines the extent of riparian vegetation (rs = .73, P < 0.01) and,
   indirectly, bird species diversity (rs = .52, P < 0.05) at the landscape
   scale; and (2) that avian diversity at the habitat scale is most
   strongly correlated with plant species diversity (rs = .57, P < 0.05).
   These results indicate avian diversity is responding to habitat
   restoration resulting from the rewatering of the Owens River Gorge but
   is spatially constrained by canyon dimensions that limit the area of
   riparian habitat and, indirectly, plant species diversity. We suggest
   future evaluations of stream restoration and its role on animal
   communities consider the merits of a multi-scale analysis.}},

Title = {{Avian Community Responses to Mechanical Thinning of a Pinyon-Juniper
   Woodland: Specialist Sensitivity to Tree Reduction}},
Journal = {{NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Natural area managers in regions of the semi-arid west, particularly on
   the Colorado Plateau. are presently dealing with expanding pinyon (Pious
   spp. Engelm.) - juniper (Juniperus spp. Engelm.) woodlands on
   rangelands. Increased equipment costs associated with `chaining'. and
   dangers associated with prescribed fires, have resulted in more
   instances where mechanical thinning of woodlands is being used. Our 2005
   to 2006 study within Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. Utah.
   examined responses of breeding birds to the mechanical reduction of
   pinyon-juniper woodlands within a randomized 4-block design that
   incorporated 11 control and nine treatment bird count stations. We
   surveyed birds within 3.1-ha bird-count stations (n = 20) prior to, and
   following. pinyon-juniper mechanical reduction treatments. Thinning in
   April 2006 removed a mean of 92\% (+ 6.4\% SE) of live trees from
   treatment blocks. The avian guild most greatly influenced by mechanical
   thinning included pinyon-juniper obligate species. Species eliminated
   following mechanical thinning were Gray Vireo (Vireo vicinior) and
   Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater). while Chipping Sparrow (Spizella
   passerine) numbers were significantly reduced. Birds in the
   shrub-nesting guild, including the sagebrush specialist Brewer's Sparrow
   (Spizella breweri), and habitat generalists such as the Bushtit
   (Psaltriparius minimus). increased in relative abundance following
   treatment. We conclude that mechanical thinning within the Intermountain
   West has the potential for natural area managers to design treatments
   that can influence numbers of both pinyon-juniper and sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) steppe avian species.}},

Abstract = {{During winter 1996-1997 and summer 1997, we surveyed birds at 26 study
   sites in desert grasslands of Arizona and New Mexico to determine
   tolerance of birds to variability in plant composition and structure.
   The relationship between bird abundance and vegetative characteristics
   might be an important consideration in the development of management and
   restoration plans. Of the 49 bird species we observed, we examined and
   16 species in detail for winter and summer seasons, respectively. A
   noticeable shift in species composition occurred between 3\% and 10\%
   woody plant cover. During winter Chestnut-collared Longspurs (Calcarins
   ornatus) and Horned Link's (Ercmophila alpestris) showed significant
   positive relationships with grass cover and negative relationships with
   woody plant cover, occurring in greatest numbers where woody cover was
   <1\%. The richness of sparrow species during winter was highest among
   sites with 6\% to 15\% woody plant cover. In addition to showing
   significant positive relationships with woody cover, Vesper Sparrows
   (Pooecetes gramineas), Black-throated Sparrows (Amphispiza bilineata),
   Brewer's Sparrows (Spirella breweri), and Chipping Sparrows (S.
   passerina) showed significant positive relationships with shrub species
   richness. Our results showed that reductions of woody plant cover below
   3\% in combination with the presence of native grasses could
   substantially enhance the presence of several bird species. Maintenance
   of woody cover between 6\% rind 15\% could increase use by a suite of
   other species, especially wintering sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{Sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) communities are a unique component
   of grassland bird habitat in eastern New Mexico and have been impacted
   by human activities for decades. These communities are frequently
   managed with livestock grazing and herbicide application for shrub
   control, strategies that potentially can be used to restore the
   historical shrub-grass composition of this plant community. During
   spring migration and the breeding seasons of 2004 and 2005, we compared
   density and community structure of grassland bird species among four
   combinations of tebuthiuron application and grazing treatments that were
   being evaluated for restoration of shinnery oak communities. We
   performed biweekly point transects on sixteen 65-ha study plots in these
   communities. Density of all avian species combined did not differ
   between grazed and ungrazed plots. Tebuthiuron-treated plots had a 40\%
   higher average density for combined species than untreated plots. There
   was a 41\% higher average density of all species during spring 2005 than
   2004, but density was similar during the breeding season of both years.
   These trends were predominantly influenced by densities of migratory
   Cassin's Sparrow (Aimophila cassinii), which were greater in
   tebuthiuron-treated plots in both years. Densities of resident
   Meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) exhibited little response to tebuthiuron or
   grazing treatments. Avian species richness, evenness, and diversity were
   only minimally affected by the tebuthiuron and grazing treatments. This
   study occurred over a period of highly variable precipitation, so future
   assessments, spanning longer wet-dry cycles and maturing plant
   communities, may be necessary to completely determine avian response to
   these restoration efforts.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{I used a randomized, replicated, controlled study design to test the
   hypothesis that nest-site availability limits breeding densities of
   secondary cavity nesting species in even-age southern pine (Pinus spp.)
   forests. Breeding densities of secondary cavity nesters increased
   significantly on treated plots after nest boxes were introduced. Total
   number of nesting attempts also increased several fold post-treatment.
   These data indicate nest-site availability was a limiting factor for
   breeding densities of secondary cavity nesting species. The response of
   individual species to nest boxes ranged from moderately high (Great
   Crested Flycatcher {[}Myiarchus crinitus]), to low (Tufted Titmouse
   {[}Baeolophus bicolor], Eastern Bluebird {[}Sialia sialis]) to no
   response (Carolina Wren {[}Thryothorus ludovicianus]). At least three
   factors accounted for interspecific differences in this study: different
   levels of reliance on cavities excavated in snags, different body sizes,
   and differences in local population densities. The large number of
   unoccupied nest boxes (only 9\% were used for nesting) suggests
   secondary cavity nesters were not limited solely by cavity availability
   but also by habitat quality. Prescribed burning appeared to facilitate
   discovery and use of nest boxes by birds in this study, consistent with
   the hypothesis that nest-site limitation is mitigated by habitat
   structure. Received 4 September 2007. Accepted 3 September 2009.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated home-range size and site tenacity of Le Conte's Sparrows
   (Ammodramus lecontii) during winter 2002-2003 at Brazoria National
   Wildlife Refuge, Texas. Twenty-six wintering Le Conte's Sparrows were
   radiomarked in 1- and 2-year post-burn units, and monitored for similar
   to 10 days. Additionally, 1-ha plots on each 1-, 2- and 3-year (n = 15)
   post-burn units were flush-netted once monthly. Telemetry results
   indicated Le Conte's Sparrows were sedentary during winter with a 50\%
   probability mean home-range of 2.41 ha (72\% < 1 ha) and a 95\%
   probability mean home range of 10.31 ha (44\% < 1 ha and 55\% < 1.5 ha).
   Home-range size did not differ between post-burn year 1 and 2 (P =

   flush-netting (P < 0.001) with estimated capture probability of 0.462

Abstract = {{Woodpeckers (family Picidae) merit specific monitoring and management
   efforts, both as keystone/facilitator species and as indicators of
   forest condition. Recent studies indicated that species richness of
   woodpeckers was correlated with richness of all forest birds, thus
   suggesting potential exists for management practices that can address
   needs of woodpeckers in particular and other forest birds in general. We
   used data from a long-term study (1995-2008) from forest sites in the
   interior of British Columbia to evaluate how abundances of seven
   woodpecker species varied with habitat variables previously identified
   as associated with forest bird richness. We found that tree species
   richness had either a neutral or positive effect on the abundance of all
   woodpecker species, whereas abundances of most woodpecker species tended
   to be lower in stands with high densities of lodgepole pine. Abundances
   of most woodpecker species were positively correlated with density of
   beetle-killed pines. Relative to control sites, higher densities of most
   woodpecker species were found at harvested sites where most trembling
   aspen and large Douglas-fir trees had been retained. Therefore,
   management strategies that favour a mixture of tree species, with
   particular attention to retention of aspen, should safeguard populations
   of most woodpecker species. Abundances of individual woodpecker species
   were weakly but positively inter-correlated before the beetle outbreak,
   and less so during and post-outbreak. It thus appears that no strong
   trade-offs exist among woodpecker species. These results, combined with
   previously identified positive correlations between woodpecker and
   forest bird richness, indicate woodpeckers can be managed as a suite for
   the purpose of managing avian biodiversity as a whole. Crown Copyright

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We used microsatellites to assess ongoing captive breeding and
   reintroduction programs of the lesser kestrel. The extent of genetic
   variation within the captive populations analysed did not differ
   significantly from that reported in wild populations. Thus, the
   application of widely recommended management practices, such as the
   registration of crosses between individuals in proper stud books and the
   introduction of new individuals into the genetic pools, has proven
   satisfactory to maintain high levels of genetic variation. The high
   rates of hatching failure occasionally documented in captivity can
   therefore not be attributed to depressed genetic variation. Even though
   genetic diversity in reintroduced populations did not differ
   significantly when compared to wild populations either, average observed
   heterozygosities and inbreeding coefficients were significantly lower
   and higher, respectively, when compared to the captive demes where
   released birds came. Monitoring of reproductive parameters during
   single-pairing breeding and paternity inference within colonial
   facilities revealed large variations in breeding success between
   reproductive adults. The relative number of breeding pairs that
   contributed to a large part of captive-born birds (50-56\%) was similar
   in both cases (28.6 and 26.9\%, respectively). Thus, the chances for
   polygyny (rarely in this study), extra- pair paternity (not found in
   this study) and/or social stimulation of breeding parameters do not seem
   to greatly affect the genetically effective population size.
   Independently of breeding strategies, the release of unrelated
   fledglings into the same area and the promotion of immigration should be
   mandatory to counteract founder effects and avoid inbreeding in
   reintroduced populations of lesser kestrels.}},

Abstract = {{Complex land use and fuels management histories have resulted in
   significant changes in composition, structure, and function of
   southwestern forests and subsequent changes in the extent and quality of
   wildlife habitats. We evaluated how several currently used fuel
   reduction treatments (e.g., mechanical thinning and prescribed fire
   alone and in combination) affect nest attributes, nest density, nest
   tree occupancy, and home range size of Western Bluebirds (Sialia
   mexicana) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-dominated forests of
   northern Arizona. Nest attributes, such as number of eggs or nestlings,
   varied among treatments, but did not differ statistically. Western
   Bluebird nest density was significantly influenced by treatment, with
   densities higher in treated areas, even though snag density was lower in
   treated areas than in control areas. The average (+/-SE) area of the
   50\% contour, across all treatment units, was 0.42 +/- 0.07 ha, and the
   average area of the 90\% contour was 2.36 +/- 0.30 ha. Home range sizes
   for both probability contours evaluated were 1.5 times larger in the
   thin-only treatments than in the control units. Conversely, home range
   area in thin-and-burn treatments was approximately 30\% smaller than in
   control units. The largest home ranges occurred in the burn-only
   treatments. Our results suggest that forest treatments, such as thinning
   and prescribed fire are, in general, beneficial to Western Bluebirds,
   but that low snag retention may be problematic in areas receiving
   prescribed fire as part of their treatment action. FOR. SCI.

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{259}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{The contiguous forest landscapes of the Brigalow Belt Bioregion in
   Australia's subtropics, known as `the western hardwood forests' are
   thought to be important for biodiversity conservation through the
   provision of continuous habitat features in an otherwise extensively
   cleared region. However, these forests have a long management history,
   as they are also important for timber production and stock grazing.
   Knowledge of the effect of these and other disturbances on the
   distribution and abundance of key structural or habitat features are
   limited and forest management activities thus continue uninformed. To
   address this knowledge gap, we investigated the effects of prescribed
   and non-prescribed disturbances on the distribution and abundance of six
   key habitat features (live and dead trees with hollows, large mature
   live trees, shrub abundance, downed coarse woody debris and litter
   cover) at 120 sites located in spotted gum Corymbia citriodora dominant
   forests within the western hardwoods.
   Logged stands had a lower mean abundance of live trees with hollows (2.5
   +/- 0.6 ha(-1)) than unlogged stands (6.2 +/- 0.8 ha(-1)). This is below
   current timber harvesting prescriptions which outline the retention of 6
   live trees with hollows ha(-1). Since only 13.5\% of western hardwood
   forest under state forest tenure remains unlogged, live trees with
   hollows are currently limited throughout the majority of the western
   hardwood forests. Recent wildfire in the region also meant reduced
   numbers of live trees with hollows. Logging affected the abundance of
   large, live trees, with highest densities occurring in the less
   intensively logged stands. Given the close relationship between
   increased tree diameter and hollow occurrence across a number of tree
   species, the small area of unlogged forest remaining in the region
   suggests that the pool of trees that may eventually form hollows may
   also be limited. The density of dead trees with hollows was strongly
   reduced by fire; by both low-frequency but high-intensity fires
   (wildfire) and by high-frequency but low-intensity burns associated with
   stock grazing management. Increased grazing was also associated with
   decreased abundance of shrubs and less downed coarse woody debris. Other
   than decreasing with increased logging intensity, litter cover did not
   appear to be influenced by other disturbance regimes, at least not by
   the long term correlational approach of our investigation. Overall, our
   results suggest that although forest management in the western hardwood
   forests could currently be described as low-intensity, it is extensive
   and impacts are discernible and cumulative. We highlight the need for a
   landscape approach to be taken in managing the various land uses for
   both production and biodiversity within the contiguous western hardwood
   forests. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The golden-headed lion tamarin Leontopithecus chrysomelas occurs in the
   Atlantic forest of southern Bahia, Brazil, where shade-cocoa
   agroforestry (known as cabruca) predominates. The economic decline of
   the cocoa industry has caused many landowners to convert cabruca into
   cattle pasture or diversify their plantations with other crops. These
   and prior anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat fragmentation are
   threatening lion tamarin persistence. For some lion tamarin groups,
   cabruca comprises a large part of their home range. Considering these
   factors, the maintenance of the biological diversity in cabruca
   favorable to golden-headed lion tamarins is of considerable interest to
   their long-term survival. Here we identify plant species that provide
   food and sleeping sites for the lion tamarins and examine their
   occurrence in cabruca plantations, in order to investigate alternatives
   for conservation management practices that benefit both lion tamarins
   and cabruca. We determined the total number of trees and the frequency
   of individuals and species used for food and sleeping sites by lion
   tamarins in Una Biological Reserve, Bahia, from 1998 to 2006. We used
   this information to compare the richness and frequency of use across
   habitats (cabruca, mature and secondary) and to create a ranking index
   considering various components of a tree species' utility to the lion
   tamarins. Lion tamarins used 155 tree species, 93 for food and 93 for
   sleeping sites. Fifty-five species were ranked as `Extremely Valuable,'
   eight as `Valuable' and 92 as `Of Interest.' Of 48 families, Myrtaceae
   and Sapotaceae were used the most. Cabruca contained fewer individual
   trees used by lion tamarins, but the highest frequency of use per tree
   compared with other habitats, indicating the large influence of single
   trees in these plantations. Using the key tree species identified in our
   study in the management of cabruca would be of considerable benefit to
   the long-term survival of lion tamarins.}},

   within each discrete habitat patch within each square. The effect of
   Entry Level Stewardship on species density was then analysed using GLMs.
   Results Boundaries managed under Entry Level Stewardship appeared to
   attract higher densities of Blue Tits, Dunnocks, Common Whitethroats and
   Yellowhammers. Margins managed under the scheme also had higher
   densities of Yellowhammers.
   Conclusions Existing boundary habitat management under Entry Level
   Stewardship may provide a mechanism for increasing the populations of
   some farmland bird species. Boundary management options should continue
   to be promoted, although rebalancing the scheme more towards in-field
   options is likely to be more widely beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a key ecological force in pine forests worldwide, and faunal
   responses to this disturbance have been a major topic of ecology, yet
   little is known for oceanic island environments. Using line transects we
   surveyed the bird community of a natural Pinus canariensis forest burned
   in the summer of 2007 on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Our goal was
   to identify important environmental variables and the thresholds that
   influenced the pattern of bird abundance at the community, foraging
   guild, and species-specific level. Models were constructed by means of
   regression trees and cross validation applying the 1-SE rule. Mixed
   results were observed and only 2 species were clearly affected by fire
   severity. Overall, total bird abundance, total species richness, and
   total bird diversity were positively influenced by low, very low, and
   moderate canopy fire severity, respectively, and the presence of either
   Erica or Myrica shrubs. Consequently, high canopy fire severity had an
   overall negative effect on bird community characteristics. Abundance of
   Myrica shrubs affected positively general ground foragers such as common
   blackbird (Turdus merula cabrerae) and Canary Islands chiffchaff
   (Phylloscopus canariensis), a canopy forager. The number of thin trees
   was important for canopy foragers such as goldcrest (Regulus regulus
   teneriffae) and African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae teneriffae), but
   also for a bark forager, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major
   canariensis). European robin (Erithacus rubecula superbus) and the
   ubiquitous endemic blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea teydea) were
   influenced by low and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively. We
   recommend that land managers incorporate these results into future
   post-fire management plans. Priority post-fire actions should be
   directed toward the protection and conservation of the endemic blue
   chaffinch, a species of conservation concern on the nearby island of
   Gran Canaria.}},

Abstract = {{The principal ecosystem driver in arid Australia is unpredictable
   rainfall, but it is hypothesised that fire also plays an important role
   in determining the distribution of animals. We investigated the effect
   of fire on birds in mulga (Acacia aneura) woodland in the central
   Australian arid zone. The study was conducted at Uluru-Kata Tjuta
   National Park using 63 sites classified into one of three
   time-since-fire classes: burnt 2002; burnt 1976; and long-unburnt. Birds
   were sampled in the winter and spring of 2005 and 2006 and vegetation
   structure was measured at all sites. Vegetation structure varied with
   time-since-fire. The burnt 2002 treatment was an early seral stage of
   mulga woodland and effectively a grassland. The burnt 1976 and
   long-unburnt treatments were both woodland, but the long-unburnt
   treatment had greater canopy cover and height. The bird community in the
   burnt 2002 treatment was characterised by granivores, whereas that in
   the burnt 1976 and long-unburnt treatments was characterised by foliar
   insectivores. All species showed monotonic responses to time-since-fire
   (i.e. none were at significantly highest density in the burnt 1976
   treatment). Fire in mulga woodland changed the vegetation structure and
   consequently also changed the composition of the bird communities.}},

Abstract = {{Two new Peruvian species of Axinaea (Melastomataceae) are described.
   Axinaea francisco-cabiesii and Axinaea reginae are small trees, endemic
   to the cloud forest zone in the northern Andean region of Peru. The
   border region of Peru and Ecuador is one of the Earth's most
   biologically diverse areas. The Huancabamba depression of the central
   Andean Cordillera allows for dispersal of flora and fauna between the
   Amazon Basin and the Pacific lowlands. Additionally, the region is
   characterized by a fast transition between the humid mountain forests of
   the northern Andes and the dry, deciduous forests of the northern
   Peruvian lowlands, making it a hotspot for endemic species. Field
   observations indicate that both new Axinaea species have small
   population sizes, occurring in a very restricted habitat. Axinaea flava
   was described only a few years ago from the cloud forest - paramo
   transition zone in southernmost Ecuador between 3400 and 3800 m a.s.l.
   This small tree is the only yellow-flowered species of the genus. The
   original assessment counted about 100 individuals. In the last decade,
   livestock grazing and widespread burning have intensified in the region,
   and a new assessment yielded only 10 individuals, four of which were
   damaged by fire. This puts the species in danger of extinction. We
   encourage search for other populations in southern Ecuador and northern
   Peru.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated thirteen years (1995-2007) of Charadrius melodus (Piping
   Plover) nesting activity at Jones Beach State Park (JBSP) to examine
   temporal trends in the number of pairs, productivity, total young
   produced per year, and nest initiation. The number of plover pairs has
   decreased over time at JBSP, while productivity (and total number of
   young produced per year) has increased. Productivity has increased more
   at JBSP compared to other areas in their range. In addition, nest
   initiation was significantly later in the nesting season in recent
   years. Increased productivity indicates that management efforts to
   increase this population parameter may have had a positive effect on
   nesting plovers. The decreased numbers of nesting pairs, however,
   suggests that management techniques to increase numbers of breeding
   pairs, such as nesting-habitat restoration, may also be necessary to
   increase local population size. In the absence of suitable nesting
   habitat for recruitment of locally fledged birds, JBSP may be
   functioning as a ``source{''} for other regional breeding populations.}},

Abstract = {{Avifauna associated to native forest and forest plantations of exotic
   conifers in the Reserva Forestal Grecia, Costa Rica. - Forest
   plantations of exotic conifers have been used as a management strategy
   for restoring forests in many areas of the Neotropics. However, there is
   a remarkable lack of information of these plantations on the value for
   conservation biodiversity. To evaluate these plantations as habitat for
   wildlife, I studied bird communities in native secondary forest and in
   plantation of exotic tree species (Pinus oocarpa and Cupressus
   lusitanica) in the Reserva Forestal Grecia, Costa Rica. Bird assemblage
   composition, richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness were compared
   between habitats using the fixed-radius point count method. Fieldwork
   was conducted from September 2008 to May 2009. A total of 743 birds of
   79 species corresponding to 10 orders and 25 families were recorded. The
   bird composition varied across habitats, sharing 51.9\% of the same bird
   species. Although I found no significant differences in the patterns of
   bird diversity or evenness, the native forest had a greater bird
   richness and abundance than the plantation. This could be explained by
   the higher spatial heterogeneity and productivity in the native forest
   than in the plantation. On the basis of these results, secondary native
   forests seem to have a greater value for bird conservation than conifer
   plantations. Therefore, some management measures could favor bird
   communities in the Reserva Forestal Grecia, such as the implementation
   of strategies for ecological restoration in order to gradually replace
   the exotic vegetation by native species which offer more resources
   available for bird populations. The continuation of studies in
   plantations of exotic conifers may provide more knowledge that will
   allow a better understanding of the role played by exotic plantations in
   maintaining bird populations and biodiversity in general.}},

   the monitoring of habitat nature quality}},
Journal = {{PLANT BIOSYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{144}},

Abstract = {{We quantified the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on the structure
   and biodiversity of boreal forests on acidic soils and created a
   statistically supported rational set of indicators to monitor the stand
   onaturalnesso. For that, we surveyed various traits of tree layer,
   understory, herb layer, forest floor and several widely accepted
   biodiversity epiphytic indicators in 252 old-aged boreal stands in
   Estonia, mostly dominated by Scots pine or Norway spruce. Multifactorial
   general linear model analyses showed that many forest characteristics
   and potential indicators were confounded by the gradient of soil
   productivity (reflected by the forest site type), local biogeographic
   gradients and also by stand age. Considering confounding effects, boreal
   forests in a near-natural state have more large-diameter trees (diameter
   at breast height 40 cm) and larger variety of diameter classes, higher
   proportion of spruce or deciduous trees, a larger amount of coarse woody
   debris in various stages, a more closed tree canopy and denser
   understory than managed mature forests. By increasing light availability
   above the field layer, forest management indirectly increases the
   coverage of herbs and lichens on the forest floor but reduces the alpha-
   and beta-diversity of herbs and the proportion of graminoids. Human
   disturbances reduce the relative incidence of many commonly accepted
   biodiversity indicators such as indicator lichens, woodpeckers,
   wood-dwelling insects or fungi on trees. The test for the predictive
   power of characteristics reacting on disturbance revealed that only a
   fraction of them appeared to be included in a diagnostic easy-to-apply
   set of indicators to assess the nature quality of boreal forest: the
   amount of dead wood, the proportion of deciduous trees, the presence of
   specially shaped trees and woodpeckers and, as an indicator of
   disturbances, the forest herb Melampyrum pratensis. Many of these
   indicators have already been implemented in practice.}},

   maintained, as well as meadows that had been abandoned at different
   times in the past. Biodiversity was evaluated using standard ecological
   indices and Disturbance Index (Z). In general, the Disturbance Index
   showed an increase in plant community forms that were abandoned or
   invaded by alien species. An association that was most like the typical
   form was seen in well maintained meadows, which suggests that the
   Disturbance Index continually rises with time after a meadow is
   abandoned. Ecological strategies and mowing tolerance were determined
   with the help of the BIOLFLOR database. Numerical classification
   revealed a highly diverse pattern of variability in the meadows
   examined. Correlations between ecological indicators and phytocenotic
   variability in Molinion meadows were also evaluated. Unmanaged meadows
   were compared to meadows in which meadow conservation management
   practices were carried out.}},

Pages = {{123-132}},
Abstract = {{Important and unique breeding bird communities occur in rice fields
   throughout the world, but little is known about breeding densities and
   nest success, and, therefore, the value of rice fields to breeding
   birds. Breeding bird use of rice fields is divided into five categories:
   1) nesting in standing rice crop, 2) nesting on levees within fields or
   at field perimeters, 3) nesting in associated irrigation canals and
   ditches, 4) nesting in other wet areas that exist because of rice
   cultivation, and 5) use of fields for foraging, while breeding in
   adjacent habitats. Nest density and nest success vary greatly based on
   the region, management practices, and species' requirements. Birds
   commonly nesting in rice fields include ducks, bitterns, rails,
   shorebirds, terns and some passerines. Herons often use rice fields
   heavily while breeding in adjacent habitat. Research on nest densities,
   nest success, nestling and fledgling success, and microhabitat selection
   is needed to better understand the bird communities that use rice
   fields. Received 22 July 2008, accepted 15 May 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Areas of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins)
   outbreaks in the Black Hills can provide habitat for black-backed
   woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), a U.S. Forest Service, Region 2
   Sensitive Species. These outbreaks are managed through removal of trees
   infested with mountain pine beetles to control mountain pine beetle
   populations and salvage timber resources. To minimize impacts to
   black-backed woodpeckers while meeting management objectives, there is a
   need to identify characteristics of these areas that support
   black-backed woodpeckers. We examined the habitat associations of this
   species nesting in areas of beetle outbreaks in the Black Hills, South
   Dakota in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic approach and
   discrete choice models to evaluate nest-site selection of 42 woodpecker
   nests at 3 spatial scales-territory, nest area, and nest tree. At the
   territory scale (250 m around nest), availability and distribution of
   food best explained black-backed woodpecker selection of beetle
   outbreaks versus the surrounding forest. Selection at the territory
   scale was positively associated with densities of trees currently
   infested by mountain pine beetles and indices of wood borer
   (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) abundance, and was greatest at distances
   of 50-100 m from the nearest patch of infestation. At the nest-area
   scale (12.5 m radius around the nest), densities of snags positively
   influenced nest-area selection. Finally, at the nest-tree scale, aspen
   (Populus tremuloides) and 3-5-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
   snags were important resources. The association between abundant
   wood-boring insects and black-backed woodpeckers creates a difficult
   challenge for forest managers. In the absence of fire, areas of beetle
   outbreak might serve as the only substantial source of habitat in the
   Black Hills. Regulating insect populations via salvage logging will
   reduce key food resources to black-backed woodpeckers during nesting.
   Therefore, given the relatively infrequent occurrence of large-scale
   fire in the Black Hills, management should recognize the importance of
   beetle-killed forests to the long-term viability of the black-backed
   woodpecker population in the Black Hills. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We undertook a 3-week expedition to Papua New Guinea in April-May 2007
   to assess the breeding, threats and Population densities of the Papuan
   Harrier Circus spilonotus spilothorax and to determine a first global
   Population estimate for this almost entirely unknown species. Two of the
   first nests known were discovered in April 2007 with three chicks each,
   in the eastern lowlands, in rank grass and reeds. The melanistic form of
   this subspecies was more common in the lowlands (< 1,500 m a.s.l) than
   in the highlands, but interbreeding of this and the typical form
   occurred ill the lowlands. Movements of identifiable individuals through
   two highland grasslands indicated up to eight birds per day oil passage,
   corroborating local knowledge that other raptors move into the highlands
   at the start of the dry season (April). Linear road counts indicated no
   harriers in the wooded highlands but Up to 2.9 harriers 10 km(-1) in
   lowland grasslands. Area counts gave all average of 6.5 harriers 100
   km(-2) in the grasslands and a breeding density of 1.21. nests 100
   km(-2). Given that preferred grassland and swamp habitat comprises c.
   7\% of the forest-dominated island of New Guinea, the global Papuan
   Harrier Population can be no more than c. 3,600 birds and c. 740
   breeding pairs. Wildfires peaked at 38 per month in the Study area,
   Occur throughout the dry season, and led to the loss of both nests. This
   suggests that many nests and prey may be lost at critical times and
   burning may be ultimately detrimental for the species. Grassland fires
   throughout Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are increasing with climatic
   warming and ENSO events, so we suggest that the Papuan Harrier may
   warrant a `Vulnerable' conservation ranking due to small total
   Population size and all accelerated reduction in habitat quality due to
   ongoing climate change.}},

Title = {{The impact of shrub encroachment on savanna bird diversity from local to

Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{948-957}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   Evidence is accumulating of a general increase in woody cover of many
   savanna regions of the world. Little is known about the consequences of
   this widespread and fundamental ecosystem structural shift on
   biodiversity.
   Location
   South Africa.
   Methods
   We assessed the potential response of bird species to shrub encroachment
   in a South African savanna by censusing bird species in five habitats
   along a gradient of increasing shrub cover, from grassland/open woodland
   to shrubland dominated by various shrub species. We also explored
   historical bird species population trends across southern Africa during
   the second half of the 20th century to determine if any quantifiable
   shifts had occurred that support an ongoing impact of shrub encroachment
   at the regional scale.
   Results
   At the local scale, species richness peaked at intermediate levels of
   shrub cover. Bird species composition showed high turnover along the
   gradient, suggesting that widespread shrub encroachment is likely to
   lead to the loss of certain species with a concomitant decline in bird
   species richness at the landscape scale. Finally, savanna bird species
   responded to changes in vegetation structure rather than vegetation
   species composition: bird assemblages were very similar in shrublands
   dominated by Acacia mellifera and those dominated by Tarchonanthus
   camphoratus.
   Main conclusions
   Shrub encroachment might have a bigger impact on bird diversity in
   grassland than in open woodland, regardless of the shrub species.
   Species recorded in our study area were associated with historical
   population changes at the scale of southern Africa suggesting that shrub
   encroachment could be one of the main drivers of bird population
   dynamics in southern African savannas. If current trends continue, the
   persistence of several southern African bird species associated with
   open savanna might be jeopardized regionally.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of silvicultural activities on birds are of increasing interest
   because of documented national declines in breeding bird populations for
   some species and the potential that these declines are in part due to
   changes in forest habitat. Silviculturally induced disturbances have
   been advocated as a means to achieve suitable forest conditions for
   priority wildlife species in bottomland hardwood forests. We evaluated
   how silvicultural activities on conservation lands in bottomland
   hardwood forests of Louisiana, USA, influenced species-specific
   densities of breeding birds. Our data were from independent studies,
   which used standardized point-count surveys for breeding birds in 124
   bottomland hardwood forest stands on 12 management areas. We used
   Program DISTANCE 5.0, Release 2.0 (Thomas et al. 2006) to estimate
   density for 43 species with > 50 detections. For 36 of those species we
   compared density estimates among harvest regimes (individual selection,
   group selection, extensive harvest, and no harvest). We observed 10
   species with similar densities in those harvest regimes compared with
   densities in stands not harvested. However, we observed 10 species that
   were negatively impacted by harvest with greater densities in stands not
   harvested, 9 species with greater densities in individual selection
   stands, 4 species with greater densities in group selection stands, and
   4 species with greater densities in stands receiving an extensive
   harvest (e.g., > 40\% canopy removal). Differences in intensity of
   harvest influenced densities of breeding birds. Moreover, community-wide
   avian conservation values of stands subjected to individual and group
   selection, and stands not harvested, were similar to each other and
   greater than that of stands subjected to extensive harvest that removed
   > 40\% canopy cover. These results have implications for managers
   estimating breeding bird populations, in addition to predicting changes
   in bird communities as a result of prescribed and future forest
   management practices. (JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT 73(8): 1368-1379;

Title = {{Measuring the postfire resilience of a bird-vegetation system: a 28-year

Abstract = {{Despite numerous studies on the response of Mediterranean ecosystems to
   fire, few have measured the respective resilience of vegetation and
   fauna compartments. For 28 years, we conducted an annual monitoring of
   avifauna composition and vegetation structure (cover profile) following
   a severe wildfire in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) stand in southern France.
   Our aim was to estimate the time necessary for this bird-vegetation
   system to return to a state analogous to its pre-fire state. In the
   burned plots, low herbaceous and shrub layers were gradually replaced by
   higher, woody layers of vegetation. Neither bird species richness nor
   inter-annual bird species turnover showed significant differences from
   one year to the next over the study period. In contrast, bird species
   composition did change steadily, leading to an almost complete
   replacement of early-successional species by late-successional ones.
   Using the first axes of multivariate analyses as `proxy variables' of
   vegetation or avifauna recoveries, we estimated by extrapolation the
   recovery times of these two ecosystem components at ca. 50 and 35 years,
   respectively. Towards the end of the study period, the rate of change in
   avifauna composition decreased comparatively to that of vegetation
   structure. Our results show that holm oak woodlands are highly resilient
   and seem to tolerate a similar to 50-year fire interval, even if it
   remains to be assessed how resilient they would be in the case of
   increased fire frequency. More generally, our multivariate approach,
   which allows comparative estimations of resilience in different
   components of an ecosystem using qualitative as well as quantitative
   criteria, could be applied to various case studies in disturbance and
   restoration ecology.}},

Title = {{Effects of management regime on the abundance and nest survival of
   shrubland birds in wildlife openings in northern New England, USA}},

Abstract = {{Many shrubland bird species are declining in eastern North America and
   as a result forest managers have used a variety of techniques to provide
   breeding habitat for these species. The maintenance of permanent
   ``wildlife openings{''} using prescribed burns or mechanical treatments
   is a widely used approach for providing habitat for these species, but
   there have been no studies of the effects of treatment regime on bird
   abundance and nest survival in managed wildlife openings. We studied
   shrubland birds in wildlife openings on the White Mountain National
   Forest (WMNF) in New Hampshire and Maine, USA, during 2003 and 2004. We
   analyzed bird abundance and nest survival in relation to treatment type
   (burned versus mowed), treatment frequency, time since treatment, and
   patch area. We found that wildlife openings provided habitat for
   shrubland birds that are not present in mature forest. There was
   relatively modest support for models of focal bird species abundance as
   a function of treatment regime variables, despite pronounced effects of
   treatment on habitat conditions. This probably was attributable to the
   combined effects of complex site histories and bird site fidelity.
   Overall nest success (52\%) was comparable to other types of
   early-successional habitats in the region, but there were few supported
   relationships between nest survival and treatment variables. We conclude
   that wildlife openings provide quality habitat for shrubland birds of
   high conservation interest as long as managers ensure treatment
   intervals are long enough to permit the development of woody vegetation
   characteristic of the later stages of this sere. Also, wildlife openings
   should be large enough to accommodate the territory sizes of all target
   species, which was >= 1.2 ha in this study. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to quantify the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on forest
   structure and diversity in deciduous and mixed boreo-nemoral stands,
   conditioned on potential confounding factors. Based on these results, we
   created a statistically-supported indicator list of stand
   ``naturalness{''}. We surveyed 50 quantitative and qualitative
   characteristics of a stand, the understorey and forest floor, and
   several widely accepted biodiversity indicators in 171 forests in
   Estonia. Multi-factorial GLM and GLIM analyses showed that many forest
   structural characteristics were confounded by forest site-type
   specificity, stand age and/or biogeography. Near-natural old-growth
   forests had higher proportions of deciduous trees, a larger amount of
   coarse woody debris, a higher frequency of logs in each decay class, a
   denser understorey, and were more homogeneous in the horizontal pattern
   of each layer than mature managed forests. By improving light
   conditions, forest management indirectly increased herb layer richness
   and coverage and the proportion of graminoids. The critical
   easy-to-apply set of indicators to assess forest ecosystem quality
   includes the amount and type of dead wood, the canopy closure of a stand
   and the presence of specially-shaped trees, specific epiphytic indicator
   lichens, mosses and wood-dwelling insects, and forest site-type specific
   herb layer species.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{258}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{616-625}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Large herbivores have potential to affect invertebrate community
   structure through numerous processes, but little work has been done to
   evaluate the relative importance of direct and indirect factors. In this
   study, we measured arthropod community assemblages on Ceanothus fendleri
   A. Gray (Fendler's ceanothus) plants that were growing inside and
   outside of 4-m(2) exclosures. We used univariate analyses and structural
   equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate relationships within this
   herbivore-plant-arthropod system in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
   Laws.) forests of northern Arizona, USA. Results showed that individual
   arthropod abundance, family diversity, family richness, and functional
   group richness were significantly greater on plots where C. fendleri
   plants were protected from large ungulate herbivores (e.g., mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni))
   than on unprotected plots in each of the three study years. Results also
   indicated the following: (1) arthropod abundance was significantly
   greater on protected plants than unprotected plants; (2) rarefaction
   curves suggested arthropod family richness was similar between protected
   and unprotected plants in two of the three years when scaled by number
   of individuals but the estimated total richness was consistently higher
   on protected plants; (3) arthropod abundance was directly affected by
   protection from herbivores, plant stem length, and number of flowers;
   (4) arthropod family richness was related to the number of individuals
   collected and affected by stem length. Results from this study
   illustrate that arthropod communities are directly affected by foraging
   vertebrate herbivores as well as indirectly affected through complex
   plant-mediated factors in this model system. Protection of preferred
   forage plants such as C. fendleri from ungulate herbivores can
   potentially increase diversity of arthropod assemblages in these
   forests, help conserve biological diversity, and enhance ecosystem
   restoration efforts. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is considered a fire
   specialist throughout its breeding range. Given its high abundance in
   recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source
   habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to
   evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed
   woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central
   Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally
   and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential
   source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time.
   Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined
   significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success
   declined from 84\% the first year after fire to 73\% and 25\%,
   respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density
   and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of
   burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests.
   Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests.
   Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates
   indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats
   for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a
   function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire
   forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone
   ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature
   and overmature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats
   important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated
   species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is a management tool used to reduce fuel loads on public
   lands in forested areas in the western United States. Identifying the
   impacts of prescribed fire on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies
   with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive,
   threatened, and migratory bird species Recent developments in occupancy
   modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of
   management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a
   Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for
   detection probability, and we demonstrate the model's usefulness for
   identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities.
   Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the
   effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the
   intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection
   probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the flexibility of
   the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite
   estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed
   species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our
   modeling of the impacts of prescribed fire on avian communities in a
   ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed fire
   treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several
   bark-insectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species
   of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial
   insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus
   migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed fire, whereas
   three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark's Nutcracker
   (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined
   following treatments. Land management agencies interested in determining
   the effects of habitat manipulations on wildlife communities can use
   these methods to provide guidance for future management activities.}},

Title = {{Determining the effects of habitat management and climate on the

Abstract = {{The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax is one of the most threatened steppe
   bird species in Europe, due mainly to agricultural intensification.
   Despite the relative importance of the Iberian population (approximately
   50\% of the global population) little is known about its dynamics and
   trends, especially in core distribution areas. This study evaluates the
   influences of meteorological factors and land management on the
   oscillations and medium-term trends of two Little Bustard populations in
   Central Spain. During 2001-2007, surveys of breeding male and female
   Little Bustards were carried out in two central Spanish locations:
   Valdetorres, in Special Protection Area (SPA) no. 139 (1600 ha), and
   Campo Real, in Important Bird Area (IBA) no. 075 (1150 ha). Densities
   were 3.3-4.0 and 1.1-2.1 males/km(2) in Campo Real, and 1.8-2.2 and
   0.6-1.3 females/km(2) in Valdetorres. The sex ratio was biased towards
   males in both cases. Both populations declined during 2001-2007,
   especially in Valdetorres (60\%). Variation in habitat composition did
   not explain variation in the numbers of males. Both populations were
   influenced by total precipitation in the preceding October-May period.
   Results suggest that the Little Bustard may be sensitive to future
   climate trends in Europe. Finally, different simulated demographic
   scenarios suggest that low female survival and productivity may be the
   immediate cause of the decline in Little Bustard populations, which is
   consistent with their sensitivity to climatic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated home-range characteristics and habitat selection by
   Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in an unburned, boreal
   forest landscape managed by mosaic harvesting in Quebec, Canada. Habitat
   selection by this species was specifically examined to determine
   home-range establishment and foraging activities. We hypothesized that
   Black-backed Woodpeckers would respond to harvesting by adjusting their
   home-range size as a function of the amount of dead wood available.
   Twenty-two birds were tracked using radiotelemetry, and reliable
   estimates of home-range size were obtained for seven breeding
   individuals (six males and one female). The average home-range size was
   151.5 +/- 18.8 ha (range: 100.4-256.4 ha). Our results indicate that
   this species establishes home ranges in areas where both open and
   forested habitats are available. However, during foraging activities,
   individuals preferentially selected areas dominated by old coniferous
   stands. The study also showed that the spatial distribution of preferred
   foraging habitat patches influenced space use, with home-range area
   increasing with the median distance between old coniferous habitat
   patches available within the landscape. Finally, these data show that
   Black-backed Woodpeckers may successfully breed in an unburned forest
   with at least 35 m(3) . ha(-1) of dead wood, of which 42\% (15 m(3) .
   ha(-1)) is represented by dead wood at the early decay stage.}},

Title = {{What explains property-level variation in avian diversity? An

Abstract = {{Modern farmed landscapes have witnessed substantial losses in
   biodiversity principally driven by the ecological changes associated
   with agricultural intensification. The causes of declines are often well
   described, but current management practices seem unlikely to deliver the
   EU-wide policy objective of halting biodiversity losses.
   Available evidence suggests that property-scale factors can be
   influential in shaping patterns of biodiversity; however, they are
   rarely included in studies. Using 44 upland farms in the Peak District,
   northern England, we investigate the roles of ecological, agricultural
   and socio-economic factors in determining avian species richness, for
   the first time incorporating information from all three influences.
   Although we might expect that habitat quality would be the main factor
   affecting species richness, these variables had little influence. The
   landscape context of each property was unimportant in explaining any of
   the three measures of species richness (Total, Upland and Conservation
   Concern) used here. Within-property habitat quality did explain 42\% of
   the variation in richness of upland specialist species, but had no
   influence on Total or Conservation Concern Richness.
   Socio-economic circumstances of farms alone accounted for 24\% of the
   variation in Total Richness, with land tenure and labour inputs
   important predictors of avian diversity. However, net income, rental
   value and the level of Agri-Environment Scheme (AES) payments did not
   play a role in predicting species richness.
   Farm management variables, including many of the main prescriptions
   outlined in AES, accounted for 23\% of the variation in the richness of
   species of Conservation Concern, but less than 10\% for Total Richness.
   However, no farm management variable alone was shown to offer better
   predictive power of avian species richness than random.
   Synthesis and applications. The agricultural landscape is managed by a
   mosaic of landowners, all of whom can influence biodiversity
   conservation. We demonstrate that variation at the property-scale in
   habitat, management and socio-economics can feed into determining
   patterns of biodiversity. Currently, farmland conservation policy
   largely assumes that socio-economic barriers and financial costs of
   implementing conservation measures are constant. Incorporating a
   consideration of the varying circumstances of individual properties into
   policy design is likely to result in substantial biodiversity gains.}},

Abstract = {{The southern United States has significant area in managed pine (Pinus

   ownership philosophy. Potential limitations include loss of natural
   forests, reduction in dead wood, constraints on stand structure, age and
   size of plantation frees, and economic pressure to increase management
   intensity. We recommend that landowners develop plans, including metrics

Abstract = {{Leaving small patches of forest intact at harvesting is now a standard
   procedure to mitigate negative effects on biodiversity. One purpose of
   the patches is to ``life-boat{''} species over the forest regeneration
   phase, although the capacity of small forest fragments to do so is very
   uncertain. We investigated the survival of red-listed and indicator
   species of bryophytes and lichens in 74 retention patches in boreal
   Sweden. The patches were between 0.01 and 0.5 ha in size and of six
   different types with respect to tree species composition and location on
   the harvested area. Species presence and abundance were recorded shortly
   after harvest in transects covering the whole patches, and an identical
   inventory was carried out 6 years after the first. During this time,
   bryophytes generally decreased, most pronounced for liverworts. The
   largest decreases were found in buffer zones to streams and lakes and
   the smallest in tree groups dominated by deciduous trees. By contrast,
   among the lichens some species decreased while others increased, and
   there was no difference between retention patch types. Among the species
   abundant enough to be analyzed individually, the lichens Calicium parvum
   and Micarea globuloselia decreased less in larger patches and the
   bryophyte Hylocomiastrum umbratum decreased more in patches of irregular
   shape. The results imply that retention patches of this size might be
   too small to function as refugia for sensitive bryophytes and lichens
   until the surrounding forest regenerates, but that some lichens appear
   to persist or even increase. Retention harvesting is still a young
   management practice and further studies on its long-term conservation
   benefits will be valuable. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape-scale disturbance events, including ecological restoration and
   fuel reduction activities, can modify habitat and affect relationships
   between species and their environment. To reduce the risk of
   uncharacteristic stand-replacing. res in the southwestern United States,
   land managers are implementing restoration and fuels treatments ( e. g.,
   mechanical thinning, prescribed. re) in progressively larger stands of
   dry, lower elevation ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa) forest. We used a
   Before-After/Control-Impact experimental design to quantify the
   multi-scale response of avifauna to large (similar to 250-400 ha)
   prescribed. re treatments on four sites in Arizona and New Mexico
   dominated by ponderosa pine. Using distance sampling and an
   information-theoretic approach, we estimated changes in density for 14
   bird species detected before (May-June 2002-2003) and after (May-June
   2004-2005) prescribed. re treatments. We observed few site-level
   differences in pre- and posttreatment density, and no species responded
   strongly to treatment on all four sites. Point-level spatial models of
   individual species response to treatment, habitat variables, and. re
   severity revealed ecological relationships that were more easily
   interpreted. At this scale, pretreatment forest structure and patch
   characteristics were important predictors of posttreatment differences
   in bird species density. Five species ( Pygmy Nuthatch {[}Sitta
   pygmaea], Western Bluebird {[}Sialia mexicana], Steller's Jay
   {[}Cyanocitta stelleri], American Robin {[}Turdus migratorius], and
   Hairy Woodpecker {[}Picoides villosus]) exhibited a strong treatment
   response, and two of these species ( American Robin and Hairy
   Woodpecker) could be associated with meaningful. re severity response
   functions. The avifaunal response patterns that we observed were not
   always consistent with those reported by more common studies of
   wildland. re events. Our results suggest that, in the short term, the
   distribution and abundance of common members of the breeding bird
   community in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests appear to be tolerant
   of low- to moderate-intensity prescribed. re treatments at multiple
   spatial scales and across multiple geographic locations.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a widespread natural disturbance agent in most conifer-dominated
   forests. In light of climate change and the effects of fire exclusion,
   single and repeated high-severity (stand-replacement) fires have become
   prominent land management issues. We studied bird communities using
   point counting in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of Oregon, USA at
   various points in time after one or two high-severity fires. Time points
   included 2 and 3 years after a single fire, 17 and 18 years after a
   single fire, 2 and 3 years after a repeat fire (15 year interval between
   fires), and >100 years since stand-replacement fire (mature/old-growth
   forest). Avian species richness did not differ significantly among
   habitats. Bird density was highest 17 and 18 years after fire, lowest 2
   years after fire, and intermediate in repeat burns and unburned forest.
   Bird community composition varied significantly with habitat type (A =
   0.24, P < 0.0001) with two distinct gradients in species composition
   relating to tree structure (live to dead) and shrub stature. Using
   indicator species analysis, repeat burns were characterized by
   shrub-nesting and ground-foraging bird species while unburned mature
   forests were characterized by conifer-nesting and foliage-gleaning
   species. Bird density was not related to snag basal area but was
   positively related to shrub height. Contrary to expectations, repeated
   high-severity fire did not reduce species richness, and bird densities
   were greater in repeat burns than in once-burned habitats. Broad-leaved
   hardwoods and shrubs appear to play a major role in structuring avian
   communities in the Klamath-Siskiyou region. In light of these results,
   extended periods of early seral broadleaf dominance and short-interval
   high-severity fires may be important to the conservation of avian
   biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the effectiveness of conservation efforts, scientists and
   land managers must evaluate the ability of conservation areas to protect
   biological diversity. The historic town of Concord, Massachusetts, home
   of the philosopher and naturalist Henry David Thoreau, provides a unique
   opportunity to examine how well conservation areas preserve biodiversity
   in a suburban landscape. About 35\% of total land area in the town has
   been protected, and botanists, including Thoreau, have surveyed plants
   in Concord five times over the last 170 years. We spent 5 years
   (2003-2007) re-surveying a subset of Concord's flora for species
   presence and abundance. Of the species seen by Thoreau in the mid-19th
   century in Concord, we could not locate 27\%, and an additional 36\%
   persist in one or two populations where they are vulnerable to local
   extinction. Most species losses appear to have occurred in the past
   three to four decades. Certain groups, such as orchids, have shown
   particularly severe losses. More native species are declining in
   abundance than are increasing. Non-native species represent an
   increasing percentage of the flora, with many increasing in abundance.
   The flora has experienced a net loss of species over the past four
   decades, with 82 species gained and 236 species missing. Because many
   species are rare on a local scale, persisting as one or two small
   populations, local extinctions will likely continue in coming decades.
   Habitat management, primarily to prevent tree establishment, appears to
   have allowed many rare species of open habitats to persist and recover.
   Active management of existing sites will likely be the key to protecting
   the species diversity of the Concord flora and maintaining the living
   connection to the writings of Thoreau. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Estimates of community attributes such as species richness, local
   extinction, and turnover are critical when evaluating ecological
   restoration efforts. Estimates of species richness based on counts can
   be biased by variation in the probability of detection among different
   species. We quantified the effects of livestock exclusion on riparian
   bird communities using mark-recapture models to account for variation in
   species detection rates. Specifically, we estimated species richness and
   other community parameters for fenced and grazed sites with robust
   design models where closed-captures were treated as mixtures, and then
   used transition rates to calculate derived vital rates for avian
   communities. Estimates of species richness based on unadjusted counts
   were correlated with estimates from robust design models, but counts
   failed to detect important temporal changes in species richness.
   Estimates of species richness from robust design models increased at
   fenced and grazed sites over an 8-year period, but community vital rates
   were unaffected by cattle exclusion. We examined qualitative changes in
   abundance of birds in four nesting guilds, and concluded that temporal
   changes may have been driven by regional dynamics in avian communities.
   Our mark-recapture analysis allowed us to compare standardized estimates
   of community parameters between habitats, observers, and time periods
   after accounting for variation in detection rates. Robust design models
   are a useful tool that will facilitate accurate assessments of community
   dynamics following future restoration efforts. Received 12 March 2007.

Abstract = {{In coniferous forests of western North American, fire is an important
   disturbance that influences the structure and composition of floral and
   faunal communities. The impacts of postfire management, including
   salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We
   compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in
   unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of
   salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5-6 snags
   retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon. We used
   analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three hypotheses
   concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage on
   densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds, and two
   hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage logging on
   relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined the
   relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species. We
   did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities or
   relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We
   detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns
   differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the
   black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P.
   villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee
   (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata)
   were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the
   unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco
   hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the
   moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment.
   We detected significant differences between years for four species of
   birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting
   species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond
   uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species
   that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage
   intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage
   logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important
   habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings
   parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting
   robust patterns that transcend particular locations. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Processes derived from global change such as land-use changes, climate
   warming or modifications in the perturbation regime may have opposite
   effects on forest extent and structure with still unknown consequences
   on forest biodiversity at large spatial scales. In the present study, we
   aimed at determining forest dynamics associated with global change
   processes (forest spread, maturation and fire) that have driven the
   variation in forest bird distributions in Mediterranean forest
   ecosystems in recent years. The study was located in Catalonia (NE
   Spain) and used changes in richness of specialist and generalist forest
   bird species in the last 20 years of the 20th century as indicators of
   forest biodiversity change. Forest bird distribution changes showed
   strong spatial patterns and appeared to be related to population
   processes occurring beyond sampling units (10 km x 10 km squares).
   Forest maturation appeared as the most important driver of such changes
   because most of the studied species have a non-Mediterranean origin and
   are associated with more mature forests. To a lower degree, forest
   spread also contributed to forest bird distribution changes whereas the
   impact of forest fires was not associated to a decrease in the richness
   of either group of forest species. Given the relatively coarse scale at
   which our study was conducted, caution should be taken when
   extrapolating our results to the possible future impacts of climate
   change on fire regime and forest bird distribution. Our results indicate
   that large-scale forest maturation and spread due mainly to land
   abandonment in Catalonia has overridden the potentially negative effects
   of fires on forest bird distributions and are currently driving changes
   in forest biodiversity patterns across the region.}},

Abstract = {{To gain insight into the question of which vegetation characteristics
   have the most influence on avian assemblages in late-successional
   forests, the habitat preferences of bird-guilds in old-growth endemic
   forests of Macedonian pine were studied over 3 years in the Pirin
   National Park, Bulgaria. Bird-habitat relationships were investigated by
   comparing vegetation characteristics, and bird species richness,
   diversity, abundance, and guild structure of birds (determined according
   to food type, foraging and nesting sites) between mature (60-100 years
   old) and over-mature (>120 years old) Macedonian pine forest stands.
   Studied forest age-classes differed mainly by the density, height and
   diameter of trees, and the amount of dead wood. The first one of these
   parameters decreased and the latter two parameters increased with the
   forest succession. The difference in the vegetation structure affected
   the abundance of bird-guilds and thus, the overall bird abundance and
   the structure of avian assemblages within Macedonian pine forests. There
   was no significant difference in bird diversity among studied forest
   age-classes, but the overall bird abundance increased with forest
   maturation. Analyzed by study plots, species richness was higher in
   over-mature forests, but at cluster level, there was no significant
   difference between mature and over-mature forest age-classes. Half of
   the studied (insectivorous, hole- and ground-nesters, bark- and
   canopy-foraging bird species) guilds were more abundant in over-mature
   forests, while there was no bird-guild exhibiting a preference for
   mature forest stands. The abundances of bird-guilds were correlated with
   tree height, diameter at breast height and the amount of dead wood
   between the studied forest age-classes and this might explain their
   preferences for over-mature pine forests. Therefore, for future
   sustainable management of these endemic forests and the conservation of
   their avifauna, efforts should focus on protecting the remaining native
   old-growth forest stands and the importance of the structure of
   Macedonian pine forests on their bird assemblages should be considered
   in forestry practices. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Forest harvesting strategies that approximate natural disturbances have
   been proposed as a means of maintaining natural species' diversity and
   richness in the boreal forests of North America. Natural disturbances
   impact shoreline forests and upland areas at similar rates. However,
   shoreline forests are generally protected from harvest through the
   retention of treed buffer strips. We examined bird community responses
   to forest management guidelines intended to approximate shoreline forest
   fires by comparing bird community structure in early (1-4 years)
   post-burned and harvested boreal riparian habitats and the adjacent
   shoreline forest. We sampled riparian areas with adjacent: (1) burned
   merchantable shoreline forest (n = 21), (2) burned non-merchantable
   shoreline forest (n = 29), (3) 10 m treed buffer with 25\% retention in
   the next 30 rn (n = 18), and (4) 30 m treed buffer (n = 21). Only minor
   differences were detected in riparian species' abundance and bird
   community composition between treatments with greater differences in
   these parameters occurring between post-fire and post-harvest upland
   bird communities. Indicators of all merchantable treatments were
   dominated by upland species with open-habitat species and habitat
   generalists being typical upland indicator species of burned
   merchantable habitats and forest specialists typical upland indicators
   of harvested treatments. Riparian species indicative of burned riparian
   habitats were Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), Le Conte's
   Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii) and Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus)
   and indicators of 30 m buffers were Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum)
   and Wilson's Warbler (Wilsonia pusilla). Multivariate Redundancy
   Analysis (RDA) of the overall (riparian and upland birds) community
   showed greater divergence than RDA with only riparian species suggesting
   less effect of fire and forestry on riparian birds than on upland birds.
   Higher natural range of variability (NRV) of overall post-fire bird
   communities compared to post-harvest communities emphasizes that
   harvesting guidelines currently do not achieve this level of
   variability. However, lack of a large negative effect on common riparian
   species in the first 4 years post-disturbance allows for the exploration
   of alternative shoreline forest management that better incorporates bird
   community composition of post-fire riparian areas and shoreline forests.

Abstract = {{Large wildfire events in coniferous forests of the western United States
   are often followed by postfire timber harvest. The long-term impacts of
   postfire timber harvest on fire-associated cavity-nesting bird species
   are not well documented. We studied nest-site selection by
   cavity-nesting birds over a 10-year period (1994-2003), representing
   1-11 years after fire, on two burns created by mixed severity wildfires
   in western Idaho, USA. One burn was partially salvaged logged (the
   Foothills burn), the other was primarily unlogged (the Star Gulch burn).
   We monitored 1367 nests of six species (Lewis's Woodpecker Melanerpes
   lewis, Hairy Woodpecker Picoides villosus, Black-backed Woodpecker P.
   arcticus, Northern Flicker Colaptes auratus, Western Bluebird Sialia
   mexicana, and Mountain Bluebird S. currucoides). Habitat data at nest
   and non-nest random locations were characterized at fine (field
   collected) and coarse (remotely sensed) spatial scales. Nest-site
   selection for most species was consistently associated with higher snag
   densities and larger snag diameters, whereas wildfire location
   (Foothills versus Star Gulch) was secondarily important. All woodpecker
   species used nest sites with larger diameter snags that were surrounded
   by higher densities of snags than at non-nest locations. Nests of Hairy
   Woodpecker and Mountain Bluebird were primarily associated with the
   unlogged wildfire, whereas nests of Lewis's Woodpecker and Western
   Bluebird were associated with the partially logged burn in the early
   years after fire. Nests of wood-probing species (Hairy and Black-backed
   Woodpeckers) were also located in larger forest patch areas than patches
   measured at non-nest locations. Our results confirm previous findings
   that maintaining clumps of large snags in postfire landscapes is
   necessary for maintaining breeding habitat of cavity-nesting birds.
   Additionally, appropriately managed salvage logging can create habitat
   for some species of cavity-nesting birds that prefer more open
   environments. Our findings can be used by land mangers to develop design
   criteria for postfire salvage logging that will reserve breeding habitat
   for cavity-nesting birds. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Relationships between site characteristics, farming system and
   biodiversity on Australian mixed farms}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{9-10}},
Pages = {{869-882}},
Abstract = {{A collaborative project between researchers, regional natural resource
   management organisations and landholders set out to explore three
   questions about the relationships between biodiversity and land use in
   Australia's mixed-farming landscapes: (1) the extent to which farm-scale
   measures of biodiversity were related to agricultural production; (2)
   the influence of the type and intensity of agricultural production on
   native biodiversity on farms; and (3) the relative influence of site and
   farming system on selected measures of biodiversity. Four land-use types
   on 47 mixed farms across nine regions, derived from several of
   Australia's 56 natural resource management regions, were surveyed in
   autumn and spring 2006 and 2007. Surveys of birds, surface invertebrates
   (beetles, ants, spiders), vegetation and soils were undertaken on four
   land classes on each farm; crop, `rotation' (break crop/pasture phase),
   perennial pasture and remnant vegetation. Data were collected by
   participating regional staff, using a standard protocol, which were sent
   to a central collection point for collation, analysis and
   interpretation.
   Species richness, functional diversity and vegetation structure were
   assessed. This introductory paper focuses on results relating to species
   richness, which for most taxa was greater in remnant vegetation than
   other land-use classes and declined along a disturbance gradient
   (remnant, pasture, rotation, crop). Properties with a greater proportion
   of perennial pastures recorded higher species richness than properties
   that were dominated by crop. Properties that recorded high wheat yields
   (t/ha) also recorded lower species richness for spiders and birds. The
   presence of insectivorous birds and beneficial invertebrates (spiders,
   beetles and ants) in all land-use classes suggests the potential to
   apply integrated pest management approaches to mixed-farming systems
   across the country.
   Site and system features were found to be important determinants of
   biodiversity, with their relative importance varying with the scale of
   investigation and the taxa. At the landscape scale, bird species
   richness was correlated with the amount of remnant vegetation within a
   5-km radius of the farm boundary, and with the condition of native
   vegetation on the farm. The average size of remnant vegetation patches
   was 5 ha or less on nearly half of the properties surveyed. At the farm
   scale, ant species richness was correlated with site features, while
   beetles were correlated with management/system features such as the
   presence and fertility of perennial pastures.
   Analyses at the functional group level will provide more detailed
   information on relationships between different land-use types. Further
   experimental work needs to be undertaken to qualify the suggested impact
   of land management practices on different taxa, while repeated surveys
   will allow for the collation of datasets over time, from which
   population dynamics may be determined.}},

Abstract = {{I compared structural characteristics between foraging plots of an
   endangered European species, the White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos
   leucotos (WbW), and random plots in primeval deciduous stands of
   Bialowieza National Park. I expected that WbW would use plots with
   higher amount of dead wood in more advanced decay stage, with higher
   amount of birches Betula spp. and aspen Populus tremula, and with more
   large trees. Within 50, 0.25-ha plots (25 used by WbW and 25 random)
   tree-species composition, tree condition, tree diameter at breast height
   DBH and characteristics of dead trees were measured. WbW and random
   plots were similar in overall structure; only the volume of fallen
   timber was significantly larger in WbW than in random plots (65.3 and
   47.4 m(3)/ba, respectively). There was also a tendency for the
   occurrence of more snags of 11-20 cm DBH within WbW plots. Thus, the
   amount of fallen timber might determine WbW choice of the foraging
   habitat. However, due to the relatively high similarity of WbW vs.
   random plots, the sections of Bialowieza National Park that are covered
   with old-growth deciduous stands represent high-quality habitat for WbW
   foraging.}},

Abstract = {{Responses of a bird assemblage to manual shrub removal In a Chacoan
   subtropical semiarid forest, Argentina. - We compared several attributes
   of vegetation structure of the understory and of bird species richness,
   guild abundance, and total abundance between a 200-ha area of semiarid
   Chacoan forest and another 200-ha area of the same forest where shrubs
   were manually removed, in Santiago del Estero province, Argentina. We
   seasonally recorded birds at 60 point count stations (30 in each type of
   habitat) between March 1998 and August 1999. The shrubless area showed
   higher percentages of herb cover and bare ground than the forest,
   whereas in the forest there were higher covers of litter and shrubs and
   a higher shrub height than in the shrubless area. Moreover, the
   shrubless area showed a lower species richness and bird abundance than
   the forest in summer. At the guild level, analyses revealed that bark
   insectivores were more abundant in the shrubless area, whereas foliage
   insectivores, terrestrial insectivores, and arboreal seed eaters were
   more abundant in the forest. Our results show that shrub removal has a
   great influence on the structure of bird assemblages, which persists
   several years later after the application of this technique. We
   recommend that, in case of massive shrub removal, stripes of shrubby
   vegetation should be maintained in order to guarantee the inclusion of
   shrub-associated bird species in the mosaic landscape.}},

   communities}},
Journal = {{REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE}},

Volume = {{64}},

Pages = {{171-188}},
Abstract = {{Bird communities of 11 fir forests (Abies pectinata and A. pinsapo +
   maroccana) and 6 pine forests (Pinus silvestris and P. pinaster) were
   compared along a 2000 kin transect from the Vosges (N.-E. France) to the
   Middle Atlas (Marocco). A common background of ca 15 Palearctic bird
   species accounts for three quarters of relative abundances in all
   communities. However, significant differences appear at several levels.
   (1) Between the medio-european and Mediterranean biogeographical areas,
   middle latitudes of Spain prevent the presence southward of ca 10
   species, such as the Goldcrest and the Bullfinch. Conversely, although
   belonging to the same faunistic region, 11 species, such as the
   Short-toed ``Free Creeper and the Serin, are more frequent in the
   Mediterranean than further north. Over the two forest types
   investigated, there are only 33 Passerine species, over a total of 54,
   common to Middle Europe and the Mediterranean area. (2) Abies and Pinus
   forests have in common a striking figure of 46 bird species. The
   distinctive species are the Firecrest and the Blackcap in fir forests,
   the Crested Tit and the Common Crossbill in pine forests. As already
   noted by various authors, as a consequence of its insularity and
   mesological peculiarities the Mediterranean forest avifauna can be
   considered as an impoverished version of its Medio-european counterpart.
   (3) At the broad regional scale, a multivariate analysis shows an
   avifaunistic gradient running from climacic forests, mainly on
   north-facing slopes from Vanoise (French Alps) to the Pyrenees, to
   para-climacic pre-forests, mainly on south-facing slopes, in Andalucia
   and Marocco. In the former case, boreal bird species account for three
   quarters of the abundances in the community but less than half in the
   latter where the rest consists predominantly of rather biogeographically
   and ecologically ubiquitous species (Carduelinae, Woodlark, Rock
   Bunting) which, for a mix of ecological and anthropogenic reasons, are
   able to colonize more and more common southward thermo-xerophilous and
   open wooded landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Larix kaempferi is the main plantation species in the low-snow,
   cool-temperate zone of Japan. I studied L. kaempferi plantations of
   various stand ages in central Japan to examine and compare the effect of
   stand age on the abundance, size, and species composition of snags
   (standing dead trees) compared to those in secondary broadleaf forests.
   Plantations that were older than the standard rotation age had more and
   larger snags than young plantations, and the species diversity of snags
   was positively correlated with stand age. Because the density of living
   planted L. kaempferi showed little correlation with snag variables,
   whereas that of naturally regenerated tree species was positively
   correlated with snag variables, the density dependence of snag
   occurrence was stronger in naturally regenerated trees than in planted
   L. kaempferi. Snag species that were positively correlated with stand
   age were the main species in secondary broadleaf forests in this area.
   Basal area, density, and number of species of snags in standard-rotation
   plantations were significantly lower than in long-rotation plantations
   and secondary broadleaf forests. Long-rotation plantations are useful
   for retaining snags compared to standard-rotation plantations.}},

Title = {{Interspecific competition and conservation management of continuous
   subtropical woodlands}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{617-626}},
Abstract = {{Context. Large reserves have potential to provide important refugia for
   fragmentation-sensitive species as they lack many aspects of habitat
   degradation associated with fragmented regions. However, large reserves
   often have a history of deleterious management practices that may affect
   the restoration of biological diversity. One significant symptom of
   habitat fragmentation and disturbance in Australia is the increased
   occurrence of the aggressive noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). In
   Queensland, however, even large continuous areas of woodland appear to
   be dominated by the noisy miner.
   Aims. We examined the severity of this phenomenon by identifying the
   interactions between habitat structure, noisy miner abundance and avian
   assemblages in a private and a public conservation reserve in central
   Queensland. We investigated potential constraints on restoration of
   avian diversity including: (1) how changes in habitat structure as a
   result of grazing by feral animals and burning regimes affect bird
   assemblages; and (2) how the noisy miner impacts on avian assemblages in
   these unfragmented woodlands.
   Methods. Bird surveys and habitat assessments were conducted in 49 sites
   on three separate occasions. Fire history and intensity of grazing
   pressure were determined for each site with direct and indirect
   observations. Sampling for lerp from insects of the family Psyllidae was
   also undertaken during the survey periods. A Bayesian model averaging
   (BMA) approach was used to model avian response to each of the habitat
   variables.
   Key results. The noisy miner dominated most of the study area, reducing
   small passerine abundance and species richness. Noisy miners were
   advantaged where shrub cover was low and feral grazing impacts were
   evident. Disturbance factors including recent wild. re and heavy grazing
   strongly reduced small passerine bird richness and abundance.
   Conclusions. Reducing the abundance of this `reverse keystone' species
   requires control of feral herbivore populations and modi. cation of. re
   regimes to achieve a mosaic including patches with a dense shrub layer.
   Implications. Deleterious interactions with competitive native species,
   such as noisy miners, are obstacles to bird conservation not only in
   fragmented landscapes but also in large, continuous woodland areas. Land
   mangers of protected areas need to be aware of shifts in interactions
   among native species driven by habitat disturbance, which may ultimately
   affect conservation outcomes.}},

Pages = {{2145-2153}},

Abstract = {{We investigated whether partial cutting used to mimic small-scale
   natural disturbances could maintain cavity and bark nesting breeding
   birds. We assessed changes in the relative abundance of cavity nesting
   birds in two intensities of partial cutting, compared to uncut and
   clearcut stands, 9 years post-treatment. We then examined the
   relationship between forest structure and nesting abundance (stand
   scale) and compared characteristics of used nest and forage trees to
   unused trees (tree scale). The relative abundance of most species was
   highest in either heavy removal or light removal treatments 9 years
   post-harvest. Brown creepers were most abundant in uncut, and
   red-breasted sapsuckers were most abundant in clearcut and heavy removal
   treatments. The proportion of deciduous trees and the density of dead
   trees were the best predictors of nest abundance. Individual nest tree
   use was predicted by the presence of large deciduous trees with broken
   tops and early to advanced stages of decay. Forage tree use was
   predicted by the presence of large conifer trees in advanced stages of
   decay. To maintain breeding habitat for cavity nesters, we suggest that
   forest managers retain the specific structural attributes required for
   nesting, but also the diverse forest conditions required for foraging.

Abstract = {{Coffee cultivation plays a role in biodiversity alteration and
   conservation in much of the tropics. This is particularly so in
   Ethiopia, where coffee is an indigenous shrub and a major commodity in
   national and local trade. In southwestern Ethiopia, coffee (Coffea
   arabica, ``highland coffee{''}) is harvested from both forests (its
   natural habitat) and from within farmland where it is grown in small
   patches under isolated shade trees. We investigated the effects of
   management practices on bird assemblages in each of these systems. We
   found that bird assemblages in the forest remnants were distinct from
   those in the farmland even if many species were regularly found in both
   habitats. Coffee cultivation in open farmlands promoted bird species
   diversity through the retention of forest trees, while coffee
   cultivation in forests reduced bird diversity. Forest coffee management
   may, however, ensure that forest remnants are not converted to other
   forms of more open agriculture. Certification standards for
   ``ecologically friendly{''} coffee in Ethiopia need to take this
   complexity into account.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance is a key ecological process influencing the distribution and
   abundance of many elements of the earth's biota. Predicting the response
   of biota to disturbance is therefore important, but it nevertheless
   remains difficult to make accurate forecasts of response. We tested
   predictions from disturbance-related theories and concepts in 10
   vegetation types at Booderee National Park (southeastern Australia)
   using a retrospective study of bird responses to. re history (over 35
   years) on 110 sites and a prospective study following a single wild. re
   event in 2003 at 59 of these sites. Our data did not support predictions
   from the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis; observed bird species
   richness at a site was significantly (F(1,99) = 6.30, P = 0.014)
   negatively related to the number of fires since 1972 and was 8.7\% lower
   (95\% CI, 1.8 -15.1\%) for each additional. re. In contrast to. re
   history effects, we found that after the 2003. re, the vast majority of
   individual species and the bird assemblage per se in most vegetation
   types recovered within two years. Thus, recovery after a single. re did
   not reflect long-term effects of multiple fires on overall bird species
   richness at a site. We postulated that the recovery of bird species
   richness and bird assemblage composition after the 2003. re would be
   fastest in structurally simple vegetation types and slowest in
   structurally complex vegetation, but observed the opposite. Although
   observed bird species richness in vertically heterogeneous forest and
   woodland had returned to prefire levels by 2006, bird species richness
   in structurally simple vegetation types (e. g., sedgeland) had not.
   Post. re vegetation regeneration, together with a paucity of
   early-successional specialists, would explain the speed of recovery of
   the bird assemblage and why it changed relatively little during our
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Current state of knowledge and conservation of the avifauna from Campos
   de Cima da Serra highlands of South Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa
   Catarina States. The portion of Planalto Meridional Brasileiro that
   corresponds to northeast Rio Grande do Sul and south-southeastern of
   Santa Catarina holds a high bird species richness that represents about
   55\% of all birds known for Rio Grande do Sul and a little more than
   45\% of the birds for Santa Catarina. Great portion of this environment
   is characterized by highland grasslands also known as Campos de Cima da
   Serra. The grassland avian fauna of the highlands are actually under
   minor number of published research than the forest avifauna of the
   Atlantic Forest Biome - Atlantic Forest sensu stricto and Araucaria
   Forest. Despite this an important parcel of the threatened or
   near-threatened birds (33\%) are grassland species. It may reflect the
   situation of their habitats, which are under intensive anthropogenic
   pressure due to, for example, extensive monocultures plantations of
   Pinus spp., for timber or other uses; hydroelectric dams; roads,
   inappropriate field management with fire and other kind of human
   environmental modifications. Based on almost all literature produced
   about the region and the field work done along the last 10 years
   focusing on the highlands and their species, we elaborated a brief
   diagnostic of the knowledge produced until here. We also described the
   situation of conservation considering the diversity and composition of
   birds and their habitats. We concluded that the number of published
   papers about stricted grassland birds is four times lower than the ones
   that involve birds of forested habitats. We presented 42 new records
   and/or distribution extensions of birds for the studied region, which
   reflects the current lack of knowledge about its specific diversity. We
   emphasized the necessity of conservation initiatives that consider
   important areas to grassland birds. We indicated four biodiversity
   conservation priority areas.}},

Abstract = {{Conspecific attraction is an important aspect of animal behaviour and
   several avian studies have shown that vocalizations may be used as an
   inadvertent cue to locate areas of suitable habitat. By studying the
   metapopulation system of a territorial passerine, the Dupont's lark
   Chersophilus duponti, we analysed the demographic correlates of
   population vocal activity, and the relationships between the occurrence
   of immigration and the availability of social information (e.g. vocal
   activity, population size, density and productivity) in 22 local
   populations. We found that the proportion of active singing days in
   spring and territorial call advertisement after breeding were positively
   related to the number of males within local populations. In turn, the
   intensity of vocal activity was associated with the likelihood of
   receiving immigrants, better explaining immigration than other kinds of
   social or public information. Because of depressed signalling, small
   local populations could experience reduced rescuing from others, thus
   compromising population persistence. In such cases, habitat management
   alone may not be enough to overcome this behavioural constraint. Because
   we found that the occurrence of inter-patch movements also depended on
   the size of nearby local populations, understanding regional processes
   may be as important as controlling social and environmental factors for
   the maintenance of small populations.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat restoration strategies for fragmented high Andean forest
   landscapes must consider the influence of within-patch habitat quality
   on bird abundance. I examined vegetation and bird abundance at three
   locations within a highly fragmented Polylepis forest landscape in the
   Cordillera Vilcanota, southern Peru. Across the landscape, there was
   significant variation in the vegetation structure of Polylepis forest
   patches of different size categories, especially in terms of tree girth,
   tree height, tree density, and canopy vegetation structure. Principal
   Component Analysis extracted five factors of habitat quality, which
   together accounted for 74.2\% of the variability within 15 habitat
   variables. Polylepis bird species differed in their responses to habitat
   quality but, overall, variation in Polylepis bird abundance was not
   fully captured by the range of habitat quality variables. Tall, dense
   vegetation cover was clearly important for 11 conservation-important
   species, a high density of large trees was important for 10 species and
   primary forest ground cover was important for eight species. Habitat
   quality exhibited no significant influence on the abundance of only one
   species - Asthenes urubambensis. The abundance of seven species was
   associated with lower elevation forest, but only one species was
   associated with higher elevation forest. Management of habitat quality
   in large and medium remnant forest patches throughout the Cordillera
   Vilcanota, particularly in the 3800-4200 m elevation range, will be a
   cornerstone in ensuring the persistence of the majority of
   conservation-important bird species populations.}},

Abstract = {{There is limited understanding of the influence of tire and Vegetation
   Structure on bird communities in dry oak (Quercus spp.) savannas of the
   Upper Midwest and whether bird communities in restored savanna habitats

   breeding seasons, we examined the relationship between bird communities
   and environmental variables, including vegetation characteristics and
   site prescribed-burn frequencies. across a habitat gradient in dry oak
   savannas in central Minnesota. The habitat gradient we studied went
   from: (1) prairie to (2) remnant oak savanna to (3) oak woodland
   undergoing savanna restoration via fire or mechanical removal of woody
   vegetation to (4) oak woodland. We conducted fixed-radius point Counts
   (n = 120) within habitats with either prairie groundcover or
   predominately oak canopy. We described canopy and groundcover
   characteristics at a sub-sample (n = 28) of non-prairie points. and
   collected canopy and woody species richness data and prescribed-burn
   frequencies over the past 20 years for all points. Observed bird
   communities were most strongly correlated with canopy cover and burn
   frequency and, to a lesser extent, attributes of the shrub component.
   Most savanna points had bird communities that were distinct from those
   found at oak woodland or oak woodland points undergoing restoration via
   burning. Savanna points similar to oak woodland points were in areas
   managed by periodic cutting rather than burning. Remnant savanna bird
   communities were more strongly associated with prescribed burning than
   those in other habitat types. but it appeared that most oak woodlands
   that had undergone 20 year's of prescribed burning remained ecologically
   distinct from remnant savannas. This suggests that some savannas that
   have converted to oak woodlands may exist in an alternative, or,table.

Abstract = {{We compared avian communities and vegetation characteristics in invaded

   Albany pine Bush, east central New York State. We recorded bird calls at
   55 stations during breeding season to estimate abundances of breeding
   birds in areas dominated by fire-dependent pine-shrub savanna and areas
   dominated by invasive hardwoods (black locust. Robinia pseudoacacia, and
   aspens, Populus tremuloides and P. grandidentata). Vegetation surveys
   were conducted surrounding each station to quantify woody plant
   composition and structure. Sites, characterized Lis invaded had more
   vegetation layers, twice as much closed canopy, and higher tree stein
   densities in all but the largest (> 25 cm dia) size classes. Forty-seven
   bird species were recorded thirty-three at both invaded and uninvaded
   sites. Grassland/shrubland birds. Such as prairie warbler (Dendroica
   discolor). field sparrow (Spizella pusilla). red-breasted nuthatch
   (Sitta canadensis), and eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus). were
   twice as frequent and three times as abundant at uninvaded sites. Native
   bird species characteristic of closed-canopy forest were more frequent
   and abundant at stations in invaded sites. Multivariate analyses
   indicate distinct associations of particular birds with unique
   combinations of vegetation characteristics that differed between invaded

   promise to restore critical avian habitat in protected areas of this

Abstract = {{In northern Europe, a long history of land use has led to profound
   changes within forest ecosystems. The white-backed woodpecker
   (Dendrocopos leucotos) is one of several specialised forest species
   whose populations have declined. Conservation management directed at
   this species' habitat has made it a de facto umbrella species for
   conservation of the biodiversity associated with forests rich in
   deciduous trees and dead wood. We assessed empirically the value of the
   white-backed woodpecker as an indicator and umbrella species in central
   Sweden. Occurrence of the woodpecker in breeding bird atlas squares (5 x
   5 km(2)) indicated high species richness of forest birds, particularly
   species of special conservation concern, which included on average 13\%
   more species in squares with than without the woodpecker. The number of
   red-listed cryptogam species expected to benefit from conservation
   actions directed at white-backed woodpecker habitats was higher in
   squares where the woodpecker bred compared to where is was absent.
   However, no such pattern was found for red-listed beetles, a group with
   very few records in the studied squares. White-backed woodpecker
   occurrence was positively associated with the current area of deciduous
   and mixed forest of high conservation value. Considering its indicator
   value, its specialised habitat requirements and its potential as a
   communication tool, using the white-backed woodpecker as an umbrella
   species may provide a coarse filter for the conservation of several
   other deciduous forest species. However, focusing solely on white-backed
   woodpecker habitat may not provide for the conservation of all such
   species, which stresses the need for a suite of complementary planning
   approaches.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1596-1604}},

Abstract = {{Grassland birds have declined more than any other North American
   habitat-associated bird community. Because most species of grassland
   birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction
   of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes
   homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with
   early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines,
   especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an
   alternative grassland management practice known as patch-burning has
   been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by
   mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie
   before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of
   patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by
   early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels
   (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296
   dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed
   between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels
   tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean
   number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the
   treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures.
   Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in
   traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird
   (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in
   patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in
   patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive
   response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides
   further evidence that this practice can he a useful tool for grassland
   bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation,
   patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by
   providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels
   and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g.,
   trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects
   of grazing, which are not available under traditional management.
   Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy
   for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of how landscape structure influences patterns of animal space
   use is critical to developing sustainable landscape management
   practices. For breeding songbirds that defend a territory embedded

   assess with in-territory and home range space use as functions of the
   proportion of clearcut-harvested versus naturally unforested land for
   two species of Neotropical migrant songbirds. We tested whether these
   relationships varied with spatial scale by assessing landscape structure
   in both the local neighborhood (115 m radius around an individual's
   territory center) and across the landscape (1250 in radius). Territory
   size for riparian-associated male Northern Waterthrushes (Seiurus
   noveboracensis) was curvilinearly related to the proportion of harvested

   of magnitude. Waterthrush territories were largest in the most heavily
   harvested landscapes. Home range space use by male Blackpoll Warblers
   (Dendroica striata), which are habitat generalists, was influenced by
   the ratio of clearcuts to natural gaps in both the neighborhood and
   landscape. Blackpolls may modify their behavior as a result of
   anthropogenic processes acting at both small and larger spatial scales,
   but we observed considerable interannual variability. Our results
   suggest that boreal forest-breeding passerines may be capable of
   modifying their space use behavior in response to moderate levels of
   structural change caused by forestry.}},

Abstract = {{Large tracts of natural habitat are being replaced by agriculture and
   urban sprawl in Mediterranean regions worldwide. We have limited
   knowledge about the effects of human activities on native species in
   these landscapes and which, if any, management practices might enhance
   the conservation of native biodiversity within them. Through a citizen
   volunteer bird-monitoring project, we compared bird abundance and
   species richness in northern Californian riparian zones surrounded by
   vineyards, urban areas, and natural areas. We assessed both local and
   landscape-level variables that may enhance native bird diversity in each
   land use type. We also demonstrate a new statistical approach,
   generalized estimating equations, to analyze highly variable data, such
   as that collected by volunteers. Avian abundance was highly correlated
   with both landscape context and local habitat variables, while avian
   richness was correlated with local habitat variables, specifically shrub
   richness, and percent of tree cover. In particular, shrub species
   richness has a strong positive correlation with riparian-preferring bird
   species. This suggests that active local management of riparian zones in
   human-dominated landscapes can increase our ability to retain native
   bird species in these areas.}},

Abstract = {{We review the existing literature on patterns of moth (Lepidoptera) and
   community composition ill northeastern Nearctic forest ecosystems across
   hierarchical scales ranging front individual trees to entire managed
   ecoregions. Moths are species-rich in northeastern forests of North
   America. with the most diverse families being, Noctuidae and
   Geometridae. Individual trees and forest stands, however, are often
   dominated by few species. Climate, stand age. disturbance regime, and
   landscape heterogeneity are significant predictors of abundance of
   dominant species. Most other moth species ill the regional pool are
   patchily dominant and appear to occur regularly at very low abundance.
   Moth communities respond predictably to forest-management practices, and
   the outcomes of postmanagement response are largely drivelly changes in
   the plant community. Significant reductions in moth species richness and
   changes in Community composition are correlated With Clear-cut
   harvesting, whereas selective logging appears to cause more moderate
   changes in moth community Structure. Broad-scale effects of forest
   fragmentation on moth communities in unglaciated regions are best
   described by species replacement rather than species loss: moth species
   richness decreases slightly across a gradient of fragment sizes'. but
   shifts in moth community composition are more important, especially ill
   the relative importance of herbaceous-plant-feeding species ill large
   and small fragments. Species that appear to be most sensitive to timber

Abstract = {{Point count distance sampling surveys were conducted at three sites in
   the Cordillera Vilcanota to determine whether variation in high-Andean
   species richness, diversity and abundance was a reflection of Polylepis
   habitat quantity. Bird community and abundance measures revealed that
   there was considerably variation in bird species richness, diversity and
   mean encounter rates between large, medium, and small forest patches.
   Densities of Polylepis-dependent bird species (including five
   globally-threatened and eight restricted-range species) were greater in
   larger forest patches and differed significantly between different patch
   size categories. Density estimates for matrix-dependent species were
   higher in smaller Polylepis patches indicating that the matrix exerts an
   influence on bird species composition and abundance in remnant Polylepis
   forests, particularly smaller patches. Comparison of lowland forest
   habitat specialists using three categories of rarity revealed that
   between 19-22\% of all Polylepis-dependent species were intrinsically
   rare within larger forest patches, and a greater number (34-74\%) were
   rare in smaller forest patches. Population estimates for all species, in
   particular for all threatened species, were extremely low, numbering <=
   10 individuals at nine of the ten sites examined. The results suggest
   that declines in the densities of certain Polylepis birds may be
   predictable following habitat loss and that these patterns of rarity
   should govern population recovery goals through appropriate habitat
   restoration strategies. Such strategies are urgently required and must
   be designed to prevent further habitat loss, and to increase Polylepis
   habitat quantity to boost threatened bird populations in the Cordillera

Abstract = {{Breeding bird communities were studied by line-transect in burnt
   pinewood and unburnt pinewoods, during three years subsequently to a
   fire event, in a coastal woodland of Mediterranean central Italy. We
   analyzed data following a diversity/dominance approach that ranks the
   species in order of their abundance, to obtain rank/abundance diagrams
   ('Whittaker plots'). Although it is generally accepted that fire may
   induce structural changes in forest communities of breeding birds, we
   observed more evident effects when considering the assemblage of
   forest-specialist species. When considering the whole community of
   birds, ordinate intercepts of the regression between rank and relative
   abundance of species were not significantly different between unburnt
   and burnt plots in any of the three years of study. However, when
   considering only the forest-related species, there was a significant
   difference between unburnt and burnt plots in all the years of study.
   Evenness showed lower values that were explicited by the
   diversity/dominance diagrams (lower collocation of the curves of burnt
   pinewoods if compared to unburnt ones). Overall, the patterns observed
   in this study suggest that the effects of fire disturbance were more
   evident at the ecological level than at the taxonomic-level assemblages.
   The gradual decline of the more sensitive species due to fires and the
   proportional increase of edge/generalist species may induce a species
   turnover in burnt woods with cascade and relaxation effects which could
   be evidenced by diversity/dominance diagrams. Consequently, it is useful
   to separate the effects of fires at community-level and at
   assemblage-level when studying bird communities in areas subjected to

   Panel on Animal Health and Welfare}},
Journal = {{EFSA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Following a request from the Commission, the AHAW panel was asked to
   deliver a scientific opinion on the animal health and welfare aspects of
   Avian Influenza and the risk of its introduction into the EU poultry
   holdings.
   More in particular, the Commission asked to update, consolidate and
   summarise the main conclusions and recommendations from previous EFSA
   opinions influenza (2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2007a and 2007b) in the light of
   new scientific evidence available. Further, the AHAW panel was asked to
   provide scientific advice and assess risk factors for the introduction
   and spread of avian influenza as defined in Council Directive 2005/94/EC
   into poultry holdings in the EU, to support a possible fine-tuning of
   current prevention and biosecurity measures taken by the Member States.
   New findings on AIV characteristics
   Phylogenetic analyses of strains from EU Member States indicated that
   all H5N1 viruses detected in the EU in poultry and wild birds since 2006
   were closely related and belong to clade 2.2 and 2.3. The use of
   phylogeny can advise on the source of infection, but it is not possible
   in all circumstances to be definitive about the likely source of an
   introduction.
   Pathogenesis and transmission
   Concerning the pathogenesis and the transmission of AIV, the main
   conclusions were that although fecal-oral infection chains govern the
   transmission of AIV, accumulating evidence indicates that H5N1 virus may
   be excreted at higher concentrations from the respiratory tract of birds
   as compared to LPAI viruses. This has important consequences for
   sampling methodologies to detect HPAI H5N1. Although there is no
   evidence for aerosol transmission of H5N1 virus, this transmission route
   cannot be excluded within short distances.
   Many, if not all, poultry species are susceptible to infection by AI
   viruses of the different subtypes, but only H5 and H7 subtypes are able
   to induce HPAI. H5N1 of the Asian lineage remains able to cause
   significant mortality in wild bird populations, although experimental
   studies show that some species can become infected without clinical
   manifestations, shedding virus whilst apparently healthy. Indirect
   evidence also points to some mild clinical effects of LPAIV in wild bird
   species
   Several domestic animals, including pigs, cats and dogs are susceptible
   to H5N1 HPAI viruses under natural and experimental conditions. H5N1
   failed to spread between mammal species, which makes the chance for
   virus transmission to humans extremely low. For cats, though, it has
   been suggested that spread between cats and from cats to poultry may
   occur. It remains to be examined whether the viral genetic changes that
   are required for adaptation of AI viruses to pigs or other mammals occur
   more readily in some animal species than in others.
   Diagnosis
   Viral isolation in embryonated eggs still remains the ``gold
   standard{''} for AI virus detection. Although it is slower, its
   diagnostic sensitivity is often superior or equal to many rapid tests.
   Virus genome detection by RT-PCR, which can be designed to detect all
   avian influenza A viruses or specific subtypes, provides a rapid,
   sensitive and convenient alternative for virus isolation. Any of the
   Influenza A commercial rapid tests can detect the Influenza viruses, but
   it should be emphasized that their specificity and sensitivity are
   limited for their application.
   The currently available serological tests are not all able to
   distinguish between sublineages or HP and LP strains. Furthermore,
   positive serological findings give no indication of current infection
   status. Competition tests are polyvalent and may be of use for obtaining
   broad estimate of infection levels in wild bird populations.
   Epidemiology and surveillance
   Enhanced surveillance both in poultry and wild birds in the EU during
   2006 to 2008 proved effective for the early detection of H5N1 HPAI.
   Passive surveillance proved to be important for the detection of H5N1
   HPAI infections in wild birds. In contrast active surveillance proved a
   better surveillance source to detect LPAI infections. Active
   surveillance remains an important source of epidemiological information
   of H5N1, especially around sites with active outbreaks. Due to the
   heterogeneity of the survey in the EU, the mobility of wild birds and
   the relatively small sample sizes compared to the overall population of
   wild birds in the EU, the surveillance results can not be used to
   estimate the true prevalence of AIV subtypes or their geographical
   distribution within the EU
   Current knowledge on EU outbreaks does not allow prediction of a risk
   season for H5N1 HPAI outbreak occurrence in the EU. Fewer H7 positive
   holdings than H5 and fewer duck and geese holdings positive for H7 than
   for H5 were found during the 2006-2007 survey. However due to the small
   sample sizes and the design of the surveillance strategy with varying
   degrees of targeting to risk factors, it is not possible to precisely
   estimate the actual prevalence of avian influenza of H5 and H7 subtypes
   in holdings of domestic poultry.
   Intervention strategies
   Biosecurity measures constitute important barriers to introduction of
   AIV into poultry holdings. Culling and safe disposal of poultry from
   infected holdings (as defined by 2005/94/EC) is one of the most
   effective measures limiting spread of virus. Pre-emptive culling of
   healthy poultry on holdings where AI is not thought to be present may be
   necessary to limit AIV spread in order to remove susceptible birds from
   the immediate vicinity.
   Potent subtype-restricted and safe AIV vaccines are available for use in
   poultry. Qualitycontrolled production and licensing procedures are
   essential to ensure vaccine efficacy. Vaccination induces protection
   against HPAIV induced clinical signs; it raises the barrier against
   infection with HPAIV field virus and reduces field virus excretion by
   amplitude and duration.
   The risk of ``silent spread{''} of AIV in vaccinated poultry populations
   requires stringent supervision and control of vaccination, including the
   application of DIVA strategies campaigns. Decisions on the use of
   vaccination depend on economical and structural aspects of the poultry
   sector and on epidemiological factors concerning risks of virus
   introduction and spread. Exit strategies from vaccination campaigns
   should be clearly defined before such campaigns commence and
   unrestricted use of AIV vaccines in poultry may give rise to an
   accelerated antigenic drift of field virus targets. In turn constant
   updates of vaccine virus strains may be required.
   Risk of introduction of Avian Influenza by wild birds
   Wild birds have been implicated in the geographical expansion of highly
   pathogenic avian influenza virus outbreaks across Asia, the Middle East,
   Europe and Africa. This should be considered in addition to traditional
   transmission by infected poultry, contaminated equipment, and people.
   Such a role requires excretion of virus in the absence of debilitating
   disease.
   Since the last EFSA opinion on the role of migratory birds for the
   spread of HPAI relatively few (21) wild bird species have been the
   subject of experimental infection, however, more birds than previously
   thought might be involved in the spread of avian influenza through
   shedding either in pre-symptomatic infection or in asymptomatic
   infection.
   Given the number of cases of HPAI H5N1 in wild birds observed over the
   last two years, the risk of introduction and release of HPAI by wild
   birds appears to be a regular, rather than a very rare or very frequent
   event and the constant presence of H5N1 in the wild bird population
   since 2006 cannot be excluded.
   However, it is still unclear to what extent wild bird species, from
   which HPAI has been isolated, act as vectors rather than serving as
   indicators of transmission by becoming infected by other vector species.
   H5N1 virus may be circulating at an undetectable level in wild bird
   populations across Europe.
   There is a continuing risk of introduction of AI into poultry
   populations from infected wild birds that may come into contact directly
   or indirectly with domestic poultry. Pathogenic amplification of avian
   influenza in domestic birds and subsequent spill-back to wild birds may
   complement the synergistic mechanism existing between domestic poultry
   and wild bird species responsible for the intercontinental spread of
   H5N1.
   Risks of AI introduction by the importation of live birds and avian
   products from third countries
   Infected live poultry are potential agents for introduction of AI
   especially when they are in their incubation period of HPAI, infected
   with LPAI or of a species that does not show overt clinical signs (such
   as seems to be the case for some duck species). Day old chicks and
   hatching eggs are not regarded as a big risk although HPAI infections
   can not be entirely excluded.
   Pigeons have previously been thought to be relatively resistant to
   infection by the virus and therefore regarded as a low risk in the
   spread of HPAI H5N1. However, some recent experimental studies have
   shown that they are susceptible to infection. It can not be excluded
   that pigeons act as mechanical carrier of virus. The sport pigeon racing
   over large distances from country to country -plus the procedure of
   gathering them together for release represents introduction risks that
   are unique to these birds.
   Wild captured birds pose a risk of introduction of HPAI. Import and
   quarantine provisions for captive birds have been revised and
   strengthened and are now restricted to birds bred in captivity from
   approved breeding establishments from a limited list of countries.
   Therefore only illegal importations would pose a risk. Importation of
   fresh meat has the highest risk of introducing of avian influenza with
   emphasis on duck meat due to the fact that the disease might not have
   been apparent before slaughter.
   Eggs for consumption may be infected with avian influenza; however they
   do not often come into contact with poultry again. Contaminated
   packaging materials and trays pose a far greater risk. Egg or meat
   products are usually subjected to a form of heat treatment which would
   inactivate the virus. Semen may be infected after viremia of the donor
   and a potential source of infection for HPAI.
   Veterinary checks on EU borders
   The check points at the EU borders have been improved over the last
   years but there are still many deficiencies. The TRACES system is also
   not fully implemented and therefore does not give the real time data of
   movements of live animals. Its active implementation across the EU is a
   high priority.
   Welfare aspects of avian influenza
   New developments of the welfare issues associated with avian influenza
   were discussed, i. e. on the killing of poultry for disease control
   including the use of dry or high extension rate foams delivering gases
   that kill by hypoxia. Other developments are mobile on-farm slaughter
   plants and whole house gassing techniques involving different gas
   mixtures, and also high-throughput electrocution techniques.
   Recent studies show that, where birds are handled by people during
   emergency killing, handling often causes much stress and injury.
   Portable shackling lines for electrical stunning and killing, using
   presently available equipment can fail in that birds are not killed but
   only stunned.
   The gassing of birds in buildings can kill poultry humanely provided
   that the building is reasonably sealed to exclude air entry, there is no
   functioning ventilation system, the gas jet does not directly contact
   birds, the gas is not cold enough to harm body tissue and the gas is an
   inert gas like argon or nitrogen or a gas mixture with no more than 30\%
   carbon dioxide.
   Recent work on carbon monoxide suggests that in addition to being
   dangerous for humans, it may cause poor welfare in poultry.
   Foams with a low gas to water extension ratio (100-140), such as high
   density fire fighting foam, kill by drowning (asphyxiation and hypoxia)
   and will often, or perhaps always, result in poor welfare in the birds.
   Foams with a high gas to water extension ratio (300 or more) surround
   the mouth of the birds with the gas so, if an inert gas such as nitrogen
   is used, the birds are stunned humanely and then killed by the gas.
   Ducks and geese are rendered unconscious and killed by gases such as CO2
   more slowly than chickens or turkeys so that exposure to CO2 gas leads
   to poor welfare for a longer time.
   Impact of avian influenza on biodiversity
   HPAI H5N1 continues to have significant implications for the
   conservation of several species of globally threatened waterbirds and
   may threaten the survival of endangered felids.
   From the little information available there is no indication about a
   direct threat of HPAI of poultry genetic diversity, except for localized
   genetics. There may be an indirect impact of the HPAI related measures
   including restocking and sector restructuring.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of agri -environment schemes (AESs) in promoting
   biodiversity was recently debated. One reason for limited effectiveness
   of AESs may be their application to small and scattered patches of land.
   This study presents the evaluation of a scheme adopted by the canton of
   Aargau, Switzerland, which seems to be unique in its consequent focus on
   entire farms, aiming at increasing quality and quantity of ecological
   compensated areas (ECAs). In vascular plants and snails, the species
   richness increased during a period of 5 years on plots with AES, but not
   on control plots without AES. In butterflies and birds, no significant
   differences were found between AES plots and control plots in the change
   of species richness over time. While butterfly species numbers generally
   decreased, bird species numbers increased on both AES plots and control
   plots. It appears that agri-environment schemes can be effective in
   protecting and promoting biodiversity, but the effect may depend on the
   group of organisms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Forest plantations of exotic conifers represent an important economic
   activity in NW Patagonia, Argentina. However, there is a remarkable lack
   of information on the impact of forestry on native biodiversity. We
   analyzed the effect of Pinus ponderosa plantations on bird communities,
   considering different stand management practices (dense and sparse tree
   covers), and different landscape contexts where they are planted
   (Austrocedrus chilensis forest and steppe). Ultimately we wished to
   assess in which way plantations may be designed and managed to improve
   biodiversity conservation. Bird richness and abundance did not change
   significantly in the steppe, although community composition did, and was
   partially replaced by a new community, similar to that of ecotonal
   forests. In contrast, in the A. chilensis forest areas, species richness
   decreased in dense plantations, but bird community composition remained
   relatively constant when replacing the native forest with pine
   plantations. Also, in A. chilensis forest, stand management practices
   aiming at maintaining low tree densities permit the presence of many
   bird species from the original habitat. In the steppe area in turn, both
   dense and sparse plantations are unsuitable for most steppe species,
   thus it is necessary to manage them at higher scales, maintaining the
   connectivity of the native matrix to prevent the fragmentation of bird
   populations. We conclude that pine plantations can provide habitat for a
   substantial number of native bird species, and this feature varies both
   with management practices and with the landscape context of areas where
   afforestation occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of valid indicators of biodiversity is a critical need
   for sustainable forest management. We developed compositional,
   structural and functional indicators of biodiversity for five taxonomic
   groups-bryophytes, vascular plants, spiders, hoverflies and birds-using
   data from 44 Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and ash (Fraxinus
   excelsior) plantation forests in Ireland. The best structural
   biodiversity indicator was stand stage, defined using a multivariate
   classification of forest structure variables. However, biodiversity
   trends over the forest cycle and between tree species differ among the
   taxonomic groups studied. Canopy cover was the main structural indicator
   and affected other structural variables such as cover of lower
   vegetation layers. Other structural indicators included deadwood and
   distances to forest edge and to broadleaved woodland. Functional
   indicators included stand age, site environmental characteristics and
   management practices. Compositional indicators were limited to more
   easily identifiable plant and bird species. Our results suggest that the
   biodiversity of any one of the species groups we surveyed cannot act as
   a surrogate for all of the other species groups. However, certain
   subgroups, such as forest bryophytes and saproxylic hoverflies, may be
   able to act as surrogates for each other. The indicators we have
   identified should be used together to identify stands of potentially
   high biodiversity or to evaluate the biodiversity effects of
   silvicultural management practices. They are readily assessed by
   non-specialists, ecologically meaningful and applicable over a broad
   area with similar climate conditions and silvicultural systems. The
   approach we have used to develop biodiversity indicators, including
   stand structural types, is widely relevant and can enhance sustainable
   forest management of plantations.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the importance of natural and manmade structural
   features on the avian community relative to management-induced
   vegetation dynamics. The study was conducted within the context of two
   alternative vegetation management treatments applied to pastures on a
   tallgrass prairie site in northcentral Oklahoma from 2001 to 2003. The
   brown-headed cowbird, a brood parasite, and the grasshopper sparrow, a
   common grassland obligate species, were most abundant in areas managed
   under a traditional treatment in which entire pastures were annually
   burned. Conversely, Henslow's sparrow, a grassland obligate of
   conservation concern, was completely absent from traditional treatment
   pastures. Total bird species diversity and grassland obligate richness
   was highest in the patch-burn treatment, in which only discrete portions
   of each pasture were burned each year to create a mosaic of vegetation
   `patches' in various stages of recovery from disturbance. Models of bird
   abundance reflected not only species-specific vegetation preferences,
   but also the often negative influence of structural features such as
   woody edges, roads, and ponds on breeding bird use of grasslands. Our
   study demonstrated that both disturbance-derived vegetation attributes
   and structural features contribute to heterogeneity and influence
   subsequent use by and composition of grassland bird communities. (C)

Abstract = {{We compared the effects of two contrasting silvicultural treatments and

   Forest. Each silvicultural treatment was applied to two approximately
   100aha units within each of three blocks. Prescribed burning was applied

   Occupancy was estimated at eight points in each plot for 11 bird species
   and three foraging guilds (bark gleaners, woodpeckers, and foliage
   gleaners). The frequencies of species detections on the point counts
   were used to estimate species richness on each plot. Occupancy did not

Abstract = {{The San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona is one of the last
   free-flowing rivers in the southwestern United States that maintains
   significant stretches of perennial water. While critical for birds, this
   river is vulnerable to salt cedar (tamarisk, Tamarix spp.) invasion,
   woody encroachment into grassland, and alteration of hydrologic regime
   resulting from groundwater pumping. Bird species richness and community
   composition metrics provide a means to assess effects of management or
   conservation efforts. To estimate these metrics, we used methods that
   incorporated species detection probabilities from data collected at 160
   points at 23 sites on the San Pedro River during 1998-2001. Species
   richness, co-occurrence, and uniqueness were estimated as a function of
   four riparian vegetation types (cottonwood-willow {[}Populus-Salix],
   salt cedar, mesquite {[}Prosopis spp], and grassland), three hydrologic
   regimes (perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral), and riparian location
   (floodplain and terrace). We found significantly higher species richness
   in cottonwood and mesquite compared with salt cedar and grassland.
   Intermittent and perennial flow sites had higher species richness
   compared with ephemeral. Cottonwood and mesquite supported more unique
   species compared with grassland and salt cedar, and cottonwood or
   perennial sites supported canopy or water-dependent species, for which
   habitat is rare on the landscape. Within the intermittent class, salt
   cedar maintained all estimated 0-2 unique species compared with native

   maintaining relatively high species richness, salt cedar contributed

Abstract = {{Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests with Cambel oak Quercus
   gambelii) are associated with higher bird abundance and diversity than
   are ponderosa pine forests lacking Gambel oak. Little is known, however,
   about specific structural characteristics of Gambel oak trees, clumps,
   and stands that may be important to birds in ponderosa pine-Gambel oak
   (hereafter pine-oak) forests. We examined associations among breeding
   birds and structural characteristics of Gambel oak at a scale similar in
   size to individual bird territories in pine-oak forests in northern
   Arizona and western New Mexico, USA. Avian species richness and
   occurrence of some bird species were associated with specific growth
   forms of Gambel oak. Estimated probability of Virginia's warblers
   (Vermivora virginiae), black-headed grosbeaks (Pheucticus
   melanocephalus), and red-faced warblers (Cardellina rubrifrons)
   occurring at points increased with increasing density of pole-sized
   Gambel oak 715 cm in diameter at breast height. We also found evidence
   that large Gambel oak trees (>= 23 cm dbh) were associated with
   increased occurrence of yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata) at
   points. Some avian associations with oak were influenced by
   characteristics of ponderosa pines. For example, bird species richness
   was positively associated with the abundance of large Gambel oak when
   density of large pine trees >= 23 cm in diameter at breast height was
   low. Because large oak trees are rare and their numbers are thought to
   be declining, efforts should be made to retain and promote growth of
   additional oaks in this size class. Forest management practices that
   maintain forest openings, such as prescribed burning, could promote
   growth of pole-sized Gambel oak, which appears important to some bird
   species in pine-oak forests.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the relationship between forest succession following fire and
   the composition of bird communities, we investigated the vegetation
   structure, bird population density, foraging behavior and guild
   structure in bamboo grasslands (11 years since the last fire), pine
   savanna (41 years), pine woodland (58 years), old-growth hemlock forest
   (never burned), and old-growth spruce forest (never burned) in the
   Tatachia area of central Taiwan. Canopy height, total foliage cover,
   tree density, total basal area of tree, total basal area of snags,
   foliage height diversity, and tree species richness all increased with
   successional age. However, shrub cover peaked in intermediate
   successional stages. The vertical profile of foliage cover was more
   diverse in later successional forests, which had more breeding bird
   species and ecological guilds. All the breeding bird species recorded in
   early and intermediate stages were also found distributed in the late
   successional forests. Because Taiwan has high precipitation and
   humidity, and most forest fires in Taiwan are caused by human
   activities, forest fires and large areas of early successional
   vegetation were probably rare in the mountain areas of Taiwan prior to
   the arrival of humans. Therefore, bird species have not had enough time
   to adapt to areas with early or intermediate successional vegetation.
   Moreover, late successional forests host all the major plant species
   found in the early and intermediate stages and have higher foliage
   height diversity index, which was positively correlated with the bird
   species richness and bird species diversity index in this study. As a
   result, all breeding bird species and guilds in the area can be found in
   late successional forests. Efforts for conserving avian diversity in
   Taiwan should focus on protecting the remaining native old-growth
   forests. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Large cavity-nesting birds depend on large-diameter trees for suitable
   nest sites. The increased spatial extent of commercial timber harvesting
   is modifying forest structure across the land base and may thus
   compromise the availability of large trees at the landscape scale. In
   this study, our objectives were to (1) characterize the availability of
   large living and dead trees in old-growth stands dominated by different
   tree species and surficial deposits that encompass the range of natural
   cover types of eastern Quebec's boreal forest; (2) analyze the
   distribution of trees among decay-classes; and (3) compare the
   availability of large trees in unharvested, remnant, and harvested
   stands for the entire range of decay-classes. A total of 116 line
   transects were distributed across unharvested forests, remnant linear
   forests, and cutblocks in cutover areas. Unharvested forest stands
   (black spruce {[}Picea mariana], balsam fir {[}Abies balsamea]-black
   spruce, balsam fir-white spruce {[}Picea glauca] and balsam fir)
   reflected a gradient of balsam fir dominance. The remnant forests
   selected were isolated for 5-15 years. Analyses were performed at two
   diameter cut-off values. Trees with DBH > 20 cm were considered for
   availability of total trees whereas trees with DBH > 30 cm were
   considered for availability of large trees. Forest stands comprised high
   proportions of standing dead trees (33\% of all stems, 8\% were large
   dead stems). Availability of total and large standing trees increased
   with the dominance of balsam fir in stands. Forest stands located on
   thick surficial deposits showed higher densities of large dead trees for
   every stand type suggesting a higher productivity on those sites.
   Availability of stems according to decay-classes showed a dome-shaped
   distribution with higher densities of snags in intermediate decay
   stages. However, for large stems, black spruce stands showed a
   significantly lower availability that was consistent across all
   decay-classes. In linear remnant forests, pure balsam fir stands were
   absent. Remnant stands thus showed a much lower availability in large
   trees when compared with unharvested balsam fir stands. Clearcuts had
   the lowest densities of dead trees across sampled stands. Current
   even-aged management practices clearly affect availability and
   recruitment of large trees, therefore forest-dwelling wildlife relying
   on these structures for breeding is likely to be affected by large-scale
   harvesting in coniferous boreal forests. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The study of successional gradients may help to understand the relative
   influence of habitat structure and competition on territory
   characteristics. Here, we evaluate the effects of vegetation cover,
   conspecific and heterospecific densities, and distance to the nearest
   neighbor on territory size, shape, and overlap in insectivorous birds.
   We studied these effects along a gradient of postfire habitat
   regeneration in which foliage cover and densities of focal species
   varied several-fold. We delineate 197 territories (minimum convex
   polygons) of the shrub-dwelling Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) and 255
   of the syntopic Sardinian (Sylvia melanocephala), subalpine (Sylvia
   cantillans) and melodious (Hippolais polyglotta) warblers at three plots
   in NE Catalonia (Spain and France) in 1987-2005. After accounting for
   the effect of the number of locations used to delineate polygons,
   generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) showed a reduction in territory
   area of the Dartford warbler as conspecific density increased and
   distance to nearest neighbor decreased, in accordance with the contender
   pressure hypothesis for territory size regulation. Heterospecific
   density was not included in the final model of territory size and the
   effect of habitat structure was marginal. Territory roundness was
   positively correlated with its size and with conspecific density,
   probably in relation to energetic constraints, and negatively with
   heterospecific density. Territorial exclusion was almost complete among
   Dartford warblers, whereas interspecific territory overlap was extensive
   and tended to increase with heterospecific density and with structural
   diversity along the gradient. Our results support the hypothesis that
   Mediterranean warbler coexistence derives from ecological segregation
   and not from interspecific territoriality.}},

Abstract = {{Unique components of tropical habitats, such as abundant vascular
   epiphytes, influence the distribution of species and can contribute to
   the high diversity of many animal groups in the tropics. However, the
   role of such features in habitat selection and demography of individual
   species has not been established. Understanding the mechanisms of
   habitat selection requires both experimental manipulation of habitat
   structure and detailed estimation of the behavioral and demographic
   response of animals, e. g., changes in movement patterns and survival
   probabilities. Such studies have not been conducted in natural tropical
   forest, perhaps because of high habitat heterogeneity, high species
   diversity, and low abundances of potential target species. Agroforestry
   systems support a less diverse. ora, with greater spatial homogeneity
   which, in turn, harbors lower overall species diversity with greater
   numerical dominance of common species, than natural forests.
   Furthermore, agroforestry systems are already extensively managed and
   lend themselves easily to larger scale habitat manipulations than
   protected natural forest. Thus, agroforestry systems provide a good
   model environment for beginning to understand processes underlying
   habitat selection in tropical forest animals. Here, we use multistate,
   capture-recapture models to investigate how the experimental removal of
   epiphytes affected monthly movement and survival probabilities of two
   resident bird species (Common Bush-Tanager {[}Chlorospingus
   ophthalmicus] and Golden-crowned Warbler {[}Basileuterus culicivorus])
   in a Mexican shade coffee plantation. We established two paired plots of
   epiphyte removal and control. We found that Bush-Tanagers were at least
   five times more likely to emigrate from plots where epiphytes were
   removed compared to control plots. Habitat-specific movement patterns
   were not detected in the warbler. However, unlike the Golden-crowned
   Warbler, Common Bush-Tanagers depend upon epiphytes for nest sites and
   (seasonally) for foraging. These dispersal patterns imply that active
   habitat selection based on the presence or absence of epiphytes occurs
   in C. ophthalmicus on our study area. Survival rates did not vary with
   habitat in either species. Interestingly, in both species, survival was
   higher in the nonbreeding season, when birds were in mixed-species
   flocks. Movement by Common Bush-Tanagers into areas with epiphytes
   occurred mostly during the breeding season, when mortality-driven
   opportunity was greatest.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation programs that facilitate restoration of natural areas on
   private land are one of the best strategies for recovery of valuable
   wetland acreage in critical ecoregions of the United States. Wetlands
   enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) provide
   many ecological functions but may be particularly important as habitat
   for migrant and resident waterbirds; however, use of, and factors
   associated with use of, CREP wetlands as stopover and breeding sites
   have not been evaluated. We surveyed a random sample of CREP wetlands in
   the Illinois River watershed in 2004 and 2005 to quantify use of
   restored wetlands by spring migrating and breeding waterbirds.
   Waterbirds used 75\% of wetlands during spring migration. Total use-day
   abundance for the entire spring migration ranged from 0 to 49,633 per
   wetland and averaged 6,437 +/- 1,887 (SE). Semipermanent wetlands
   supported the greatest total number of use-days and the greatest number
   of use-days relative to wetland area. Species richness ranged from 0 to
   42 ((x) over bar = 10.0 +/- 1.5 {[}SE]), and 5 of these species were
   classified as endangered in Illinois. Density of waterfowl breeding
   pairs ranged from 0.0 pairs/ha to 16.6 pairs/ha ((x) over bar = 1.9 +/-
   0.5 {[}SE] pairs/ha), and 16 species of wetland birds were identified as
   local breeders. Density of waterfowl broods ranged from 0.0 broods/ha to
   3.6 broods/ha and averaged 0.5 +/- 0.1 (SE) broods/ha. We also modeled
   spring stopover use, waterbird species richness, and waterfowl
   reproduction in relation to spatial, physical, and floristic
   characteristics of CREP wetlands. The best approximating models to
   explain variation in all 3 dependent variables included only the
   covariate accounting for level of hydrologic management (i.e., none,
   passive, or active). Active management was associated with 858\% greater
   use-days during spring than sites with only passive water management.
   Sites where hydrology was passively managed also averaged 402\% greater
   species richness than sites where no hydrologic management was possible.
   Density of waterfowl broods was 120\% greater on passively managed sites
   than on sites without water management but was 29\% less on sites with
   active compared to passive hydrologic management. Densities of waterfowl
   broods also were greatest when ratios of open water to cover were 70:30.
   Models that accounted for vegetation quality and landscape variables
   ranked lower than models based solely on hydrologic management or
   vegetation cover in all candidate sets. Although placement and
   clustering of sites may be critical for maintaining populations of some
   wetland bird species, these factors appeared to be less important for
   attracting migrant waterbirds in our study area. In the context of
   restored CREP wetlands, we suggest the greatest gains in waterbird use
   and reproduction may be accomplished by emphasizing site-specific
   restoration efforts related to hydrology and floristic structure.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{8-22}},

Abstract = {{Capsule Farmland bird species occurred at low densities and were highly
   aggregated in a small proportion of available pastures, stubble fields
   and farmyards.
   Aim To document the current distribution and abundance of farmland birds
   and their habitats within the lowland farmland of Britain in winter.
   Methods Over three winters volunteer observers visited a stratified
   random sample of 1090 1-km squares within which they counted a suite of
   30 farmland bird species and mapped agricultural habitats.
   Results For individual species, less than 10\% of habitat patches were
   occupied and densities in occupied patches were low. Several differences
   were apparent in patterns of relative abundance compared to the 1980s.
   In particular marked declines of Tree Sparrow and Corn Bunting were
   apparent. The national distribution of cereal stubbles was localized. A
   large proportion of most species was found in grassland. Positive
   associations at the patch scale were apparent for improved grassland by
   invertebrate feeders and cereal and maize stubbles and farmyards, mostly
   by granivores.
   Conclusion Many farmland passerines are highly aggregated, even within
   particularly favoured field types. These results are consistent with
   winter food resources being highly localized and the need to create more
   food-rich patches if declines are to be reversed.}},

Title = {{Rethinking avian response to Tamarix on the lower Colorado River: A

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Many of the world's large river systems have been greatly altered in the
   past century due to river regulation, agriculture, and invasion of
   introduced Tamarix spp. (saltcedar, tamarisk). These riverine ecosystems
   are known to provide important habitat for avian communities, but
   information on responses of birds to differing levels of Tamarix is not
   known. Past research on birds along the Colorado River has shown that
   avian abundance in general is greater in native than in non-native
   habitat. In this article, we address habitat restoration on the lower
   Colorado River by comparing abundance and diversity of avian communities
   at a matrix of different amounts of native and non-native habitats at
   National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona. Two major patterns emerged from
   this study: (1) Not all bird species responded to Tamarix in a similar
   fashion, and for many bird species, abundance was highest at
   intermediate Tamarix levels (40-60\%), suggesting a response threshold.
   (2) In Tamarix-dominated habitats, the greatest increase in bird
   abundance occurred when small amounts of native vegetation were present
   as a component of that habitat. In fact, Tamarix was the best vegetation
   predictor of avian abundance when compared to vegetation density and
   canopy cover. Our results suggest that to positively benefit avian
   abundance and diversity, one cost-effective way to rehabilitate larger
   monoculture Tamarix stands would be to add relatively low levels of
   native vegetation (similar to 20-40\%) within homogenous Tamarix
   habitat. In addition, this could be much more cost effective and
   feasible than attempting to replace all Tamarix with native vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{We compared winter (December, January, and February),and early spring
   (March and April) bird communities among 4 successional stages that
   included grassland, shrubsteppe, juniper-shrubsteppe, and old-growth
   juniper woodland in central Oregon. Birds were surveyed monthly from
   December through April in 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 using the point count
   method to estimate relative abundance of birds
   (individuals.transect(-1)year(-1)). We used distance sampling to correct
   for potential bias in estimating abundance and density among
   successional stages. A total of 4513 birds (32 species) were detected.
   Relative abundance of total birds (all species combined) was similar in
   the juniper-shrubsteppe and old-growth woodland (48.7 and 48.9
   individuals.transect(-1), respectively) but 6 times greater than in the
   grassland and shrubsteppe (8.0 and 7.7 individuals.transect(-1),
   respectively) during the 5-month period. Total density of birds was
   greater in old-growth juniper woodland and juniper shrubsteppe than in
   grassland or shrubsteppe. However, median bird species richness in
   1998/1999 was highest in grassland and lowest both in shrubsteppe and
   juniper-shrubsteppe, and in 1999/2000 it was highest in shrubsteppe and
   lowest in juniper-shrubsteppe and oldgrowth juniper woodland. American
   Robins and Townsend's Solitaires were the most abundant species in
   juniper-shrubsteppe and old-growth juniper woodland during the winter
   months. Sage Sparrows and Horned Larks were the most abundant species in
   shrubsteppe during winter, and Horned Larks were most abundant in
   grasslands during the early spring transition period prior to nesting.
   Our results indicate that a different suite of species use these
   successional stages during the nonbreeding season. If avifauna
   conservation is a part of long-term management goals, a broad range of
   successional stages Should be maintained on the landscape to provide
   habitat for it variety of avian species throughout the year.}},

Abstract = {{We studied bird community composition and abundance within the logged
   and unlogged forest areas of a certified forestry concession in lowland
   Bolivia. The logged forest was harvested using reduced-impact logging
   techniques between one and four years previously We used canonical
   correspondence analysis to describe the relationship between selected
   environmental variables and bird species abundance data, and the
   indicator Value procedure to test for associations between bird species
   and the logged and unlogged habitats. Approximately one-third of birds
   were restricted to either the logged or unlogged areas, with 20\% of all
   species only encountered in, or significantly more abundant in, the
   unlogged areas of the concession. The majority of birds found in
   significantly higher abundance in the unlogged areas of the concession
   were associated with forest habitats dominated by large trees, or a high
   diversity of trees, providing dense canopy cover and deep leaf litter,
   with an understorey dominated by ferns. Over 40\% of bird species that
   were significantly associated with the unlogged areas of the concession
   are of conservation concern. In contrast, the majority of birds
   associated with the logged areas of the concession are known to be
   relatively resilient to human disturbance. The majority of species which
   exhibited significant lower abundances in the logged areas of the
   concession belonged to insectivorous or frugivorous feeding guilds. We
   discuss whether current management practices within this certified
   concession are sustainable and how our results can be used to guide
   future research and inform better practice. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{1. Habitat destruction and fragmentation have led to precipitous
   declines in a number of species of concern. For these species,
   traditional models that group individuals into age or stage cohorts may
   not accurately capture the stochasticity associated with small
   populations. Additionally, traditional models do not explicitly
   incorporate landscape-level structure, which becomes increasingly
   important at small population sizes. Thus, for declining species,
   spatially explicit individual-based models (SEIBM) can be used to
   understand both population demography and the impacts of habitat
   destruction, and to guide management practices to increase the chances
   of species survival.
   2. To gauge the impacts of changes in habitat and also demographic rates
   on a US endangered species, we constructed an SEIBM for the Cape Sable
   seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis Howell) of the South
   Florida Everglades. The model simulates temporal and spatial dynamics of
   individual sparrows using local GIS-based topography, vegetation and
   hydrology along with behavioural and demographic rates derived from
   field studies.
   3. When adult mortality and, to a lesser extent, juvenile mortality were
   increased in model simulations, there was an increase in extinction risk
   and a decrease in population size, whereas changes in number of clutches
   or female mating range had little impact. In contrast to the effects of
   simulating changes in mortality rates, simulated landscape-level changes
   (increasing water levels or decreasing habitat availability) were
   associated with dramatic population declines and increases in extinction
   risk. The sparrow appears to be particularly sensitive to the loss of
   higher-elevation breeding habitat. These results highlight the
   importance of proper water- and land-use management in assuring the
   species' survival.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Although changes in demographic rates
   affect population growth and are often the focus of conservation
   efforts, changes in habitat structure can also dramatically alter
   population viability. When both landscape-level and demographic data are
   available, spatially explicit models are particularly advantageous. Not
   only do they allow researchers and resource managers to prioritize areas
   for habitat restoration and species management, but they can also be
   used to help focus future research efforts.}},

Title = {{Restoration of wet features for breeding waders on lowland grassland}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{305-314}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Over the last century, the loss of around half of the world's
   wetlands, principally through drainage and conversion to agriculture,
   has been one of the main drivers of declines in breeding waders. Across
   Europe, nature reserves have been effective conservation islands for
   breeding waders, but management of the wider countryside is needed for
   more wide-scale population recovery. This is likely to require the
   restoration of wet features, but in a manner which is compatible with
   farming operations.
   2. Here we explore the extent to which three types of wet feature
   influence the distribution of breeding lapwings Vanellus vanellus and
   their chicks on grassland. Footdrains are shallow channels used
   historically for drainage, but which can also be created and managed for
   water retention and cause little disruption to farming activities.
   Footdrain floods are areas where water overtops footdrains. Isolated
   pools are unmanaged areas of surface water resulting from rainfall or
   high water tables.
   3. We selected 70 fields on nine sites which spanned the range of wet
   feature type and cover in early April. By May, only around 10\% of the
   water within isolated pools remained, whereas 30-40\% water was
   maintained in footdrains into June.
   4. Fields with high footdrain flood densities attracted significantly
   higher densities of nesting lapwing and nests were more likely to be
   within 50 m of footdrain floods. Later in the season, footdrains were
   the primary remaining water source, and chick field use increased
   significantly with footdrain density. Chicks were also more likely to
   forage nearer footdrain floods in areas of wet mud created by receding
   water levels.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Areas of shallow, small-scale flooding
   are of critical importance for breeding waders. Management tools such as
   footdrains, coupled with appropriate hydrological management, provide a
   means of retaining water throughout the breeding season. Installation of
   these features is relatively simple, but maintaining sufficient water
   levels within the system is critical, especially in the face of
   increasingly unpredictable water supplies associated with climate
   change. Such management tools offer a solution that may be both
   effective at improving breeding wader populations and practicable for
   commercial grazing marsh management.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{315-324}},

Abstract = {{1. Managers considering restoration of landscapes often face a
   fundamental challenge - what should be the habitat composition of the
   restored landscape? We present a method for evaluating an important
   conservation trade-off inherent in making that decision.
   2. Oak savannas and grasslands were historically widespread across
   central North America but are now rare. Today, in north-west Indiana,
   USA, habitats spanning a range of woody vegetation density, from nearly
   treeless open habitats to forests, occur across the conserved landscape
   where savannas probably once dominated. To understand the benefits of
   different potential landscape compositions, we evaluated how different
   proportions of five habitats - open, savanna, woodland, scrub and forest
   - might affect the conservation value of the north-west Indiana
   landscape for birds. Two variables of potential conservation importance
   were examined: species diversity, a measure of avian community richness,
   and conservation index, the percentage of a bird species' global
   population occurring on a hectare of landscape, summed across all bird
   species present. Higher values of conservation index were associated
   with higher local densities of globally more rare and more threatened
   species.
   3. Conservation index and species diversity were correlated negatively
   across hypothetical landscapes composed of different proportions of the
   five habitats. Therefore, a management trade-off existed between
   conservation index and species diversity because landscapes that
   maximized species diversity differed from landscapes that maximized
   conservation index.
   4. A landscape of 50\% open, 22\% savanna, 15\% scrub and 13\% forest
   was predicted to represent a compromise at which conservation index and
   species diversity reached the same percentage of their maxima. In
   contrast, the current landscape is dominated by forest.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We quantified the trade-off between two
   potential aspects of a landscape's conservation value for birds - the
   landscape's ability to promote avian species diversity and the

Abstract = {{Large wildfires are common in many western coniferous forests, and these
   fires can affect woodpecker reproduction and habitat use. Our objectives
   were to examine nesting densities, reproductive parameters, and
   species-specific habitat selection of woodpeckers in a recently burned
   region of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, between 2001 and 2004.
   Postfire nesting densities were greatest in areas dominated by high
   prefire canopy cover, and reproductive success averaged >70\%. For some
   species of woodpeckers, factors such as diameter at breast height, burn
   severity, and distance to unburned patches were important for nest-site
   selection. Our data indicated that nesting densities of many woodpeckers
   in the Black Hills were lower than what has been recorded elsewhere
   following recent, large wildfires in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
   forests. Management activities that simulate mixed-severity fire effects
   and retain higher numbers of large snags are likely to benefit cavity
   nesters in this region.}},

Abstract = {{In British Columbia, Canada, management efforts used to control mountain
   pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks have included
   treatment of infested trees with an organic arsenic pesticide,
   monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA). Cumulative pesticide applications
   over a large geographic-area have generated concerns about arsenic
   loading in the environment and potential toxicity to nontarget wildlife.
   We investigated woodpecker foraging patterns in infested stands with and
   without MSMA treatment using a combination of tree debarking indices,
   point count surveys, and radiotelemetry methods in addition to insect
   flight traps to measure mountain pine beetle emergence. Debarking
   indices indicated woodpecker foraging of MSMA-treated trees was
   significantly lower than nontreated trees in all sampling years.
   However, similar to 40\% of MSMA trees had some evidence of foraging.
   Focal observations of foraging woodpeckers and point count surveys in
   MSMA treatment areas further confirmed that several species of
   woodpeckers regularly used MSMA stands during the breeding season.
   Radio-tagged Hairy (Picoides villosus) and Three-toed (Picoides
   dorsalis) Woodpeckers spent on average 13\% and 23\% (range 0-66\%) of
   their time, respectively, in treated stands, despite the fact that these
   areas only comprised on average I2\% of their core home range ( 1
   km(2)). MSMA strongly reduced the emergence of several bark beetle
   (Coleoptera, Scolytidae) species including the mountain pine beetle, and
   there was a highly significant positive relationship between
   Dendroctonus beetle abundance and Three-toed Woodpecker abundance. This
   study identifies the potential negative impact that forest management
   practices using pesticides can have on woodpecker populations that
   depend on bark beetles and their host trees.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting how bird populations may respond to climate change is a major
   challenge which could be addressed by understanding how past
   environmental processes have driven the variations of breeding
   population size and productivity. In inhabited regions, this issue may
   be complicated by the interference associated with heterogeneous levels
   of habitat management. Here, we have explored how several hydrological
   variables influenced the breeding of the Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus
   roseus in the Camargue (Rhone delta, southern France) over a 28-year
   period (1974-2001). In this region, Flamingos breed in a commercial salt
   pan. They forage in both salt pans and adjacent brackish lagoons. We
   hypothesized that breeding numbers, productivity and body condition of
   chicks at fledging were influenced positively by water levels of the
   Vaccares, the main lagoon of the delta, in spring (water and food
   availability) and the Rhone discharge in winter (nutrient availability
   in the salt pans). We controlled for variations of the flooding date of
   the breeding salt pan by the salt company and the size of the breeding
   island. We first found the Vaccares water levels and Rhone discharge to
   be negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).
   Secondly, the number of Flamingo breeding pairs (range 3560-22 200)
   increased by 1767 +/- 1418 (95\% CI) with a 10-day advance of the
   flooding date of the breeding salt pan and by 1146 +/- 1081 per 10-cm
   water level rise in the Vaccares. Productivity was 0.46 +/- 0.41 chicks
   per pair and could not be explained by any of the variables considered.
   Finally, chick body condition decreased with the number of breeding
   pairs and Rhone discharge. Our results show that (1) this intensely
   managed system remains sensitive to large-scale climate variations, (2)
   the breeding of the Greater Flamingo is affected by both climate
   variations and management of the salt pan, and (3) the expected
   enhancement of delta productivity by high river discharge was absent,
   probably prevented by dykes and embankments along the river. The
   response of bird populations to climate variations can thus be complex
   in intensely managed biological systems as found in the Mediterranean.
   We encourage pursuing such analyses incorporating anthropogenic
   variables explicitly in order to expand our capacity to make inference
   on the future of these systems.}},

   The results suggest that the observed decline in diversity of the top

Abstract = {{We report the effects of an extensive (> 7000 km(2)), high-intensity
   late-dry-season fire in the central Kimberley, Western Australia, on the
   species richness and abundance of mammals, reptiles and birds. Five
   weeks after the fire we surveyed 12 sites (six burnt, six unburnt); each
   pair of sites was closely matched for soil type and vegetation. The
   species richness and abundance of mammals and reptiles was greater at
   unburnt sites, especially for mammals (with a 4-fold difference in
   abundance between burnt and unburnt sites). There was an indication that
   reptiles immigrated into unburnt patches, but mammals did not. There
   were also species-specific responses to the fire: Rattus tunneyi and
   Pseudomys nanus were much more abundant in unburnt sites, whereas
   Pseudomys delicatulus was caught in equal numbers at burnt and unburnt
   sites. Diurnal reptiles were more abundant at unburnt sites, but
   nocturnal reptiles were equally common at burnt and unburnt sites. Avian
   species richness and overall abundance was similar between burnt and
   unburnt patches, although a few species showed preferences for one state
   or the other. The overall high trapping success for mammals (18\% across
   all sites; 28\% in unburnt patches) contrasts with the well documented
   mammal collapse in parts of northern Australia and seems paradoxical
   given that our study area has experienced the same increase in fire
   frequency and extent that is often blamed for species collapse. However,
   our study area has fewer pressures from other sources, including grazing
   by large herbivores, suggesting that the effects of these pressures, and
   their interaction with fire, may have been underestimated in previous

Abstract = {{The variability of natural disturbance regimes implies that retention
   cutting, aimed at emulating natural disturbances to support
   biodiversity, should be forest-type specific. We explored in four site
   types (ranging from dry nutrient-poor to wet nutrient-rich) in Estonia
   how the retention of live and dead trees affects post-cut abundance and
   species richness of birds. The whole bird communities and
   harvest-sensitive species groups responded differently: while the total
   abundance and relative species richness of birds increased along with
   the abundance of dead trees, the species of national conservation
   concern occurred more frequently at higher densities of live trees.
   Hence, although the species of conservation concern and hole-nesters
   preferred the cuts having the generally densest and most species-rich
   avian communities, this co-variation was obviously insufficient for
   using the total community characteristics (particularly density) as
   indicators of forestry impacts on bird biodiversity. In contrast to
   expectations, tree retention always influenced birds independently of
   forest type. This may be related to the particular study system (notably

Abstract = {{Agricultural land abandonment, widespread in the Mediterranean, is
   leading to a recovery of scrubland and forests which are replacing open
   habitats and increasing wildfire events. Using published data, we
   modelled the global and regional impact of abandonment and wildfires on
   554 species of terrestrial vertebrates occurring in Mediterranean
   Europe. For all groups except amphibians, open habitats or farmland
   sustained higher species richness. Open habitats showed regional
   differences in their conservation value, western areas being
   particularly important for birds and amphibians and eastern areas for
   reptiles. Scrublands hosted fewer species than open habitats, farmland
   and forest, but sustained several endemic birds and mammals. The greater
   species richness of forests was mostly due to species widespread in
   Europe. Wildfires promote scrubland expansion in detriment of forest;
   because more species are associated to eastern forests, fire is
   predicted to affect more seriously this region. Scrubland conservation
   value was found to be highest in the west, where fire might have a
   positive impact. Fire regime, however, plays a crucial role. Although
   large fires have a negative impact, small-scale fires may favour
   biodiversity in abandoned areas. Due to the intrinsic difficulty in
   managing abandoned land to preserve the original Mediterranean
   vertebrate diversity, the best option to achieve this goal is the
   development of policies designed to make farmers and traditional

   low understory and ground insectivores, and aerial insectivores all
   increased in density in treated stands. Overall, bark insectivores
   showed no density response to treatments. Tree foliage insectivore

Abstract = {{Mate change and fire suppression have facilitated expansion of
   pinyon-juniper woodlands into sage-brush-Steppe ecosystems of the Great
   Basin, USA, resulting in a loss of biological diversity To assess the
   effects of using prescribed fire in restoration efforts, ant abundance,
   species richness, and composition were examined pre- and post-burn along
   the elevation and tree cover gradients encompassed by a pinyon-juniper
   woodland in a central Nevada watershed. Ants were sampled using pitfall
   traps in 6 sites for the elevation study and in 2 sites for the tree
   cover study, representing paired burn and control sites in a ran domized
   block design. Vegetation and ground cover variables were also sampled to
   determine how variation in ant populations was correlated with
   differences in vegetation and ground cover. Ant species richness
   remained unchanged for all treatments. Tree cover had no significant
   effect on ant populations. Significantly more ants were trapped after
   the burn treatment on burn plots. Variation in ant populations was not
   directly correlated with any of the vegetation or ground cover
   variables. According to ANOVA and multivariate analyses, elevation had
   the greatest effect on changes in ant communities, likely due to
   increased moisture availability Our results suggest that management for
   conservation of sagebrush-steppe ecosystems in this and similar
   watersheds should include a range of elevations to ensure maximum ant
   species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Georgia land lottery maps from the 1820s reveal two tree species, water
   oak (Quercus nigra) and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), were
   formerly limited to major floodplains in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain.
   These species are now common in upland sites as a result of past land
   use and disruption of fire regimes. We investigated the effect this
   invasion had on breeding bird diversity in upland mixed pine (Pinus
   spp.) stands based on 90 point counts conducted in spring 2005. Half of
   these stands had no water oak or sweetgum (open stands) and half had a
   minimum of 25\% of their basal area as water oak and/or sweetgum
   (invaded stands). Bird species richness and abundance were 42 and 41 \%
   lower, respectively, in invaded stands. Thirty-five bird species had
   more than 20 records and were tested for an association with invaded
   stands. No species were positively associated with invaded stands while
   10 were negatively associated with invaded stands; these were mostly
   grassland pine savanna and shrubland bird species of high conservation
   value. Invasion of upland pine forest by these native tree species is
   similar to invasion by exotic species, and appears to disrupt ecosystem
   function causing declines in bird diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding bird communities in burnt and unburnt residual pinewoods were
   studied over 3 years by line-transect method, following a catastrophic
   fire event in Castelfusano (Rome, Central Italy; July 2000). We applied
   bootstrap procedures to evaluate whether the observed data were true or
   just produced by chance, and then examined the emerging patterns at
   three levels: community, guild and species levels. At the community
   level, fire acted on breeding bird communities by altering especially
   the total abundance patterns: the species abundance decreased in the
   burnt pinewood compared to the residual one, but other parameters were
   not significantly affected by fire. As a consequence of fire, the
   destruction and structural simplification of the canopy and shrubby
   component, as well as the increase of edge habitat and patchiness at
   landscape scale, induced a turnover in species between pinewoods.
   Species turnover was higher at the burnt than at the residual pinewoods,
   during all the 3 years of study. At the guild level, the forest species
   decreased strongly in terms of richness and abundance in the burnt
   pinewoods, contrary to the edge and open habitat species which increased
   in terms of richness, abundance and evenness. Edge species showed the
   highest turnover in burnt pinewood during the whole period of study. At
   species level, after an a priori subdivision (based on bibliographic
   search) of the various species in two ecological guilds (forest versus
   edge species), it was found that an a posteriori statistical analysis
   confirmed the expected trend, i.e. that the species which decreased
   significantly in burnt pinewood were essentially the forest species,
   whereas the species which increased were essentially the edge/open
   habitat ones. Overall, in order to investigate the effects of fire
   catastrophes on birds, the guild approach seems more exhaustive than the
   taxonomic community approach, where intrinsic confounding trends are
   present.}},

Abstract = {{Forestry is obliged to record as well as maintain and/or enhance
   biological diversity in forests due to national and international
   agreements. Accordingly, it is necessary to work out methodological
   approaches for the assessment of biodiversity in forests. In the study
   presented here, we focus on the total plant species pool (563 vascular
   plant and bryophyte species) of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests in NE
   Germany to identify indicators for plant species richness. We
   distinguished several groups like ``herb{''}, ``grass-like{''},
   ``woody{''}, ``endangered{''}, and ``exotic species{''}, for which we
   detected indicators for low (class \#1), intermediate (class \#2), and
   high (class \#3) species numbers. From a total of 84 species, which were
   identified by a three-step procedure, most indicators were found for
   class \#3. Only few indicators have been revealed for intermediate
   species numbers, i.e. class \#2. With help of Ellenberg's ecological
   indicator values and information on the main occurrence in Central
   European vegetation types and plant communities, respectively, we
   characterized the indicator species ecologically. The ecological site
   preferences of the indicator species in general reflect the fact that
   species richness is highest in base-rich, light, and anthropogenically
   disturbed pine forests. On the contrary, species-poor forests were
   revealed by indicators, which mainly occur on acidic sites. It is
   concluded that a considerable set of indicators for species richness can
   help facilitate biodiversity assessments in forestry and ecosystem
   restoration practice.}},

Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{734-749}},

Abstract = {{Oak savannas were historically common but are currently rare in the
   Midwestern United States. We assessed possible associations of bird
   species with savannas and other threatened habitats in the region by
   relating fire frequency and vegetation characteristics to seasonal
   densities of 72 bird species distributed across an open-forest gradient
   in northwestern Indiana. About one-third of the species did not exhibit
   statistically significant relationships with any combination of seven
   vegetation characteristics that included vegetation cover in Five
   vertical strata, dead tree density, and tree height. For 40\% of the
   remaining species, models best predicting species density incorporated
   tree density. Therefore, management based solely on manipulating tree
   density may not be an adequate strategy for managing bird populations
   along this open-forest gradient. Few species exhibited sharp peaks in
   predicted density under habitat conditions expected in restored
   savannas, suggesting that few savanna specialists occur among Midwestern
   bird species. When fire frequency, measured over fifteen years, was
   added to vegetation characteristics as a predictor of species density,
   it was incorporated into models for about one-quarter of species,
   suggesting that fire may modify habitat characteristics in ways that are
   important for birds but not captured by the structural habitat variables
   measured. Among those species, similar numbers had peaks in predicted
   density at low, intermediate, or high fire frequency. For species
   suggested by previous studies to have a preference for oak savannas
   along the open-forest gradient, estimated density was maximized at an
   average fire return interval of about one fire every three years.}},

Abstract = {{The hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus) is a keystone species in forest
   ecosystems of Washington, USA, providing nesting and roosting cavities
   for many species of wildlife. Therefore, management practices that
   promote healthy populations of this bird will help to conserve
   cavity-nesting communities as a whole. The objective of this study was
   to determine patterns in forest type and landscape use by hairy
   woodpeckers, and thus, provide landscape-level recommendations to forest
   managers. We documented the ranging patterns and habitat use of 23 hairy
   woodpeckers on the Olympic Peninsula using radiotelemetry and a
   Geographic Information System analysis. Use patterns of stand age, type,
   and size, as well as distance-from-edge analyses revealed that the hairy
   woodpecker is a relative generalist in its use of the managed forest
   landscape. However, certain features, such as older stands with large
   trees, were used more heavily by nesting pairs. Hairy woodpeckers used
   61-80-year forest stands significantly (P < 0.05) more than expected
   relative to their availability within the birds' home ranges. We also
   documented significant underuse of 6-10-year and 11-20-year stands,
   whereas the birds used 41-60-year stands, >80-year stands, and
   clear-cuts (<5 yr) equivalent to their availability. We suggest that
   hairy woodpeckers select older stands with larger, dying trees for
   foraging, but also use clear-cuts proportionally due to the residual
   snags, decaying trees, and remnant dead wood available. Higher use (P <
   0.001) by hairy woodpeckers of small forest patches (0-5 ha) and
   intermediate-sized stands (5-30 ha) than large patches (>30 ha) may be a
   result of the older, higher-quality habitat available in small stands in
   the managed forest landscape. We recommend that land managers interested
   in maintaining healthy managed forest ecosystems with a full complement
   of cavity-using species in forests of western Washington and
   northwestern Oregon maintain a landscape mosaic with approximately 45\%
   of the landscape in stands >40 years, and >30\% of the landscape in
   stands >60 years.}},

Abstract = {{We quantified breeding bird abundance, diversity, and indicator species
   in riparian and upland dry forests along 6 third- to fourth-order
   streams on the east slope of the Cascade Range, Washington, USA. Upland
   dry forest on southerly aspects was dominated by open ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa) and dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plant
   associations. Upland mesic forest on northerly aspects was dominated by
   closed-canopy Douglas-fir or dry grand fir (Abies grandis) plant
   associations. Riparian overstory vegetation was dominated by black
   cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) plant associations with a prominent
   hardwood tree and shrub component. We quantified bird assemblages,
   diversity, and abundance from parallel point transects on riparian and
   adjacent dry and mesic upslope forests. We detected 80 bird species from
   >12,000 point-transect observations during 1998-1999. Eighteen species
   accounted for 75\% of all detections. Species richness and evenness were
   similar in all 3 forest types, with approximately 35 species and high
   evenness (0.85) in each forest type. Bird species assemblages differed
   among dry, mesic, and riparian forest types, with the greatest
   differences between riparian and both dry and mesic upland forests.
   Riparian forest had the greatest number (9) of strong characteristic, or
   indictor, species among the 3 forest types. Upland mesic forest was
   characterized by 7 indicator species. Upland dry forest had 4 indicator
   species. Our results indicate that current standards and guidelines for
   riparian buffers zones would allow for avian refuge and corridor
   functions along these streams. Forest managers could use our indicator
   species to predict and monitor shifts in upland forest species
   composition from thinning and prescribed burning practices that are used
   to reduce fuels in uplands and to reduce continuity of fire effects
   between riparian and upland zones.}},

Abstract = {{Forest structure and diversity have generally been well studied, but the
   effects of anthropogenic disturbance on structural differences of
   hemi-boreal old-growth and managed mature stands have not been
   quantified along a wide range of the productivity gradient. This study
   compared 39 quantitative or qualitative characteristics and various
   widely accepted biodiversity indicators of a stand, its understorey and
   the forest floor in old-growth and conventionally managed mature stands
   of dry alvar and fresh boreo-nemoral forests. This study has to produce
   a statistically supported set of indicators for evaluating of forest
   ``naturalness{''}. We examined 154 stands over a wide biogeographical
   range in Estonia.
   Many forest structural characteristics, including stand basal area and
   composition, amount of dead wood, and coverage of understorey layers
   (shrub, herb and moss layers) followed productivity and/or
   biogeographical gradients. Old-growth forests had higher proportions of
   deciduous trees, a larger amount of coarse woody debris (CWD, consisting
   of logs and snags), a higher frequency of logs in each decay class, a
   denser understorey and herb layer, and a more heterogeneous pattern of
   herb layer diversity than mature managed forests. We found a correlation
   between live trees greater than 40 cm in diameter and forest age. The
   effects of forest management on the forest floor are both direct and
   indirect. Anthropogenic disturbance directly decreased shrub and herb
   layer coverage. Indirectly forest management increased herb layer
   coverage, proportion of graminoids, and species richness of the herb
   layer by improving light conditions as stand canopy was opened.
   The sets of indicators for assessing ecosystem quality in each forest
   site-type have overlapping features, such as the amount of dead wood,
   canopy closure of the stand and the presence of woodpeckers and specific
   lichens. Several other old-growth or disturbance indicators are
   forest-type specific, related to the composition of shrub and herb layer
   vegetation.
   Results suggest that stands managed with an extended rotation can be
   compositionally very similar to old-growth forests. Stands differ
   quantitatively in structural features, but these differences are
   confounded by other environmental factors, such as soil productivity,
   forest age or biogeography. Mature and old-growth forests still enclose
   features created by the mid-term (decades) and long-term (centuries)
   history of forest management practices. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Riparian zones and agricultural fields adjacent to incised streams in
   northwestern Mississippi are impacted by gully erosion initiated by
   runoff flowing over unstable streambanks. Currently, installation of
   erosion control structures (drop pipes) at the riparian
   zone-agricultural field interface halts gully erosion and simultaneously
   establishes one of four riparian habitat types. Avian communities were
   compared among four types of restored habitats and among four seasonal
   periods in northwestern Mississippi from June 1994 to May 1996.
   Fifty-seven species were observed among riparian habitats, of which 49\%
   were neotropical migrants. Habitat type and season significantly
   affected species richness, abundance, and diversity. Species richness,
   abundance, and diversity increased as habitat area, pool volume, and
   vertical structure of woody vegetation increased among riparian habitat
   types. Additionally, species richness, abundance, and diversity
   increased during spring and fall. The influence of habitat type on avian
   species richness, abundance, and diversity did not differ among seasons.
   Present drop pipe installation practices focus on erosion control
   without consideration of habitat creation. Installation practices can be
   altered to more effectively incorporate habitat creation to provide the
   greatest ecological benefits for avian communities within impacted
   riparian zones. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the frequent nature of fires and resultant drastic change in
   habitat following fire, research on the effects of fire on birds in the
   grasslands of South Africa is surprisingly scarce. For at least five
   months after burns we followed the changes in bird species composition,
   species richness and densities of two controlled burns and one
   accidental fire at the Barberspan Nature Reserve in grasslands that had
   not been burned or grazed in 10 years, Compared with the control areas,
   species richness and densities increased in the burned areas immediately
   following the burns, with more species and birds recruited to the burned
   areas than were lost. Immediate post-burn opportunists tended to be
   larger species, and the biomass increase mirrored the increases in
   species richness and densities in burned areas. Avian species richness,
   densities and biomass tended to return to the initial conditions after a
   number of months. Although the bird communities from two
   controlled-burns differed before the burns, they converged to a
   characteristic immediate post-burn composition. Five months after the
   burns however, the bird communities reflected a pre-burn composition.
   Indications were that birds in an area larger than that burned were
   affected. Mosaic burning, with shifting large and small patches, should
   be considered on a landscape scale.}},

Abstract = {{The study compared plant and avian diversity and species composition
   between four habitats to review the potential implications of two
   distinct management practices on a forestry estate, namely to
   rehabilitate riparian zones to grasslands or woodlands as the two
   habitats that historically occurred on the property. The study habitats
   were Plantation (Pinus trees in riparian zone), Bushland (recently
   harvested), Grassland (cleared of broadleaf plants), and Woodland
   (control). At seven sampling sites per habitat, a vegetation assessment
   was conducted, while birds were caught with mist nests. Plant species
   richness increased from Plantation to Woodland, whereas most bird
   species and individuals were found in Bushland. Plant and bird species
   composition differed significantly between habitats. Bushland and
   Grassland birds were closely associated with exotic forbs. Grassland
   attracted birds with diverse habitat and nesting-site associations, and
   Woodland birds associated with woody plants. It is recommended that the
   majority of riparian zones be managed as grasslands, although the exact
   affect of the biennial summer burning and presence of exotic plants on
   birds needs to be investigated. To attract cavity-nesting birds to the
   Estate, some suitable riparian zones should be rehabilitated to Woodland
   by planting Ficus and Acacia trees, as these trees are the most abundant
   and frequently occurring in this habitat. Rather than manage avian
   diversity per se, the African stonechat in Grassland and lesser
   honeyguide in Woodland can be employed as indicators of the
   rehabilitation state of the riparian zones.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the original forest and woodland cover on the western slopes of
   New South Wales and the northern plains of Victoria has been cleared for
   agriculture (wheat, sheep and cattle) and what remains is highly
   fragmented and modified by a long history of disturbance. Over the past
   three decades, native eucalypt trees and shrubs have been planted
   extensively in a part of this region to provide a range of environmental
   benefits. Our aim was to determine the extent to which these plantings
   could improve biological diversity in agricultural landscapes in
   south-eastern Australia and to identify the variables influencing their
   effectiveness. We sampled birds at 120 sites encompassing the range of
   available patch sizes, stand ages, floristic and structural conditions,
   and habitat attributes for revegetated areas and remnants of native
   vegetation, and we compared these to nearby paddocks. Eucalypt plantings
   were found to provide significant improvements in bird population
   density compared with cleared or sparsely treed paddocks, and mixed
   eucalypt and shrub plantings had similar bird communities to remnant
   native forest and woodland in the region. Birds displayed a strong
   response to patch size, with both larger (>= 5-20 ha) eucalypt plantings
   and larger (>= 5-20 ha) remnants having more species and more
   individuals per unit area than smaller (< 5 ha) patches of these
   vegetation types. Older (10-25 years) plantings had more bird species
   and individuals than young (< 10 years) plantings. The distance from
   remnant forest and woodland (habitat connectivity) appeared to be an
   important variable influencing bird species richness in eucalypt
   plantings. The main differences were due to the greater numbers of
   species classified as woodland-dependent in the larger-sized patches of
   plantings and remnants. Eucalypt plantings provided useful habitat for
   at least 10 declining woodland-dependent species, notably for the
   Speckled Warbler, Red-capped Robin and Rufous Whistler. The Brown
   Treecreeper and Dusky Woodswallow appeared to be the species most
   limited by the extent of remnant forest and woodland in the region.
   Plantings of all shapes and sizes, especially those larger than 5 ha,
   have an important role to play in providing habitat for many bird
   species. Restoration efforts are more likely to be successful if
   eucalypt plantings are established near existing remnant vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Reforestation of degraded lands in the tropics is one of the most
   important goals of ecological restoration. Restoration of montane wet
   forest is in progress at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge,
   Hawaii, using plantations of Acacia koa (koa), a canopy tree of montane
   wet forest. We used longhorned beetles (Plagithmysus claviger and P.
   varians) as indicator species to assess restoration. The beetles feed by
   boring into dead koa branches and are food for the endemic forest bird
   Hemignathus munroi. We quantified density of beetles in branches of koa
   from trees of 3 age categories: young plantations (3-8 y; 222 branches),
   older plantations (12-15 y; 212 branches), and canopy trees of intact
   forest (167 branches). We sampled by breaking dead branches into short
   pieces and counting the beetles within. Density of beetles was greater
   in canopy trees (4.89 beetles/branch) than in planted trees and was
   greater in older plantations (3.24 beetles/branch) than in younger
   plantations (0.90 beetles/ branch). Beetles were clumped in distribution
   among branches (coefficient of dispersion = 5.17). Mean basal diameter
   of branches in canopy trees (32.6 mm) was greater than in planted trees
   and was greater in older plantations (29.3 mm) than in young plantations
   (19.0 mm). In young and older plantations, branches that harbored
   beetles were larger than branches that did not, but in canopy trees
   there was no difference. Branch diameter had a positive effect on number
   of beetles per branch in all age categories. Koa plantations promote
   recovery of plant and animal biological diversity in degraded habitats
   formerly occupied by montane wet forest.}},

Abstract = {{Elevation has strong effects on climate and biota. In Hawaii, elevation
   on volcanic mountains affects temperature, rainfall, vegetation, and
   fauna. The effect of elevation on animal distribution and abundance can
   be direct through effects on climate or, in the case of phytophagous
   insects, indirectly mediated through climatic effects on host plants. In
   montane wet forests dominated by Metrosideros polymorpha (ohia lehua)
   and Acacia koa (koa), longhorned wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae,
   Plagithmysus) play an important role as decomposers of wood and as food
   for higher trophic levels. The beetles I studied feed exclusively on
   dead wood of koa. I assessed the effect of elevation on the density of
   longhorned beetles in plantations of koa at Hakalau Forest National
   Wildlife Refuge, Hawaii. Density per branch of longhorned beetles was
   more than twice as great in the low-elevation sample (1,620-1,650 m;
   3.49 beetles/branch, n = 200) as in the high-elevation sample
   (1,8801,970 m; 1.61 beetles/branch, n = 200; t = 5.08, P < 0.001).
   Beetles were contagiously distributed among branches at both low and
   high elevations (CD = 5.71). Size of branch had a consistent positive
   effect on density of beetles, although this effect was more pronounced
   at low elevation. Elevation affects biological diversity directly
   through climate and seasonality, and indirectly through climatic effects
   on key habitat features. Effects of seasonality and habitat features on
   longhorned beetles need further study in Hawaiian montane forest.}},

   The proposed method further allows identifying the best potential new
   sites to be included in the network, to reach target population sizes

   data from the French Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and spatial
   interpolation models known as kriging to predict the relative abundance
   of species at a national scale. We applied the proposed methodology to
   Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and a sample of 20 bird species
   concerned by the Directive of the Council of the European Community on
   the Conservation of Wild Birds. We estimated which relative part of the
   national population is included within the boundaries of all national
   SPAs. Our results suggest that the current SPA network is probably not
   efficient to ensure favorable national conservation status for the most
   widespread species, but allows reaching a 5\% target value for more
   localized ones. Consequently, we discuss the limit of such a protected
   area network to ensure the global conservation of widespread species,

Abstract = {{Rising societal demands for forest resources along with existing natural
   disturbance regimes suggest that sustainable forest management will
   increasingly depend on better understanding the cumulative effects of
   natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In North America, for example,
   there is increasing economic pressure to salvage log burned forests,
   although the ecological consequences of combining fire and harvesting on
   the same sites are unclear. We examined the short-term (2 year)
   responses of boreal forest ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) to the
   individual and combined effects of wildfire, harvesting, and herbicide.
   Ground beetle responses to wildfire and forestry-related disturbances
   differed strongly and suggested that, although some species may appear
   to benefit from disturbance combinations (e.g., Sericoda quadripunctata
   (DeGeer)), these effects are detrimental to others (e.g., Sericoda
   bembidioides Kirby). Species compositional variability was significantly
   reduced by disturbance combinations suggesting that multiple
   disturbances may lead to a simplification of this entire assemblage. In
   addition, ground beetle responses were correlated with changes in
   several key habitat parameters such as amount of woody debris, exposed
   ground, and plant species richness suggesting avenues for future study.
   Overall, however, our results suggest that efforts to avoid compounding
   disturbances on any site should be considered when developing current
   and future forest management guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the effects of 3 fuel reduction techniques and a control on
   breeding birds during 2001-2005 using 50-m point counts. Four
   experimental units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of 3
   replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, North
   Carolina, USA. Treatments were 1) prescribed burn, 2) mechanical
   understory reduction (chainsaw-felling of shrubs and small trees), 3)
   mechanical + burn, and 4) controls. We conducted mechanical treatments
   in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub
   cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls.
   Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn
   treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter
   burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird species did not
   detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species
   richness, total bird density, and some species, including indigo
   buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis),
   increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year
   delay; eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after
   treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers
   (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus)
   declined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to
   understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most
   species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag
   density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions,
   and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn
   treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species
   richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy
   intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory
   removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the
   mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy
   tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used
   as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open
   habitat while retaining many forest and generalist species, but may have
   short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the
   ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.}},

Abstract = {{Alteration of Iowa, USA, landscapes for agricultural production has
   resulted in a loss of >99\% of the original prairie and >95\% of native
   wetlands. This conversion has included riparian areas, which, as
   interfaces between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, are important to
   many wildlife species. Farm Bill programs have resulted in the
   reestablishment of millions of hectares of grasslands and wetlands
   nationwide, including >100,000 ha in riparian areas of the Midwest. We
   assessed plant and arthropod responses to burning and disking of
   riparian grasslands in east-central Iowa in 2001 and 2002. Burning
   altered the plant community by removing litter and standing dead
   vegetation and had negative effects on several arthropod taxa, including
   Hemiptera and Lepidoptera. However, we observed no differences in
   vegetation or arthropods between burned and unburned fields during the
   second year postburning (P > 0.05). Disking decreased the cover of
   grasses, litter, and standing dead vegetation and increased plant
   species richness and the cover of forbs and bare ground (P < 0.05).
   Arthropod abundance and dry biomass were greater on disked than undisked
   portions of fields (P < 0.05). Increases in the abundance and biomass of
   arthropods associated with changes in vegetation structure and
   composition likely improved habitat quality for a number of breeding
   bird species. Both burning and disking appear to be effective management
   options for maintaining or enhancing riparian grasslands for wildlife.}},

Abstract = {{A growing trend in public forest management is the inclusion of the
   public in the decision making process. Visual representations of the
   management process can assist in conveying complex management
   treatments. A second trend has been the promotion of biological
   diversity as a management objective. Ecosystem managers and restoration
   ecologists are using pre-settlement landscape patterns and forest
   conditions as a reference point to encourage the recovery of rare or
   extirpated species and habitat types. The problem is that information
   about pre-settlement conditions is limited. Our research goal was to
   visualize pre-settlement forests in Wisconsin and compare them with
   current forest conditions. Pre-settlement vegetation conditions were
   derived from computerized U.S. Public Land Survey records. Current
   forest conditions were derived from USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory
   and Analysis data. We used World Construction Set software (3D Nature,
   LLC) for the visualizations. Our results focus on ecosystems that are
   (a) still widespread but altered in structure and species composition
   (northern hardwoods communities) or (b) Greatly diminished in extent
   (pine barrens communities). We found there are substantial visual
   differences between current and pre-settlement forests, most notably in
   species composition, density, and stand structural complexity. Our
   results highlight the potential of computer visualization as a tool to
   aid forest managers and restoration ecologists. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A study was carried out in a tropical scrub forest in India, to
   investigate the effects of extractive activities such as fodder and
   firewood collection, on native bird communities and to study the
   relative influences of altered vegetation composition and structure. The
   study was based on comparison between six `disturbed' (extracted) and
   four `undisturbed' (non-extracted) sites that were delineated using
   quantitative disturbance indicators. Birds were sampled seven times over
   two different seasons utilising the fixed radius point count method. Six
   different variables related to vegetation structure (canopy cover, basal
   area, average forest height, tree density, tree height diversity and
   tree species richness) were quantified, as was tree species composition.
   There was no significant difference in number of recorded species or
   bird abundance between disturbed and undisturbed sites. However. bird
   species diversity was significantly lower in disturbed sites in
   comparison to undisturbed sites. Overall, bird species composition also
   differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Nine of
   38 locally abundant bird species (23.6\%) showed significant selection
   for either disturbed or undisturbed habitats. Of these nine species,
   seven chose undisturbed habitats and two chose disturbed. All seven
   species adversely affected by disturbance are primarily insectivorous.
   Canopy cover, tree basal area and height of trees were significantly
   lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. In both
   habitats, bird species composition was significantly dependent on these
   components of altered vegetation structure. Tree species composition was
   also significantly altered by disturbance in scrub forest. However,
   altered tree species composition did not significantly affect bird
   species composition. Partial Mantel's tests confirmed that there were no
   significant residual effects of tree species composition on bird
   composition after the effects of vegetation structure were accounted
   for. Our study indicates that rural biomass extraction can have
   significant effects upon bird species composition of tropical scrub
   forest which is caused principally by alteration of vegetation
   structure, rather than by changes in forest tree composition. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{Plant and bird diversity in the Indonesian jungle rubber agroforestry
   system was compared to that in primary forest and rubber plantations by
   integrating new and existing data from a lowland rain forest area in
   Sumatra. Jungle rubber gardens are low-input rubber (Hevea brasiliensis)
   agroforests that structurally resemble secondary forest and in which
   wild species are tolerated by the farmer. As primary forests have almost
   completely disappeared from the lowlands of the Sumatra peneplain, our
   aim was to assess the contribution of jungle rubber as a land use type
   to the conservation of plant and bird species, especially those that are
   associated with the forest interior of primary and old secondary forest.
   Species-accumulation curves were compiled for terrestrial and epiphytic
   pteridophytes, trees and birds, and for subsets of `forest species' of
   terrestrial pteridophytes and birds. Comparing jungle rubber and primary
   forest, groups differed in relative species richness patterns. Species
   richness in jungle rubber was slightly higher (terrestrial
   pteridophytes), similar (birds) or lower (epiphytic pteridophytes,
   trees, vascular plants as a whole) than in primary forest. For subsets
   of `forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds, species
   richness in jungle rubber was lower than in primary forest. For all
   groups, species richness in jungle rubber was generally higher than in
   rubber plantations. Although species conservation in jungle rubber is
   limited by management practices and by a slash-and-burn cycle for
   replanting of about 40 years, this forest-like land use does support
   species diversity in an impoverished landscape increasingly dominated by

Journal = {{AUK}},

Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{969-985}},

Abstract = {{Oak savannas and woodlands historically covered millions of hectares in
   the midwestern United States but are rare today. We evaluated the
   ecological distinctiveness and conservation value of savannas and
   woodlands by examining bird distributions across a fire-maintained
   woody-vegetation gradient in northwest Indiana encompassing five
   habitats-open habitats with low canopy cover, savannas, woodlands,
   scrublands, and forests-during migration, breeding, and overwintering.
   Savannas and woodlands were significantly different in overall bird
   species composition from open and forest habitats but were often
   intermediate between open and forest in guild densities. Few bird
   species were consistently and highly concentrated in savannas or
   woodlands, and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus)
   was the only species significantly more abundant in savannas and
   woodlands than in open, scrub, and forest habitats. Fire frequency over
   a 15-year interval was a significant predictor of bird community
   composition and was positively related to species diversity, spring
   transient migrant density, and density of the most threatened species.
   Each habitat type had characteristics potentially important for avian
   conservation. Scrub had the highest density of transient migrants, which
   suggests it plays an important role as migration stopover habitat. More
   species were significantly concentrated in open or forest habitats than
   in the other habitats. Lack of species concentration and intermediate
   community composition suggested that birds experienced savannas and
   woodlands more as ecotones than as habitats distinct from forests or
   grasslands. However, this intermediate character can benefit

Abstract = {{1. Habitat structure long has been identified as a primary factor
   influencing local assemblage composition. Most evidence has been in the
   form of correlations of species occurrence and assemblage composition
   over a range of habitats, with experimental verification of
   relationships being relatively uncommon because of the difficulties of
   enacting precise manipulations of habitat structure.
   2. Fallen timber (also known as coarse or large woody debris) is one of
   the few habitat-structural elements in forests and woodlands that can be
   manipulated with relatively high precision. We report on manipulations
   of wood-loads on 30 experimental 1-ha plots in floodplain forests of
   northern Victoria, Australia, over 4 years (one pre- and three
   post-manipulation).
   3. We show that very high wood-loads (80 Mg ha(-1)) and intermediate
   wood-loads derived from tree crowns (40 Mg ha(-1)) increase species
   richness (all species and ground-foraging species) and numbers of birds
   (all species and ground-foraging species) relative to the control plots.
   4. Three bird species consistently increased most following
   manipulations: white-plumed honeyeater Lichenostomus penicillatus (Gould
   1837) (fam. Meliphagidae), brown treecreeper Climacteris picumnus (Temm.
   \& Laug. 1824) (fam. Climacteridae) and yellow rosella Platycercus
   elegans flaveolus (Gould 1837) (fam. Psittacidae). The honeyeater is not
   considered as a ground or fallen timber dependent species, while the
   treecreeper and rosella both are regarded as being dependent on
   ground-layer structure.
   5. Fallen timber management needs to be considered in a landscape and
   temporal context for improving conservation of avian biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Predation is the primary cause of nest failure for northern bobwhites
   (Colinus virginianus). There are few reliable data documenting the
   species diversity and relative importance of bobwhite nest predators in
   southern Texas, USA. We used infrared video-monitoring systems to
   document nest fates of 127 bobwhite nests over 4 nesting seasons from
   2002 to 2005 in southern Texas. A majority of depredation events (83\%)
   were caused by 4 species: coyote (Canis latrans), striped skunk
   (Mephitis mephitis), southern fire ant (Solenopsis xyloni), and badger
   (Taxidea taxus). Observed bobwhite nest fates for the study period were
   0.50 successful, 0.34 depredated, and 0.16 abandoned or undetermined. A
   universal approach to mitigating nest predation is not likely to be
   applicable in regions similar to southern Texas, with high nest-predator
   diversity (e.g., fire ants, rodents, and mammalian carnivores). We
   believe that infrared video surveillance is a valuable tool for
   documenting baseline information on predator context and nest fate for
   many avian species, considering the limitations of past methods (e.g.,
   postfate evidence).}},

Title = {{Selecting Focal Songbird Species for Biodiversity Conservation
   Assessment: Response to Forest Cover Amount and Configuration}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Conservation of biodiversity is now a firmly entrenched objective of
   sustainable forest management, and emulating natural disturbance has
   been widely adopted as a conservation strategy. Yet the foundation for
   this approach is still very much a hypothesis based on first principles,
   and there has been little rigorous testing of the approach. In addition,
   practical constraints mean that the full range and character of natural
   patterns can never be implemented, so decisions must still be made in
   setting forest management targets and levels. An alternative, but
   complementary approach is to select a focal group of species and use
   their habitat requirements to define the range of conditions that should
   be maintained on the landscape. In this study, I used a balanced
   factorial sample design to test the effect of landscape vs. local scale
   factors for explaining relative abundance of 30 forest songbird species
   in boreal Ontario, and then examined components of variance, and used
   multivariate analysis and logistic regression to describe these
   relationships in more detail. Based on statistically defendable
   inferences and habitat model coefficients, 13 species were selected,
   with habitat associations ranging from high to low edge density,
   homogeneous to heterogeneous forest matrix, hardwood to softwood
   dominated overstory, young to old stands, and open to closed canopy. I
   found that variations in amount and configuration of mature forest cover
   had relatively little influence on the overall boreal forest songbird
   community, but that individual species differ in their response to these
   variables. To be successful, biodiversity conservation strategies must
   emulate the patterns created through natural disturbance by maintaining
   the full range of forest cover homogeneity and heterogeneity on the
   landscape. The habitat requirements for Alder Flycatcher,
   Black-and-white Warbler, Bay-breasted Warbler, Blackburnian Warbler,
   Brown Creeper, Common Yellowthroat, Chestnut-sided Warbler, Least
   Flycatcher, Ovenbird, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Red-eyed Vireo, Winter
   Wren, and White-throated Sparrow describe a broad range of habitat
   conditions that, at a minimum, describe necessary coarse-filter
   conditions to sustain the boreal songbird community in Ontario. This
   suite of species can also serve in developing a ``bioassay{''} to
   evaluate the effectiveness of forest policy to conserve biodiversity
   through emulation of natural disturbance.}},

Title = {{The perpetual forest: using undesirable species to bridge restoration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{604-614}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Conversion of established forests of undesirable species composition
   or structure to a multi-age, native forest community is a common
   restoration goal. However, for some ecosystems, the complexity of
   multiple disturbances and biotic factors requires unique approaches to
   advance community development. We use the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris
   Miller) ecosystem as a model of such a restoration paradigm with an
   approach that utilizes the undesirable species as a functional or
   structural bridge to foster ecological processes.
   2. In the conversion of adult slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.)
   plantations to the biologically diverse longleaf pine forests that once
   dominated the south-eastern US Coastal Plain, we examine techniques for
   restoring and maintaining critical structural and functional components.
   Through partial and variable retention of the undesirable slash pine
   canopy, establishment of longleaf pine seedlings is facilitated, while
   maintaining fuels essential for prescribed fire, a necessary management
   practice for longleaf pine. Furthermore, we project that with subsequent
   fires, fine fuels and species richness will be encouraged in the ground
   cover, and with future slash canopy harvest, established longleaf pine
   seedlings will be released.
   3. In this study, we present a statistical approach that examines the
   compositional movement of vegetation in restoration sites over time
   relative to the reference conditions that are also changing through
   time.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Restoration efforts that remove
   undesirable species initially may actually hinder rather than facilitate
   restoration. Restoration of fire-maintained ecosystems in which the
   production of adequate fuels is an important consideration may require
   the retention of a portion of the existing canopy to provide fuels
   during the restoration process, even if the canopy is comprised of less
   preferred species. Individual species often provide similar structural
   features and influences on function within an ecosystem; thus, systems
   other than longleaf pine may also benefit from retention of the
   undesirable species through the restoration process. We conclude that a
   gradual approach to restoration may be advantageous when legacies of
   past management have altered complex ecological dynamics and promoted
   development along a successional pathway strongly differing from that of
   the reference conditions.}},

   (Juniperus occidentalis), to 4) old-growth western juniper. Species
   richness, evenness, and diversity of bird communities were highest in
   old-growth and mid-successional juniper (22.9 species/transect and 23.6
   species/transect, respectively) but lowest in the grasslands (17.6
   species/transect). Bird species diversity was positively correlated with
   physiognomic cover diversity (r = 0. 74, P = 0.001). Density of breeding
   birds was greatest in old-growth juniper (6.6 birds/ha) and lowest in
   postburn grasslands (3.6 birds/ha) but similar in shrub-steppe and
   sagebrush-steppe-juniper (6.0 birds/ha and 5.5 birds/ha, respectively).
   Old-growth juniper had the highest total densities of both tree and

Abstract = {{The pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) is a species of
   conservation concern and an indicator of mature and old forest habitat
   conditions in the Pacific Northwest. The effects of natural and
   human-caused disturbance on density of nesting pairs, reproductive
   success, and traditional home ranges were compared over 30 years in two
   areas and over 15 years in five additional areas. In one study area,
   density of nesting pairs of pileated woodpeckers decreased from five to
   one after extensive regeneration cuts eliminated most of the stands of
   mature and old-growth grand fir (Abies grandis) and reduced the density
   of nest and roost trees and foraging substrate since 1990. Density of
   nesting pairs, reproductive success, and home range location remained
   fairly consistent over 30 years in a second study area with extensive
   tree mortality resulting from insect outbreaks but without regeneration
   harvests. The amount of unharvested stands and closed canopy stands in
   home ranges were positively correlated with reproductive success, and
   the amount of area in harvested stands was negatively correlated with
   reproductive success in 2003-05. High tree mortality and subsequent loss
   of canopy closure in stands of grand fir and Douglas-fir from insect
   outbreaks did not appear to be detrimental to pileated woodpeckers

Abstract = {{This study reports on the responses of bird assemblages to woodland
   clearance, fragmentation and habitat disturbance in central Queensland
   Australia, a region exposed to very high rates of vegetation clearance
   over the last two to three decades. Many previous studies of clearing
   impacts have considered situations where there is a very sharp
   management contrast between uncleared lands and cleared areas: in this
   situation, the contrast is more muted, because both cleared lands and
   uncleared savanna woodlands are exposed to cattle grazing, invasion by
   the exotic grass Cenchrus ciliaris and similar fire management. Bird
   species richness (at the scale of a 1-ha quadrat) was least in cleared
   areas (8.1 species), then regrowth areas (14.6 species), then uncleared
   woodlands (19.9 species). Richness at this scale was unrelated to
   woodland fragment size, connectivity or habitat condition; but declined
   significantly with increasing abundance of miners (interspecifically
   aggressive colonial honeyeaters). At whole of patch scale, richness
   increased with fragment size and decreased with abundance of miners.
   This study demonstrates complex responses of individual bird species to
   a regional management cocktail of disturbance elements. Of 71 individual
   bird species modelled for woodland fragment sites, the quadrat-level
   abundance of 40 species was significantly related to at least one
   variable representing environmental position (across a rainfall
   gradient), fragment condition, fragment size and/or connectivity. This
   study suggests that priorities for conservation management include:
   cessation of broad-scale clearing; increased protection for regrowth
   (particularly where this may bolster connectivity and/or size of
   woodland fragments); control of miners; maintenance of fallen woody
   debris in woodlands; increase in fire frequency; and reduction in the
   incidence of grazing and exotic pasture grass.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic changes in forest structure threats the persistence of
   numerous organisms. In Spain, Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests
   are mainly subjected to three sylvopastoral management systems which
   determine variations in the forest structure: (i) ``young forests{''}
   subjected to frequent disturbance by fires and clear-cuttings; (ii)
   ``Pyrenean oak dehesas{''}, subjected to a traditional sylvopastoral
   system exclusive to Spain which favours the development of both old oaks
   and pasture; (iii) largely undisturbed ``mature forests{''}. We examined
   the effects of these sylvopastoral management systems on habitat use and
   reproduction of the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius), a
   forest specialist bird, at the south-western edge of its distribution
   range. Habitat use was examined at multiple spatial scales. Within the
   territories, woodpeckers preferred large diameter oaks for foraging and
   decay oaks with holes for nesting. Within the forest tracts, no
   significant relationships between territory density and habitat
   structure in the forest tracts were found. At the landscape scale,
   dehesas and mature forests, both with high densities of important
   foraging and nesting trees, were occupied by woodpeckers. Young forests,
   with low densities of those trees, were avoided. No significant
   differences in territory density or reproductive success were found
   between dehesas and mature forests. The maintenance of viable woodpecker
   populations requires conservation actions at several spatial scales.
   Within the forest tracts, suitable densities of important foraging and
   nesting trees must be maintained. At the landscape scale, management
   decisions must consider the maintenance of traditional sylvopastoral
   systems in dehesas and mature forests. At the regional scale, taking
   into account a habitat cover in the landscape of the 7\% for the
   Cantabrian Mountains, we estimated an area of 285,000 ha to be included
   in the conservation planning unit for the middle spotted woodpecker. (c)

Abstract = {{Canadian boreal forests are increasingly modified by post-fire removal
   of trees (salvage logging), yet the ecological consequences of this
   practice are little studied. As mixed-wood forests have recently become
   accessible for salvage operations, we studied woodpeckers in mixed-wood
   (trembling aspen Populus tremuloides and white spruce Picea glauca) and
   adjacent coniferous (black spruce Picea mariana and jack pine Pinus
   banksiana) areas to examine the effects of salvage logging and burn
   severity on these species. During 2003-2004 we carried out transect
   counts in 24 landscape units (625 ha each) that varied in pre-fire
   amount of merchantable mixed-wood (low=7-15\% and high=25-35\% of the
   unit area), salvage logging intensity (from control=no salvaging to
   high=60-70\% of merchantable mixed-wood harvested) and burn severity
   (estimates based on tree survival after fire). Six main findings are
   presented: (1) in mixed-wood areas subjected to salvage, total
   woodpecker abundance and woodpeckers of the genus Picoides (most notably
   black-backed woodpecker Picoides arcticus) responded negatively to
   increasing salvage logging intensity; (2) northern flicker (Colaptes
   auratus) showed a marginally significant positive response to salvage in
   the mixed-wood areas; (3) the salvage response of the black-backed
   woodpecker was season dependent (first post-fire summer, winter and
   second post-fire summer compared); (4) in coniferous but not in
   mixed-wood areas, black-backed woodpecker responded positively to
   increasing burn severity. Moreover, the response in coniferous habitat
   was stronger in the first post-fire summer, compared to the subsequent
   winter and the second post-fire summer. In the retained mixed-wood
   areas, northern flicker responded positively to increasing burn
   severity; (5) the majority of the detected 73 woodpecker nests with
   chicks were in trembling aspen trees or in mixed-wood stands; (6) among
   coniferous tree species, dead standing jack pine and white spruce trees
   had much greater evidence of woodpecker foraging than had black spruce
   (ca. 65-75\% versus 15\% of trees). These results indicate the crucial
   influence of salvage logging, the amount of retained mixed-wood forests
   and burn severity on woodpecker abundance. Hence we recommend retention
   of large, burned mixed-wood areas during salvage harvesting to support
   these dead-wood dependent birds. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Historic losses and fragmentation of tallgrass prairie habitat to
   agriculture and urban development have led to declines in diversity and
   abundance of plants and birds associated with such habitat. Prescribed
   burning is a management strategy that has potential for restoring and
   rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, and through such
   restoration, might create habitat for birds dependent upon prairies. To
   provide improved data for management decision-making regarding the use
   of prescribed fire in tallgrass prairies, we compared responses of plant
   and bird communities on five burned and five unburned tallgrass prairie
   fragments at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, Iowa, USA, from 1995
   to 1997. Overall species richness and diversity were unaffected by
   burning, but individual species of plants and birds were affected by
   year-treatment interactions, including northern bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), which
   showed time-delayed increases in density on burned sites. Analyses of
   species/area relationships indicated that, collectively, many small
   sites did make significant contributions to plant biodiversity at
   landscape levels, supporting the overall conservation value of prairie
   fragments. In contrast, most birds species were present on larger sites.
   Thus, higher biodiversity in bird communities which contain
   area-sensitive species might require larger sites able to support
   larger, more stable populations, greater habitat heterogeneity, and
   greater opportunity for niche separation.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To evaluate the joint and independent effects of spatial location,
   landscape composition and landscape structure on the distribution
   patterns of bird and carabid beetle assemblages in a mosaic landscape
   dominated by pine plantation forests.
   Location A continuous 3000-ha landscape mosaic with native maritime pine
   Pinus pinaster plantations of different ages, deciduous woodlands and
   open habitats, located in the Landes de Gascogne forest of south-western
   France.
   Methods We sampled breeding birds by 20-min point counts and carabid
   beetles by pitfall trapping using a systematic grid sampling of 200
   points every 400 m over the whole landscape. Explanatory variables were
   composed of three data sets derived from GIS habitat mapping: (1)
   spatial variables (polynomial terms of geographical coordinates of
   samples), (2) landscape composition as the percentage cover of the six
   main habitats, and (3) landscape structure metrics including indices of
   fragmentation and spatial heterogeneity. We used canonical
   correspondence analysis with variance partitioning to evaluate the joint
   and independent effects of the three sets of variables on the ordination
   of species assemblages. Moran's I correlograms and Mantel tests were
   used to assess for spatial structure in species distribution and
   relationships with separate landscape attributes.
   Results Landscape composition was the main factor explaining the
   distribution patterns of birds and carabids at the mesoscale of 400 X
   400 m. Independent effects of spatial variables and landscape structure
   were still significant for bird assemblages once landscape composition
   was controlled for, but not for carabid assemblages. Spatial
   distributions of birds and carabids were primarily influenced by the
   amount of heathlands, young pine plantations, herbaceous firebreaks and
   deciduous woodlands. Deciduous woodland species had positive responses
   to edge density, while open habitat species were positively associated
   with mean patch area.
   Main conclusions Forest birds were favoured by an increase in deciduous
   woodland cover and landscape heterogeneity, but there was no evidence
   for a similar effect on carabid beetles. Fragmentation of open habitats
   negatively affected both early-successional birds and carabids,
   specialist species being restricted to large heathlands and young
   plantations. Several birds of conservation concern were associated with
   mosaics of woodlands and grasslands, especially meadows and firebreaks.
   Conserving biodiversity in mosaic plantation landscapes could be
   achieved by the maintenance of a significant amount of
   early-successional habitats and deciduous woodland patches within a
   conifer plantation matrix.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{411-421}},

Abstract = {{Riparian forest communities in the southwestern United States were
   historically structured by a disturbance regime of annual flooding. In
   recent decades, however, frequency of flooding has decreased and
   frequency of wildfires has increased. Riparian forests provide important
   breeding habitat for a large variety of bird species, and the effects of
   this altered disturbance regime on birds and their breeding habitat is
   largely unknown. To evaluate effects of high-intensity spring and summer
   wildfire on the quality of breeding bird habitat in the Middle Rio
   Grande valley, we measured vegetation structure and composition, avian
   nest use, and nest success at 4 unburned plots and 4 wildfire plots over
   a 3-year period. We measured avian nest use and success at nest boxes
   located in unburned riparian forest plots and plots recently burned by
   wildfire. Recent wildfire plots (< 7 yr after fire) had a much different
   vegetation structure than unburned plots; an older (> 7 yr after fire)
   wildfire plot more closely resembled its paired unburned plot than did
   recently burned plots. Ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens)
   and Bewick's wrens (Thryomanes bewickii; hereafter, flycatchers and
   wrens, respectively) used nest boxes in most of the plots. A model
   selection procedure applied to logistic regressions showed that
   frequency of nest box use by flycatchers was positively associated with
   wildfire, although flycatchers used boxes in unburned plots as well.
   Wrens showed a preferential use of nest boxes that were in unburned
   sites and in close proximity to vegetative cover. Growth rates, feeding
   rates, and fledging mass of flycatchers were similar in wildfire and
   unburned plots. Growth rates for wrens were slower in wildfire plots,
   while feeding rates and fledging mass were similar. Nest predation
   varied between years, was higher for flycatchers than for wrens, and was
   not directly influenced by wildfire. Model selection showed that
   predation increased with grass cover, an indicator of forest openness,
   and decreased with distance to habitat edge. Recovery of dense
   vegetation appears important in maintaining populations of Bewick's
   wrens, whereas ash-throated flycatchers were less sensitive to
   vegetative structure and composition of postfire succession. Postfire
   management that maintains nest sites in large forest strips would
   enhance nesting density and success of these cavity-nesting birds in
   riparian zones.}},

Abstract = {{Forestry practices such as fuel-reduction burning and maintenance of
   road networks can negatively impact avian assemblages, both directly by
   changing habitat structure and indirectly by creating conditions
   favorable for predators or competitors. The Brigalow Belt forests
   include some of the largest contiguous areas of native forest in the
   temperate and sub-humid zones of eastern Australia. Over I million ha of
   these forests are proposed to be converted from forestry to conservation
   tenure, yet the impacts on the avifauna of current and potential future
   forest management practices are not known. We investigated the influence
   of road edges and habitat type and structure on the avifauna of a 356
   000 ha forest. Survey sites were either < 50 m or > 300 m from a road,
   and in either cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla forest, spotted gum
   Corymbia citriodora forest with a regenerating cypress pine/buloke
   Allocasuarina luehmannii understorey or spotted gum forest with an open
   understorey due to fuel-reduction burning. The avifauma differed
   significantly among vegetation types but not with proximity to a road,
   with the greatest differences between cypress pine and both types of
   spotted gum forest. The noisy miner Manorina melanocephala, an
   aggressive avian competitor, appears to be the factor mediating these
   assemblage-level differences. Noisy miners were rare in cypress pine
   forest but were three times more numerous than any other species in
   spotted gum forest. Spotted gum forest with a regenerating understorey
   had fewer noisy miners. Although total bird abundance was highest in
   open spotted gum forest, the species richness and abundance of
   passerines smaller than noisy miners was significantly lower in this
   forest type. Abundance of small passerines was eight times higher in
   sites where < 3 noisy miners were recorded. Only one species, the
   eastern yellow robin, was influenced by proximity to a road edge.
   Cypress pine forest is potentially an important refuge for smaller
   birds. The results suggest that burning regimes that reduce regeneration
   of the cypress pine and buloke subcanopy in spotted gum forest
   potentially are exacerbating the problem of noisy miner domination of
   the avifauna. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of burn severity on avian communities are poorly understood,
   yet this information is crucial to. re management programs. To quantify
   avian response patterns along a burn severity gradient, we sampled 49
   random plots ( 2001 - 2002) at the 17351- ha Cerro Grande Fire ( 2000)
   in New Mexico, USA. Additionally, pre-. re avian surveys ( 1986 1988,
   1990) created a unique opportunity to quantify avifaunal changes in 13
   pre-. re transects ( resampled in 2002) and to compare two designs for
   analyzing the effects of unplanned disturbances: after- only analysis
   and before - after comparisons. Distance analysis was used to calculate
   densities. We analyzed after- only densities for 21 species using
   gradient analysis, which detected a broad range of responses to
   increasing burn severity: (I) large significant declines, (II) weak, but
   signi. cant declines, (III) no signi. cant density changes, (IV) peak
   densities in low- or moderate- severity patches, (V) weak, but signi.
   cant increases, and (VI) large signi. cant increases. Overall, 71\% of
   the species included in the after- only gradient analysis exhibited
   either positive or neutral density responses to. re effects across all
   or portions of the severity gradient ( responses III - VI). We used pre/
   post pairs analysis to quantify density changes for 15 species using
   before - after comparisons; spatiotemporal variation in densities was
   large and confounded. re effects for most species. Only four species
   demonstrated signi. cant effects of burn severity, and their densities
   were all higher in burned compared to unburned forests. Pre- and post-.
   re community similarity was high except in high- severity areas. Species
   richness was similar pre- and post-. re across all burn severities.
   Thus, ecosystem restoration programs based on the assumption that recent
   severe. res in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have overriding
   negative ecological effects are not supported by our study of post-. re
   avian communities. This study illustrates the importance of quantifying
   burn severity and controlling confounding sources of spatiotemporal
   variation in studies of. re effects. After- only gradient analysis can
   be an efficient tool for quantifying. re effects. This analysis can also
   augment historical data sets that have small samples sizes coupled with
   high non- process variation, which limits the power of before - after
   comparisons.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat restoration can partially compensate for the extensive loss of
   coastal wetlands, but creation of functional habitat and assessment of
   restoration success remain challenging tasks. To evaluate wintering
   shorebird use of restored coastal wetlands, we quantified shorebird
   assemblages and behavior of selected focal species at five restored
   sites and paired reference sites in Mugu Lagoon, southern California,
   United States. The Shannon-Wiener index of species diversity (for all
   birds in order Charadriiformes) was higher in the restored than in the
   reference portion of three of the five sites, higher in the reference
   portion of a fourth site, and similar between reference and restored
   areas of the fifth site. Species diversity was lower in sites closer to
   man-made structures. The four most abundant species groups across the
   five sites were selected for detailed analysis of site use and behavior:
   Willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus), Marbled Godwits (Limosa fedoa),
   Dowitchers (Limnodromus spp.), and Sandpipers (Calidris spp.) (Western,
   Least, and Dunlin). Each focal species group exhibited distinct site
   preferences, and densities in restored sites were often as high or
   higher than in reference sites. Willets and Dowitchers preferred
   habitats with more extensive tidal flats, a characteristic of restored
   sites. Godwits and Sandpipers preferred heterogeneous habitats with a
   mix of water and tidal flats. Most birds were engaged in feeding
   activities during the ebb tides surveyed, and there were no apparent
   differences in behavior between reference and restored sites. Though not
   all restored sites were used equally by all species, the creation of
   multiple restored sites with varied habitat characteristics attracted a
   diverse assemblage of shorebirds and may have contributed to the
   integrity of the regional wetland landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Winter roosts afford escape from extreme climatic conditions, reduce
   heat and energy loss, and provide protection from predators for North
   American woodpeckers. We monitored the use and characteristics of 12
   winter roosts used by nine radio-marked Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides
   villosus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern
   Arizona that had experienced wildfire in 1996 and 2000. Roost trees were
   larger in diameter than 95\% of non-roost trees and on average 2.5 times
   larger within burned areas of similar severity. Roost trees were within
   patches less dense than 95\% of measured patches across study sites,
   which were on average 1.5 times as dense. Two-thirds of roost trees were
   created by fire and were smaller than those created by other means. Six
   birds each used one roost and three males each used two roosts.
   Two-thirds of the roosts were outside or on the edge of estimated home
   ranges. Maximum straight-line distances traveled, from roost to farthest
   point of home range, were > 1 km for 8 of 9 birds. Woodpeckers have a
   significant role in providing cavities for secondary cavity nesters.
   Thus, understanding habitat requirements for winter roosts could provide
   managers with essential tools to maintain or enhance populations of this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the nest densities and nest survival of seven
   cavity-nesting bird species, including four open-space foragers
   (American Kestrel {[}Falco sparperius], Lewis's Woodpecker {[}Melanerpes
   lewis], Western Bluebird {[}Sialia mexicana], and Mountain Bluebird
   {[}S. currucoides]) and three wood-foragers (Hairy Woodpecker
   {[}Picoides villosus], Black-backed Woodpecker {[}P. arcticus], and
   Northern Flicker {[}Colaptes auratus]), after two wildfires (one
   partially salvage-logged and one unlogged) in western Idaho from
   1994-2004. We estimated the relationship between nest density and time
   since fire, tested for statistical differences in nest densities and
   nest survival in the partially salvage-logged vs. unlogged wildfires,
   and tested for differences in nest survival between early (1-4 years
   after fire) and late (5-12 years after fire) postfire periods. Nest
   densities of open-space foragers and Northern Flickers generally
   increased with time since fire, whereas nest densities of Black-backed
   and Hairy Woodpeckers peaked 4-5 years postfire. Nest densities of
   wood-foraging species and Mountain Bluebirds were significantly higher
   in the unlogged burn, whereas Lewis's Woodpeckers had significantly
   higher nest densities in the partially logged burn. Kestrels tended to
   favor the partially logged burn, while Western Bluebird nest densities
   were nearly equal in both burned areas. For most species, postfire
   period and treatment (partially logged vs. unlogged) had little
   influence on nest survival. However, Hairy Woodpecker nest survival was
   significantly lower in the partially logged burn versus the unlogged
   wildfire in the early postfire period, and Lewis's Woodpecker nest
   survival was significantly reduced in the later postfire period versus
   the early postfire period in the partially logged burn. Importantly, the
   salvage logging was designed to retain more than half of the snags over
   23 cm in diameter, which provided suitable nesting habitat for
   open-space foragers during the decade following fire.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of four prescribed burning regimes (annual, 2-
   to 3-y, 4- to 7-y, and unburned) on avian communities in western
   Louisiana longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) stands for two spring (May and
   June) and two winter (January and February) seasons. Avian species
   richness and abundance were evaluated by season. During spring,
   red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis), Bachman's sparrows
   (Aimophila aestivalis), and pine warblers (Dendroica pinus) showed
   increasing abundance with increasing frequency of fire. Four resident
   and six Neotropical migrant species increased with decreased frequency
   of fire (P <= 0.05). During winter, numbers of red-cockaded woodpeckers,
   pine warblers, and brown-headed nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) increased
   with increased regularity of fires; no temperate-zone migrant species
   displayed such an increase. Six resident and six temperate-zone migrant
   species increased with decreasing frequency of fire (P <= 0.05).
   Although avian species richness and abundance increased with decreasing
   frequency of fire, species that increased in abundance or were not
   present in frequently burned stands are not currently in jeopardy. The
   longleaf pine-grassland forest type occupies <5\% of its original area;
   therefore, this type must be maintained and its extent expanded because
   it is critical to some avian species that are declining in numbers.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{18-33}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Information about how vegetation composition and structure vary
   quantitatively and spatially with physical environment, disturbance
   history, and land ownership is fundamental to regional conservation
   planning. However, current knowledge about patterns of vegetation
   variability across large regions that is spatially explicit (i.e.,
   mapped) tends to be general and qualitative. We used spatial predictions
   from gradient models to examine the influence of environment,
   disturbance, and ownership on patterns of forest vegetation biodiversity
   across a large forested region, the 3-million-ha Oregon Coast Range
   (USA). Gradients in tree species composition were strongly associated
   with environment, especially climate, and insensitive to disturbance,
   probably because many dominant tree species are long-lived and persist
   throughout forest succession. In contrast, forest structure was strongly
   correlated with disturbance and only weakly with environmental
   gradients. Although forest structure differed among ownerships,
   differences were blurred by the presence of legacy trees that originated
   prior to current forest management regimes. Our multi-ownership
   perspective revealed biodiversity concerns and benefits not readily
   visible in single-ownership analyses, and all ownerships contributed to
   regional biodiversity values. Federal lands provided most of the
   late-successional and old-growth forest. State lands contained a range
   of forest ages and structures, including diverse young forest, abundant
   legacy dead wood, and much of the high-elevation true fir forest.
   Nonindustrial private lands provided diverse young forest and the
   greatest abundance of hardwood trees, including almost all of the
   foothill oak woodlands. Forest industry lands encompassed much
   early-successional forest, most of the mixed hardwood-conifer forest,
   and large amounts of legacy down wood. The detailed tree- and
   species-level data in the maps revealed regional trends that would be
   masked in traditional coarse-filter assessment. Although abundant, most
   early-successional forests originated after timber harvest and lacked
   legacy live and dead trees important as habitat and for other ecological
   functions. Many large-conifer forests that might be classified as old
   growth using a generalized forest cover map lacked structural features
   of old growth such as multilayered canopies or dead wood. Our findings
   suggest that regional conservation planning include all ownerships and
   land allocations, as well as fine-scale elements of vegetation
   composition and structure.}},

   Ground Parrot in relation to fire}},
Journal = {{EMU}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{79-88}},
Abstract = {{Measures of abundance and population trends are necessary for informed
   management of rare species, but obtaining reliable estimates of sparsely
   occurring species is an ongoing challenge in conservation biology. It is
   even more difficult when the species of interest is also cryptic. We
   censused a population of one such species, the Western Ground Parrot (
   Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), over several years to develop a
   monitoring protocol to assist in future management, extend understanding
   of its response to fire, and provide a model that could be used with
   other cryptic bird species. Abundance of Western Ground Parrots,
   monitored by means of calling frequencies, varied from year to year at a
   study site in Fitzgerald River National Park, south- western Australia.
   Frequency of calling increased significantly from 1996 to 2000. During
   this time, frequency of calling peaked in 1998 in part of the study site
   that had been unburnt for more than 40 years, and remained high in 2000.
   Frequency of calling was similar in a more recently burnt part of the
   study area except in May 1998, when frequency was lower following a fire
   that burnt part of this area five months previously. Frequency of
   calling dropped significantly in both the long unburnt and recently
   burnt areas between 2000 and 2004; exact reasons for this are unknown.
   Western Ground Parrots can use recently burnt vegetation where it is
   immediately adjacent to an established population, but do not need fire
   to create habitat, at least in the timescale of 40 years. The current
   monitoring protocol, where eight listening posts are counted
   approximately three times each, is capable of detecting an annual change
   in frequency of calling of similar to 13\%. The number of listening
   posts would need to be increased to 14 in order to detect an annual
   change of 10\%, and would need to be increased to 40 in order to detect
   an annual change of 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{We have designed a system that predicts species richness in the mixed
   wood boreal forest of Canada. The system is based on a simple
   multivariate linear model that uses four landscape characteristics as
   independent variables: canopy species type, distance from the nearest
   ridgeline, time since the last fire and canopy stem density. The model
   is shown to provide statistically significant estimates of richness when
   using observed independent variables. We developed models for estimating
   the four landscape characteristics from geospatial data consisting of
   remotely sensed imagery and a digital elevation model. We ran the model
   at the stand scale and the pixel scale and found that stand scale
   predictions were be more accurate that pixel scale predictions. We
   produced a map of vegetation species richness for Prince Alberta
   National Park in central Saskatchewan Canada that is consistent with our
   expectations. We also estimated the uncertainty in the four landscape
   characteristic estimates and developed a methodology for propagating
   this uncertainty through the system to produce estimates of uncertainty
   in the pixel-based richness predictions. While the uncertainty. is
   significant, the estimation and management of uncertainty in a mapping
   system of this type represents an innovation.}},

   impermeable pavement were analyzed as water-circulation. Lastly,
   although the ratio of forest and river biotope was high, those were
   distributed in the suburbs of Seoul and were artificially established.
   In addition, the damp areas which had critical functions as habitats in
   the city were distributed on a small-scale. Therefore, as the direction
   of energy circulation plan, 7 detailed planning items were required as
   follows : the improvement of roadside' s trees and green spaces, the
   formation of brook street, tree-planting in the school' s playground, an
   extension and new formation of children' s park green space,
   tree-planting around public institutions and religious facilities,
   tree-planting on roofs and walls, an increase in green space around
   apartment complexes and the establishment of environment-ecological
   planning. In terms of water circulation; ecological restoration of
   artificial rivers, security of rainfall reservoir and establishment of
   residential area with satisfactory water circulation were suggested.
   Also, improvement plans for the biological diversity must be established
   by classifying into the three parts; the security of the biological
   habitats, the formation of urban ecological axis and the activation of
   ecological culture.}},

Pages = {{279-295}},
Abstract = {{Restoration Ecology is the application of principles from Evolutionary
   Ecology to recover ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or
   destroyed by human activities. Successful restoration requires clearly
   defined objectives and the means to assess progress in meeting them.
   Often this includes monitoring population trajectories (changes in
   population size over time) of focal species. Unfortunately, population
   trajectories in and of themselves are often ambiguous and open to
   interpretation. Incorporation of additional information can increase the
   information content of such monitoring programs. Here we advocate using
   behavioral indicators, particularly the giving-up density (GUD) of food
   in experimental foraging patches, to complement more traditional
   monitoring programs that track changes in population sizes over time. We
   use the results of two field studies to demonstrate how GUDs reflect
   changes in environmental quality (background food abundance), changing
   physiological costs of maintenance over an annual cycle, and risk of
   predation. We then illustrate, through hypothetical examples, how
   knowledge of changes in GUDs over time can inform interpretation of
   actual population trajectories (based on 12 years of monitoring) of four
   bird species of conservation concern at the United States Forest Service
   Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois, USA. We conclude with a
   prospectus providing guidelines for incorporating behavioral indicators
   like the GUD in monitoring programs. Integrating behavioral indicators
   with more traditional population monitoring approaches provides an
   effective means of acquiring useful information in a timely and
   efficient manner.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances, such as fire, livestock grazing and introduced weeds, all
   have profound effects on vegetation structure and the composition of
   remnant vegetation. Native fauna within remnants frequently shows
   contrasting responses to vegetation changes; some species increase and
   others decline. Changes in vegetation structure can alter animal
   abundance through loss of shelter or foraging areas. However, changes in
   plant species composition are also influential, because specialist
   animal species are dependent on particular plants. Predicting the extent
   of specialization would enable better management by highlighting the
   components of the vegetation that could be retained or recovered to
   benefit the most species. Disturbance mosaics seem a logical solution to
   the diverse response of species to disturbance. However, evidence that
   tests the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, a model that incorporates
   the mosaics concept, suggests that mosaics rarely sustain the highest
   number of species. Given these lessons for management from ecological
   theory, there is an ongoing need to integrate theory and management.
   Furthermore, the lack of congruence between the expected benefits of
   mosaics and the results of intermediate disturbance experiments
   emphasizes the need for further landscape-scale experiments.
   Implementing management in the form of designed experiments will be an
   important part of the solution.}},

   Fragments Project, the world's largest and longest-running experimental

   the influence of fragment area on Amazonian biotas, the project has
   yielded insights that go far beyond the original scope of the study.
   Results suggest that edge effects play a key role in fragment dynamics,
   that the matrix has a major influence on fragment connectivity and
   functioning, and that many Amazonian species avoid even small (< 100 m
   wide) clearings. The effects of fragmentation are highly eclectic,
   altering species richness and abundances, species invasions, forest
   dynamics, the trophic structure of communities, and a variety of
   ecological and ecosystem processes. Moreover, forest fragmentation
   appears to interact synergistically with ecological changes such as
   hunting, fires, and logging, collectively posing an even greater threat

Abstract = {{Playback of bird songs is a useful technique for species detection;
   however, this method is usually not standardized. We tested playback
   efficiency for five Atlantic Forest birds (White-browed Warbler
   Basileuterus leucoblepharus, Giant Antshrike Batara cinerea,
   Swallow-tailed Manakin Chiroxiphia caudata, Whiteshouldered Fire-eye
   Pyriglena leucoptera and Surucua Trogon Trogon surrucura) for different
   time of the day, season of the year and species abundance at the Morro
   Grande Forest Reserve (South-eastem Brazil) and at thirteen forest
   fragments in a nearby landscape. Vocalizations were broadcasted monthly
   at sunrise, noon and sunset, during one year. For B. leucoblepharus, C.
   caudata and T surrucura, sunrise and noon were more efficient than
   sunset. Batara cinerea presented higher efficiency from July to October.
   Playback expanded the favourable period for avifaunal surveys in
   tropical forest, usually restricted to early morning in the breeding
   season. The playback was efficient in detecting the presence of all
   species when the abundance was not too low. But only B. leucoblepharus
   and T surrucura showed abundance values significantly related to this
   efficiency. The present study provided a precise indication of the best
   daily and seasonal periods and a confidence interval to maximize the
   efficiency of playback to detect the occurrence of these forest species.}},

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To investigate the sources of spatial bias in the bird records of
   Catalonia from 1900 to 2002, with the aim of providing generalized
   recommendations for using other databases, and setting up broad
   inventory projects. The paper examines the influence of environmental
   variables, human distribution and ornithological preferences of
   birdwatchers on past avian sampling effort in Catalonia, a contrasting
   region in the north east of Spain.
   Location: Catalonia (Spain).
   Methods: The relationship between time (field days) devoted to sampling
   birds in 10 x 10 km UTM squares (from the records of VertebraCat
   database, across 5 study periods from 1900 to 2002) and a set of
   environmental, human distribution and bird species richness variables
   was analysed. These relationships were analysed by means of Partial
   Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and multiple regression analyses.
   Results: A partial least squares regression analysis accounted for 39.4
   \% of the spatial variation in time devoted to avian sampling per UTM 10
   x 10 km square in the most recent (1983 - 2002) period. The major
   pattern shows that large visit frequencies were mainly associated with
   coastal areas with a large cover of wetlands, marshes and sand dunes,
   high human population density, dense transportation, and also high
   covers of irrigated croplands, urban and industrial environments.
   Another group of highly visited UTM squares was also covered with a
   large surface of protected areas, mostly located in mountainous
   Catalonian sectors, as opposed to those UTM squares in lowland areas
   mainly covered by non-irrigated extensive croplands. Catalonian
   ornithologists and birdwatchers also showed an uneven preference for
   different groups of bird species, as they mainly relied on migratory and
   endangered species.
   Conclusions: The illustrated biased pattern of ornithological field work
   in Catalonia casts doubts about the usefulness of biodiversity indices
   obtainable from databases of observation records without a
   random-stratified sampling approach. However, these problems might be
   overcome by including a variable of sampling bias such as the number of
   records or days of field work.}},

   Three years after fire the number of birds and bird species were similar

   were significantly lower in the burned forests. The bird species
   composition also differed significantly between undisturbed and burned
   forests, with a strong decline of closed forest preferring bird species
   accompanied by a strong increase in degraded forest preferring species
   in burned forests. These differences were strongly related to
   differences in environmental conditions such as shifts in vegetation
   cover and layering and differences in ground and understorey vegetation
   structure. We also found significant shifts in body mass distribution,
   foraging height and feeding guilds between the bird communities in
   unburned and burned forests. Surprisingly, repeated burning did not lead
   to increasing impoverishment of the avifauna, and both once and twice

Abstract = {{The combined effects of rapid habitat loss, fragmentation and
   disturbance on tropical forest avifaunas have not been examined to date.
   The southern Amazonian `arc of deforestation' marks the boundary of the
   most aggressive agricultural frontier in tropical forests worldwide. We
   sampled 21 disturbed and undisturbed primary forest patches, ranging in
   size from 1.2 to 14,476 ha, to elucidate the synergistic effects of both
   forest disturbance and fragmentation on bird community structure, and
   pinpoint which species were the ``winners{''} and ``losers{''} from this
   process. A number of forest patch metrics, derived from an independent
   remote sensing approach, explained much of the resulting
   presence/absence matrix. The bird community exhibited a highly nested
   structure, with small patches being most dissimilar from one another.
   Bird species differed in their response to both forest patch size and
   forest canopy perforation according to their dependence on closed-canopy
   primary forest. Forest patch geometry, which clearly modulated the shape
   of species-area relationships accounted for 83-96\% of the variation in
   species richness, but forest habitat quality resulting from logging and
   surface-fire disturbance was also a significant predictor of species
   richness for the most forest-dependent taxa. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forest ecosystems of the US
   southeastern Coastal Plain, among the most biologically diverse
   ecosystems in North America, originally covered over 24 x 106 ha but now
   occupy less than 5\% of their original extent. The key factor for
   sustaining their high levels of diversity is the frequent application of
   prescribed fire uninterrupted in time and space. Pine fuels, critical to
   application of fire and regulated by canopy distribution, provide the
   nexus between silviculture and fire management in this system. Typical
   silvicultural approaches for this type were, in large part, developed to
   maximize the establishment and growth of regeneration as well as growth
   and yield of timber, with much less regard to how those practices might
   influence the ability to sustain prescribed burning regimes or the
   associated biodiversity. However, many landholdings in the region now
   include conservation of biodiversity as a primary objective with
   sustained timber yield as an important but secondary goal. This review
   synthesizes the literature related to controls of biodiversity for
   longleaf pine ecosystems, and silvicultural approaches are compared in
   their ability to Sustain natural disturbance such as fire and how
   closely they mimic the variation, patterns, and processes of natural
   disturbance regimes while allowing for regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of postfire salvage logging on
   cavity-nesting birds by comparing nest densities and patterns of nest
   reuse over a three-year period in seven logged and eight unlogged
   patches of mixed-conifer forest in the Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife
   Management Area, Montana. We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting
   birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots,
   but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one
   species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of
   the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots.
   Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in
   the salvage-logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent
   species in the northern Rocky Mountains-American Three-toed (Picoides
   dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances
   in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still
   more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum
   number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters,
   which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a
   reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site
   availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly
   selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary
   cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots,
   nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary
   cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that
   typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance
   of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially
   populations of primary cavity-nesting species.}},

Abstract = {{Design and establishment of ecologically good networks of conservation
   areas often requires quick assessments of their biodiversity. Reliable
   indicators would be useful when doing such assessments. In order to
   explore the potential indicators for species richness in boreal forests,
   we studied (1) the co-variation of species richness and composition of
   species assemblages among beetles, polypores, birds and vascular plants,
   (2) the relationships between species richness and four boreal forest
   site types, (3) the relationship between species richness and forest
   physical structure and (4) the suitability of potential indicator groups
   within the four taxa to predict the species richness generally. The data
   show that there are probably not a single taxonomic or forest structural
   characteristic to be used as a general biodiversity indicator or
   surrogate for all the species. The correlations in species richness
   among the four taxa studied were low. However, group-specific indicators
   were obvious: forest site type was a good surrogate for vascular plant
   richness, and quantity and quality of dead wood predicted the species
   richness of polypores. The results support the view that different
   indicators shall be used for different forest types and taxonomic
   groups. These indicators should facilitate relatively rapid methods to
   assess biodiversity patterns at the forest stand level. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{We investigated how changes in vegetation structure and prey resources
   following wildfire affected the winter ecology of hairy woodpeckers
   (Picoides villosus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of
   northern Arizona, USA. Using point-counts, radiotelemetry, and focal
   bird observation, we assessed the relative abundance, home range size
   and composition, and habitat use by foraging hairy woodpeckers in 3
   stands that had experienced wildfire in 1996, 2000, or 2002. Because we
   conducted the study over 2 years, we used the 1996 fire to represent 6
   and 7 years after fire, while we used the 2000 fire to represent 2 and 3
   years after fire in a space-for-time substitution chronosequence
   analysis. We also assessed bark beetle and woodborer density by x-raying
   bark samples collected from a subset of trees within burned areas. We
   detected significantly greater hairy woodpecker relative abundance in
   burned forests representing 1 and 2 years after fire, and bark beetle
   and woodborer density was highest in these stands as well. Woodpecker
   home range size increased across stands representing increasing time
   since fire. Within a burn, hairy woodpeckers used high-severity burned
   areas more than moderate-severity burned areas representing 2 and 3
   years after fire, but not in areas representing 6 and 7 years after
   fire. Bark beetle and woodborer densities were also higher in
   high-severity burned stands representing 2 and 3 years after fire. Hairy
   woodpeckers used edges of high-severity burned areas more than the
   interior. We hypothesize that an initial increase in bark beetle and
   woodborer density following fire allowed for higher woodpecker abundance
   and smaller home ranges, but as burned forests aged, bark beetle and
   woodborer density within trees decreased, killed trees fell, and, in
   response, hairy woodpecker relative abundance decreased and home range
   size increased. These patterns suggest that high-severity burned areas
   provide important but ephemeral resources to this dominant primary
   cavity-nester. The higher bark beetle and woodborer densities and
   greater use of edges of high-severity burned areas by woodpeckers
   suggests that salvage logging of these areas could remove potential prey
   and preferred foraging areas for hairy woodpeckers, especially when
   trees are removed along severely burned edges.}},

Abstract = {{Currently over 14.6 million ha of land at an annual cost of US\$1.76
   billion are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CPP). The
   habitat benefits of CRP frequently are lauded, but documentation that
   wildlife is responding as hoped is urgently needed. We evaluated plant
   and breeding bird responses to 92.4 ha of CPP grasslands at China Farms
   in northeastern Maryland, USA. In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP
   fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various
   growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing
   and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and
   facilitate stand establishment. In 6 years cumulative plant species
   richness increased to 261, 105 of which were species exotic to the
   region. During the third growing season, we initiated a schedule of
   prescribed burning on a 3-year rotation to remove accumulated litter and
   to retard woody succession, and in 2003 we added additional management
   to control aggressive plant species. Several at-risk bird species
   colonized the restored grasslands in the first year and established
   sustainable breeding populations. We implemented a comprehensive
   observation and banding program, which included mapping male territories
   for selected bird species and recording nest locations. We marked 1,985
   grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; GRSPs) in 7 years. Breeding
   GRSP populations ranged annually from 70 to 90 socially monogamous pairs
   with an additional 40 non-territorial males. Annual return rates in the
   last 5 years were 57\% for adult males, 41\% for adult females, and 12\%
   for hatch-year individuals. Adults and young birds exhibited high site
   fidelity, but overgrown fields left unburned for 2-3 years were
   unpopulated by GRSPs but attracted several shrub-land bird species.
   Habitat preference for territories was influenced more by vegetation
   structure than by plant species composition. We recommend the management
   of grasslands restored for birds include spatial and temporal rotation
   of prescribed fire and herbicide applications to sustain vegetation
   physical structure rather than species composition.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite imagery was used to model the distribution and abundance of
   Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli) in the White Mountains of New
   Hampshire. Image-derived data for live softwood shrub density, standing
   dead-tree basal area, distance to nearest fir-shrub cover type, along
   with a digital elevation model and point-count data, were used to supply
   regressor estimates in a multivariate logistic habitat model that was
   constructed from field vegetation sampling and point-count data.
   Spatially explicit predictions of probability of Bicknell's Thrush
   presence were made for each 28.5 x 28.5 m-pixel covering 70,000 ha. A
   model validation procedure using observations independent from model
   calibration revealed no difference (P > 0.05) between modeled and
   observed estimates of Bicknell's Thrush presence within probability
   deciles 0 to < 0.1, 0.1 to < 0.2, 0.2 to < 0.3, 0.3 to < 0.4, 0.5 to <
   0.6, and 0.6 to < 0.7 with respective densities (40 ha(-1)) of 0.5, 1.6,
   2.8, 4.1, 7.3, and 9.4. Transforming probabilities into relative
   abundance produced an estimated 4,900 Bicknell's Thrushes across the
   study area. Habitats supporting the highest density of Bicknell's
   Thrushes were predicted to be at the uppermost elevations. However,
   abundance estimates decreased even as density increased, owing to
   decreasing amounts of habitat area with increasing elevation, and
   suggested that lower-elevation, low-density habitats may support a
   significant fraction of Bicknell's Thrushes.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the effects of fire history and a riparian-upland gradient
   on the breeding bird community at Fort Bragg Military Installation in
   North Carolina, one of the largest remnant areas of the endangered
   longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. Study sites were classified
   into two treatments: fire-intense (areas experiencing growing-season
   burns) and fire-suppressed (areas lacking fires). Within each treatment,
   bird and vegetation data were recorded at point-count stations
   positioned at three distances from streamhead pocosins to characterize
   the riparian-upland habitat gradient: 0, 75, and >= 150 m. Total bird
   abundance and species richness varied significantly along the
   riparian-upland gradient, with pocosins contributing greatly to avian
   biodiversity. Our data revealed strong effects of fire history and
   riparian-upland gradient on bird species, which we described in terms of
   breeding-bird assemblages. Members of the open longleaf assemblage
   (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker {[}Picoides borealis], Bachman's Sparrow
   {[}Aimophila aestivalis]) were most common in fire-intense areas and at
   upland locations. Members of the fire-suppressed assemblage (e.g., Wood
   Thrush {[}Hylocichla mustelina], Ovenbird {[}Seiurus aurocapilla]) were
   confined to pocosins in fire-intense areas, but became more abundant in
   fire-suppressed areas. Members of the pocosin assemblage (e.g., Eastern
   Towhee {[}Pipilo erythropthalamus], Common Yellowthroat {[}Geothlypis
   trichas]) were largely confined to pocosins and, in some cases, were
   most abundant in fire-intense pocosins. Fire suppression increased

Abstract = {{We simulated a shelterwood forest regeneration treatment by reducing
   basal area, and monitored the response of an avian community in
   oak-hickory forest on the southern Cumberland Plateau, northern Alabama,
   USA. We used five treatments: control (no removal), clear-cut (100\%
   removal), and 25, 50, and 75\% removal of basal area. Territory mapping
   was used to quantify bird community between mid-April and July of both
   2002 and 2003. Microclimate variables were recorded at each plot. The
   residual basal area and canopy cover showed three distinct conditions
   after treatment: closed canopy, open forest, and clear-cut. The
   microclimate varied among treatments: air temperature was highest in
   clear-cut plots and lowest in control plots, whereas soil moisture had
   the opposite pattern. A total of 71 bird species were detected, with 36
   of them defending territories. Territory density, species richness, and
   Shannon diversity index differed among the treatments; the relationship
   between these bird community indices and the level of basal area removal
   was quadratic, lowest in the clear-cut plots and highest in the
   intermediate levels. Although species richness was similar among the
   control, 25, 50, and 75\% removal treatments, species composition
   varied. The richness difference among treatments became smaller in the
   second year post-treatment (2003) with an increase in bird density and
   richness occurring in the clear-cut plots.}},

Abstract = {{By emulating natural disturbances like wildfire, managers hope to
   maintain biodiversity in managed forests. Leaving residual live trees in
   harvested areas is an important component of this strategy. However, the
   influence of this approach on songbird communities is largely unknown.
   We surveyed songbirds in 166 stands in the Rocky Mountains in BC,
   Canada, that had been logged or burned by wildfire. Stands were located
   in mid or high elevation biogeoclimatic zones, and varied from 7 to 45
   years since disturbance and in density of residual trees from 0 to 320
   conifer overstory, 0 to 832 conifer understory, and 0 to 68 broadleaf
   trees/ha. Although differences in bird communities between burned and
   logged stands of similar ages were detected, these differences were not
   consistent between biogeoclimatic zones, nor did they explain a large
   amount of the variation in bird communities. Logged stands had a higher
   density of birds, but expected species richness did not differ between
   logged and burned stands. All but a few rare species were detected in
   both disturbance types. Of 26 species analysed in detail, densities of
   14 were greater in logged stands, 6 were greater in burned stands, and 6
   were not significantly different between disturbance types. The bird
   community, bird abundance and densities of individual species were
   influenced by residual tree density and type. As time since disturbance
   increased, bird communities in burned and logged stands in the Engelmann
   Spruce-Subalpine Fir zone became more similar, but those in the Montane
   Spruce zone became less so, likely due to differences in residual tree
   density. Results suggest differences in bird communities in logged and
   burned stands >= 7 years post-disturbance are mainly in abundance rather
   than community composition, but abundances of individual species can be
   significantly influenced by residual tree density and type. Managers can
   influence the abundance of some species in harvested areas by
   manipulating the type and density of residual trees. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The frequency of wild and prescribed fires in montane forests of the
   southwestern United States has increased after a century of fire
   suppression and subsequent fuels accumulation. To assess the effects of
   recent fires (median time since fire = 6 yr) on the montane forest bird
   community, we surveyed birds in 8 Sky Island mountain ranges in
   southeastern Arizona, USA, and examined how the distribution (i.e.,
   presence-absence) of 65 species and relative abundance of 16 species
   correlated with evidence of severe and less severe fire at > 1,500
   survey points. We detected associations between fire and bird
   presence-absence for 17\% of the 65 species analyzed and between fire
   and bird relative abundance for 25\% of the 16 species analyzed. Most
   species (73\%) were positively associated with burned areas and
   displayed stronger associations (i.e., more extreme odds ratios) with
   survey points that had evidence of severe as opposed to less severe
   fire. Positive associations with severe fire were strong (> 3 to 1 odds)
   for western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and house wren (Troglodytes
   aedon), and negative associations with severe fire were strong for
   warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus) and red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta
   canadensis). Although recent fires appear to have had a positive effect
   on the distribution and relative abundance of several montane forest
   bird species in the region, these species are not the open-woodland
   birds that we would have expected to have benefited from fire based on
   previous research. Nevertheless, our results confirm associations
   between fire and bird presence-absence and relative abundance reported
   previously for 7 species of birds. Our results also provide new
   information for Grace's warbler Dendroica graciae) and greater pewee (C.
   pertinax), 2 species for which fire data were formerly lacking. Managers
   can use these data to make and test predictions about the effects of
   future fires, both severe and less severe, on montane forest birds in
   the southwestern United States.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation often is used as a decision variable for conservation and
   resource management. Because time and money are limited, it is useful to
   identify predictable relationships between measures of vegetation
   diversity or status, the physical environment, and disturbance; native
   and non-native plants may have different functional responses. Working
   towards development of effective, practical strategies for management
   and ecological restoration in the Spring Mountains, an isolated mountain
   range in the eastern Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA) that is a focus of
   regional conservation planning, we examined whether native and
   non-native assemblages of spring-associated perennial plants have
   predictable relationships with elevation, springbrook length, and
   various land uses. We also tested whether elevation, springbrook length,
   and overall disturbance were associated with the degree of
   predictability of local species presence and absence. Consistent with
   work in other systems, species richness and cover of native plants
   tended to decrease as intensity of disturbance increased, whereas
   species richness (but not cover) of non-native plants tended to peak
   with intermediate disturbance. Our results may suggest that invasions of
   non-native plants at springs in the Spring Mountains are relatively
   recent, and that rapid restoration and management actions may help
   protect ecological processes and viability of native plants. Ability to
   predict the order in which individual species are likely to be
   extirpated from or colonize springs was limited, perhaps reflecting
   considerable environmental heterogeneity among springs.}},

   sagebrush cover or percent sagebrush in the landscape, whereas Vesper
   Sparrows were negatively associated with sagebrush cover and positively
   related to increases in sagebrush fragmentation at local and landscape
   scales. Including a measure of juniper encroachment Substantially
   improved models for all species in the analysis. Green-tailed Towhees
   showed a curvilinear response to the amount of juniper in the landscape.
   All other species showed a strong negative relationship with juniper.
   Our results indicate that, although changes in sagebrush habitat
   associated with fire had a negative influence on sagebrush birds,
   juniper encroachment due to fire suppression also impacted this
   high-elevation sagebrush bird community.}},

Abstract = {{A functional network of green space is important for the maintenance of
   the ecological dimension of a sustainable urban landscape. We used avian
   ecological diversity as a proxy for evaluating the functionality of
   different types of urban green space. The urban landscape of the
   municipality of Orebro in Sweden was stratified into four strata (City
   centre, Residential, Greenway and Periphery). Bird species found in
   these strata were classified into four ecological groups with decreasing
   degree of specialisation (woodpeckers, hole-nesters, forest birds and
   urban birds). Overall there was lower bird species richness in the City
   centre and Residential areas compared to the Greenway and Periphery.
   Woodpeckers, hole-nesters and forest birds showed an increasing trend in
   the number of species as well as individuals from the City centre to the
   Periphery while urban birds showed the opposite trend. The amount and
   quality of green space as well as natural vegetation increased from the
   City centre to the Periphery. Species richness of woodpeckers, forest
   birds and hole-nesters were positively correlated with tree density
   while urban birds showed an inverse correlation. There was no dead wood
   in City centre, Residential and Greenway in contrast to the Periphery,
   which held some dying trees, stumps and old windthrows. Our findings
   emphasise the importance of urban green space with natural structures to
   maintain high ecological diversity. Finally, we discuss how conflicts
   between habitat for biodiversity maintenance and other functions of
   green space could be handled by zoning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Fire is an important determinant of many aspects of savanna ecosystem
   structure and function. However, relatively little is known about the
   effects of fire on faunal biodiversity in savannas. We conducted a
   short-term study to examine the effects of a replicated experimental
   burn on bird diversity and abundance in savanna habitat of central
   Kenya. Twenty-two months after the burn, Shannon diversity of birds was
   32\% higher on plots that had been burned compared with paired control
   plots. We observed no significant effects of burning on total bird
   abundance or species richness. Several families of birds were found only
   on plots that had been burned; one species, the rattling cisticola
   (Cisticola chiniana), was found only on unburned plots. Shrub canopy
   area was negatively correlated with bird diversity on each plot, and
   highly correlated with grass height and the abundance of orthopterans.
   Our results suggest that the highest landscape-level bird diversity
   might be obtained through a mosaic of burned and unburned patches. This
   is also most likely to approximate the historical state of bird
   diversity in this habitat, because patchy fires have been an important
   natural disturbance in tropical ecosystems for millennia.}},

Abstract = {{Although considered by some as a less ``ecologically suitable{''}
   forestry model than ``near-natural{''} stand management, even-aged
   plantation forest management, with regeneration procedure involving
   clearcutting, creates temporary habitat for many early-successional
   birds. The present study addresses the question of the conservation
   value for birds of clearcutting-related open areas in European temperate
   forest, in the context of a mixed woodland-farmland landscape. The point
   count technique was used to census the breeding birds on 300 sampling
   plots, distributed in the eight main habitat types of the Ardenne region
   (southern Belgium), including agricultural land, edge habitats, closed
   forest habitats and open areas in forest. Most of these open areas in
   forest derive from clearcutting practices, rapidly planted with young
   Norway Spruce (Picea abies). We quantified the conservation value of a
   given habitat type by using a ``conservation value index{''},
   integrating the frequency of occurrence of each species in the
   considered habitat and their conservation status in Europe or in
   southern Belgium. Both conservation value index and species richness
   were higher for edge habitats and open areas in forest, compared to
   forest interior and agricultural land. Detrended Correspondence Analysis
   of the plot species lists showed that bird assemblages from open area in
   forest are not intermediate between forest and agricultural open land,
   as opposed to external edge habitats. Hence, open areas in forest do not
   contain bird assemblages composed of forest species mixed with
   colonizing agricultural species but rather shelter specific bird
   assemblages. An Indicator Species analysis further emphasized this
   specificity and identified seven species, which, in the Ardenne context,
   form a group of species specific to open areas in forest. Due to major
   changes of land use in the Ardenne during the 20th century, which leads
   to a tremendous decrease of moor, heath and fallow land areas, clearcut
   openings in the plantation forest progressively gained high conservation
   value at the regional scale. Further studies about habitat requirement
   of the conservation interest species inhabiting these open areas is
   needed, including a better understanding of how early-successional
   species react to forest planning. If plantation forestry evolves to an
   uneven-aged and more permanently closed forest, then other options,
   including semi-natural habitat restoration, are urgently required to
   save early-successional bird communities. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Question: Do case studies from silvicultural and restoration studies and
   applied conservation management in second-growth Pinus palustris stands
   provide unique insights for conservation models?
   Methods: A review of management paradigms that conserve the high
   biological diversity and rare species, drawn from characteristics in
   both second-growth and old-growth stands, is presented for
   fire-maintained Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) forests.
   Results: A common assumption that old-growth stands provide the primary
   information for the development of conservation management strategies
   de-emphasizes lessons learned from second-growth and restoration
   studies. Primary conservation management goals for the Pinus palustris
   ecosystem include the perpetual regeneration of the fire-maintained
   forest and conservation of the characteristically high biological
   diversity and rare species. Several attributes, such as a sustained
   population of Picoides borealis (red-cockaded woodpecker), Aristida
   stricta (wiregrass)-dominated ground cover, and undisturbed
   upland-wetland ecotones, can predict a diverse and ecologically
   functional ecosystem. Such indicators are linked to critical structural
   and functional features of the system and reflect previous land
   management histories that suggest sustainable approaches.
   Conclusions: A traditional definition of `old-growth' relying on
   overstorey may be limited in describing important features of healthy,
   diverse Pinus palustris ecosystems. Some characteristics are
   significantly more important for maintenance of diversity than age of
   the trees and these features may be present in old- or second-growth
   forests. We advocate that the management history, structural
   characteristics and landscape context of stands that harbour desirable
   conservation attributes (red-cockaded woodpeckers, wiregrass, gopher
   tortoises and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones) can be used as
   indicators to identify important conservation and forest management
   principles.}},

Abstract = {{Within boreal forests of western North America, the dominant large-scale
   natural disturbance is wildfire. Thus, harvesting that is as similar as
   possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities.
   We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds)
   from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses
   to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus
   postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and
   also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest.
   Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those
   postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the
   forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by
   relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the
   period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and
   bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest
   succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen
   (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea
   glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities.
   Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many
   old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies.
   Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific
   forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a
   single forest type.}},

Abstract = {{Aim This paper uses null model analysis to explore the pattern of
   species co-occurrence of terrestrial vertebrate fauna in fire-prone,
   mixed evergreen oak woodlands.
   Location The Erico-Quercion ilicis of the Mediterranean belt (50-800 m
   a.s.l.) in the Madonie mountain range, a regional park in northern
   Sicily (37 degrees 50' N, 14 degrees 05' E), Italy.
   Methods The stratified sampling of vertebrates in a secondary succession
   of recent burned areas (BA, 1-2 years old), intermediate burned areas
   (INT, 4-10 years old) and ancient burned areas (CNB, > 50 years old),
   plus forest fragments left within burned areas (FF, 1-2 years old)
   permitted the comparison of patterns of species co-occurrence using a
   set of separate presence/absence matrices. First, the breeding avifauna
   derived from standardized point counts was analysed using Stone \&
   Roberts'C-score, and by a null model algorithm (fixed/equiprobable).
   Secondly, the analysis was repeated using all vertebrate species
   recorded in the succession.
   Results Sixty-five species were recorded in the 2-year study period in
   the four sample treatments. Birds were found to make up the largest
   component (63\%) of the recorded assemblage. The BA treatment had the
   lowest species richness, followed in order by the small, medium and
   large FFs, and then by the CNBs. For both analyses (birds and total
   vertebrates), the C-scores were quite small and not significantly
   different from those that could be expected by chance in the BA and INT
   burned areas; this indicates a random co-occurrence among vertebrates of
   those assemblages. Contrariwise, for both analyses in the CNBs, the
   C-scores were large and significantly different from the simulated
   indices, thereby indicating a non-random co-occurrence pattern
   (segregation) of vertebrates in the undisturbed woodlands. In addition,
   C-score values for the surviving FFs show a significant aggregation of
   species.
   Main conclusions The null model analyses highlighted a new aspect of
   fire disturbance in Mediterranean woodland ecosystems: the disruption in
   patterns of co-occurrence in the terrestrial vertebrate community.
   Wildfire alters community organization, inducing, for at least 10 years,
   a random aggregate of species. Communities re-assemble themselves,
   showing the occurrence of species segregation at least 50 years after
   fire.}},

Abstract = {{Our purpose was to define a quantitative and expeditious method to
   analyze the effects of processes that influence species distribution and
   abundance at different organizational scales. We considered habitat
   loss, the breaking apart of habitat patches, and habitat structural
   alteration critical processes that affect species distribution and
   abundance. We evaluated the effects of these processes by considering
   the response of selected indicator species to isolation (landscape
   scale), patch size and edge effect (patch scale), and habitat structure
   (plot scale). We used broadleaf forests as our case-study ecosystem and
   birds as indicator species. Faunal data came from a georeferenced,
   long-term, breeding-bird database, and environmental data were obtained
   from field surveys and land-use digital cartography. Birds, grouped
   according to their sensitivity to patch isolation, patch size, edge
   effect, and habitat structure, indicated how environmental conditions
   affected species abundance. The most sensitive group to the
   above-mentioned processes included the Marsh Tit (Parus palustris),
   Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), and Short-toed Treecreeper (Certhia
   brachydactyla). We evaluated the umbrella effect of these species for
   the conservation of the other co-occurring birds and found that their
   effectiveness varied according to the criterion used to select sites for
   protection. Site selection based on indicator species identified forest
   patches with greater species abundance than an alternative criterion
   that chose sites based on patch isolation and size, edge effect, and
   forest structure. The alternative criterion, although not as efficient
   as indicator species, may nevertheless be useful and effective for
   conservation when faunal data are lacking and guidelines for habitat
   management or restoration are needed. Our method is applicable to other
   ecosystems and taxa because the processes we considered occur in many
   ecosystems and may have significant effects on species from all
   taxonomic groups.}},

Abstract = {{We combine mist-net data from 24 disturbance treatments taken from seven
   studies on the responses of understorey Amazonian birds to selective
   logging, single and recurrent wildfires, and habitat fragmentation. The
   different disturbance treatments had distinct effects on avian guild
   structure, and fire disturbance and the isolation of forest patches
   resulted in bird communities that were most divergent from those in
   continuous, undisturbed forest in terms of their species composition.
   Although low-intensity logging treatments had the least noticeable
   effects, the composition of understorey birds was still markedly
   different from the composition in undisturbed forest. This analysis
   demonstrates the importance of preventing habitat fragmentation and the
   spread of fires in humid tropical forests, and highlights the need for
   more research to determine the long-term suitability of large areas of
   degraded forest for forest birds. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Many studies have examined differences in avian community composition
   between urban and rural habitats, but few, if any, have looked at
   nesting success of urban shrubland birds in a replicated fashion while
   controlling for habitat. We tested factors affecting nest survival,
   parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), and species
   abundance in shrubland habitat in rural and urban landscapes. We found
   no support for our hypothesis that nest survival was lower in urban
   landscapes, but strong support for the hypothesis that survival
   increased with nest height. We found strong support for our hypothesis
   that cowbird parasitism was greater in urban than rural landscapes;
   parasitism in urban sites was at least twice that of rural sites. We
   found strong support for an urban landscape effect on abundance for
   several species; Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and
   Brown-headed Cowbirds were more abundant in urban landscapes, whereas
   Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla) and Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora
   pinus) were more abundant in rural sites. There was support for lower
   abundances of Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea) and Indigo
   Bunting (Passerina cyanea) with increased housing density. For six other
   species, edge and trail density or vegetation parameters best explained
   abundance. Lower abundances and greater parasitism in habitat patches in
   urban landscapes are evidence that, for some species, these urban
   landscapes do not fulfill the same role as comparable habitats in rural
   landscapes. Regional bird conservation planning and local habitat
   management in urban landscapes may need to consider these effects in
   efforts to sustain bird populations at regional and local scales.}},

Abstract = {{1. Peatlands have suffered great losses following drainage for
   agriculture, forestry, urbanisation, or peat mining, near inhabited
   areas. We evaluated the faunal and vegetation patterns after restoration
   of a peatland formerly mined for peat. We assessed whether bog pools
   created during restoration are similar to natural bog pools in terms of
   water chemistry, vegetation structure and composition, as well as
   amphibian and arthropod occurrence patterns.
   2. Both avian species richness and peatland vegetation cover at the site
   increased following restoration. Within bog pools, however, the
   vegetation composition differed between natural and man-made pools. The
   cover of low shrubs, Sphagnum moss, submerged, emergent and floating
   vegetation in man-made pools was lower than in natural pools, whereas pH
   was higher than in typical bog pools. Dominant plant species also
   differed between man-made and natural pools.
   3. Amphibian tadpoles, juveniles and adults occurred more often in
   man-made pools than natural bog pools. Although some arthropods,
   including Coleoptera bog specialists, readily colonised the pools, their
   abundance was two to 26 times lower than in natural bog pools. Plant
   introduction in bog pools, at the stocking densities we applied, had no
   effect on the occurrence of most groups.
   4. We conclude that our restoration efforts were partially successful.
   Peatland-wide vegetation patterns following restoration mimicked those
   of natural peatlands, but 4 years were not sufficient for man-made pools
   to fully emulate the characteristics of natural bog pools.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about factors that structure biodiversity on landscape
   scales, yet current land management protocols, such as forest
   certification programs, place an increasing emphasis on managing for
   sustainable biodiversity at landscape scales. We used a replicated
   landscape study to evaluate relationships between forest structure and
   avian diversity at both stand and landscape-levels. We used data on bird
   communities collected under comparable sampling protocols on four
   managed forests located across the Southeastern US to develop logistic
   regression models describing relationships between habitat factors and
   the distribution of overall richness and richness of selected guilds.
   Landscape models generated for eight of nine guilds showed a strong
   relationship between richness and both availability and configuration of
   landscape features. Diversity of topographic features and heterogeneity
   of forest structure were primary determinants of avian species richness.
   Forest heterogeneity, in both age and forest type, were strongly and
   positively associated with overall avian richness and richness for most
   guilds. Road density was associated positively but weakly with avian
   richness. Landscape variables dominated all models generated, but no
   consistent patterns in metrics or scale were evident. Model fit was
   strong for neotropical migrants and relatively weak for short-distance
   migrants and resident species. Our models provide a tool that will allow
   managers to evaluate and demonstrate quantitatively how management
   practices affect avian diversity on landscapes. Published by Elsevier

   to increased above-ground activity. We reduced ants on five plots over 2
   yr; however, We found no difference in total ground arthropod biomass

   analysis. We selected nine focal resident bird species for study of

   Seven of nine species had higher relative abundance following food
   supplementation. Three species were recaptured more frequently in

   persistence responses did not Cause any changes in body condition. In
   one species, Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), food supplementation
   resulted in higher concentrations of individuals in breeding condition.
   These results demonstrated Functional response to dry-season food

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of seminatural grasslands to ozone (O-3) pollution is
   not well known, in spite of the important function of these common
   ecosystems for agriculture and nature conservation. A 5-year field
   experiment was carried out at a rural, mid-elevation site at Le Mouret
   (Switzerland) to investigate the effect of elevated O-3 on yield and
   species composition of a permanent, extensively managed, species-rich
   old pasture. Using a free-air fumigation system, circular plots of 7 m
   diameter were exposed to either ambient air (control plots) or to air
   containing O-3 of approximately 1.5 x ambient concentrations. The
   resulting accumulated O-3 exposure over the threshold of 40 ppb for one
   season ranged from 13.3 to 59.5 ppm h in the elevated O-3 plots, and
   from 1.0 to 20.7 ppm h in the control plots. Subplots in each ring were
   harvested three times each year, and harvested biomass was separated
   into functional groups (FGs) (grasses, legumes, forbs). Productivity in
   both treatments decreased over time, but the yield of O-3-exposed plots
   decreased faster than that of the control plots, with the reduction
   being twice as large by the end of the fifth season. Compared with the
   ambient air control, loss in annual dry matter yield was 23\% after 5
   years. The change in annual biomass production because of O-3 stress was
   accompanied by a change in the fractions of FGs, with the legume
   fraction showing a strong negative response. Such long-term effects of
   O-3 stress could have negative implications for the maintenance of
   biological diversity in rural landscapes across large areas of Europe.
   The results from this first long-term experiment show that a moderately
   elevated O-3 level reduces the productivity of intact grasslands during
   a 5-year exposure under real field conditions.}},

Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{139-152}},
Abstract = {{Management of the dynamics of woody vegetation in Australia's tropical
   savannas is a vexing issue for both pastoralists and conservation
   biologists. In savanna regions around the world, increasing density of
   woody vegetation contributes to declines in pastoral productivity, but
   its effects on native fauna are largely unknown. In this paper we
   examine the avifauna in savanna woodlands of varying structure in the
   Desert Uplands bioregion, Queensland. Vegetation cover maps derived from
   aerial photographs were used to choose 60 sites, across 4 cattle
   stations. We sampled sites mapped at 30-45\% and 45-60\% foliage cover,
   and areas which previously had these levels of cover but had been
   mechanically modified, both by broad scale clearing and selective
   thinning. Between May and June 2004, we measured a range of habitat
   variables and sampled the birds at each site. Bird species composition
   varied significantly between treatments. Bird richness and frequency was
   greatest in intact vegetation. Thirteen species of birds were most

   oak-pine sawtimber (ST) stands, pine poletimber (PT) stands,
   high-density pine seedling (SS) stands, and recently clearcut areas

   Mississippi. Species richness was 25\% greater in forested stands
   compared to clearcut areas, yet total bird density was 50\% greater in
   clearcut areas. Bird communities ranged from open-habitat assemblages in
   clearcut areas to forest-obligate assemblages in ST stands. Little
   overlap of avian community composition was observed between ST stands
   and clearcut areas. PT and SS stands supported avian communities where
   most species were observed at intermediate abundance values compared to
   ST or clearcut areas. Highly fragmented, closed-canopy stands embedded
   within the silvicultural landscape of HSNF do not support large
   populations of species traditionally associated with detrimental edge
   effects on forest-obligate songbirds. Intensively managed PT and SS
   stands appear to provide suboptimal habitat for forest and grassland

Abstract = {{A comprehensive understanding of variables associated with spatial
   differences in community composition is essential to explain and predict
   biodiversity over landscape scales. In this study, spatial patterns of
   bird diversity in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, were examined and
   associated with local-scale (habitat structure and heterogeneity) and
   landscape-scale (logging, slope position and elevation) environmental
   variables. Within the study area (c. 196 km(2)) local habitat structure
   and heterogeneity varied considerably, largely due to logging. In total
   9747 individuals of 177 bird species were recorded. Akaike's information
   criterion (AIC) revealed that the best explanatory models of bird
   community similarity and species richness included both local- and
   landscape-scale environmental variables. Important local-scale variables
   included liana abundance, fern cover, sapling density, tree density,
   dead wood abundance and tree architecture, while important
   landscape-scale variables were elevation, logging and slope position.
   Geographic distance between sampling sites was not significantly
   associated with spatial variation in either species richness or
   similarity. These results indicate that deterministic environmental
   processes, as opposed to dispersal-driven stochastic processes,
   primarily structure bird assemblages within the spatial scale of this
   study and confirm that highly variable local habitat measures can be
   effective means of predicting landscape-scale community patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The southeastern United States population of the painted bunting
   (Passerina ciris) has decreased approximately 75\% from 1966-1996 based
   on Breeding Bird Survey trends. Partners in Flight guidelines recommend
   painted bunting conservation as a high priority with a need for
   management by state and federal agencies. Basic information on home
   range and survival of breeding painted buntings will provide managers
   with required habitat types and estimates of land areas necessary to
   maintain minimum population sizes for this species. We radiotracked
   after-second-year male and after-hatching-year female buntings on Sapelo
   Island, Georgia, during the breeding seasons (late April-early August)
   of 1997 and 1998. We used the animal movement extension in ArcView to
   determine fixed-kernel home range in an unmanaged maritime shrub and
   managed 60-80-year-old pine (Pinus spp.)-oak Quercus spp.) forest. Using
   the Kaplan-Meier method, we estimated an adult breeding season survival
   of 1.00 for males (n = 36) and 0.94 (SE = 0.18)for females(n=27).
   Painted bunting home ranges were smaller in unmanaged maritime shrub
   (female: kernel (x) over bar = 3.5 ha {[}95\% CI: 2.5-4.51; male: kernel
   (x) over bar = 3.1 ha {[}95\% CI: 2.3-3.9]) compared to those in managed
   pine-oak forests (female: kernel (x) over bar = 4.7 ha {[}95\% CI:
   2.8-6.6]; male: kernel (x) over bar = 7.0 ha {[}95\% CI: 4.9-9.1]).
   Buntings nesting in the managed pine-oak forest flew long distances (>=
   300 m) to forage in salt marshes, freshwater wetlands, and moist forest
   clearings. In maritime shrub buntings occupied a compact area and rarely
   moved long distances. The painted bunting population of Sapelo Island
   requires conservation of maritime shrub as potential optimum nesting
   habitat and management of nesting habitat in open-canopy pine-oak
   sawtimber forests by periodic prescribed fire (every 4-6 years) and
   timber thinning within a landscape that contains salt marsh or
   freshwater wetland openings within 700 m of those forests.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape configuration and dispersal characteristics are major
   determinants of population distribution and persistence in fragmented
   habitat. An individual-based spatially explicit population model was
   developed to investigate these factors using the distribution of
   nuthatches in an area of eastern England as an example. The effects of
   immigration and increasing the area of breeding quality habitat were
   explored. Predictions were compared with observed population sizes in
   the study area. Our model combined a nuthatch population simulator based
   on individual behaviour with a grid-based representation of the
   landscape; nuthatch life cycle and immigration parameters were user
   selectable. A novel aspect of the model is user-selection of habitat
   perceptual range. Using a realistic set of parameters, the number of
   breeding pairs predicted by the model matched observed numbers.
   According to model simulations, the main cause of nuthatch scarcity in
   the study area was the inability of patches to support viable
   populations without immigration from elsewhere. Modelled habitat
   management, which increased breeding quality habitat in existing woods,
   lowered the threshold above which the study area population became
   self-sustaining. The existence of a large core habitat area was critical
   in producing a self-sustaining population in this landscape, the same
   area in dispersed small woods failed to sustain populations.}},

Abstract = {{Fire can cause profound changes in the composition and abundance of
   plant and animal species, but logistics, unpredictability of weather,
   and inherent danger make it nearly impossible to study high-severity
   fire effects experimentally. We took advantage of a unique opportunity
   to use a before-after/control-impact (BACI) approach to analyze changes
   in bird assemblages after the severe fires of 2000 in the Bitterroot
   Valley, Montana. Observers surveyed birds using 10-minute point counts
   and collected vegetation data from 13 burned and 13 unburned transects
   for five years before fire and three years after fire. We compared
   changes in vegetation variables and relative bird abundance from before
   to after fire between the set of points that burned and the set of
   points that did not burn. The magnitude of change in vegetation
   variables from before to after fire increased with fire severity. The
   relative abundances of nine bird species showed significantly greater
   changes from before to after fire at burned points compared with
   unburned points. Moreover, when burned points were separated by whether
   they burned at low, moderate, or high severity, an additional 10 species
   showed significant changes in relative abundance from before to after
   fire at one or more severities. Overall, almost twice as many bird
   species increased as decreased significantly in response to fire. We
   also found changes in abundance between one year after and two years
   after fire for most species that responded to fire. Thus, species that
   have been termed ``mixed responders{''} in the literature appear to be
   responding differently to different fire severities or different time
   periods since fire, rather than responding variably to the same fire
   conditions. These findings underscore the importance of fire severity
   and time since fire and imply that both factors must be considered to
   understand the complexities of fire effects on biological communities.
   Because different bird species responded positively to different fire
   severities, our results suggest a need to manage public lands for the
   maintenance of all kinds of fires, not just the low-severity, understory
   burns that dominate most discussions revolving around the use of fire in
   forest restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Snags (standing dead trees) are important components of forests that
   contribute to ecological processes and provide habitat for many life
   forms. We monitored dynamics of snag populations on 1-ha plots in
   southwestern mixed-conifer (n = 53 plots) and ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa, n = 60 plots) forests in north-central Arizona from 1997 to
   2002. Of 2,240 snags marked in 1997, at least 76\% remained standing in
   2002, 17\% had fallen and were relocated as logs, 0.5\% were cut down,
   and the remainder (6\%) were unaccounted for. Snag density increased
   significantly in mixed-conifer forest but not in ponderosa pine forest.
   Snag density increased mainly in the smaller size classes in both forest
   types. Density of large snags (>= 46 cm in diameter and 9 m in height)
   increased slightly but non significantly from 1997 levels in both forest
   types, and fell below current targets for retention. Species composition
   of snags differed between 1997 and 2002 in ponderosa pine forest, but
   not in mixed-conifer forest, and decay-class distributions differed
   among years in both forest types. A classification-tree analysis
   indicated that a ratio of height to diameter, species, and diameter were
   key variables in predicting whether a snag survived from 1997 to 2002.
   These results provide empirical data on snag populations and dynamics in

Abstract = {{Snags are important components of wildlife habitat, providing nesting
   and feeding sites for over 75 species of animals in the southwestem
   United States. Wildfires can increase or decrease the availability of
   snags to wildlife by killing live trees or incinerating snags. Our
   objectives were to describe dynamics and spatial patterns of fire-killed
   snags in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona
   and predict the probability of snag use by cavity nesters. We
   established six 1-ha plots following two recent fires that occurred in
   northern Arizona (Hochderffer fire of 1996 {[}H96] and Pumpkin fire of
   2000 {[}P00]) to determine ponderosa pine snag availability and use by
   wildlife as evidenced by presence of excavated cavities. For comparison,
   six paired 1-ha plots in nearby unburned areas were sampled with burned
   plots. For the twelve 1 ha plots, field methods included mapping and
   measuring 15 characteristics for 668 snags (630 in burned and 38 in
   unburned plots) 4 years post-fire on the H96 fire, and 1010 snags (996
   in burned and 14 in unburned plots) 1 year post-fire on the POO fire. We
   remeasured characteristics of all snags in 2003. Most burned snags were
   standing 3 years after fire, but 7 years after fire, 41\% had fallen.
   Snags in burned plots were clumped when initially measured and
   remeasured. After 7 years, snags in burned plots that were still
   standing were straight, large diameter trees in denser clumps. Density
   of excavated cavities was similar between burned (3.0 ha(-1)) and
   unburned (2.2 ha(-1)) plots, even though burned areas produced much
   higher densities of snags. Snags (both burned and unburned) that were
   most likely to contain excavated cavities were large diameter with
   broken tops. This evidence of cavity nester use indicates that in
   ponderosa pine forests in the southwest, retaining large diameter snags
   is important to cavity nesters regardless of snag origin. If salvage
   logging is to occur in severely burned ponderosa pine in the southwest,
   retaining straight, large diameter snags in clumps will help maintain
   snags for cavity-excavating species. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Breeding birds (songbirds, shorebirds, and ptarmigan) were surveyed at
   the Ekati Diamond Mine in Canada's Northwest Territories from 1996
   through 2003. Surveys were conducted on permanent, 25 ha mine and
   control plots. Five metrics (relative density of individual species,
   relative density of all birds, species richness using rarefaction
   curves, and species diversity using two indices) were used to assess
   potential impacts up to a distance of 1 km from the mine. Six species
   were more common on mine plots, and three were more common on control
   plots. Species diversity was slightly higher on mine plots when measured
   with Fisher's alpha index. No other metrics suggested strong impacts.
   This study suggests that the mine has had a relatively limited impact on
   the upland breeding bird community within 1 km of the footprint but has
   provided habitat for at least one synanthropic bird species. Further
   monitoring of breeding birds on the tundra should include
   pre-development control data and demographic variables such as

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that tropical dry forests are being exploited on a
   large scale for various forest products, there has been limited
   evaluation of the accompanying ecological impacts. In particular, there
   is no information on the effects of widespread biomass extraction such
   as grazing and firewood collection. A study was carried out in Sariska
   Tiger Reserve in northern India, to investigate the effects of biomass
   extraction on forest vegetation composition, diversity and structure.
   Biomass extraction caused significant changes in forest vegetation
   structure and species composition in the tree layer but the extent of
   these changes varied across the three major vegetation types found in
   the Reserve. Anogeissus-dominated slope forest showed significantly
   lower mean canopy cover, tree density, tree basal area and height of
   trees in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Riparian
   forest showed lower mean canopy cover, tree basal areas and number of
   recorded tree species in disturbed sites. Scrub forest had lower mean
   canopy cover, tree basal area and tree height. There were fewer tall
   trees but greater number of short trees in disturbed sites of all three
   vegetation types. Girths of trees similarly shifted towards lower values
   in riparian and scrub forest. In Anogeissus-dominated forest, disturbed
   and undisturbed sites did not differ in proportions of trees in various
   girth-classes. Tree species richness was substantially lower in
   disturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated and riparian forest in
   comparison to undisturbed sites, but was not affected by disturbance in
   scrub forest. Understorey species richness was higher in disturbed sites
   of all three vegetation types but understorey changed structurally only
   in Anogeissus-dominated forest. Overall tree and understorey species
   composition was significantly different between disturbed and
   undisturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated forest, but was unchanged in
   scrub and riparian forest. Observed changes in vegetation structure,
   diversity and composition of the different vegetation types due to
   biomass extraction have implications for biodiversity conservation in
   tropical dry forest ecosystems, and need to be addressed in future
   forest management planning.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is often used in wetlands to remove plant litter,
   decrease woody or invasive species, and increase use by wetland birds.
   However, little is known about the within-season, short-term response of
   wetland birds to prescribed burning, especially during spring migration.
   We surveyed use of 19 burned and 19 unburned (reference) wetlands by
   migratory birds in the Rainwater Basin region of Nebraska, USA during
   three spring migrations, 2002-2004. We calculated the change in avian
   abundance and species richness, as well as generating the Sorenson's
   similarity index for burned and reference wetlands in the weeks
   immediately before and after burning. We compared Sorenson's index
   values and percent change in abundance and species richness between
   burned and reference wetlands using an analysis of covariance with week
   and wetland area as covariates to account for migration chronology and
   differences in the area of experimental units. Following removal of
   effects due to wetland area and week, burning had no effect on the
   percent change in avian abundance and species richness. Sorenson's index
   also did not differ between burned and reference wetlands. Prescribed
   burning did not improve use of wetlands by migratory birds in the short
   term. Understanding the immediate and long-term effects of prescribed
   burning on migratory avian abundance, species richness, and community
   composition is imperative for management decisions.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{177-189}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background There is a compelling need to protect natural plant
   communities and restore them in degraded landscapes. Activities must be
   guided by sound scientific principles, practical conservation tools, and
   clear priorities. With perhaps one-third of the world's flora facing
   extinction, scientists and conservation managers will need to work
   rapidly and collaboratively, recognizing each other's strengths and
   limitations. As a guide to assist managers in maintaining plant
   diversity, six pragmatic models are introduced that are already
   available. Although theoretical models continue to receive far more
   space and headlines in scientific journals, more managers need to
   understand that pragmatic, rather than theoretical, models have the most
   promise for yielding results that can be applied immediately to plant
   communities.
   Six Pragmatic Models For each model, key citations and an array of
   examples are provided, with particular emphasis on wetlands, since `wet
   and wild' was my assigned theme for the Botanical Society of America in
   2003. My own work may seem rather prominent, but the application and
   refinement of these models has been a theme for me and my many students
   over decades. The following models are reviewed: (1) species-area:
   larger areas usually contain more species; (2) species-biomass: plant
   diversity is maximized at intermediate levels of biomass; (3)
   centrifugal organization: multiple intersecting environmental gradients
   maintain regional landscape biodiversity; (4) species-frequency: a few
   species are frequent while most are infrequent; (5) competitive
   hierarchies: in the absence of constraints, large canopy-forming species
   dominate patches of landscape, reducing biological diversity; and (6)
   intermediate disturbance: perturbations such as water level
   fluctuations, fire and grazing are essential for maintaining plant
   diversity.
   Conclusions The good news is that managers faced with protecting or
   restoring landscapes already have this arsenal of tools at their
   disposal. The bad news is that far too few of these models are
   appreciated.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To evaluate the occurrence of open-habitat and steppe-land bird
   species in Western Mediterranean burned areas and to assess the role of
   the extent and location of the fire on species richness and composition.
   At the species level, the relationship was explored between habitat
   breadth, distribution extent and the ability to occupy recently burned
   areas.
   Location: Iberia and Southern France
   Methods: Fieldwork and bibliography were assembled to obtain breeding
   bird inventories for 21 burned areas, mostly large wildfires (135-23,800
   ha). The sampling effort was standardized in relation to the area in the
   I I fire locations surveyed using transects.
   Results: Single burned areas contained 0 to 15 open-habitat species
   (mean = 7.6), and in all the areas combined there were 22 species,
   including 17 with an unfavourable conservation status in Europe. The
   most frequent were Carduelis cannabina, Lullula arborea, Alectoris rufa,
   Oenanthe hispanica and Emberiza cia, but characteristic steppe-land
   birds such as O. leucura, Calandrella brachydactyla and C. rufescens
   also bred in particular burned areas. After controlling for the extent
   of the species range in the Spanish distribution Atlas, passerine
   occurrence in burned areas was positively related to the species'
   habitat breadth in a gradient of unburned habitats. Cluster analysis
   separated a species-poor group of fire locations from a species-rich
   group, and showed that some neighbouring areas had a similar species
   composition. However, there was no spatial autocorrelation between
   burned areas, and species composition was correlated with the fire
   extent (Mantel test). Species richness tended to increase with
   increasing fire area. From the regression equation 5, 9, 12-13 and 16-17
   open-habitat species may be expected to occur in burned areas of 100,
   1000, 10,000 and 100,000 ha, respectively.
   Conclusions: This study stresses the importance of biogeographical
   constraints on colonisation of new habitat patches created by
   disturbances. The extent of the fire rather than the proximity between
   burned areas influenced species richness and composition of open-habitat
   birds in recently burned areas. The best post-fire colonisers were
   generalists regarding habitat structure. The role of large wildfires in
   the conservation of threatened open-habitat birds seems to be
   significant and merits further study.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the composition and structure of primary forest avifauna
   among primary forests, selectively logged forests and mixed-rural areas
   (e.g. villages and agricultural areas) of Peninsular Malaysia. We found
   that forests that were selectively logged at least 30 years ago
   contained only 73-75\% of the 159 species of extant primary forest
   birds, with an increased proportion of dominant species. We estimated
   that only 28-32\% of the primary forest species utilized the mixed-rural
   habitat, and that the number of species that bred in the agricultural
   landscapes might be even lower. The microhabitat of different species
   most affected their vulnerability to disturbance. Most small, arboreal
   frugivores and omnivores, and insectivores that fed from tree trunks,
   showed greater persistence in the mixed-rural habitat than ground
   dwelling bird species, which were affected most by disturbance. Resource
   abundance and variables that were closely related to forest disturbance
   such as the density of large trees, density of dead trees, canopy cover
   density and shrub volume influenced the distribution of the primary
   forest birds. Large primary forest reserves and a revision of
   short-cycle logging regimes (ca. 30 years) are needed if we are to

   rate of invasion by non-native species, and decreasing the persistence
   of native species. This paper briefly reviews the scientific literature
   on the impacts of sprawl on biological diversity, with specific emphasis
   on the influence of sprawl on non-native species richness. We then
   explore the relationship between sprawl and biodiversity using a data
   set of ant species collected from 46 habitat patches located in the
   increasingly suburbanized Florida Keys, USA. We quantified sprawl as the
   proximity of roads and amount of development surrounding a habitat
   patch. Using bait transects, we identified 24 native and 18 non-native
   species of ants. Neither the overall number of native species nor the
   number of rare native species were significantly affected by the amount
   of development or proximity to roads, however, the number of non-native
   species was significantly correlated with the amount of development.
   Surprisingly, the number of native species and rare native species was
   significantly positively correlated with the number of non-native
   species. Areas that supported many species of native ants also supported
   a diverse non-native ant fauna, and the species distribution was highly
   nested. Currently, the native ant fauna of the Florida Keys does not
   appear to be dramatically influenced by sprawl, however, if development
   increases, the number of non-native ants may increase, and many of these
   species have been documented as decreasing native ant diversity. If
   development plateaus, there is evidence that the native ant fauna could
   persist and could decrease non-native species richness through
   competition or predation.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the influence of vegetation structure and tree phenology on
   bird communities along a gradient of tropical forest degradation in NW
   Madagascar. Birds were censused by point counts at Ankarafantsika, one
   of the largest remnants of the severely reduced dry deciduous forest.
   The original forest was dominated by foliage insectivores. A few years
   after wildfire, regrowth was dense, most forest bird species were still
   present and additional understorey species appeared. As a result,
   species richness and abundance per point count increased. In contrast,
   when forest was transformed into savanna, the avian assemblage became
   poor, dominated by granivores and aerial insectivores, with only seven
   species shared with the original forest. Foliage volume, grass volume
   and bare ground cover explained most of the bird community variation by
   means of canonical correspondence analysis. Birds tended to increase
   their habitat breadth along the forest-savanna gradient. An index of
   bird conservation value, including abundance, endemism and the
   threatened status of the species, was highest in burned forests (1.12),
   intermediate in unburned forests (1) and lowest in savanna (0.44). The
   results emphasise the urgent need to protect not only the undisturbed
   fragments, but also the burned dry forests, because of their high value

Abstract = {{Bird species composition (61 species) of Afromontane forest fragments (n
   = 19) embedded in a natural grassland matrix or a plantation forestry
   matrix were compared. Forest bird assemblages in a natural grassland
   matrix displayed a nested non-random species distribution. Species loss
   was significantly area-dependent and predictable. Assemblages in the
   plantation-dominated matrix were also nested but were neither area- nor
   isolation-dependent and these potential processes had equal influence
   over bird species composition. Forests patches <50 ha in plantation were
   more species rich than those in a grassland matrix and visa versa for
   patches >50 ha. The effect of the matrix is revealed here with arboreal
   plantation cover promoting dispersal across the landscape, favouring
   abundant generalist bird species in smaller patches than expected in the
   plantation matrix, and the loss of some specialists and species living
   at low densities from large (>50 ha) patches. Because of a significant
   species-area relationship and possible area-dependent extinction, the
   largest forest patch in the nested series in a grassland matrix protects
   most bird species (89\%). However, in a plantation matrix the absence of
   a species-area relationship requires the combination of many larger
   forest patches to protect most bird species. Plantation forests in the
   matrix significantly alter forest bird assemblage structure and
   composition. To avoid the effects of insularisation and to maintain the
   viability of bird communities in Afromontane forests requires
   conservation of the larger forests in a natural matrix. However, for
   forests in a plantation matrix, the management of dispersal processes by
   manipulation of the matrix may be as important to conserving species and
   communities as is minimising extinctions. Avoiding placing plantations
   near large forests, increasing the size of small patches, and where
   afforestation is unavoidable, placing plantations in the vicinity of
   small rather than large. forest patches, are preferable management
   practices. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Two main mechanisms may explain post-disturbance species
   colonization patterns of early successional habitats such as those
   originated by wildfires. First, post-disturbance colonization is not
   limited by the dispersal ability of the species to reach the newly
   created open areas and, secondly, colonization is limited by dispersal.
   Under the first hypothesis, we expect, at a regional scale, to find
   similar post-disturbance communities to develop on recently burned
   sites. However, colonization limited by dispersal will lead to strong
   between-site variations in species composition.
   Location To test these hypotheses, we studied the post-fire colonization
   patterns of nine open-habitat bird species in eight distantly located
   wildfires in the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula.
   Methods We censused post-fire bird composition by means of field
   transects and identified potential colonization sources from
   species-habitat suitability maps derived from atlas data.
   Results Our results showed strong significant differences in post-fire
   species composition between burnt areas. Burnt areas located in areas
   with low probability of species presence before the fire event showed
   lower species occurrence and richness after the fire.
   Main conclusions These results do not support the idea that early
   successional stages and open habitats have a homogeneous community
   structure at regional scales and suggest that dispersal is a key
   constraint determining bird colonization of post-fire habitats. Further
   attention should be paid to landscape heterogeneity as a key factor in
   determining population dynamics of open-habitat species in the light of
   current and future land-use changes in Mediterranean regions.}},

Abstract = {{Most insights about the effects of residential development on wildlife
   are based on research from urban and suburban areas. Yet exurban
   development is an increasingly prevalent form of human settlement in
   many parts of the world. Moreover because such development often occurs
   near the periphery of protected areas, it may have a disproportionate
   influence on native species. We examined bird community patterns in the
   Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado across a gradient of exurban
   development to determine how avifauna responded to this form of
   settlement. Using fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed the occurrence
   and abundance of breeding birds in 11 developed sites and in 6 nearby
   undeveloped sites, all occurring in a forested matrix. We sampled
   ground-level habitat features at each survey point and derived digital
   land-cover maps from aerial photographs to characterize and quantify
   road development and building density. We found little evidence that
   land-cover varied with development intensity, yet bird abundance
   increased significantly with building density. Patterns of species
   richness were equivocal due to a highly influential observation.
   Principal components analysis (PCA) distinguished two axes that
   explained nearly 50\% of the variation in the bird community and were
   strongly associated with road and building density. Weighted average
   analysis showed a marked decline in the abundance and richness of
   species that were insectivorous or nested in snags, suggesting that
   reductions in dead wood may have influenced the bird community. However,
   no conclusions could be drawn because dead wood was confounded with
   building density. Logistic regression of species occurrence and building
   density indicated that the incidence of some generalist species
   increased with building density, whereas the incidence of specialists
   decreased. Overall, our results suggest that development at low
   densities can favor habitat generalists. Similar patterns have been
   observed in more urbanized areas. If exurban development persists as a
   popular form of settlement in the Rocky Mountains, a regional plan for
   protecting avian habitat and limiting development dispersion will be
   necessary to maintain native bird communities. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The intensification and expansion of modern agriculture is amongst the
   greatest current threats to worldwide biodiversity. Over the last
   quarter of the 20th century, dramatic declines in both range and
   abundance of many species associated with farmland have been reported in
   Europe, reading to growing concern over the sustainability of current
   intensive farming practices. Purportedly `sustainable' farming systems
   such as organic farming are now seen by many as a potential solution to
   this continued loss of biodiversity and receive substantial support in
   the form of subsidy payments through ELF and national government
   legislation. This paper assesses the impacts on biodiversity of organic
   farming, relative to conventional agriculture, through a review of
   comparative studies of the two systems, in order to determine whether it
   can deliver on the biodiversity benefits its proponents claim. It
   identifies a wide range of taxa, including birds and mammals,
   invertebrates and arable flora, that benefit from organic management
   through increases in abundance and/or species richness. It also
   highlights three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of
   chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilisers; sympathetic management of
   non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are
   largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming, and that are
   particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife. However, the review also
   draws attention to four key issues: (1) It remains unclear whether a
   `holistic' whole-farm approach (i.e. organic) provides greater benefits
   to biodiversity than carefully targeted prescriptions applied to
   relatively small areas of cropped and/or non-cropped habitats within
   conventional agriculture (i.e. agri-environment schemes); (2) Many
   comparative studies encounter methodological problems, limiting their
   ability to draw quantitative conclusions; (3) Our knowledge of the
   impacts of organic farming in pastoral and upland agriculture is
   limited; (4) There remains a pressing need for longitudinal,
   system-level studies in order to address these issues and to fill in the
   gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming, before a full
   appraisal of its potential role in biodiversity conservation in
   agroecosystems can be made. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed, biennial burning in forest understory started in Cuivre
   River State Park, Missouri, USA, in the late 1980s to help restore the
   forest to conditions that existed prior to European settlement. Bird
   surveys were started in 1996 on two burned and two unburned sections of
   the park to determine what effects the burning and subsequent changes in
   vegetation were having on bird populations. Birds were sampled at 17
   60-m radius point counts on each study area; each point was sampled
   twice per year during the main breeding period from 1996 through 2002.
   Total abundance and species richness differed among the four areas but
   no differences could be attributed to burning. Some individual species,
   however, differed in abundance and frequency of occurrence between
   burned and unburned areas. For example, Indigo Bunting (Passerina
   cyanea), Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), and several species of
   woodpeckers were more abundant on burned areas; Ovenbird (Seiurus
   aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vemivorous), Wood Thrush
   (Hylocicla mustelina) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) were
   among the species more abundant on unburned areas. As a consequence,
   overall community composition differed significantly between burned and
   unburned areas of the park, but did not differ between burned areas or
   between unburned areas. Prescribed burning was instituted to restore
   vegetation to presettlement conditions and has started to achieve that
   objective. Restoration also has affected and likely will continue to
   affect bird populations. Future maintenance of a full complement of bird
   species, including a number of neotropical migrants, will be dependent
   on presence of both burned and unburned forest habitat. (C) 2004

Title = {{Are epiphytes important for birds in coffee plantations? An experimental
   assessment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{1. Coffee is produced in tropical regions of the world, largely in Latin
   America. Coffee cultivation techniques range from traditional systems,
   where coffee grows under a diverse canopy of shade trees (shade-coffee
   plantations), to modern systems, where coffee grows without any type of
   shade (sun-coffee plantations). Shade-coffee plantations provide refuge
   for forest fauna in otherwise deforested landscapes. The conservation
   value of these agro-ecosystems depends upon their structural and
   floristic diversity.
   2. The way coffee producers manage the vegetation, including the
   epiphytic component, may profoundly affect the value of plantations for
   conserving biological diversity. Shade-coffee certification programmes
   have emerged to verify that coffee advertised as `shade grown' is
   actually grown on highly biodiverse plantations. Although these
   programmes universally encourage epiphyte protection from pruning (a
   common practice), there has been no experimental evaluation of the
   importance of epiphytes in supporting faunal diversity. We report the
   effect of experimentally removing epiphytes on the bird assemblage in a
   shade-coffee farm near Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico.
   3. We established two matching pairs of epiphyte removal and control
   plots. We compared bird diversity and abundance, based on daily censuses
   during the breeding and non-breeding season. We used existing
   information on the way in which birds use epiphytes as foraging and
   nesting substrates to explain the presence of different species in plots
   with epiphytes.
   4. Plots without epiphytes tended to be less diverse than plots with
   epiphytes, but rarefaction analysis and ANOVA showed no significant
   differences in species richness between treatments in any of the
   seasons. Mean bird abundance was significantly higher in plots with
   epiphytes during both seasons, and a multidimensional scaling analysis
   showed that bird community structure differed between the two
   treatments.
   5. Eighteen forest bird species were significantly more abundant in
   plots with epiphytes. Three non-forest species were more common in plots
   without epiphytes. Resident bird species that used epiphytes as a
   nesting substrate were significantly more abundant in plots with
   epiphytes.
   6. When epiphytes are removed, canopy cover, foraging substrates, nest
   sites and nest materials are eliminated and microclimatic conditions
   change. This could increase predation on adult birds and nests, increase
   intra- and interspecific competition, and decrease individual

   7. Synthesis and applications. This is the first experimental assessment
   of the importance of epiphytes for birds. Shade-coffee plantations with
   epiphytes maintain higher abundance and diversity of the inhabitant bird
   fauna than plantations without epiphytes. This study reinforces the
   value of positive epiphyte management as an important factor in
   shade-grown coffee certification, where the goal is to promote
   biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Dead wood is a typical feature and a key factor of biodiversity in the
   sense of species richness in natural forests. Late development phases
   are characterised by a high amount and diversity of dead wood. Because
   European forests have been intensively managed over long periods of
   time, the late development phases are scarce or completely missing. Such
   shortage of the dead wood component has led to a severe loss of habitats
   for saproxylic species. This has been recognised at the political level
   by the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe
   (MCPFE). Within the Pan-European Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable
   Forest Management, nine improved indicators under the criterion 4:
   ``Maintenance, Conservation and Appropriate Enhancement of Biological
   Diversity in Forest Ecosystems{''} have been adopted at the 411
   Ministerial Conference in 2003 One of these indicators addresses dead
   wood. In this paper habitat requirements are identified for saproxylic
   species groups and their sensitivity towards key criteria of dead wood
   assessment. The different functional types of dead wood are then
   defined, categorised and compared to existing assessments within
   monitoring schemes (national and international). Finally the identified
   attributes are investigated on their applicability for operational use
   of monitoring dead wood within monitoring schemes. On this basis, a
   method of dead wood assessment on the scale of natural and biogeographic
   regions is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{A method for biodiversity assessment and natural resources management in
   the Pechora River Basin is developed, to evaluate the sustainability of
   land-use. Data were collected on the abiotic and the biotic system, and
   models are being developed on forest production, regeneration and
   changes in biodiversity. Species diversity differs per taxon, but also
   alpha and beta diversity differs, and management has large impact on the
   species diversity. We show that high species diversity is often
   associated with harvesting, due to invasion of plant and bird species in
   open vegetation. In other ecosystems we observe a high species diversity
   for disturbed areas (e.g. gardens, with ruderal species and neophytes),
   and low diversity for species-poor ecosystems such as peatlands or even
   some pristine forests.
   Species diversity was found to be a poor approximation of biodiversity
   in the sense of ecosystem value, since different succession stages and
   disturbance regimes result sometimes in high species numbers, compared
   to undisturbed ecosystems. We propose therefore a different approach,
   based on a number of indicators at both landscape (ecosystem) and stand
   level. At landscape or ecosystem level we propose ecosystem rarity,
   landscape pattern, naturalness, and representativeness as indicators. At
   stand level we propose species diversity, species rarity and dead wood.}},

   Suriname's avifauna. The Sipaliwini savanna harbors a number of bird
   species that are not found elsewhere in the Guianas. The savanna itself
   has a low human population density and is relatively unaffected by the
   large-scale cattle grazing and frequent fires that have degraded other
   savanna regions throughout the Neo-tropics. The Sipaliwini appears to
   contain healthy populations of several species that require
   late-successional post-fire habitats or are otherwise sensitive to human
   activity, including the San Parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis) and
   Rufous-sided Pygmy-Tyrant (Euscarthmus rufomarginatus). Continued
   protection of the savanna from extensive fire and grazing is urged.}},

Abstract = {{Water-level drawdown has long been recognized as an effective approach
   to enhance habitat conditions for aquatic fauna in lakes and
   impoundments. Although targeted species such as sport fish may benefit,
   increasingly there are concerns over nontarget species. We assessed the
   impacts of a drawdown of Lake Kissimmee on Florida apple snails. Prior
   to the drawdown, we found apple snails at significantly higher densities
   in sites dominated by sandy substrates and emergent macrophytes: no
   snails were found in sites with deep layers of unconsolidated organic
   material and dominated by Nuphar luteum. Following the drawdown. some of
   the sites containing this unconsolidated organic material were also
   scraped with heavy equipment (e.g., bulldozer) to remove the organic
   layer. We monitored the response of 31 snails from one site. most of
   which were stranded in the dry littoral zone during the 1995-1996
   drawdown. Mortality rates of stranded snails were high due to the dry
   conditions of the littoral zone., but also indirectly due to increased
   vulnerability to predation by several avian species. The Survival data
   was corroborated by the 1996 and 1997 funnel trap data wherein our catch
   declined by 80 \% from 1995 (pre-drawdown) levels. The proportion of
   juveniles also declined significantly, indicating an impact on
   recruitment. Snail abundance did increase. albeit marginally. in some
   sites. indicating potential benefits of drawdown and organic Substrate
   removal in some types of littoral zone habitats. However, the timing of
   drawdown events appears critical, as evident in poor recruitment and
   relatively low abundance following completion of lake restoration
   activity. In order to avoid substantial losses to non-target species
   such as apple snails, we suggested that natural resource managers give
   greater consideration to the potential negative impacts of deviating
   from the natural hydrologic regime in terms of timing, duration, and
   frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Pine plantations are an alternative to marginal agriculture in many
   countries, and are often presented as an option that improves
   biodiversity. However, these plantations can have adverse environmental
   effects if improperly managed. To evaluate the effect of forest
   management practices on biodiversity, the diversity, species richness,
   dominance and frequency of understory woody plant species in different
   forests of the Basque Country (northern Spain) were compared.
   Plantations of exotic conifers (Pinus radiata {[}D.] Don) of different
   ages were compared with deciduous forests of Quercus robur L. and Fagus
   sylvatica L. The effects of different types and intensities of
   management were taken into account. The differences observed were mainly
   conditioned by the intensity of forestry management, although the
   response varied according to forest type and age. In unmanaged pine
   plantations, the diversity and species richness of the understory
   increased rapidly after planting (while dominance decreased), remained
   stable in the intermediate age range, and reached a maximum in
   plantations more than 25 years of age. Management practices resulted in
   decreased understory diversity and species richness, as well as greater
   dominance. This was more pronounced in younger than in older stands.
   Moderate management, however, favored a greater diversity of the
   understory in deciduous forests. The species composition of the
   plantations and deciduous forests were different, the latter having a
   wider range of characteristic species. Knowledge of how forestry
   practices influence biodiversity (in terms of diversity, richness,
   dominance, and species composition) may allow predictions to be made
   about the diversity achievable with different management systems.}},

Abstract = {{Recent losses and fragmentation of tallgrass; prairie habitat to
   agriculture and urban development have led to corresponding declines in
   diversity and abundance of plants and birds associated with such
   habitat. Mowing and burning are alternative management strategies for
   restoring and rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, but their
   specific, comparative effects are the subjects of ongoing evaluation. We
   compared the responses of plant and bird communities on four sets of
   mowed, burned, and untreated sites of small (3-10 ha), fragmented
   tallgrass prairies at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR), Iowa,
   U.S.A., during May-July in 1998 and 1999. Species richness and diversity
   of plants, resident grassland birds, and communities of birds associated
   with grassland edges (edge species) were independent of treatment.
   Although not affecting species richness and diversity in plant
   communities, mowed sites ranked lower in total plant coverage and total
   forb coverage than burned sites or untreated sites. In contrast,
   untreated sites had more coverage by shrubs, suggesting that mowing and
   burning did retard shrub encroachment. Overall, abundance and diversity
   of plants and birds were generally insensitive to management strategies.
   Small, fragmented sites of rare habitat may not respond in the short
   term to management treatments and may not be capable of supporting
   highly diverse communities, no matter how intensively manipulated. It is
   more probable that diversity of native prairie communities can be
   enhanced and restored only through long-term efforts, acquisition of
   large land units capable of supporting stable populations, and
   deliberate reintroduction of species of high conservation value.}},

   Overall, sites that were perceived as more well-cared-for and as a good
   place to enjoy nature were perceived as more attractive. In addition,
   objective site characteristics, like cultural cues and natural landscape

Abstract = {{Use of herbicides to control competing vegetation in young forests can
   increase wood volume yields by 50-150\%. However, increasing use of
   herbicides in forest management has caused widespread concerns among the
   public and biologists about direct toxicity to wildlife and indirect
   effects through habitat alteration. Abundant research has indicated that
   forest herbicide treatments target biochemical pathways unique to
   plants, do not persist in the environment, and have few toxic effects
   when operationally applied. Herbicides affect forest biodiversity by
   creating short-term declines in plant species diversity, altering
   vegetative structure, and potentially changing plant successional
   trajectories. For wildlife species, effects vary but generally are
   short-term. Despite these findings, public opinion against forest
   herbicides often has limited or restricted their use, likely due to
   people's values associated with forests and a lack of technical
   knowledge. Future research efforts on relationships between forest
   herbicides and biodiversity should address landscape and site-specific
   issues, be based on rigorous experimental design, be relevant to public
   concerns, include comparisons of herbicide treatments with alternative
   treatments excluding herbicides, examine use of chemical mixtures, and
   determine the social, economic, and possible long-term ecological
   consequences of treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in the intensity of the management of agricultural grasslands
   over the past 50 years have reduced plant species diversity in swards
   and increased uniformity in structure through changes in fertilizer
   regimes, grazing and mowing practices. These factors, as well as
   increased disturbance and trampling, have reduced the number and
   diversity of forbs and thus the diversity and abundance of
   invertebrates, in particular of foliar species. Associated with these
   changes in management, there has been a large decline in the abundance
   of many species of farmland birds in pastoral areas and more local
   extinctions compared with arable areas. To understand the impact of
   these management changes on bird populations, and design measures to
   reverse the declines, it is necessary to identify the key factors
   influencing bird usage of fields. We review results from five studies,
   which have related fertilizer and grazing management to bird usage of
   grass fields. Species that fed on soil invertebrates tended to show a
   positive response to the amount of nitrogen fertilizer added and
   increased grazing pressure, although there was a high degree of
   correlation between these two variables. In summer, many species,
   including corvids, Common Blackbird Turdus merula, Common Starling
   Sturnus vulgaris, Pied Wagtail Motacilla alba and Hedge Accentor
   Prunella modularis, showed a negative relationship with sward height,
   and in winter more species showed a positive relationship with bare
   ground. Taller sward heights are associated with a greater abundance and
   diversity of bird invertebrate food resources, and accessibility of food
   items or a lower risk of predation (actual or perceived) are likely to
   be the reasons for birds choosing to forage on shorter swards and in
   areas with more bare ground. Birds feeding on soil invertebrates were
   found to be generally tolerant of modern management practices that
   maintain short swards short, as accessibility to the soil has been
   increased. Species that feed on foliar invertebrates or forb seeds have
   been affected negatively by modern grassland agricultural practices.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in agricultural policies have favored tree clearing and removal
   of shrubs to favor intensive farming in the holm oak Quercus ilex
   dehesas of Iberia. The effect of these changes for bird species
   wintering in this agricultural landscape has been rarely analyzed. Here
   the effects are studied of farming changes in traditional holm oak
   dehesas on population size, social structure and time budget of common
   cranes Grus grus in eight traditional wintering sites in Spain. The role
   of acorn availability, the principal winter food of the species, in
   relation to management is also assessed. The number of cranes in each
   wintering area was not related to degree of agricultural
   intensification, nor to the availability of acorns. However, crane flock
   size decreased, and the relative occurrence of isolated family groups
   increased in less intensively transformed wintering areas characterized
   by the predominance of fallow lands. The age composition of crane flocks
   varied with acorn availability since more juveniles were reported in
   areas with relatively lower acorn availability. Time budget was also
   related to acorn availability, since cranes spent relatively more time
   preening in those wintering areas with higher availability of acorns.
   Globally evidence suggests the need to maintain the fallow land (posios)
   to sustain the wintering populations of cranes in Iberia, since this
   agro-grazing system maintains most of the juvenile cranes using the
   western migratory route.}},

Abstract = {{Community level analyses of species-environment relationships can
   provide critical information for conservation planners. A comprehensive
   analysis of the factors that influence species distributions should
   include variables measured at multiple scales because
   species-environment relationships are known to vary with the scale of
   observation. The pitch pine-scrub oak (Pinus rigida-Quercus ilicifolia)
   communities, or pine barrens, of the northeastern USA are severely
   threatened by development and fire suppression. They also provide
   critical habitat for many species of rare moths. We used partial
   canonical correspondence analysis to assess the relative effects of
   three levels of environmental variables (plot, patch, and landscape) on
   the distribution and abundance of 10 species of rare moths in a pine
   barrens community in southeastern Massachusetts, USA. We also used a set
   of spatial variables to quantify and partial out the effects of spatial
   autocorrelation of species composition among sampling locations. All
   three levels of environmental factors combined, independent of spatial
   factors, accounted for virtually half (48.4\%) of the total variation in
   the moth community. Sequential partitioning of the variance explained by
   each level of environmental factors indicated that landscape level
   factors explained more than twice as much variance as plot and patch
   level factors. Another environmental model that included only landscape
   level variables explained 53\% of the total variation in the moth
   community. Patch density and percentage of the landscape comprised of
   open and sparse canopy, scrub oak habitats were the most significant
   variables. These results suggest that the presence of scrub oak habitat
   within relatively large, heterogeneous landscape mosaics may be more
   important for the maintenance of many rare pine barrens associated moth
   populations than plot or patch level characteristics. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Journal = {{RESTORATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{376-390}},

Abstract = {{The planting of sand-binding vegetation in the Shapotou region at the
   southeastern edge of the Tengger Desert began in 1956. Over the past 46
   years, it has not only insured the smooth operation of the
   Baotou-Lanzhou railway in the sand dune section but has also played an
   important role in the restoration of the local eco-environment;
   therefore, it is viewed as a successful model for desertification
   control and ecological restoration along the transport line in the arid
   desert region of China. Long-term monitoring and focused research show
   that within 4-5 years of establishment of sand-binding vegetation, the
   physical surface structure of the sand dunes stabilized, and inorganic
   soil crusts formed by atmospheric dust gradually turned into microbiotic
   crusts. Among the organisms comprising these crusts are cryptogams such
   as desert algae and mosses. In the 46 years since establishing
   sand-binding vegetation, some 24 algal species occurred in the crusts.
   However, only five moss species were identified, which was fewer than
   the species number in the crust of naturally fixed sand dunes. Other
   results of the planting were that near-surface wind velocity in the
   46-year-old vegetation area was reduced by 54.2\% compared with that in
   the moving sand area; soil organic matter increased from 0.06\% in
   moving sand dunes to 1.34\% in the 46-year-old vegetation area; the main
   nutrients N, P, K, etc., in the desert ecosystem increased; soil
   physicochemical properties improved; and soil-forming processes occurred
   in the dune surface layer. Overall, establishment of sand-binding
   vegetation significantly impacted soil water cycles, creating favorable
   conditions for colonization by many herbaceous species. These herbaceous
   species, in turn, facilitated the colonization and persistence of birds,
   insects, soil animals, and desert animals. Forty-six years later, some
   28 bird species and 50 insect species were identified in the vegetated
   dune field. Thus, establishment of a relatively simple community of
   sand-binding species led to the transformation of the relatively barren
   dune environment into a desert ecosystem with complex structure,
   composition, and function. This restoration effort shows the potential
   for short-term manipulation of environmental variables (i.e., plant
   cover via artificial vegetation establishment) to begin the long-term
   process of ecological restoration, particularly in arid climates, and
   demonstrates several techniques that can be used to scientifically
   monitor progress in large-scale restoration projects.}},

Abstract = {{In the northeastern United States, pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.)-scrub
   oak (Quercus iIicifolia Wang.) communities are increasingly threatened
   by development and fire suppression, and prioritization of these
   habitats for conservation is of critical importance. As a basis for
   local conservation planning in a pitch pine-scrub oak community in
   southeastern Massachusetts, we developed logistic-regression models
   based on multiscale landscape and patch variables to predict hotspots of
   rare and declining bird and moth species. We compared predicted moth
   distributions with observed species-occurrence records to validate the
   models. We then quantified the amount of overlap between hotspots to
   assess the utility of rare birds and moths as indicator taxa. Species
   representation in hotspots and the current level of hotspot protection
   were also assessed. Predictive models included variables at all measured
   scales and resulted in average correct classification rates (optimal
   cutpoint) of 85.6\% and 89.2\% for bird and moth models, respectively.
   The majority of moth occurrence records were within 100 m of predicted
   habitat. Only 13\% of all bird hotspots and 10\% of all moth hotspots
   overlapped, and only a few small patches in and around Myles Standish
   State Forest were predicted to be hotspots for both taxa. There was no
   correlation between the bird and moth species-richness maps across all
   levels of richness (r = -0.03, p = 0.62). Species representation in
   hotspots was high, but most hotspots had limited or no protection. Given
   the lack of correspondence between bird and moth hotspots, our results
   suggest that use of species-richness indicators for conservation
   planning may be ineffective at local scales. Based on these results, we
   suggest that local-level conservation planning in pitch pine-scrub oak
   communities be based on multitaxa, multiscale approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of source and sinks can guide conservation, but empirical
   studies are needed to demonstrate that this concept applies to the real
   world. We investigated whether the source-sink concept Could help to
   clarify the influence of habitat potential (scrub ridge
   characteristics), population density, and fires (shrub heights) on
   Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) demography and dispersal. We
   mapped territories and measured survival, recruitment, emigration,
   immigration, and shrub heights annually for 12 years. We classified
   territories as oak if they overlapped well-drained ridges, oak-palmetto
   if they overlapped poorly drained ridges >0.4 ha, and palmetto-oak if
   they only overlapped poorly drained ridges <0.4 ha. Territory size
   differed little among these categories but was negatively correlated
   with the annual number of breeding pairs, which ranged from 12 to 27.
   Scrub ridge characteristics influenced the locations of sinks and
   potential sources, whereas population density and fires caused temporal
   variation in demographic success. Oak territories were usually sources
   because they were net exporters of individuals and because recruitment
   exceeded mortality. Oak-palmetto territories sometimes functioned as
   sources but were often pseudo-sinks because density dependence caused
   mortality to exceed recruitment. Palmetto-oak territories were true
   sinks because they were net importers of individuals and mortality
   exceeded recruitment regardless of population density. All scrub was
   short (<1.2 m) or medium height (1.2-1.7 m), but the spatial arrangement
   of these height classes changed regularly because fires occurred every
   2-7 years. We observed a quadratic relationship between demographic
   success and the area of medium-height scrub within territories.
   Territories that had 0.9-1.2 ha of medium-height scrub had the highest
   demographic success. Applying source-sink concepts at the territory
   scale was useful to quantify habitat variation at a spatial scale
   relevant to population processes, reserve design, and habitat
   management. Our approach can be applied by using territory maps or
   geographic information systems to partition heterogeneous landscapes
   into territories and then by classifying territories into potential
   sources and sinks using scrub ridge characteristics and shrub heights.}},

Abstract = {{The role of habitat heterogeneity as a key factor in determining species
   pools in habitat mosaics has been acknowledged, but we still know little
   on the relative importance of the different ecological processes acting
   within such complex landscapes. We compared species richness and
   distribution in forest fragments imbedded in shrub-lands to those in
   continuous forests or in continuous shrublands. We examined the
   consistency of our data with the predictions of two hypotheses: 1) the
   Habitat fragmentation hypothesis which states that fragmentation has
   negative effects on the species from the original continuous habitat; 2)
   the Habitat supplementation /complementation hypothesis which stipulates
   that the presence of a matrix habitat around the fragments will mitigate
   negative effects on the species from the original habitat
   (supplementation) or allow the presence of species that depend on the
   presence of both the fragment and matrix habitats (complementation). We
   show that: 1) species richness in forest fragments did not differ from
   species richness in segments of continuous forests of equal area; 2) the
   bird community of forest fragments got impoverished in some forest
   species but a higher proportion of species common in continuous forests
   were not affected by fragmentation; 3) fragment communities had a
   significant proportion of common species that were scarce in, or absent
   from both continuous forests and shrublands. While, a few forest species
   supported predictions from the fragmentation hypothesis, occurrence
   patterns observed in several other species were consistent with either
   the supplementation or the complementation hypotheses. Our results
   suggest that there is no single hypothesis that properly captures the
   consequences of a shift from continuous forests to a mosaic of forest
   fragments and shrublands and that different ecological mechanisms act in
   conjunction to determine species pools in habitat mosaics. Habitat
   heterogeneity at a local scale appears a key factor in maintaining bird
   diversity in fire driven Mediterranean landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{We compared vegetation structure used by 14 bird species during the 1998
   and 1999 breeding seasons to determine what habitat features best
   accounted for habitat division and community organization in Utah
   juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands of southwestern Wyoming.
   Habitat use was quantified by measuring 24 habitat variables in 461
   bird-centered quadrats, each 0.04 ha in size. Using discriminant
   function analysis, we differentiated between habitat used by 14 bird
   species along 3 habitat dimensions: (1) variation in shrub cover,
   overstory juniper cover, mature tree density, understory height, and
   decadent tree density; (2) a gradient composed of elevation and forb
   cover; and (3) variation in grass cover, tree height, seedling/sapling
   cover, and bare ground/rock cover. Of 14 species considered, 9 exhibited
   substantial habitat partitioning: Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura),
   Bewick's Wren (Thryomanes bewickii), Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila
   caerulea), Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides), Plumbeous Vireo
   (Vireo plumbeus), Green-tailed Towhee (Pipilo chlorurus), Brewer's
   Sparrow (Spizella breweri), Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis), and
   Cassin's Finch (Carpodacus cassinii). Our results indicate juniper bird
   communities of southwestern Wyoming are organized along a 3-dimensional
   habitat gradient composed of woodland maturity, elevation, and juniper
   recruitment. Because juniper birds partition habitat along successional
   and altitudinal gradients, indiscriminate woodland clearing as well as
   continued fire suppression will alter species composition. Restoration
   efforts should ensure that all successional stages of juniper woodland
   are present on the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{I investigated the role of habitat structure in explaining bird species
   richness and abundance in riparian buffer strips of old-growth
   coniferous forest on western Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Using
   buffer strips of varying widths and a control from undisturbed riparian
   forest, I tested the hypothesis that vegetation differs in buffer strips
   of varying width. I selected 10 summary variables to represent
   broad-scale vegetation attributes of riparian habitat. Deciduous tree
   density was higher, and shrub richness was lower in wide buffers
   compared with narrow buffers. I then used Akaike information criterion
   to examine whether vegetation structure or buffer width best explained
   patterns of bird richness and abundance in riparian habitats. Species
   richness and abundance in several foraging guilds were explained better
   by buffer width than by vegetation. Abundances of three bird habitat
   guilds: riparian specialists, forest-interior, and open-edge species,
   and 6 of 10 species were best explained by specific vegetation features.
   Differences in vegetation, particularly deciduous tree density and shrub
   cover, explained part of the variation in abundance of several riparian
   forest-dwelling species and may be useful in evaluating specific forest
   management practices. Because deciduous tree density is also positively
   correlated with buffer width, wide buffers (>100 m) may benefit not only
   those species associated with coniferous upland forests and forest
   generalists sensitive to buffer width, but also those species whose
   abundance is associated with deciduous trees.}},

Abstract = {{We studied year-round food preferences of the three-toed woodpecker
   (Picoides tridactylus) from 1994 to 2000 in Berchtesgaden National Park,
   Germany. We color-banded 52 birds for individual recognition, and we
   radiomarked 25 adults from this sample. We analyzed 142 feces of 30
   adults and 588 feces of 40 nestlings from 15 nests. Additionally, we
   took samples from 20 trees recently used for foraging in 10 woodpecker
   territories to estimate local prey availability. Based on relative
   abundance and relative frequency of food items (i.e., importance value),
   overall diet composition of adult three-toed woodpeckers was dominated
   by spiders (Araneidea), larvae of longhorn beetles (Coleoptera,
   Cerambycidae), and bark beetles (Coleoptera, Scolytidae). Adults ate
   longhorn beetle larvae primarily during nesting, while imagines (fully
   developed adults) and larvae of various bark beetles appeared to be the
   main food resource outside the nesting season. Nestling diet was
   dominated by spiders and longhorn beetle larvae that were gathered 247
   +/- 122 m ( (x) over bar +/- SD) from the nest. Our results demonstrated
   that consumption of bark beetles by three-toed woodpeckers varies
   throughout the year, being lowest during the nesting season, while
   longhorn beetle larvae are preferred throughout the year. Securing
   habitat requirements of both bark and wood-boring beetle communities is
   a critical step to maintaining viable three-toed woodpecker populations.}},

Abstract = {{Pale-headed Brush-finch Atlapetes pallidiceps is a restricted-range
   species that is threatened with extinction due to habitat loss. The
   total population of 60-80 individuals achieved a reproductive output of
   only 0.74 young per breeding pair in 2002. Brood parasitism by Shiny
   Cowbird Molothrus bonariensis was a major factor reducing breeding
   success, affecting 38.5\% of broods. Parasitism rates reached 50\% in an
   ungrazed reserve, but only 14\% on an adjacent grazed plot. The
   resulting difference in breeding success was not, however, attributable
   to vegetation parameters used to describe microhabitat use. Cowbird
   parasitism rates therefore seem to be influenced largely by factors
   operating at the landscape level. These may include grazing scheme,
   topography, humidity and host availability. It is suggested that lower
   species diversity and bird abundance rendered the grazed site less
   attractive to cowbirds. Current parasitism rates are of great
   conservation concern due to the low population size of Pale-headed
   Brush-finch, and the initiation of controlling measures is pressing.
   Management options described from intensive cowbird control programmes
   in North America are reviewed and evaluated for their applicability
   here. To. combine the possibility of further data collection with
   commencement of immediate conservation action, we consider two
   alternative approaches. Nest monitoring and cowbird egg removal would
   enable the study of the distribution of parasitism in relation to
   landscape and vegetation variables, whereas cowbird shooting and nest
   monitoring might provide a larger short-term benefit to reproductive
   output. Habitat management, resumption of some grazing in the reserve
   and cowbird removal should be considered for the intermediate future.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation structure is an integral component of avian habitat
   selection. Therefore, structure changes caused by management practices
   can influence avian communities. The salt marshes of the pampas region
   of Argentina have experienced an increase in fire use as a management
   tool to improve cattle forage and to avoid accidental fires. A spring
   burn of 200 ha of salt marsh in Mar Chiquita Biosphere Reserve,
   Argentina, in September 1995, allowed us to compare the response of
   birds associated with two vegetation communities, one dominated by
   Spartina densiflora (Spartina marsh) and another dominated by Juncus
   acutus (Juncus marsh) from one month to one year post-burn. We recorded
   changes in plant species composition and vegetation structure (height
   and cover) at 40 days after the burn and every season for the subsequent
   year. Fire reduced total cover of both plant communities. Juncus marsh
   recovered pre-burn structure and bird community by one year post-fire.
   However, Spartina marsh recovery was incomplete in that period. Relative
   abundances of bird species that used unburned Juncus marsh were similar
   to those in burned Juncus marsh in the spring period one year after the
   burn. Plant height at the burned Spartina marsh did not reach that of
   the unburned Spartina in 12 months; red-capped wren-spinetail
   (Spartonoica maluroides), a rare tall-grass-dependent species, settled
   burned parcels at lower relative abundances than in unburned habitat.
   Because species that first use the burned patches are very common and
   widespread in other habitats, and excessive burning may reduce available
   habitat for endangered or rare species, prescribed burns should be
   avoided in this region.}},

   19, and the remainder were too rare to draw any conclusions. Species
   that Were snore common in unflooded fields were all carnivorous or
   granivorous in winter, whereas species that were snore common in flooded
   fields were mostly insectivores commonly associated with aquatic
   habitats. The net effects of the responses by individual species were
   fewer raptor species in flooded fields, but no difference in the species

   birds in North America. Although hawk owls use burned forest, reports of
   this association have been primarily anecdotal and outside the breeding
   season. We present the first comparison of hawk owl relative abundance
   between burned and unburned conifer-dominated boreal forest in North
   America. Hawk owls were detected only in postfire forest and were not
   detected in nearby unburned coniferous forest. There was a significant
   negative exponential relationship between hawk owl abundance and burn
   age, suggesting that burns were only suitable up to 8 years postfire. A
   conservative estimate of a peak in breeding density was three nests per
   100 km(2) for a 2-year-postfire forest. Wildfire and newly burned
   forests may be an important feature for hawk owls in the Nearctic boreal
   forest. This raises the question whether management of this species
   through improved forestry techniques is a sufficient conservation
   measure.}},

Abstract = {{Single-species habitat management strategies are often undertaken

   Here we explore the potential effects of managing eastern Ontario
   deciduous forests for the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea) by
   examining its potential as a biodiversity indicator species and as an
   umbrella species. Our results indicate that the Cerulean Warbler would
   not be an effective biodiversity indicator, as its distribution across
   the studied landscape did not coincide with areas of high avian species
   richness. However, the Cerulean Warbler may be effective as an umbrella
   species for the maintenance of populations of other canopy-nesting
   species that require mature deciduous forest habitats. It is hoped that
   the conclusions reached in Ontario, while perhaps not directly
   transferable to all parts of the breeding range, encourage other
   Cerulean Warbler researchers to ask similar questions in their study

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{81-92}},

Abstract = {{The Bialowieza Forest (BF) is an extensive and relatively little changed
   forest complex on the Polish-Belarussian border. Data on the structure
   and diversity of its breeding avifauna have mostly been collected in
   primeval old-growth stands, preserved within the Bialowieza National
   Park (BNP). Mapping censuses repeated in space (plots, replicated in
   riverine, oak-lime-hornbeam and coniferous stands) and time (permanent
   plots, 28 years) reveal that the breeding bird assemblages are rich in
   species (29-52/season in a 25 to 33-ha plot), but of moderate overall
   density (40-120 pairs/10 ha). The latter is due to low, lower than in
   man-transformed areas, densities of the majority of particular species.
   Despite marked changes in vegetation structure, the composition of the
   breeding bird assemblage does not vary much across different primeval
   forest types, with a single breeding bird community inhabiting all of
   them, including treefall gaps. High richness of the BF avifauna stems
   from the Forest's geographical locality, as well as from a high level of
   the primeval avifauna retention. Over 95\% of the 135-140 pristine
   species still breed there. Especially species-rich groups are birds of
   prey, owls, woodpeckers and Sylvinae warblers. Bird communities in the
   BNP and primeval tropical rain forests share many features, suggesting
   that natural differences between temperate and tropical forests were
   less pronounced in the past. The combination of high species richness
   with low densities of individual species is probably a feature of all
   pristine forests, independent of climatic zone. The BF avifauna must
   once have been typical of the ancient European forests and it has become
   so exceptional chiefly because it has preserved most of its pristine
   features. The BF thus constitutes an indispensable reference site for
   future studies of woodland bird biology. To ensure its survival should
   become a priority. Commercial logging, taking place over 80\% of the
   Polish BF part, severely changes the Forest's structure and strongly
   affects the birds, especially species which depend on dead wood
   (Dendrocopos leucotos, Picoides tridactylus) and on old-growth stands.
   The small area protected as the BNP becomes an increasingly isolated
   ``island{''}, in which preservation of the primeval forest features
   seems to be impossible. In order to retain them, it is necessary to
   protect the whole BF area.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of rotted wood is often noted in descriptions of woodpecker
   nest and roost sites, and ornithologists have found that certain fungi
   and species of woodpeckers, such as the red heart fungus (Phellinus
   pini) and Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) are intimately
   linked. The relationship assumed is usually one of woodpecker dependence
   or preference for partially decayed wood in which to excavate cavities,
   but the woodpecker is also sometimes suggested as a vector for the
   fungus. In this paper we review such associations and describe patterns
   evident among woodpecker nest sites that suggest microclimatic and
   microhabitat characteristics favoring fungal colonization of trees,
   wood-pecker-favorable responses of trees to fungi, and ultimate use of
   the trees for woodpecker cavity excavation. Factors that favor fungal
   invasion and tree use by woodpeckers include tree species, growth
   history, site characteristics such as proximity to water and exposure to
   sun or shade, nature and position of tree injury, local climate, forest
   age and species composition, fire frequency, and human management
   activities. Woodpecker cavity height and entrance orientation may be
   related to the dispersal dynamics of fungi, which in turn may be related

Abstract = {{No published data exist on responses of grassland passerines and their

   northwestern North Dakota, we monitored breeding bird occurrence,

   (1998-2000) on 5 prescribe-burned, mixed-grass prairie management units
   (range = 50-534 ha, each burned 3-6 times in the previous 10-20 years).
   All breeding passerine species characteristic of upland, northern
   mixed-grass prairie were common (> 10\% occurrence) during at least 1 of
   3 years on burned and grazed units, except Chestnut-collared Longspur
   (Calcarius ornatus), which was uncommon. Vegetation was generally
   shorter and sparser than that found on 4 nearby units treated by fire
   only (1999; density, visual obstruction, and height, all P < 0.01).
   Regardless, occurrences of individual bird species resembled those
   previously documented on prairie units at LNWR with similar fire
   histories but no grazing; however, Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater)
   occurred 2.4 times more frequently on burned and grazed units studied.

Volume = {{121}},

Abstract = {{Food availability during winter may determine habitat use and limit
   populations of overwintering birds, yet its importance is difficult to
   judge because few studies have experimentally tested the response of
   nonbreeding birds to changes in resource abundance. We experimentally
   examined the link between fruit availability and habitat use by
   manipulating winter abundance of Myrica cerifera L. (Myricaceae) fruits
   in managed longleaf (Pinus palustris) and loblolly (P. taeda) pine
   stands in South Carolina. Myrica cerifera is a common understory shrub
   in the southeastern United States and provides lipid-rich fruit in late
   winter (February and March), when insects and other fruits are scarce.
   On treatment plots, we covered fruiting M. cerifera shrubs with netting
   in early winter to prevent birds from eating their fruits. In late
   February, when M. cerifera fruit crops were largely depleted elsewhere
   on our study site, we uncovered the shrubs and documented the response
   of the bird community to those patches of high fruit availability.
   Relative to control plots, total bird abundance (excluding the most
   common species, Yellow-rumped Warbler {[}Dendroica coronata]) and
   species richness did not change after net removal. Yellow-rumped
   Warblers, however, became significantly more abundant on treatment plots
   after net removal, which suggests that they track M. cerifera fruit
   abundance. We suggest that M. cerifcra plays a role in determining the
   local distribution of wintering Yellow-rumped Warblers at our study
   site. To put these results into a management context, we also examined
   the effect of prescribed fire frequencies on M. cerifera fruit
   production. Across pine stands with different fire regimes, M. cerifcra
   fruit abundance increased with the number of years since burning. It
   takes 4-6 years for individuals to recover sufficiently from a burn to
   produce large quantities of fruit. Thus, shorter intervals between burns
   will reduce winter fruit availability. Taken together, these results
   suggest that within those pine plantations, the local winter
   distribution of at least one common migratory bird is closely tied to
   fruit abundance, which in turn is tied to the frequency of prescribed
   fires.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we used a hierarchical, multifactor ecological
   classification system to examine how spatial patterns of biodiversity
   develop in one of the most species-rich ecosystems in North America, the
   fire-maintained longleaf pine-wiregrass ecosystem and associated
   depressional wetlands and riparian forests. Our goal was to determine
   which landscape features are important controls on species richness, to
   establish how these constraints are expressed at different levels of
   organization, and to identify hotspots of biological diversity for a
   particular locality. We examine the following questions: 1) How is the
   variance in patterns of plant species richness and diversity partitioned
   at different scales, or classification units, of the hierarchical
   ecosystem classification developed for the study area? 2) What are the
   compositional similarities among ecosystem types? 3) For our study area,
   what are the sites expected to harbour highest species richness? We used
   a spatially explicit map of biodiversity to project abundance of
   species-rich communities in the landscape based on a previously
   developed ecological classification system for a lower Gulf Coastal
   Plain landscape. The data indicate that high species richness in this
   ecosystem was found in sites with frequent fire and high soil moisture.
   Sites in fire-maintained landscapes with lower frequency of fire were
   associated with geomorphological characteristics, suggesting a
   dependence of the diversity-disturbance relationship with soil type.
   With more frequent fire on some sites, high diversity shifts from canopy
   component to ground flora, with an overall increase in total species
   richness. Our approach demonstrates how potential species richness can
   be identified as a restoration goal and that multiple vegetation
   endpoints may be appropriate vegetation objectives. We identify basic
   management needs for the maintenance of biodiversity in this ecosystem
   that can be derived from an understanding of the combination of factors
   that most strongly predict diverse plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Indicator species as surrogates for high species richness or a habitat
   type are widely used in conservation programs. The capercaillie (Tetrao
   urogallus), a large forest grouse, is often implicitly attributed an
   indicator function. To integrate habitat requirements for this
   endangered species in forest management practice is a major challenge
   for conservation in most central European countries. It has been
   predicted that capercaillie has an umbrella function for a rich mountain
   forest community. If this is true, conservation measures for
   capercaillie populations will favour overall diversity of naturally
   co-occurring species.
   In this paper we present results of two studies that compare species
   richness and abundance of birds and beetles (Cerambycidae, Buprestidae)
   in forest stands preferred or avoided by capercaillie. We found that the
   capercaillie is a good umbrella for red-listed mountain forest bird
   species, but its potential as a surrogate measure for high species
   diversity of beetles is limited. We conclude that the applicability of

Abstract = {{In Italy the spread of Castanea sativa is largely dependent upon humans,
   who first protected and then Cultivated it for about 3000 years'
   Recently, however, chestnut cultivation has steadily declined, due
   mainly to social and economic factors. In this paper we analysed the
   dynamics of the bird community in chestnut stands that represent a
   gradient from woods impacted by domestic firewood collecting to
   abandoned and derelict coppice interspersed with mature fruiting
   cultivars. Bird diversity, density, species richness and the abundance
   of six out of the sixteen commonest species were positively affected by
   the occurrence of mature fruiting sweet chestnuts in the study stands.
   These old trees (>100 years) are rich in cavities and support many dead
   branches and thus call take the place of dead standing wood for birds,
   offering food. nesting and roosting sites. We also found a significant
   trend of increasing bird abundance. species richness and diversity with
   increasing stand age; heterogeneity in vegetation structure and
   composition following natural regeneration possibly created more
   forest-like conditions than uniform younger woods, thus supporting a
   richer bird community. The present findings are discussed in terms of
   conservation of bird diversity in old coppiced woods.}},

Title = {{The terrestrial vertebrate fauna of Litchfield National Park, Northern
   Territory: monitoring over a 6-year period and response to fire history}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{587-596}},
Abstract = {{Forty-seven 50 m x 50 m quadrats were sampled systematically for
   vertebrates at Litchfield National Park, northern Australia, in both
   1995-96 and 2001-02. A total of 184 vertebrate species was recorded from
   this sampling, of which 92 species were recorded from five or more
   quadrats. There was substantial change in the reported species
   composition of these quadrats between these two periods: the mean
   Bray-Curtis index for similarity in species composition from the
   baseline to subsequent sampling of a quadrat was only 22.1 (for an index
   that varies from 0 for complete turnover in species to 100 for unchanged
   composition). For individual species, correlations across quadrats in
   the abundance scores from baseline to resampling varied from -0.12 to
   0.85. Matched-pairs testing showed that there was significant change in
   abundance for 18 species from the baseline to repeat sampling, and
   significant increase in total bird species richness and total native
   mammal abundance, but significant decrease in reptile species richness.
   Fire history was recorded biannually for 40 of the 47 quadrats. Fire was
   very frequent, with quadrats being burnt in an average of 3.65 years of
   the six years between fauna samples. Three aspects of this fire history
   (total number of years of fires, number of fires in the late dry season,
   and interval from the last fire to the date of resampling) were related
   to change in the fauna composition of quadrats. Neither the similarity
   in species composition, nor change in richness or total abundance of all
   vertebrates or of the four taxonomic classes considered (frogs,
   reptiles, birds and mammals) were significantly correlated with these
   components of the fire history of sampled quadrats. This lack of
   association was possibly because the monitoring period was too short to
   show pronounced directional change, because the system was responding to
   many factors other than fire, because the variations in abundance were
   too large and the number of samples too small to detect true
   associations, or because fire histories preceding baseline sampling were
   not considered.
   The apparent instability of fauna species and communities in this system
   provides a considerable challenge for broad-brush (that is, vertebrate
   community-wide) monitoring. Power analysis demonstrated that, for most
   species, more than 1000 sample sites are needed to be 90\% certain of
   detecting a 20\% change in abundance, and with a 10\% chance of
   accepting a Type I error. This level of sampling effort is commensurate
   with the current level of vertebrate sampling in this region.
   Broad-brush monitoring approaches such as described here are valuable,
   but need also to be complemented by more targetted monitoring for
   individual threatened species or species of particular management
   interest.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying areas with relevant features of biodiversity is useful to
   rank priorities for strengthening the design of well-sited natural
   protected areas and to optimize resource investment in conservation.
   This study provides decision makers critical tools for highlighting
   pieces of land worthy of conservation in Spain. We studied four
   taxa-amphibians, reptiles, nesting birds and mammals-in a 50 x 50 kin
   grid (n = 259 cells). We used five criteria for identifying areas of
   high-value diversity: species richness, rarity, vulnerability, a
   combined index of biodiversity, and a Standardized Biodiversity Index
   that measured all four taxa together. As far as we know, the combined
   index of biodiversity and the Standardized Biodiversity Index are
   original. Areas of high-value diversity were defined as those cells
   within the 15\% top segment of ranked values for the different criteria.
   Congruence of areas of high-value diversity for taxa pairs was moderate
   to low, and averaged 38.5\% for areas of high-value diversity based on
   the combined index of biodiversity. The performance based on the average
   proportion of threatened species excluded from areas of high-value
   diversity followed the rank combined index of biodiversity = rarity
   (0.3\%) > vulnerability (9.9\%) > species richness (13.8\%). The areas
   of high-value diversity identified according to the Standardized
   Biodiversity Index included all amphibian and mammal species, all but
   one reptile species (categorized as rare) and all but six bird species
   (three of which were categorized as threatened). About 70\% of the areas
   of high-value diversity identified based on the Standardized
   Biodiversity Index included natural protected areas. However, they
   average only 274.6 km(2), thus occupying a small fraction of the areas
   of high-value diversity, and there is no guarantee that the species
   found in an area of high-value diversity site will be present in its
   protected fraction. Consequently, we urge managers of natural protected
   areas to conduct diversity surveys. We also urge that additional natural
   protected areas be established to include the gap of 30\% of areas of
   high-value diversity not currently protected. We took an step for
   biodiversity conservation planning in the studied region, and discuss
   the usefulness of maps of areas of high-value diversity for
   conservation, ecological restoration, and environmental impact
   assessment and mitigation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The density and species richness of bird communities in disturbed and

   than in nearby stands that were not disturbed. However, there were fewer
   species and individuals of highly specialized birds or species
   characteristic of papyrus, in disturbed stands than in undisturbed
   swamps. At < 1 ha(-1), the density of Papyrus Gonolek Laniarius
   mufumbiri in Ugandan swamps was, for example, significantly lower in
   polluted and burnt sites than in undisturbed papyrus where up to 13
   ha(-1) were recorded in the centre of swamps. White-winged Swamp Warbler
   Bradypterus carpalis was only recorded in undisturbed papyrus. In the
   papyrus that fringes Lake Naivasha in Kenya, outside the geographical
   range of species restricted to papyrus, disturbance in the form of
   grazing selects against species classified as swam 9, p-reliant. Species
   classified as generalist users of papyrus were much less sensitive to

Abstract = {{Soil characteristics, disturbance histories, and species richness among
   distinct groups of plants and animals may be useful predictors of
   important conservation areas when data are limited. We used multivariate
   analysis of covariance to test the hypothesis that the species richness
   of plants, arthropods, herpetofauna, and breeding birds are correlated
   and increase with soil fertility (silt and clay content in sandy soils),
   soil variability, and hardwood midstory reduction in subxeric,
   nutrient-poor longleaf pine sandhills at Eglin Air Force Base in
   northwest Florida. During 1994-1995 and 1998-1999, we sampled 30 81-ha
   plots with varying fire-exclusion histories and at two spatial scales of
   resolution (10 x 40 m and 81 ha). The relationship between the number of
   plant species and percent silt and clay and its coefficient of variation
   was significant and positive at the plot level (81 ha) but not at the
   subplot level (10 x 40 m). Herpetofaunal species richness was the only
   faunal variable that increased with silt and clay content, but the
   coefficient of variation did not. Multivariate effects of hardwood
   reduction were significant in 1998-1999 but not in 1994-1995, which
   suggests that the reintroduction of fire increased species richness
   across taxa. Univariate effects of hardwood reduction were marginally
   significant for plant species richness at the subplot level and not
   significant for herpetofaunal species richness at either scale. Plant
   and arthropod species richness were not correlated. Herpetofaunal
   species richness was not correlated with that of other taxa (plant and
   animal). The species richness of plants and arthropods were each
   significantly positively correlated with the richness of breeding bird
   species at the subplot level during 1994-1995, whereas only arthropod
   species richness was positively correlated with bird species richness at
   the plot level in either year. Our results suggest that the restoration
   of fire regime may be the most effective tool with which to increase
   diversity in pyrogenic areas considered for conservation protection.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The southern Iberian Peninsula is dominated by a savannah-like
   ecosystem, the montado, which is a typically Mediterranean cultural
   adaptation to generally poor productive areas. Montados are exploited
   for three main uses: forestry, agriculture, and extensive grazing, in
   proportions that vary according to local conditions (more or less
   productive land) and historical circumstances. Because these ecosystems
   occur over a large geographic area (they occupy some 6 million ha),
   biodiversity would be expected to vary among montados. However,
   differences in management practices may also influence species
   distribution. In this paper, we investigate differences in plant and
   bird species diversity among 60 montados distributed all across southern
   Portugal. The environmental variables studied included geographical
   coordinates, climatological data, soil type, and altitude. We also
   investigated agro-economic variables that could describe human
   activities at each site: animal husbandry (breeds, stock density,
   grazing rotation, etc.), agriculture (fallow rotation frequency, use of
   fertilizers, etc.), and forestry (cork harvesting, thinning, etc.).
   Finally, land-use type and metrics were assessed from rectified aerial
   photographs. Species richness among these two groups was not correlated,
   sites with high or low numbers of plant species not necessarily having
   high or low numbers of bird species. However, both plant and bird
   communities exhibited a similar pattern of species composition and
   turnover. This pattern was ecologically based, rather than a result of
   biological similarities between groups: direct gradient analyses and
   variance partitioning revealed strong correlations between species
   distribution and spatial gradients, namely longitude and latitude. In
   trying to distinguish anthropogenic from biophysical processes, we found
   that both were equally important as drivers of montado, biodiversity.
   Plants and birds exhibited a similar ecological pattern, although
   environmental conditions were slightly more important in the case of
   plants, and human activities were slightly more important in the case of
   birds.}},

Abstract = {{Development of lakeshores has occurred at unprecedented levels in recent
   decades. Changes in the shoreland ecosystem concomitant with this
   development have been little studied. In this study, we compared the
   structural and floristic characteristics of vegetation at 97 developed
   and 85 undeveloped (reference) shoreland sites in northern Wisconsin,
   USA. Quantitative comparisons of vegetation structural characteristics
   (percent cover of canopy, subcanopy, and understory vegetation layers;
   percent of shoreline overhung by trees and shrubs; and amount of coarse
   woody debris) showed significantly greater complexity and cover at
   undeveloped versus developed sites. We classified plant communities and
   described plant species composition along three belt transects parallel
   to shore (upland, shoreline, and shallow water) using ordination
   techniques to describe the differences between developed and undeveloped
   sites, as well as among undeveloped sites. The mean number of plant
   species and the percent of native species were both greater at
   undeveloped than at developed sites along all three transects.
   Undeveloped upland sites could be grouped by plant species composition
   into three types: Northern Wet Forest (bog species), Northern Mesic
   Forest, and Northern Xeric Forest. Undeveloped shoreline vegetation was
   also clustered into three categories: bog species, upland species with
   an abrupt transition to aquatic species, and wet meadow species. Soil
   characteristics further distinguished the upland and shoreline
   categories. No distinct vegetation categories emerged in the shallow
   water ordination. We recommend that appropriate species for shoreland
   restoration efforts be selected based on the native plant communities
   present at the undeveloped sites, their relative location along an
   upland to shallow water gradient, and, in some cases, soil
   characteristics.}},

   Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitized 5.3\% of the nests
   and reduced host recruitment by even less. This suggests that ROW in
   forested areas support high production of shrubland birds and do not
   exert a measurably harmful effect on forest-nesting birds. Selective
   herbicide application on ROW sustained shrubland vegetation and
   supported high densities and high nesting success. Mechanical cutting
   lowered the structural diversity of vegetation the following spring and
   was associated with fewer individual birds and species. Cool burns in
   early spring produced a high structural diversity of herbs, shrubs and
   trees and supported a high density of birds and bird species. Long-term
   maintenance of shrublands by burning will require supplemental cutting
   to remove saplings. As reforestation continues to reduce shrubland
   habitat, probably below pre-colonial levels, active management for
   early-succession habitat will be necessary to sustain current population
   levels of numerous species. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Silvicultural practices, such as thinning, are increasingly performed
   both for commodity production and to help achieve biodiversity goals and
   promote ecological restoration. However, relatively little research has
   examined effects of thinning conifer forests on vertebrates. We
   experimentally manipulated stands using a randomized block design to
   evaluate influences of two thinning intensities on populations of
   diurnal breeding birds in western Oregon. We conducted point counts of
   birds seven times each year in 1994 (prior to treatment) and from 1995
   through 2000 (subsequent to treatment). We analyzed data using multiple
   linear regression and information-theoretic approaches to model
   selection. Of the 22 species for which we had sufficient data for
   analysis, detections of nine species decreased and eight species
   increased in thinned stands relative to controls, and there was no
   strong evidence that thinning influenced numbers of five species. Of the
   17 species that responded to thinning, the magnitude of response of
   eight species varied with thinning intensity; for each of these species,
   response was greatest in the more heavily thinned stands. Although no
   species was extirpated from stands following thinning, detections of
   Hutton's Vireos (Vireo huttoni), Golden-crowned Kinglets (Regulus
   satrapa), Brown Creepers (Certhia americana), Black-throated Gray
   Warblers (Dendroica nigrescens), and Varied Thrushes (Ixoreus naevius)
   decreased to less than half of the detections in controls in one or more
   treatment types, suggesting thinning significantly reduces their
   numbers. In contrast, American Robins (Turdus migratorius), Townsend's
   Solitaires (Myadestes townsendi), and Hammond's Flycatchers (Empidonax
   hammondii) were rare or absent in controls but regularly present in
   thinned stands, and detections of Western Tanagers (Piranga
   ludoviciana), Evening Grosbeaks (Coccothraustes vespertinus), and Hairy
   Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) increased by threefold or more in
   thinned stands relative to controls. Only Pacific-slope Flycatchers
   (Empidonax difficilis), Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus), and Western
   Tanagers showed strong evidence of temporal trends in response. For
   these species, differences between numbers in controls and treated
   stands became more extreme through time. Our findings suggest that
   thinning densely stocked conifer stands in landscapes dominated by
   younger stands enhances habitat suitability for several species of
   birds, but that some unthinned patches and stands should be retained to
   provide refugia for species that are impacted by thinning.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of the attention that has been focused on the importance of
   traditional, shade coffee production for biodiversity, little is known
   about the relative conservation value of different systems of managing
   the shade canopy. We surveyed fruit-feeding butterfly species richness
   and vegetation structure on different shade coffee management systems in
   Chiapas, Mexico, that ranged from intensive commercial to traditional,
   rustic systems. The impact, of management on the diversity and structure
   of the shade canopy in each coffee production system was quantified and
   compared using a Management Index. This Management Index revealed
   statistically significant differences between management systems that
   previously were distinguished by researchers using qualitative,
   ``gestalt{''} categories. Butterfly species richness was found to
   decline as management intensity increased, but a significant drop was
   found between the rustic system and the other more intensive systems,
   corroborating the importance of preserving rustic, shade coffee
   production for the conservation of biodiversity. Fruit-feeding
   butterflies were found to be very sensitive to the intensification of
   management of the shade canopy, so they may be an effective way to
   monitor ecological changes that accompany intensification within the

Abstract = {{Bird community characteristics of three sites with different levels of

   sampling and had no recent history of fire (HAR). Species richness, as
   assessed by species-time curves and rarefaction, was higher in both
   altered areas than in undisturbed forest (INT). In general, frugivores
   and omnivores were more abundant in both altered areas compared to
   intact forest. Canopy frugivores, understory omnivores and
   multiple-strata omnivores were most abundant in HAR. Canopy frugivores,
   near-ground insectivores, understory and multiple-strata omnivores were
   least abundant in INT, although INT had the highest abundances of canopy
   insectivores and near-ground omnivores. Richness and abundance of
   widespread species with low habitat specificity was higher in both areas
   that experienced disturbance compared to intact forest. Differences in

Abstract = {{In 1992, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry adopted a new forest
   management practice known as even-aged reproduction with reservation
   (EAR), which replaces clearcutting on state forestlands. The EAR
   guidelines mandate the retention of at least 12 trees/ha and 24-36
   m(2)/ha of basal area, representing a diversity of overstory and
   understory species. During summer 1998, we compared the temporal
   (breeding season vs. mid-sununer) and spatial (edge versus interior) use
   of EAR stands by birds. In addition, we compared observed vs. expected
   use of overstory trees in EAR stands. In each of ten representative EAR
   stands, we sampled birds twice per season along two-edge and
   two-interior transects. Total species richness and abundance (all
   species combined), species richness and abundance of ground-shrub
   foragers, and species richness of canopy-sallier foragers were
   significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the breeding season than in
   mid-suminer. Eight of 20 common bird species analyzed also were
   significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant during the breeding season (e.g.,
   black-and-white warbler and chestnut-sided warbler), and one species was
   significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant during mid-summer. Total species
   richness, total abundance, and abundance of ground-shrub foragers were
   significantly higher (P < 0.05) in interiors compared to edges of EAR
   stands. Five species also were significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant in
   interiors of EAR stands, whereas no species was more common in edges.
   All species combined and three foraging guilds showed differential use
   (P < 0.05) of overstory tree species; eight species also differed
   significantly in their use of abundant tree species. Based on our
   findings, we believe that EAR stands are excellent substitutes for
   clearcuts on state forestlands, although we caution that our findings
   were based only on one yr of data. We recommend the continued retention
   of a diversity of overstory, trees, especially snags and rough-barked
   trees, in both edges and interiors of EAR stands for use by a variety of
   bird species during both the breeding season and mid-summer.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{1. In the deserts of the south-western United States of America, as in
   many ecoregions around the world, invasion of non-native plants is
   modifying the structure and composition of riparian vegetation.
   2. Restoration of native plant species frequently proves to be
   ecologically and economically difficult. In the Muddy River drainage in
   the Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA), eradication of one the most aggressive
   invasive plants, Tamarix ramosissima (salt-cedar), often reduces the
   structural and compositional diversity of the remaining vegetation. This
   can have negative effects on native animals, including birds.
   3. The objectives of our work were (i) to examine relationships between
   avian diversity and measures of vegetational diversity (species
   richness, dominance of non-native plants and vegetation structure
   {[}total vegetation volume]), (ii) to explore the extent to which avian
   community composition was associated with vegetation composition
   (floristics) or vegetation structure (physiognomy), and (iii) to
   consider the potential effects of alternative land management and
   ecological restoration strategies on the biodiversity of birds and other
   native fauna in watersheds in the arid south-western USA.
   4. Species richness of all birds and of breeding birds was best modelled
   by total vegetation volume alone. Neither species richness of plants nor
   dominance of non-native plants had a statistically significant effect on
   species richness, abundance or evenness of birds.
   5. Species composition of birds between sites was more similar when
   floristics was more similar, and vice versa. Species composition of
   birds was not correlated with physiognomy.
   6. Species richness of native birds in the Muddy River drainage appears
   not to suffer from invasion of non-native plants, provided that the
   vegetational community retains sufficient structural diversity.
   7. The composition of the bird community is closely related to
   floristics, and other taxonomic groups may exhibit different responses
   to vegetation structure and composition. Therefore, explicit strategies
   for landscape-scale management, restoration and maximization of native
   faunal diversity should consider how removal of invasive plants may
   affect physiognomy and floristics of the vegetational community as a
   whole.}},

Abstract = {{The longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem of the southeastern United
   States is among the most heavily degraded of all ecosystems. Less than
   1\% of the original longleaf pine forests remain as old-growth stands.
   Eglin Air Force Base (Eglin) in northwest Florida contains the largest
   remaining extent of longleaf pine, but much of this habitat has been
   degraded through fire suppression, selective logging, and planting
   off-site species of pines. We examined the distribution of bird species
   among habitats during spring and fall 1994-1995 to assess the influence
   of large-scale habitat restoration on bird communities across the
   landscape. During both spring and fall, species richness and relative
   abundance of neotropical migrants were greatest in oak hammocks and
   riparian habitats. During spring, the abundance of resident species was
   greatest in barrier island scrub and flatwoods, but species richness of
   residents also was high in oak hammocks. During fall, both species
   richness and abundance of residents were greatest in oak hammocks and
   flatwoods. Analyses of abundance for individual species (both
   neotropical migrants and residents) suggested that each habitat examined
   was important for greater than or equal to1 species. An analysis
   examining the importance of habitats for conservation found that oak
   hammocks and riparian habitats were important for species of high
   management concern, but burned sandhills along with oak hammocks and
   riparian habitats were very important for species of the greatest
   management concern. Our results suggest that habitat modifications
   resulting from restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem will benefit
   many species of management concern. Bird species negatively affected by
   habitat modifications for longleaf pine restoration were abundant in

Abstract = {{The occurrence of large burnt areas has increased considerably in
   southern Europe in recent years. In order to design management plans to
   prevent large wildfires while preserving biodiversity, understanding of
   the ways in which birds respond to these fires is required. We
   investigated the spatial variability of both avifauna and habitat
   structure in three zones: unburnt, burnt in 1982, and burnt in 1994. The
   habitat structure of the unburnt zone was the most variable spatially.
   However, bird species composition between sampling points was very
   homogeneous in space. In contrast, the bird communities inhabiting burnt
   zones were more spatially heterogeneous. This pattern was caused by
   distinct specific responses to variations in habitat structure.
   Open-space species responded to small changes in habitat structure with
   large changes in local abundance, whereas the response of forest species
   to these structural variations was much less. We suggest that land
   managers should select specific zones with limited vegetation recovery
   within large burnt areas and maintain them as open space to keep
   combustibility low and provide an appropriate habitat for several open
   space species that are of conservation concern.}},

   possibly predation by introduced rats and should be classified as
   threatened. Population densities of the Endangered, endemic Red-and-blue
   Lory Eos histrio had remained stable since the last survey in 1997. They
   occurred at higher densities in primary forest, but were also common in
   human-made habitats. The estimated population was 8,230-21,400 birds,
   threatened by habitat loss and trapping for the wild bird trade.
   Although more commonly encountered in forest, the Near Threatened
   Blue-naped Parrot Tanygnathus lucionensis was found at higher densities
   in secondary habitats, and the population was estimated at 8,130-20,700
   birds. The Restricted-range Blue-tailed Imperial Pigeon D. concinna was
   very common on Karakelang (14,500-27,700 birds), whilst the Vulnerable
   Grey Imperial Pigeon D. pickeringii was recorded rarely; both species
   were more frequently recorded in primary forest. The endemic Talaud
   Kingfisher Halcyon enigma occurred at low densities (5,290-8,690 birds),
   in primary forest and adjacent disturbed areas. It is heavily dependent
   on primary forest and threatened by habitat loss, and should be
   classified as Vulnerable. Approximately 350 km(2) of primary forest on
   Karakelang is protected, 250 km(2) as a wildlife reserve. However, at
   present, management is absent and forest is threatened by agricultural
   encroachment, illegal logging, and fire. Given that all endemic and
   threatened species were encountered more frequently or occurred at
   higher densities in primary forests, future conservation efforts should
   target these protected areas. Management of reserves should involve
   local stakeholders from government and representatives of island
   communities. Wildlife trade is a major threat to Eos histrio and strict
   enforcement of the species' protected status should include monitoring
   of roost sites, patrols of harbours and markets in Talaud, Sulawesi and
   the Philippines, and the control of Philippine fishing boats involved in
   the wild bird trade. Further species-specific research and monitoring is
   also required.}},

Abstract = {{We examined response of breeding bird communities to timber harvest in
   riparian areas using two harvest techniques (full tree harvest and
   cut-to-length (CTL)) along first to third order streams in northern
   Minnesota, USA. Although many studies have quantified bird response to
   riparian buffer harvest, we are unaware of any study that examined the
   response of breeding birds to riparian forest harvest using different
   cutting practices. We compared community composition, total abundance
   and species richness, as well as abundance of six individual species on
   plots within four treatments (three plots/treatment) completed within 30
   in on both sides of the stream. Treatments in the riparian area (30 m on
   both sides of the stream) were: (1) riparian control (no harvest); (2)
   reduction of basal area to an average of 7-10 m(2)/ha with full tree
   harvest system; (3) reduction of basal area to an average of 7-10
   m(2)/ha with CTL harvest system; and (4) control (no harvest in riparian
   area or upland). For treatments 1, 2, and 3, adjacent upland forests on
   the plots were clearcut. Bird surveys were completed I year prior to,
   and 3 years after harvest and revealed a significant response of the
   bird community to timber harvest in the riparian area. Bird communities
   were most affected by tree removal with both harvest methods, but
   harvest type also affected bird communities. Early-successional species,
   e.g. song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), white-throated sparrow
   (Zonotrichia albicollis), mourning warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), and
   chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica) were associated with
   harvested plots, whereas forest species, e.g. scarlet tanager (Piranga
   olivacea) and black-throated green warbler (Dendroica virens) were
   associated with riparian control and control plots. Of six individual
   species tested for response to riparian harvest treatment over time,
   only the ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) showed a significant time by
   treatment interaction. Ovenbird numbers decreased in both the CTL and
   full tree harvest plots through 2000, when no individuals were observed.
   Two other forest-dependent species, black-throated green warbler and
   hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus), showed similar responses to treatment
   as the ovenbird. The winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) responded
   positively to the greater amount of slash that was left on-plot with the
   CTL harvest system. However, with the exception of the winter wren, we
   found that bird species and communities did not differ in their response
   to harvest system. ((C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The wide geographic distribution, variable climates and associated

   the biodiversity of Fescue Prairie. Fire can be reintroduced as a
   process to create temporal and spatial variation in composition,
   structure, and functioning in a mosaic. This variability can be achieved
   by reintroducing fire throughout the year, altering the frequency and
   the proportion of prairie remnants burned, and by using many types of
   fires. In most cases specific burning prescriptions are not needed to
   reintroduce fire as a process that is essential for maintaining
   structure, functioning and composition in Fescue Prairie remnants. A
   primary goal for conserving Fescue Prairie remnants should be to
   reintroduce fire as a process to create and maintain patterns and

Abstract = {{In 1985 new silvicultural prescriptions for managing jarrah ( Eucalyptus
   marginata) forest in south- west Western Australia came into operation.
   The most extreme logging treatment ( gap release) involved removal of
   most of the overstorey from patches no larger than 10 ha, followed by a
   regeneration fire. In the other logging treatment ( shelterwood), less
   wood was removed from a larger area, also followed by a fire. This study
   examined the impact of these disturbances on the avifauna by monitoring
   species richness and abundance of birds one year before logging, one
   year before burning, and for five years after burning. Although 68 bird
   species were recorded during the seven years of the study, 29 of these
   were detected fewer than 15 times. Of the other 39 bird species
   recorded, only two ( Gerygone fusca and Acanthiza apicalis) showed a
   statistically significant treatment effect over time on their abundance.
   The abundance of G. fusca initially declined in the disturbed treatments
   and by Year 7 of the study ( 5 years post-fire) in the gap-release
   treatment had not recovered its original abundance. A. apicalis
   increased its abundance in both shelterwood and gap-release treatments.
   By Year 7, both species in the logged treatments had abundances similar
   to those in the unlogged treatments. Total abundance of all species
   varied little across treatments. Species richness was highest by Year 7
   in the shelterwood and lowest in the gap-release treatment. In some
   years community structure varied more at the external-reference sites (
   not recently logged or burnt) than at the gap-release sites. In
   particular, there was little overlap in community structure in the
   external-reference treatment between the first and final years, whereas
   the pre-logging and final year in the gap-release treatment showed a
   high degree of overlap. These differences are suggestive of overriding
   short-term annual variation in broad-scale factors rather than local
   factors. Yearly variation in rainfall and temperature was documented;
   during low rainfall periods, populations of foliage arthropods may have
   been reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological relationships between wildlife conservation and farm
   management provide common ground for the enhancement of bird habitat and
   the natural suppression of pests on farmland. We compared bird
   populations in 15 paired organic and nonorganic sites ( cornfields plus
   edges, 30 sites total) that were similar in environment and edge habitat
   but that differed in use of fertilizers, herbicides, cultivation, and
   crop rotations. At each site, we used one strip transect to sample birds
   and vegetation in the bordering edge and cornfield perimeter (0-25 m
   from the edge) and another to sample in the cornfield (50-150 m from the
   edge). During the 1995 and 1996 growing seasons, we recorded 54 bird
   species, 51 in organic and 39 in nonorganic sites. On average, bird
   abundance on organic sites was 2.6 times higher than on nonorganic
   sites, and mean species richness per visit was 2.0 times greater. When
   analyzed separately, organic edge, perimeter, and field transects
   supported higher bird abundance and greater richness than did their
   nonorganic counterparts. Abundance and richness were higher on organic
   sites for insectivores, omnivores, and granivores, and for each of three
   migratory groups. Twelve species were individually more abundant on
   organic sites, and one regularly observed species was observed only on
   organic sites. No species had greater abundance on nonorganic sites.
   More non-crop vegetation on organic cornfields, most likely a result of
   no herbicide use, may have provided better foraging opportunities for
   birds. The plant food, cover, and invertebrate prey in organic
   cornfields appeared to augment birds not only in the field but also in
   the uncropped edges. Organic fields appear to benefit birds, but
   reproductive success needs further study. Modifying farm-management
   practices, especially near field edges where bird activity is
   concentrated, may enhance the conservation of birds and their potential
   predation on crop pests.}},

Abstract = {{Ecotones have been considered as unique environments, and the concepts
   of edge effect and ecotonal species have been widely used, especially in
   avian community ecology. We studied the patterns of bird densities
   across heath-wood edges at replicated sites in three locations in
   southeastern Australia. Multivariate analysis showed that the bird
   community in the ecotone was intermediate between the heath and wood
   communities, indicating that the ecotone contained a mixing of species
   rather than a unique bird community. ANOVA showed a modest increase in
   bird density at the wood side of the ecotone, which may be partly due to
   sampling biases rather than to some inherent habitat value in the
   ecotone. The outstanding pattern was that bird density and species
   richness in the wood habitat were twice as high as in the heath habitat.
   Of a total of 86 species, 31 occurred in sufficient numbers to
   categorize according to their habitat association (generalist, or heath
   or wood specialist) and their density at the ecotone (ecotone neutral,
   ecotone shy, or ecotone conspicuous). Three of these were
   habitat-generalist-ecotone-neutral. Fourteen species were ecotone
   neutral but were habitat specialists on either the wood (13 spp.) or the
   heath (1 sp.). Three species were ecotone shy. Although 11 species were
   ecotone conspicuous, they also occurred in either heath or wood or both.
   Thus, no species could be categorized as entirely ecotonal. We conclude
   that there is little evidence from this or other studies of avian
   communities to support an edge effect of increased density and species
   richness, and no evidence,of entirely ecotonal species.}},

Abstract = {{Undisturbed plant communities dominated by shrubs or trees are often
   left isolated within landscapes otherwise devoid of woody vegetation
   following large-scale disturbances such as wild-fires. We discuss
   potential ecological benefits associated with these terrestrial
   vegetation ``islands{''}, giving special attention to islands in
   disturbed shrub systems dominated by big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata
   Nutt.). Shrub habitat islands provide important refugia for plant and
   animal species that are associates of shrubs-from those that generally
   require shrub cover to those that have evolved obligate symbioses with a
   particular shrub species. Even if islands are not able to support
   breeding populations, they may provide essential temporary habitat for
   maintaining a plant or animal metapopulation or for dispersing animals.
   Habitat islands are likely to enhance local biological diversity of
   plants and animals, because they harbor species that are lacking in
   disturbed areas, and because abrupt structural changes from disturbed to
   undisturbed vegetation provide a habitat mosaic that facilitates high
   levels of species turnover. A previous study confirmed that small mammal
   species richness in sagebrush islands is intermediate to the high
   species richness in undisturbed sagebrush ``mainlands{''} and the low
   richness associated with burned sagebrush habitats. In re-analyzing some
   of the data from the latter study, we found that small mammal richness
   in sagebrush islands increases with time since the surrounding habitat
   burned. Finally, habitat islands provide more evenly dispersed seed
   sources for re-establishment of decimated vegetation within disturbed
   areas, and they may harbor animal species that provide seed dispersal
   services. Thus, they should accelerate vegetation recovery after
   disturbance. Managers, fire crews, and others who may influence how
   disturbance patterns affect habitat heterogeneity should be aware of
   these ecological benefits of habitat islands.}},

Abstract = {{I examined the lingering effects of past timber management practices on
   the vegetation structure and bird community of Kibale National Park,
   Uganda. I compared four forest treatments: unlogged native forest (UL),
   two that were selectively logged Lit low (LL) and high (HL) intensities
   in the 1960s, and a conifer plantation (PL). Forest-dependent birds were
   best represented at UL. LL was similar to UL in both vegetation
   structure and bird community cornposition, although some
   forest-dependent bird species were missing from the former. HL had
   significantly less canopy closure and lower tree density than other
   plots as a result of the combination of extensive secondary damage and
   natural disturbance patterns that prevented the reclosure of the forest
   canopy. Thirty-one percent of the forest-dependent bird species observed
   during the study were not detected Lit HL. At PL, bird species richness
   and bird abundance were about a third of those observed in other plots.
   There were significant correlations between heterogeneity of tree
   distribution (horizontal heterogeneity) and abundance and species
   richness of birds across plots. Abundance and species richness of all,
   forest-dependent, and forest generalist birds were highest in plots with
   intermediate measures of horizontal heterogeneity, which were mostly
   unlogged or lightly logged. If reduced-impact logging practices are not
   implemented during selective logging operations in tropical forests,
   consequent long-term changes in vegetation structure may result ill
   significant declines in the populations of some forest-dependent
   species, as was observed in Kibale National Park. (C) 2002 Fisevier

Abstract = {{We examined the impact of single-tree selective logging and fuel
   reduction bums on the abundance of hollow-nesting bird species at a
   regional scale in southeastern Queensland, Australia. Data were
   collected on species abundance and habitat structure of dry sclerophyll
   production forest at 36 sites with known logging and fire histories.
   Sixteen bird species were recorded with most being resident,
   territorial, obligate hollow nesters that used hollows that were either
   small (<10 cm diameter) or very large (>18 cm diameter). Species
   densities were typically low, but combinations of two forest management
   and three habitat structural variables influenced the abundances of
   eight bird species in different and sometimes conflicting ways. The
   results suggest that habitat tree management for biodiversity in
   production forests cannot depend upon habitat structural characteristics
   alone. Management histories appear to have independent influence (on
   some bird species) that are distinguishable from their impacts on
   habitat structure per se. Rather than managing to maximize species
   abundances to maintain biodiversity, we may be better off managing to
   avoid extinctions of populations by identifying thresholds of acceptable
   fluctuations in populations of not only hollow-nesting birds but other
   forest dependent wildlife relative to scientifically valid forest
   management and habitat structural surrogates.}},

Abstract = {{Structural complexity of managed forests is proving to be vitally
   important for the conservation of wildlife and ecological processes. We
   test for the factors most important in determining the availability of
   snags (dead standing trees) in fire-origin boreal forests of
   northwestern Ontario. The strongest correlate of snag basal area
   (m(2)/ha) was the amount of live tree basal area, which accounted for
   68\% of variation in the production of snags. The relationship between
   live and dead tree basal area followed a 3/4 power law with a slope of
   0.74 for the forest community and differing slopes for forest stands and
   forest age. A relationship between tree mortality and metabolic rate is
   consistent with rate of self-thinning theory. This invariance indicates
   that total community biomass is likely to be insensitive to species
   diversity. Mixed hardwood forest types produced the greatest basal area
   of snags, followed by poplar, mixed conifer, jack pine and spruce
   stands. The percentage of stems that were dead was greatest in young
   forests (18\% of stems in 0-60-year-old forests), decreased to a low
   percentage of 12\% in 61-80-year-old forests, and thereafter increased
   with age of forests from 15 to 16\% in 81-100, >100-year-old forests,
   respectively. In contrast, the number of small diameter (10-22 cm dbh)
   snags (stems/ha) was greatest in 61-100-year-old forests, whereas medium
   diameter (22-30 cm dbh) snags and large diameter (>30 cm dbh) snags were
   greatest in old-growth (>100 years) forests. The management implications
   are that increased live tree density due to environmental conditions, or
   possibly intensive forest management practices following clear cutting,
   may secondarily result in greater snag production and the structural
   complexity that favors wildlife biodiversity. Forest management
   guidelines that incorporate allometric relationships are needed to
   ensure maintenance of biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity following
   timber harvesting. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the midwestern United States, less than 1\% of the original tallgrass
   prairie ecosystem remains. State and federal agencies have responded to
   this habitat loss with programs and land acquisition that have increased
   the amount of grassland on the landscape by restoring grassland from
   other land-Use practices. We assessed the effects of habitat restoration
   and the relative contribution of local habitat and landscape factors on
   breeding grassland birds in northern Iowa. During the 1999 and 2000
   breeding seasons, we Surveyed grassland birds in 10 tallgrass prairies
   and 10 restored grasslands that contained a wide diversity of habitat
   and landscape conditions. Densities of common bird species were similar
   between habitat types, except for grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus
   savannarum) and savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), which
   were 4 and 9 times more dense in restored grasslands, respectively.
   Species richness of breeding birds was similar between habitat types.
   Habitat structure was different in prairies and restored grasslands;
   restored grasslands had 7\% less total vegetation cover and 3\% more
   bare ground. A nested, multiscale analysis indicated that habitat
   structure explained some variation in species richness and bird density
   of all common species, yet addition of landscape structure improved
   models for species richness and for density of 4 of 8 species
   considered, explaining an additional 10-29\% of the variation.
   Edge-density metrics were the most common variables entering into
   landscape models; most species had lower densities in landscapes with
   high edge density. Our results indicate that restored grassland habitats
   contain bird communities generally similar to those in native prairie
   habitats in northern Iowa, suggesting that restored grasslands may
   provide similar habitat suitability for most grassland birds. In
   addition, both local habitat and landscape factors can be important for
   managing breeding grassland birds.}},

Abstract = {{We compared northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) abundance and

   for the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) on the Ouachita
   National Forest, Arkansas, USA. To determine northern bobwhite
   (hereafter, bobwhite) population response in untreated control, thinned,
   and thinned and burned stands either 1, 2, or 3 growing seasons (Mar to
   mid-Oct) post-burn, we used whistling-male counts and covey-call counts
   as indices of population abundance. We estimated woody stem density,
   understory and overstory canopy cover, conifer and hardwood basal area,
   and the disc of vulnerability to characterize habitat response. Relative
   abundance of whistling males in the spring was greatest in thinned
   stands 3 growing seasons post-burn and in thinned but unburned stands.
   These stands had the smallest disc of vulnerability and the greatest
   understory shrub cover <2 in in height compared with other treatments. A
   threshold-like increase in bobwhite abundance was observed as a function
   of woody structure <2 in. Pine-grassland restoration provided suitable
   structure for bobwhites in spring, summer, and fall, but may not be
   adequate in winter. Further, data suggested that bobwhite density within
   a stand also was related to the amount of suitable habitat Surrounding
   the stand. Bobwhite management efforts in similar shortleaf pine forests
   should include thinning to reduce midstory and overstory cover and
   frequent fire to maintain open woodland conditions-i.e., low basal area

Abstract = {{Common reed is increasingly harvested from the Mediterranean region to
   provide thatching material to north European countries. The impact of
   these management practices on the fauna is poorly known. The aim of this
   study was to quantify the effect of reed cutting in the Mediterranean
   region through a comparative analysis of water regime, vegetation
   structure, arthropod distribution and passerine assemblage at cut and
   uncut reedbeds in southern France. Cut reedbeds were characterised by a
   lower salinity, higher water level in spring, and higher reed biomass
   than uncut reedbeds. Arthropod distribution differed consistently
   between cut and uncut sites, leading to a higher index of food available
   to passerines in cut reedbeds. Cut reedbeds had a similar bird species
   richness but a lower bird abundance, due to the significant decrease in
   Moustached Warblers and Bearded Tits at cut sites. The mild
   Mediterranean winter favoured early growth of reed in spring, making
   harvested reedbeds suitable for breeding of long-distance migrants such
   as the Great Reed Warbler and Reed Warbler. However, for the resident
   species that breed earlier in the season, cut reedbeds presumably lack
   sufficient vegetation cover to provide adequate nesting and feeding
   sites. Although biennial cutting (double wale) is considered as a good
   compromise between conservation and commercial interests in the UK, the
   juxtaposition of annually cut and never cut reed patches appears as the
   only sustainable alternative for the Mediterranean region. We further
   hypothesise that an optimal mosaic design of cut/uncut reed patches
   could provide as high a conservation value as unmanaged reedbeds.}},

   with snag density while yellow warblers and Swainson's thrushes were

   densities and species richness peaked in the 14-year-old burns and

Abstract = {{We studied the populations of breeding birds in five reference stands of
   natural mixedwood forest and I I conifer plantations up to 21-years old
   in southern New Brunswick, Canada. Variations of the distribution and
   abundance of birds were related to changes in the plant-species
   composition and structural attributes of their habitat. Bird species
   occurred in plantations in levels of abundance and diversity similar to
   that of reference forest, although community composition was highly
   dissimilar. Species of reference stands were typical of mature,
   mixedwood forest. Species of younger plantations were typical of open,
   early successional, upland habitats. Once the plantations became older
   than 13 years and the tree height exceeded about 5 in, birds typical of
   conifer forest began to invade the habitat, resulting in a mixed-species
   composition. Although cavity-containing snags were rare in the
   plantations, if they did occur in them or near their edge they were used
   by hole-nesting birds. Although we could not study a complete rotation,
   the field data and habitat trajectory suggest that the plantations will
   not support some elements of the avian biodiversity of the natural
   forest in the study area. The mature plantations will be highly
   depauperate in coarse-woody debris, snags, and cavities, and will not
   support species dependent on these critical habitat elements. In
   addition, birds requiring habitat containing trees of larger size and of
   various species, including hardwoods, will not find the mature
   plantations to be suitable. To accommodate the needs of species
   potentially at risk from the extensive development of plantations, the
   following changes in forestry management practices should be instituted:
   (1) retention of natural cavity-trees, snags, coarse-woody debris, and
   hardwood trees and shrubs in residual non-harvested ``islands{''} within
   clear-cuts and plantations; (b) retention of a patchy angiosperm
   component by leaving some areas untreated during herbicide applications;
   and (c) setting aside large areas of natural forest as non-harvested
   protected areas. Although we believe that these mitigations would help
   sustain elements of indigenous biodiversity that are at risk in an
   extensive industrial forest, we stress that these predictions would have
   to be tested through additional research and monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{We synthesized key findings from the Biological Dynamics of Forest
   Fragments Project, the world's largest and longest-running experimental
   study of habitat fragmentation. Although initially designed to assess
   the influence of fragment area on Amazonian biotas, the project has
   yielded insights that go far beyond the original scope of the study.
   Results suggest that edge effects play a key role in fragment dynamics,
   that the matrix has a major influence on fragment connectivity and
   functioning, and that many Amazonian species avoid even small
   (<100-m-wide) clearings. The effects of fragmentation are highly
   eclectic, altering species richness and abundances, species invasions,
   forest dynamics, the trophic structure of communities, and a variety of
   ecological and ecosystem processes. Moreover, forest fragmentation
   appears to interact synergistically with ecological changes such as
   hunting, fires, and logging, collectively posing an even greater threat
   to the rainforest biota.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the importance of standing (snags) and down coarse woody

   forests, we compared breeding (1997-1999) and nonbreeding (1997-1998,
   1998-1999) responses of birds among two coarse woody debris (CWD)
   removal and control treatments. In each of four blocks, we established
   four experimental units: (1) DCWD removed, (2) snags and DCWD removed,
   and (3) and (4) unmodified control plots. We quantified vegetation
   layers to determine their effects on the experimental outcome. Total
   breeding bird abundance, abundance of resident species, breeding bird
   diversity, breeding species richness, and abundance of Great Crested
   Flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus ) were reduced by the removal of DCWD
   and snags. Total woodpecker and Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus
   ) breeding territories were reduced by snag removal. Weak excavating and
   secondary cavity-nesting species, Neotropical migrants, and Eastern
   Towhees (Pipilio erythrophthalmus ) had fewer breeding territories on
   plots where DCWD was removed. Red-headed Woodpeckers ( Melanerpes
   erythrocephalus ) and midstory and canopy-nesting species were at lowest
   densities on plots where all CWD had been removed. The CWD removal had
   no effect on the nonbreeding bird community. Most breeding and
   nonbreeding species used habitats with sparse midstory and
   well-developed understory, whereas sparse canopy cover and dense
   midstory were important to some nonbreeding species. Snag and DCWD
   retention, and practices that maintain a dense understory and sparse
   midstory and canopy, will create favorable breeding habitat for many
   bird species of loblolly pine forests.}},

Abstract = {{Forest area is known to be correlated with bird-species diversity. Most

   area appeared to better predict bird-species presence than woodland
   width. The proposed Little Darby National Wildlife Refuge located within
   the study area includes restoration of riparian forest habitat along the

Abstract = {{We examined short-term trends in relative abundance and species richness
   of breeding and wintering grassland birds before (1996) and after (1997,
   1998) a prescribed burn in a mesquite-invaded, desert grassland at

   sampled vegetation along 1-km line transects bisecting 14 (7 control, 7
   burn) 25-ha Plots located randomly within a burn and adjacent, control
   unit. Following a spring burn that was moderate in intensity and patchy
   ill areal extent, we observed that ground Cover was affected more
   strongly by burning than mesquite (Prosopis) cover, smaller mesquite
   were affected more strongly by burning than larger mesquite, and
   mortality of mesquite was low. No change in total abundance of birds was
   detected oil the burn unit following fire for either wintering or
   breeding birds; however, species richness of breeding birds decreased in
   the first war post-burn. During the breeding season, mourning doves
   (Zenaida macroura) increased, whereas Botteri's sparrows (Aimophila
   botterii), Cassin's sparrows (Aimophila and cassinii), and
   (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus) decreased in relative abundance
   following fire. During the wintering season, ladder-backed woodpeckers
   (Picoides scalaris) and vesper sparrows (Pooeceles gramineus) increased
   and cactus wrens decreased in relative abundance following fire. Beyond
   species-level trends, we found stronger evidence of trends and greater
   magnitudes of relative change for breeding species associated with open
   grasslands compared to those associated with shrubs. The use of spring
   burns on the Refuge will likely improve conditions for open-grassland
   species that were historically more abundant by killing smaller mesquite
   and reducing mesquite recruitment. However, more intense and extensive
   fires will be required to reduce the presence of larger mesquite. Such
   fires would likely have a greater impact oil birds associated with

Abstract = {{In this study, we explored the habitat associations of the five most
   abundant passerine species nesting in the Ebro Delta reedbeds (NE
   Spain). Habitat characteristics (water depth, vegetation height and
   density, and plant-species composition) and abundance of all passerine
   species were measured at each of the 68 sampling points. The sampled
   area included most of the reedbeds in the Ebro Delta. Sampling points
   were classified according to the habitat parameters measured using
   cluster analysis. The resulting four habitat types differed in the
   composition and attributes of their passerine communities. The abundance
   of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and reed warbler
   (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) was greatest in tall, permanently inundated
   and almost monospecific Phragmites reedbeds. In contrast, the numbers of
   the reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and Savi's warbler (Locustella
   luscinioides) were greatest in areas of drier soils and a denser basal
   stratum. Finally, the fan-tailed warbler (Cisticola juncidis) showed no
   clear habitat association, In the Ebro Delta, reedbed management
   includes freshwater inputs and burning of standing reeds. These
   practices promote tall, permanently inundated reedbeds with minimal
   detrital accumulation. Bird species richness and diversity were greater
   in less intensely-managed habitats, but only diversity was significant
   (p < 0.001). We conclude that, since reedbeds are important habitats for
   several scarce bird species, and the abundance of these species seem to
   be influenced by vegetation structure, bird conservation considerations
   should be incorporated into future reedbed management practices.}},

Abstract = {{The longleaf pine (Pines palustris) ecosystem is one of the most
   endangered ecosystems in the United States. Recent incentives have led
   to increased interest in longleaf pine restoration. These restoration
   efforts often emphasize reestablishing native groundcovers, yet there
   have been no studies that address the role of native groundcover on
   breeding bird communities within longleaf pine forests. Therefore, we
   studied breeding bird communities in mature longleaf pine stands with
   either native or disturbed groundcovers to determine the likely effects
   of groundcover reestablishment associated with longleaf pine
   reforestation. Avian species richness and diversity did not differ
   (P=0.823, P=0.571, respectively), and avian community similarity was
   high (Morisita's index=0.98) between native and disturbed groundcover.
   However, pine warblers (Dendroica pinus), gray cat-birds (Dumetella
   carolinensis), eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens), brown-headed
   cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis)
   were more abundant (Pless than or equal to0.10) in areas with native
   groundcover, whereas indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) were more
   abundant (P=0.058) in areas with disturbed groundcover. Although
   groundcover restoration may benefit some avian populations, overall
   avian species richness, diversity, and community composition may be
   unaffected. Restoration of native groundcover may be best justified for
   aesthetic values and as a tool to facilitate long-term stand management
   using prescribed fire.}},

Abstract = {{Because many forest stands are increasingly dominated by maple (Acer
   spp.) in eastern North America, there will likely be a relative scarcity
   of mature oak (Quercus spp.) forests within the next several decades. In
   an effort to understand how avian communities may be affected by a
   regional change in forest composition from oak to maple dominance, we
   compared bird communities in both Oak- and maple-dominated forest stands
   in three seasons (winter, spring, and fall). In 1998 and 1999, birds
   were surveyed and habitat characteristics were measured in six mature
   forest woodlots in central Pennsylvania. Total abundance of birds was
   greater within Oak- than maple-dominated stands in all seasons, whereas
   species richness was greater in oak stands only in the spring. Resident
   species, long-distance migrants, woodpeckers, bark-gleaners, and 11
   individual species were more abundant within oak than maple stands in at
   least one season. Differences in avian community structure between oak
   and maple stands were greatest in the fall when oaks produced hard mast
   and in the spring when insectivorous birds gleaned arthropods from tree
   substrates. This pattern was consistent with our expectations based on
   mast characteristics and tree physiognomy of maples and oaks as well as
   the diet and foraging behavior of birds. Our results suggest that a
   regional change from Oak- to maple-dominated forests may strongly affect
   avian community structure and populations of some common bird species
   associated with eastern deciduous forests.}},

Abstract = {{The Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota are characterized by a
   complex history of both natural and human disturbance regimes.
   Historically, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities were
   characterized by frequent, cool ground fires. Intensive fire suppression
   and timber harvest throughout the past century have drastically altered
   the structure of existing forests. Today, much of the area has been
   harvested using shelterwood logging resulting in open even-aged stands.
   The goal of this study was to compare bird communities in treated (areas
   that have recently been harvested) and untreated (areas receiving
   minimal silvicultural treatment) in the past 40 yr. Of the 20 commonly
   observed bird species, 3 species {[}red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta
   Canadensis), brown creeper (Certhia Americana), and ovenbird (Seiurus
   aurocapillus)] were conspicuously less abundant in treated than in
   untreated stands. Eleven other species were more abundant in treated
   stands, while six species showed no response to treatment. Although bird
   species diversity and the abundance of birds were highest in treated
   stands, this does not imply that logging is beneficial to the entire
   bird community. The abundance of particular bird species may appear to
   have increased, but the composition of the bird community has been
   altered. As more of the forested areas are harvested, the bird community
   will shift from one with birds typical of both open pine and dense pine

Abstract = {{Many farmland bird populations have exhibited marked declines in the
   last 20-30 years and there is growing evidence to link these declines to
   agricultural intensification. Field margin management is frequently
   proposed as a way of enhancing bird populations but there have been few
   attempts to assess the relative value of different management options.
   This paper aims to provide a preliminary assessment of the relative
   value of six different cereal field margin management practices in
   providing foraging habitats for farmland birds. It also briefly compares
   these with the benefits afforded by field and whole farm approaches such
   as set-aside and organic farming, to wildlife conservation on arable
   land. The field margins considered are: grass margins (separated into
   grass-only strips and grass/wildflower strips), naturally regenerated
   set-aside margins, uncropped wildlife strips, game cover crops and
   conservation headlands. Sympathetically managed field margins can
   provide a range of plant and invertebrate food resources for birds both
   in summer and winter. In general, the best winter food supplies (mainly
   seeds) will be provided by game cover crops and naturally regenerated
   rotational set-aside strips. The most abundant summer food supplies
   (invertebrates and seeds) will be provided by a diverse sward;
   grass/wildflower strips, uncropped wildlife strips and naturally
   regenerated rotational set-aside strips followed by conservation
   headlands. Field margin swards that are less diverse in terms of species
   composition and structural heterogeneity and that consequently support
   fewer invertebrates, can, nonetheless, provide higher quality foraging
   habitats for birds than an intensively managed crop up to the hedge
   base. A number of bird species such as yellowhammer (Emberiza
   citrinella) and tree sparrow (Passer montanus), prefer to forage in
   margins in winter and summer and many of the benefits of whole field
   approaches such as set-aside, overwinter stubbles and undersown cereals.
   could be gained from margins under the same management, Whole-field
   approaches are, however, required for boundary-avoiding species such as
   skylark (Alauda arvensis) and lapwing (Vanellus vanellus). Less is known
   about the use other birds make of margins, relative to their use of
   field centres in winter. Whole farm approaches such as organic farming,
   whilst being highly beneficial to birds, are likely to remain rather
   localised in the UK, whereas field margin management can be relatively
   easily incorporated into the farmed landscape on an extensive scale. (C)

Abstract = {{Plantations of single tree species which are usually set up to
   reafforest cleared lands in the tropics, have often been criticized for
   being associated with a low level of diversity in the ecosystems.
   However, our study of understorey plant species in various plantations
   of single exotic or indigenous species has shown that more plant species
   grew within stands near a natural forest than within grasslands in
   Sakaerat, northeastern Thailand. These forests contribute to the
   acceleration of the secondary succession from grassland, which before
   reafforestation was achieved by recurrent fires. In the natural
   regeneration of understorey tree species in planted forests, large tree
   species in the natural forest seem to be the major common seed source
   among the stands studied. The small leaf biomass in these planted
   forests generated enough shade to prevent the invasion of 2 fire-adapted
   competitive grasses and to provide a suitable light environment for
   seedling establishment at an early stage of forest development. These
   factors facilitated the establishment of other species within the
   plantations of single tree species. Faster-growing exotic species
   accumulated larger amounts of understorey biomass than indigenous
   species. The most suitable species was Acacia mangium. The association
   of forests planted with single tree species with a high species richness
   in the ecosystems may enable to achieve a high biological diversity at
   the landscape level, which could bring various benefits to the forests
   of Sakaerat.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{217-225}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Predation is not only an important ecological process in the
   population dynamics of red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, but also has
   conservation implications for their predators such as hen harrier Circus
   cyaneus and peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus. It has been suggested
   that habitat management might reduce the susceptibility of grouse to
   predation and thus reduce conflicts between grouse management and raptor
   conservation.
   2. We investigated whether habitat characteristics influenced predation
   on red grouse on a managed moor near Langholm in southern Scotland
   during 1992-96. We combined demographic studies of the grouse population
   with radio-telemetry of individual grouse to assess the influence of
   habitat on mortality rates. Systematic observations of hen harriers were
   also used to assess the effect of habitat characteristics on their
   encounter rates and strike success with grouse and other prey.
   3. There was no evidence that habitat characteristics directly
   influenced grouse mortality rates at the scale of the grouse population.
   However, grouse densities were higher and overwinter losses of grouse
   were lower on areas with greater cover of heather Calluna vulgaris. The
   most likely explanation for the observed pattern of winter loss was that
   grouse dispersed into areas with more heather, to some extent locally
   compensating for losses to predators.
   4. Individual radio-tagged grouse that survived the winter had more
   blaeberry Vaccinium myrtillus in their home ranges than grouse that were
   killed in winter by predators. There was, however, no effect of heather
   cover, vegetation height or vegetation density on the likelihood of
   individual grouse survival.
   5. Hen harriers were more likely to encounter grouse broods in a mixture
   of heather and grass than expected from the observed distributions of
   grouse broods on moorland. However, having encountered a grouse brood,
   there was no effect of habitat type or vegetation height on the strike
   success of the harriers.
   6. We conclude that the direct effects of habitat on the susceptibility
   of red grouse to predation are limited under current predator control
   regimes on managed moorland. Habitat management aimed at mitigating
   conflicts between raptor conservation and grouse management should focus
   on reducing the availability of passerine and small mammal prey for hen
   harriers and thus reducing harrier abundance on grouse moors. Further
   research is required, however, to assess the consequences of such
   management for biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Fire, a frequent phenomenon in Mediterranean landscapes, is a major
   ecological disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems. We hypothesized that
   bird communities undergo greater seasonal changes in burnt areas than in
   unburnt ones. Using the point-count method we assessed bird species
   composition and abundance in three zones (unburnt, burnt in 1982, and
   burnt in 1994) during the breeding and wintering seasons of 1997 and
   1998.
   From the breeding to the wintering seasons, burnt zones showed an
   increase in forest species, whereas the bird community of the unburnt
   zone remained stable in the gradient open-forest species. Moreover, the
   seasonal turnover of communities was higher in burnt zones than in the
   unburnt ones, although this did not imply that the former varied in
   richness through the year. The pattern of bird abundance in the unburnt
   zone was similar during the two study years, in contrast with that of
   burnt zones, suggesting higher annual cyclicity in resource availability
   in unburnt areas. These findings suggest that fire increases the
   seasonal variability of bird communities.}},

Abstract = {{To improve our understanding of how management affects the composition
   and structure of northern hardwood forests, we compared managed with
   unmanaged sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) dominated forests.
   Unmanaged old-growth and unmanaged second-growth forests provided
   baselines for comparing the effects of even-aged and uneven-aged forest
   management on selected aspects of biological diversity. Three
   replications of each condition were located on the Winegar Moraine in
   Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Old-growth forests were multistoried,
   dominated by a few, large trees with well-developed crowns extending
   over a subcanopy stratum 10-15 m in height and an abundance of woody
   vegetation (mostly sugar maple seedlings) at 2-3 m. This complex stand
   structure contrasts with the relatively uniform structure of unmanaged
   second-growth forests with a closed overstory canopy and limited
   understory development. Forest management, both even- and uneven-aged,
   created forest structures that were more complex than their unmanaged
   second-growth baselines, yet managed forests lacked some of the
   structural complexity characteristic of old-growth. Managed forests had
   fewer large trees (stem diameter at 1.37 m > 50 cm) and considerably
   less basal area in dead trees when compared with old-growth. There were
   fewer tree species in managed forests because commercially important
   tree species were favored for retention and, when present, early
   successional species (e.g., Populus grandidentata Michx., Populus
   tremuloides Michx.) were harvested. A subcanopy comprised of large
   shrubs and small trees characteristic of old growth was absent in
   managed forests, but this structural element may develop with time under
   management. As expected, thinning the overstory and disturbing the
   forest floor through tree harvesting promoted understory development in
   managed forests, Most of the added species, however, were common in the
   landscape and thus added little to overall species richness.}},

Abstract = {{Reversing decades of fire exclusion by hardwood midstory reduction is
   now used to recover populations of the federally endangered Red-cockaded
   Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest
   ecosystems. The effects of Red-cockaded Woodpecker management on winter
   birds in longleaf pine sandhill forests are largely unknown. Examining
   habitat use of winter migrants, some of which are declining, may
   influence the selection of habitat management techniques used for
   Red-cockaded Woodpeckers to benefit overwintering migrants. During the
   winters (December-February) of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999, we tested
   experimentally the effects of hardwood reduction treatments applied in
   1995 on winter birds at Eglin Air Force Base in fire-excluded northwest
   Florida longleaf pine sandhills. Treatments were (1) prescribed spring
   burning, (2) herbicide application, (3) mechanical felling and girdling,
   and (4) a control where decades of fire exclusion was maintained. We
   also sampled winter bird flocks in frequently burned, nonexperimental
   reference plots to measure management success. Hardwood reduction
   techniques had no effect on flock species richness, which averaged 7.9
   and 7.2, respectively, during 1997-1993 and 1998-1999. Larger flocks in
   felling and girdling and in herbicide plots were primarily due to
   significantly higher numbers of overwintering Chipping Sparrows
   (Spizella passerina), as well as resident Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and
   an influx of temperate migrant Pine Warblers (Dendroica pinus). In
   contrast, flocks in control plots were smaller (flock size and species
   composition in spring burn plots were intermediate) and composed of
   hardwood-associated species, such as Tufted Titmouse (Bacolophus
   bicolor) and Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). The relative
   uses of longleaf pines and hardwoods by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, Pine
   Warblers, and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) during both
   winters best explained that winter birds present in herbicide, felling
   and girdling, and reference plots were more likely to forage on the same
   tree species and substrates than birds in spring-burned plots, and least
   likely to forage on the same species and substrates as birds in the
   control plots. Those differences corresponded to the following
   increasing order of hardwood stem mortality among treatments: control,
   spring burn (41\%), felling and girdling (62\%), and herbicide (92\%).
   Repeated burning is recommended to restore the reference foraging
   condition because it was eight times less expensive than other
   techniques, which favored mostly Chipping Sparrows.}},

Pages = {{1-25}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The farming landscape of eastern Canada is dotted with three main types
   of hedgerows: (1) natural woody, (2) planted woody and (3) herbaceous.
   The objective of this study was to compare the value of these habitats
   as a repository of plant biodiversity in agricultural areas of southern
   Quebec. The overall plant diversity was higher in natural hedgerows and
   they contained more plant species of conservation values than other
   hedgerow types. Plant species richness per quadrat was, however, higher
   in planted woody hedgerows, and together with the species composition,
   lead to the conclusion that planted hedgerows in their entirety
   consisted of an ecotone type of vegetation such as is found in field
   edges which usually support high plant diversity and productivity but
   where transient plant species predominate. Consequently, this study
   indicated that natural hedgerows fare better than planted hedgerows in
   terms of diversity of plants of conservation interest. In spite of that,
   planted woody hedgerows contained plant (and bird) species of some
   interest and should be favoured over more desolate herbaceous hedgerows.
   In areas where hedgerows were removed and are not re-establishing
   naturally, a mixture of deciduous trees and conifers should be
   encouraged in further windbreak planting programs so as to conciliate
   both the conservation and agronomic objectives. Furthermore, management
   practices should optimise the growth of establishing plants of
   conservation values.}},

   indicated breeding pairs per 100 km(2), 68\% being of the four most
   common species {[}Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Ring-necked Duck (Aythya
   collaris), American Black Duck (Anas rubripes), and Common Goldeneye
   (Bucephala clangula)]; 13 other species were encountered. The average
   total of breeding waterfowl for the region was estimated at 59330 pairs.
   Distributions of the species were related to ecodistrict and to
   surficial geology. The more northerly of the two main ecodistricts had
   higher densities of American Black Ducks, Ring-necked Ducks, Common
   Goldeneyes, and Canada Geese (Branta canadensis). Mallard and Hooded
   Merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus) distributions correlated with presence
   of surficial clay and moraines, respectively. Less common species
   including Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca) and American Wigeon (Anas
   americana) appeared to be concentrated in smaller-scaled habitat
   features (beaver pond sequences and estuarine marshes, respectively).
   Results generally agreed with those of earlier Clay Belt surveys. Total
   breeding density of waterfowl is slightly higher than that of
   surrounding regions.}},

Pages = {{470-481}},
Abstract = {{Coastal birch forests in northern Norway have over the last 50 years
   gradually been replaced with non-native spruce plantations. To
   investigate possible changes in bird communities, we compared species
   richness and composition in six forest types (mature spruce plantations,
   ecotones, mixed forests, and three birch forest types) in two regions
   over two years. In the southern region, birch forests tended to host a
   higher number of species than spruce plantations, but species
   composition differed between forest types. The species composition in
   rich birch forests was particularly distinguished from spruce
   plantations, but also from the less productive birch habitats.
   Furthermore, there were dissimilarities in species richness and
   composition between regions. Ground nesters and species nesting on their
   northern margins occur-red most frequently in the southern region,
   whereas cavity-nesters were most abundant in the northern region. Some
   species declined in abundance from 1998 to 1999, whereas three species
   shifted their main distribution from birch forests to mixed
   forests/ecotones. Possible factors underlying these results are
   discussed. We recommend that researchers and managers pay attention to
   habitat qualities within forest types (i.e., other than tree species
   composition in overstory) as well as to regional variations in species
   assemblages when addressing outcomes of management practices.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires play a key role in shaping the boreal forest landscape, yet
   the response of wildlife to the patchy mosaics they create is poorly
   understood. We studied songbirds 5-6 years post-fire in a large burn
   (9600 ha) in the boreal mixedwood forest of north-eastern Alberta. In
   the spring of 1995 and 1996 we estimated abundance of songbirds in four
   areas, each with four replicate sites: unburned patches within the fire
   (Isolates); burned patches (Burns); patches that had been clear-cut
   prior to burning by wildfire (Cut-Burns); and the unburned, continuous
   forest adjacent to the burn (Peripherals). We also sampled shrub-based
   arthropods with sweep-nets at each site. To investigate the role of
   Isolates, we compared them to Peripherals and to Burns. We compared
   Cut-Burns to Burns to examine the effect of logging prior to burning. In
   general, Isolates supported higher numbers of species and individuals
   than Peripherals, mainly due to higher numbers of aerial-foraging birds.
   Isolates and Burns had similar species richness and abundance, but Burns
   supported more aerial foragers while Isolates had more foliage gleaners.
   Cut-Burns generally supported fewer individuals than Burns, in
   particular fewer shrub-nesters, aerial foragers, and neotropical
   migrants. More bird species reached their highest densities in Burns
   than in any other area. Songbird species richness and abundance were
   positively related to dry arthropod biomass, with Burns and Isolates
   having the highest arthropod biomass. These patterns indicated that, 5-6
   years post-burn, the patchy mosaic created by this wildfire supported
   more species than the mature forest surrounding the fire. Clear-cut
   logging prior to burning resulted in a diminished songbird community
   compared to that found in burned stands.}},

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-33}},
Abstract = {{The river valley of the French upper Meuse and its floodplain,
   constitutes a relatively natural ecosystem which still contains many
   endangered species of high conservation value. For example, several
   birds (Crex crex, Numenius arquata) as well as plant species (Gratiola
   officinalis, Inula britannica, Teucrium scordium, Ranunculus lingua and
   Mentha pulegium) which have declined seriously in France in recent times
   are found in the upper Meuse floodplain. Phytosociological studies and
   water level measurements have shown that the floristic diversity is
   mainly influenced by hydrological fluctuations and agricultural
   practices. The plant communities are structured along a topographical
   gradient in the high water bed reflecting the duration of floods and the
   ground water table depth. Agricultural practices have influenced the
   vegetation changes by selecting species adapted to particular management
   practices (e.g., fertiliser use, grazing, cutting regime). The data
   collected in this study from the upper Meuse as enabled 13 grassland and
   wetland ecotopes to be defined which are correlated with different
   environmental factors. Fertiliser use, grazing and reduction in the
   frequency of the cutting lead to a lower species richness because they
   encourage competitive species. However, it is also demonstrated, that
   maximum biodiversity is not always synonymous with high conservation
   value because some impoverished ecosystems, e.g., sedges and tall forb
   formations, may contain endangered plant and bird species. Knowledge of
   the boundaries between the different plant communities enables likely
   changes in floristic composition after modification of one or more site
   factors to be forecasted. Such factors include, water table depth and
   flood frequency, cutting regime, fertiliser use and grazing pressure.
   Thus, the definition of these ecotopes, corresponding to correlations
   between water regime, agricultural practice and vegetation composition,
   could lead to the establishment of guidelines for water and agricultural
   managements that could be involved in restoration projects.}},

Title = {{Influence of variable retention harvests on forest ecosystems. I.
   Diversity of stand structure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1221-1233}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Variable retention harvests or `green-tree retention systems' are
   important to the management of coniferous forests in the temperate zone.
   Green-tree retention leaves large live trees after harvest (i.e.
   residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating
   stand and provide mature forest habitat that develops sooner than in
   typical even-aged management by clear-cutting. The seed-tree system is
   one method of harvesting that leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing
   singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally.
   Green-tree retention may increase biological diversity and help to
   enhance functional links among forest structures or ecological
   processes.
   2. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the abundance
   (e.g. basal area and density of residual trees and amount of vegetation)
   and diversity (e.g. species diversity and structural diversity of the
   herb, shrub and tree layers) of various aspects of stand structure will
   decline with lower levels of tree retention. In particular, abundance
   and diversity should be greater in sites with green-tree retention than
   in clear-cut sites.
   3. Stand structure attributes were measured from 1996 (immediately after
   harvesting) to 1999 in replicated clear-cut, single seed-tree, group
   seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed forests of Douglas
   fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern
   British Columbia, Canada.
   4. In terms of abundance, clear-cut, single seed-tree and group
   seed-tree sites had similar mean basal areas of residual trees, ranging
   from 0.1 to 2.5 m(2) ha(-1), with significantly higher levels on
   patch-cut (23.4 m(2) ha(-1)) and uncut forest (39.0 m(2) ha(-1)) sites.
   Mean densities of residual trees also followed this pattern, ranging
   from 0.7 to 16.3 stems ha(-1) on the clear-cut to group seed-tree sites,
   to 769.4 and 2050.0 stems ha(-1) on the patch-cut and uncut forest
   sites, respectively. However, mean volume (m(3) ha(-1)) of fallen wood
   (i.e. dead wood or woody debris) was similar among sites, ranging from
   116.7 in the single seed-tree to 210.2 in the patch-cut sites. Contrary
   to our hypothesis, the mean index of total crown volume of herbs,
   shrubs, mosses and lichens was similar among sites.
   5. Mean species richness of herbs, shrubs and total plants was similar
   among sites. Mean richness of trees in seed-tree sites was similar to
   that in uncut forest in three of four post-harvest years. The mean
   species diversity of herbs was similar among sites, but that of shrubs
   and trees was generally lowest in the patch-cut sites and similar among
   the other sites.
   6. The mean structural richness and diversity of herbs was lowest in the
   uncut forest and similar at the other sites 3 and 4 years post-harvest.
   The mean structural richness of trees and total plants in the patch-cut
   and uncut forest sites had more vegetation layers than the other sites.
   7. Our hypothesis was partly supported in terms of basal area and
   density of residual trees and structural richness of total vegetation
   layers across a gradient of tree retention from uncut forest to
   clear-cut sites. However, this pattern was not supported for abundance
   or diversity of understorey vegetation. Thus, the structural attributes
   of residual trees and layers of vegetation, but not the abundance,
   species richness or species diversity of understorey vegetation, lend
   support to the aims of variable retention harvesting, at least up to 4
   years post-harvest.}},

Abstract = {{The Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) is of conservation concern

   management of the warbler's lowland heath habitat. This study analysed
   the warbler's habitat requirements in Dorset, its UK population centre.
   Maps of breeding territories from 1974, 1984 and 1994 were linked to
   maps of heathland vegetation and adjacent land use from 1978, 1987 and
   1996. Logistic regression showed territories were positively associated
   with the area of dry/humid heath, mature Ulex europaeus, bare soil, and
   more rarely with wet heath, young U. europaeus, U. gallii and Pinus
   scrub. There were negative responses to fragmentation (isolation and
   area of a heath), and the proximity of woodland, urban areas and
   intensive agriculture, Sub-optimal habitat was used in years of high
   population size. Habitat management for this species should consider not
   only heathland vegetation but also landscape factors such as
   fragmentation and the proximity of avoided land use types. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Population declines of farmland birds over recent decades in Europe,
   Canada and the USA have been attributed to more intensive agricultural
   management. We counted birds during the 1990 breeding season on 72 field
   sites in southern Ontario, Canada, paired between 10 organic and 10
   conventional farms for local habitat to enhance our ability to detect
   effects of agricultural practices. Of 68 species recorded, 58 were on
   organic sites, 59 on conventional. Species richness and total abundance
   were significantly greater on organic than conventional sites based on
   log-linear regression. Of 43 species analyzed with log-linear
   regression, eight (18.6\%) were significantly (P <0.05) more abundant on
   organic than conventional sites and four (9.3\%) approached significance
   (0.05 <P <0.10). Eight of these 12 species had negative population
   trends for 1967-1998 Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS) in this region. Two of
   the 43 species analyzed (4.7\%) were significantly more abundant on
   conventional than organic sites and three (7.0\%) approached
   significance. Two of these five species had negative BBS population
   trends. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of 13 practices and 13
   habitat variables explained 44\% of total variation (TV) accounted for
   in a detrended correspondence analysis of bird species composition and
   abundance. Practices contributed 23.7\% of TV, habitat 26\%; habitat and
   practices shared 5.7\% with each other and 12\% with farm ownership
   (i.e. clustering of field sites within farms). CCA ordinations indicated
   considerable mixing of organic and conventional sites across a gradient
   from sites with many birds species associated with greater habitat
   heterogeneity and more pasture, winter grain, farmstead and other
   non-crop habitats (hedgerow, woodland) to sites with few bird species
   associated with larger fields, more rowcrop and spring grain, more
   passes and tilling, and use of herbicides and chemical fertilizers. Our
   results re-emphasize the importance of non-crop habitats, more permanent
   crop cover, and less intensive management practices to the conservation
   of avian biodiversity on farmland. Canadian Crown Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Fire is being experimentally reintroduced to the forests of southern
   Ohio to determine its effectiveness in restoring and maintaining
   mixed-oak (Quercus spp.) forest communities. We studied the effects of
   repeated burning (1-4 years of annual burning) and recovery (1 year
   after burning) on the breeding bird community. Burning resulted in
   incremental but temporary reductions in the availability of leaf litter,
   shrubs, and saplings, but it did not affect trees, snags, or understory
   vegetation cover. Of 30 bird species monitored, 4 were affected
   negatively and 2 were affected positively by burning. Population
   densities of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warblers
   (Helmitheros vermivorus), and Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina)
   declined incrementally in response to repeated burning and did not
   recover within 1 year after burning, suggesting a lag time in response
   to the changes in habitat conditions. Densities of Northern Cardinals
   (Cardinalis cardinalis) fluctuated among years in the control units, but
   remained low in the burned units. Densities of American Robins (Turdus
   migratorius) and Eastern Wood-Pewees (Contopus virens) increased in
   response to burning, but these increases were apparent only after
   several years of repeated burning. In general, burning resulted in
   short-term reductions in the suitability of habitat for ground- and
   low-shrub-nesting birds, but it improved habitat for ground- and
   aerial-foraging birds. Overall, there were no changes in the composition
   of the breeding-bird community. Total breeding bird population levels

Abstract = {{Rotational grazing has been proposed as a Best Management Practice (BMP)
   for minimizing runoff in Wisconsin agricultural riparian areas. The
   influence of this land management practice on grassland birds has not
   been evaluated in relation to more traditional agricultural land
   management systems in Midwestern riparian areas. This study compared the
   grassland bird community in riparian areas in Wisconsin that were
   rotationally grazed to common land use practices along streams in
   Wisconsin: continuously grazed pastures and rowcrop fields with
   10-m-wide ungrazed buffer strips located along the stream. We calculated
   total number of birds, the Berger-Parker Index of Dominance, and number
   of birds ha(-1) for each site. Vegetation variables used were
   height-density, litter depth, and percent bare ground. Bird species
   richness, species dominance, and density did not differ among land use
   types. In contrast, grassland bird species of management concern
   {[}Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis Gmelin), Eastern
   Meadowlark (Sturnella magna L.), and Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus
   L.)] were found on continuous and rotational pastures but very rarely or
   never occurred on buffer strips. Contrary to previous research, however,
   rotationally grazed pastures did not support more of these species than
   continuously grazed pastures. Bird density was related to vegetation
   structure, with higher densities found on sites with deeper litter.
   Within the pasture land use types, there were no consistent differences
   between species richness and density near the stream (< 10 m) and away
   (> 10 m).}},

   Sickle-billed Vangas, Falculea palliata, a Malagasy endemic, were

   were tall eucalypt trees (20-30 m) situated outside the forests, and the
   some trees were used repeatedly. Roosting flock size decreased during
   the breeding season, from October to December, due to the departure of
   breeding individuals. Mean sizes of daily home range and of foraging

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{To restore habitat is to restore the functional aspects of a place where
   one or more species are intended to live. However, habitat restored with
   the right structural elements can still fail to support the species due
   to insufficient space and spatial contiguity (e.g., movement corridors)
   with nearby habitat. The spatial extent of habitat determines its
   capacity to support various demographic units, such as a breeding pair
   of individuals, a true population, or a metapopulation. In scatter-plots
   of published density estimates and their corresponding study area sizes,
   I found consistent patterns that appeared to represent spatial scale
   domains, in which subpopulations, populations, and multiple populations
   exist for each species. These spatial scale domains can help guide
   habitat restoration by indicating the minimum area needed to support a
   population. The effectiveness of restored habitat, considered alone or
   in combination with existing habitat, should be judged by the habitat's
   capacity to sustain a functioning population, which includes the
   population's membership in a metapopulation. Additionally, the evidence
   increasingly demonstrates that habitat must include sufficient space for
   the population(s) to periodically relocate as resources are depleted
   locally. The spatial extent of proposed habitat restoration can now be
   linked to the likely demographic unit of the species that can be
   supported there. I provide two examples of proposed habitat conservation
   and their likely effectiveness based on their spatial areas.}},

Abstract = {{The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) is well
   adapted to fire-maintained pine ecosystems of the southeastern United
   States. Management practices vary greatly among land ownerships. In some
   wilderness areas and state parks, a ``no management{''} policy has
   eliminated use of prescribed fire, artificial cavities, and woodpecker
   translocation, tools that have proved effective elsewhere in recovering
   woodpecker populations. We compared forests with essentially ``no
   management'' to actively managed forests of similar tree ages and
   similar red-cockaded woodpecker population demographics. We also
   compared sites that had received no management in the past to the same
   sites after management. In every case, populations in forests that did
   riot use state-of-the-art management for woodpeckers declined severely
   compared to those in managed forests. Because managed forests typically
   used all available management techniques concurrently, it was not
   possible to separate and rank effectiveness of specific management
   activities. One exception was the Wade Tract in Georgia, where
   prescribed fire was the primary activity for herbaceous layer and
   hardwood management in a high-density, stable woodpecker population.
   Wilderness areas, which are intended to be pristine places that preserve
   biodiversity, are losing red-cockaded woodpeckers, a keystone species in
   the ecosystem, at an alarming rate. Collectively, 9 groups of
   red-cockaded woodpeckers were present in 4 wilderness areas in Texas
   national forests in 1983. At the close of the millennium, only one
   woodpecker group remained and its continued existence is unlikely
   without management. The very fragmented features of present-day
   landscapes and intervention by humans impair the effectiveness of
   natural disturbance processes, primarily growing-season fire, that
   historically produced and maintained open pine savannas with grass-forb
   herbaceous layers in the pre-Columbian forests of the southeastern U.S.
   therefore, active management must be used if the red-cockaded woodpecker
   is to persist.}},

Abstract = {{Bird communities are declining in south-eastern Australia and riparian
   woodlands are critical habitats for birds in this agricultural region.
   We investigated how terrestrial bird communities varied with, different
   land management practices (levels of grazing by domestic livestock and
   extent of clearing) and with habitat quality on the floodplains of the
   Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers. Bird community composition in ungrazed
   and lightly grazed sites was significantly different to that in more
   heavily grazed sites, and these differences were related to tree and
   shrub cover, as well as tree species diversity and abundance of standing
   dead trees. Crazing appeared to have an effect on bird communities
   separate from that caused by clearing. Indicator species were identified
   for the effects of grazing and clearing. Grazing by livestock has had
   negative impacts on riparian birds through degradation of habitat
   quality. A combination of lower stocking rates, strategic placement of
   off-river watering points for stock, and the introduction of rotational
   grazing practices may be used to restore riparian habitat quality. The
   grazing-sensitive species we identified could be used as indicator
   species for the success of rehabilitation efforts. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In the Mississippi Alluvial Valley flood control has led to a drastic
   reduction in the area of forest habitat and altered the patchwork of
   forest cover types. Silvicultural management of the the remaining
   fragmented forests has changed to reflect the altered hydrology of the
   forests, current economic conditions of the area, and demand for forest
   products. Because forest type and silvicultural management impact forest
   birds, differences in avian productivity within these forests directly
   impact bird conservation. To assist in conservation planning, we
   evaluated daily nest survival, nest predation rates, and brood
   parasitism rates of forest birds in relation to different forest cover
   types and silvicultural management strategies within this floodplain.
   Within bottomland hardwood forests,, nest success of blue-gray
   gnatcatcher (Poliptila caerulea, 13\%), eastern towhee (Pipilo
   erythrophthalamus, 28\%), indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea, 18\%),
   northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis, 22\%), and yellow-billed
   cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus, 18\%) did not differ from that within
   intensively managed cottonwood plantations. However, average daily
   survival of 542 open-cup nests of 19 bird species in bottomland
   hardwoods (0.9516 +/- 0.0028, similar to 27\% nest success) was greater
   than that of 543 nests of 18 species in cottonwood plantations (0.9298
   +/- 0.0035, similar to 15\% nest success). Differences in daily nest
   survival rates likely resulted from a combination of differences in the
   predator community - particularly fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) - and a
   marked difference in species composition of birds breeding within these
   2 forest types. At least 39\% of nests in bottomland hardwood forests
   and 65\% of nests in cottonwood plantations were depredated. Rates of
   parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were greater in
   managed cottonwoods (24\%) than in bottomland hardwoods (9\%). Nest
   success in planted cottonwood plantations for 18 species combined
   (similar to 14\%). and for yellow-breasted chat (Iteria virens, 7\%),
   eastern towhee (14\%), indigo bunting (14\%), and northern cardinal
   (17\%) did not differ from nest success in cottonwood plantations that
   were coppiced from root sprouts following pulpwood harvest. Within
   bottomland hardwood forests, uneven-aged group-selection timber harvest
   reduced the combined daily nest survival of all species from 0.958 to
   0.938, which reduced nest success by about 14\%. Specifically, timber
   harvest reduced nest success of species chat nest in the forest midstory
   and canopy such as Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) - from 32\%
   before harvest to 14\% after harvest. Conversely, those species that
   nest primarily in the shrubbery understory - such as northern cardinal -
   were not affected by timber harvest and maintained an overall nest
   succcess of about 33\%. Thus, birds nesting in the understory of
   bottomland hardwood forests are not adversely imparted by selective
   timber harvest, but there is a short-term reduction in nest success for
   birds that nest in the canopy and midstory.}},

Abstract = {{We made counts of 42 bird species at 217 points in 44 jack pine Pinus
   banksiana stands in the boreal region of north-central Saskatchewan,
   Canada because of concerns about the impact of forestry on avian
   biodiversity. Using multivariate analyses we describe the main patterns
   of bird species abundance and composition in relation to local habitat
   variables. According to canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), 17 of
   43 explanatory variables accounted for significant variation in the bird
   species matrix: stand age, tamarack Larix laricina canopy cover,
   percentage shrub Alnus glutinosa, canopy closure (6-30\%). percentage
   herbs, maximum canopy height, percentage shrub Alnus viridis. percentage
   moss, percentage shrub Betula nana, minimum and mean shrub height,
   percentage litter, white birch Betula papyrifera canopy cover, white
   spruce Picea glauca canopy cover, mean canopy height, canopy closure
   (71-100\%), and zero shrub canopy closure. Habitat and stand identity
   (clustering of sites within stands) explained 55.5\% of the total
   variation; 16.3\% was unique to habitat alone (29.4\% of the total
   variance explained - TVE) and 17.2\% (31.0\% TVE) was shared with stand
   identity. Stand identity accounted for 22.0\% (39.6\% TVE) of the
   variation. Neotropical migrants associated with ``overmature{''}
   mixed-wood stands included Cape May Dendroica tigrina, bay-breasted D.
   castanea and Tennessee Vermivora peregrina warblers. Conversely,
   orange-crowned C: celata, palm D. palmarum. and Nashville V. ruficapilla
   warblers were found in young stands. The presence of several Neotropical
   migrants was associated with mixed-wood attributes (ovenbird Seiurus
   aurocapillus with aspen, red-eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus with shrub
   alder, and Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus with canopy white
   birch). Jack pine stands older than commercial rotation age must be
   maintained in a managed landscape because their bird communities differ
   from younger stands. Because of the limited avian diversity in pure jack
   pine stands, sufficient mixed-wood stands must be regenerated to sustain
   populations of characteristic bird species. We recommend that jack pine
   mixed-woods be managed using shelterwood or selective cuts, and that
   rotation age of some stands be increased. Without the extensive fires
   necessary for regeneration. cutting patterns at the landscape level
   should approximate natural disturbance patches both in size and
   frequency of disturbance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Transect bird surveys were conducted at 43 tallgrass prairies in
   southwestern Missouri, U.S.A. in mid-June each year from 1992 to 1999.
   Litter volume on and near the ground was estimated on a nine-point scale
   during 1994 to 1999. The relative importance of management type
   (rotational burning, rotational haying, or a combination of both) and
   litter volume on relative abundance was analysed for three declining
   grassland songbirds: Henslow's Sparrow Ammodramus henslowii, Grasshopper
   Sparrow A. savannarum, and Dickcissel Spiza americana. Haying resulted
   in significantly higher abundance than burning for all species except
   Dickcissel, for which few significant management effects were detected.
   Henslow's Sparrow increased in abundance from light to heavy litter,
   Grasshopper Sparrow peaked in low to intermediate litter, and Dickcissel
   showed little pattern relative to litter. Litter scores recorded in each
   management type increased with number of years since last treatment.
   Although litter profoundly affected bird abundance, independent and
   equally important was whether that litter was obtained via haying or
   burning. Greater consistency among years in hayed vegetation structure
   may help explain these birds' preference for haying over burning or
   haying + burning. Rotational haying should be employed more than burning
   in the management of these declining birds, especially for the sharply
   declining, fire-sensitive Henslow's and Grasshopper Sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{In southcentral Florida where agricultural lands are being converted
   rapidly to urban development, much of the remaining nonurban habitat
   occurs on privately owned cattle ranches. We studied the Crested
   Caracara (Caracara cheriway), a threatened bird of prey, to learn the
   role of private lands in sustaining the population We investigated
   patterns of distribution and reproductive activity of breeding pairs of
   caracaras in relation to patterns of land ownership and use. Eighty-two
   percent of 73 active nest sites found were on privately owned cattle
   ranches. We rarely found breeding pairs on Publicly owned lands most of
   which are managed as natural areas (no agricultural production and
   limited livestock grazing) to support native plant and animal
   communities, in 46 breeding areas with 4 years of known histories of
   occupancy and reproduction, pairs nesting on lands where the major land
   use was cattle ranching exhibited higher rates of breeding-area
   occupancy, attempted breeding during more years, initiated egg laying
   earlier exhibited higher nesting success, and attempted a second brood
   after successfully fledging a first brood more often than pairs nesting
   on lands managed as natural areas Compositional analysis suggested
   nonrandom selection of habitats by breeding pairs of caracaras in their
   establishment of a home range in the current landscape of southcentral
   Florida. Compared with random areas and available habitat in the overall
   study area, caracara home ranges had higher proportions of improved
   pasture and lower proportions of forest, woodland, oak, scrub and marsh.
   Which management activities favor and do not favor caracaras is
   uncertain, and hypotheses should be formulated and tested to guide
   future conservation applications. Particular grazing and fire management
   practices on privately, and publicly owned lands may affect the
   structure of vegetation and prey communities in ways that influence
   caracaras. Or replacement of native by exotic grasses may retain
   structurally suitable plant communities, where as fertilization and
   grazing may increase productivity and nutrient cycling in ways that
   favor caracaras. Given continued conversion of natural habitats and
   agricultural lands to urban development, it is important to recognize
   that cattle ranches may provide important resources for wildlife
   conservation. Although cattle ranching is not likely to benefit all
   species historically associated with the native prairie ecosystem in
   Florida finding ways to retain this land use may be important for the
   conservation of Flolida's population of Crested Caracaras and other
   organisms of Florida's dry prairies.}},

Abstract = {{We use the term ``optimal niche gestalt{''} to refer to the concept that
   there are structural features of the environment that allow a species to
   thrive over and above those that allow it to persist. Analyses of the
   covariation between demographic and habitat features can reveal a
   trajectory toward this optimal state. To help identify new criteria for
   foraging-habitat guidelines for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides
   borealis) in the Apalachicola National Forest, we examine seven years of
   demographic data for the woodpecker population and habitat in core
   stands, the naturally regenerated prime habitat in the centers of their
   territories. For both districts of the forest, two compound habitat
   variables are highly related to the average number of adult birds per
   social group, the average number of young fledged per group, and the
   density of groups. These variables are, first, the difference between
   the density of trees > 35 cm dbh and that of trees 15-25 cm dbh and,
   second, the difference, in the ground cover, between the percentage of
   wiregrass and that of woody-plus-palmetto vegetation. Although the birds
   require a few old relict trees for their cavities, a regression analysis
   shows that including data for variation in the availability of relict
   trees in this forest does not improve the power of the above habitat
   variables to account for variation in the demography of the birds.
   Because covariation between demographic variables and the
   recommendations in the current federal guidelines for the management of
   foraging habitat of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker is low, we conclude that
   experimental tests of whether causal mechanisms underlie the much higher
   correlative relationships we have found are warranted. Such tests should
   use differing levels of prescribed fire, which has dramatic effects on
   the ground cover. Smaller size classes of trees in closed-canopy stands
   should be thinned, creating patchy openings in the forest that will
   promote natural pine regeneration. Traditional unevenaged silvicultural
   management could adopt a target tree distribution similar to that on the
   Apalachicola Ranger District, which supports a population of woodpeckers
   that is deemed to have recovered. We think that in addition to being
   beneficial for the birds the proposed program of habitat management is
   more likely to promote the long-term restoration of the longleaf
   pine/wiregrass ecosystem within Red-cockaded Woodpecker habitat than are
   alternative scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian habitats typically support high diversity and density of both
   plants and animals. With the dramatic loss of riparian habitats,
   restoring them has become a priority among conservation practitioners.
   Diversity and density of avian species tend to increase following
   riparian restoration, but little is known about holy restored habitats
   function to meet particular species' needs. Habitat structure is an
   important factor affecting species diversity and density and can
   influence nest-site selection and reproductive success. To evaluate
   habitat restoration, rye examined interactions between habitat
   structure, nest-site selection, and nesting success in Song Sparrows
   (Melospiza melodia) nesting in restored, mature, and young naturally
   regenerating stands of riparian forest. We found that stand types
   differed markedly in structure, and that habitat structure influenced
   both nest-site selection and rates of nest loss to predation. Comparison
   of habitat structure among the three stand types indicated that restored
   stands offered fewer acceptable nest sites and poorer protection from
   nest predation. Concordant with those differences in habitat structure,
   Song Sparrows showed trends toward less density in restored stands than
   in mature forest, and had poorer nesting success as a result of
   predation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{390-400}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. The abundance of meadow pipits appears to be a good indicator of the
   breeding density of hen harriers on moorland managed for red grouse in
   Scotland. High densities of hen barriers can limit grouse populations at
   low density and reduce shooting bags, with repercussions for grouse moor
   management and conservation. We therefore examined the habitat
   characteristics of managed grouse moors, asking whether changes in
   vegetation could alter the ratio of pipits, and thus harriers, to
   grouse.
   2. We examined grouse abundance and habitat on 69 sites of 1 km(2) in
   upland Britain,. of which pipit abundance was studied on 36. Similar
   data were collected on 73 sites of 25 ha within the Langholm estate in
   south-west Scotland, in order to make a within-estate and among-moor
   comparison.
   3. The distribution of pipit abundance on the Langholm estate was
   similar to that seen in the extensive among-moor study. Pipit and grouse
   abundance were related to habitat in similar ways in the two data sets.
   4. Pipits were the most frequent passerine, but their abundance was not
   related to grouse abundance. Pipit abundance declined with increasing
   muirburn and heather, but increased with grass cover. In a linear
   regression model Calluna, Sphagnum and muirburn cover accounted for 42\%
   of the variation in pipit abundance across Britain.
   5. Grouse abundance was influenced by the regional location of the
   grouse moor and to a lesser extent by its altitude. There were more
   grouse on English moors with less patchy habitats. Bird species declined
   with increasing Calluna and Sphagnum cover and habitat patchiness. Bird
   species diversity increased from west to east and on moors with more
   muirburn.
   6. This study provides evidence that meadow pipits are influenced by
   habitat characteristics on moorland managed for grouse. This work also
   illustrates how habitat management may be able to mitigate
   human-wildlife conflicts: long-term increases in heather cover and
   management of this habitat by muirburn on grouse moors may reduce pipit
   numbers and thus reduce the ratio of hen harriers to grouse. However,
   the effects of such vegetation change on other components of the upland
   bird assemblage requires further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal wetlands in the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain commonly are managed
   intensively by fall or winter burning and constructing impoundments to
   improve habitat for wintering waterfowl, reduce wetland loss, and create
   emergent wetlands. However, little information is available on effects
   of these management practices on plant or bird communities during
   summer. We conducted experimental burns in 4 types of impounded and
   unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwestern
   Louisiana. We recorded vegetation characteristics and species
   composition and relative abundance of plants and birds during April-lune
   1996-1998. We found that vegetation characteristics in burned marshes
   did not differ from those of unburned marshes by the first summer
   post-burn and that winter burning did not affect bird species richness
   or species composition. Birds/survey for all species combined and for
   sparrows (primarily seaside sparrows {[}Ammodramus maritimus]) did not
   differ between burned and unburned marshes during the first or third
   summers post-burn, but were 2 times greater in burned than in unburned
   marshes during the second summer post-burn. Our results indicate that
   winter burning for waterfowl is compatible with management for other
   marsh birds, provided that measures ensuring sufficient winter cover for
   passerines are included in management plans. Number of icterids/survey
   was greatest and sparrows/survey was least in intermediate impounded
   marshes compared to other marsh-management types. Sparrows generally
   were most abundant in brackish and saline unimpounded marshes,
   indicating that continued loss of unimpounded marsh habitat could impact
   coastal sparrow populations.}},

Abstract = {{Evolving agricultural policies have influenced management practices
   within agroecosystems, impacting available habitats for many species of
   wildlife. Enhancing wildlife habitat has become an explicit objective of
   existing agricultural policy. Thus, there is renewed focus on field
   borders and the use of shelterbelt agroforestry systems to achieve
   conservation goals in the Midwest. Two Representative Farms - a 283-ha
   dryland and 510-ha irrigated farm were created in Saunders County,
   Nebraska. The Habitat Analysis and Modeling System (HAMS) was used to
   describe the composition and spatial pattern of the existing farms and
   surrounding landscape, as well as for the landscapes surrounding
   selected Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. Simulated land use changes
   resulting from the implementation of two shelterbelt scenarios,
   Agricultural and Wildlife, were incorporated on each Representative Farm
   and surrounding landscape. Landscape variables which influence breeding
   bird species richness and community composition as determined from BBS
   routes were measured on simulated farm landscapes. A more heterogeneous
   landscape results from implementing either scenario. The percent total
   woods was a significant determinant of bird species richness on the BBS
   routes and was important in influencing bird communities at the farm-
   and landscape-level. Other landscape metrics which influenced the bird
   community composition on BBS routes were woody edge percentages and edge
   density values. Policies promoting shelterbelts create edge habitats
   which ultimately favor birds within the Forest-edge/generalist guild
   while bird species in need of conservation such as grassland-field
   species would potentially be negatively affected.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the effect of experimental logging of two different ages,
   and the effect of tree girdling without selective logging, on the local
   abundance of three heliothermic lizards. The response to intensity of
   selective logging varied among species of lizards. The local abundance
   of M, nigropunctata increased with the intensity of logging damage,
   while the relationships for R calcarata and A. ameiva were not
   statistically significant. The three species used plots cut four years
   before more frequently than control plots, but the density of A. ameiva
   in gaps in blocks cut 9-10 years before was similar to that in
   undisturbed vegetation. The girdling treatments had a significant
   negative effect on K. calcarata, but not M. nigropunctata or A. ameiva.
   We suggest that differences in numbers of lizards reflect a behavioral
   choice for microhabitats created in the logging areas, because the
   spatial scale of this study was too small to confidently detect the
   effects of the silvicuture treatments on populations of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in weed populations and weed seed abundance have probably
   contributed to the decline of granivorous birds on European farmland.
   Effective management of weed populations to restore seed sources
   requires that we know which weeds are important foods for birds, and
   where and how in the farmed landscape seeds are best made available to
   birds. Weed genera of widespread importance in farmland bird diet
   include Polygonum, Chenopodium, Poa, Stellaria, Rumex, Cerastium,
   Sinapis, Taraxacum and Senecio. The seeds of the most pernicious
   agricultural grass weeds are not widely taken by birds. Birds will
   choose to feed where seeds are at high density, easily accessible and
   where predation risk is minimal. For most species, this means that seed
   provision is best concentrated along field edges but field centre
   management is also required for skylark, linnet and twite. Seed is best
   provided on sparsely vegetated ground. Further research is needed to
   advance from description of weed management practices that are required
   to help reverse bird population declines to realistic, quantitative
   predictions of the size of seed populations needed to support known
   populations of birds. Field studies of distributions of seed-eating
   birds as a function of seed densities are now providing a better basis
   for judging which fields, managed in which ways are most likely to
   attract and support sced-eating birds.}},

Title = {{Foliage structure influences foraging of insectivorous forest birds: An
   experimental study}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{219-231}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Preferences for foraging in particular tree species have been well
   documented in a variety of bird species, but underlying reasons remain
   little investigated. Understanding the causal bases for such patterns of
   habitat use can help to elucidate mechanisms of habitat selection and,
   therefore, community organization and structure. I experimentally tested
   the hypothesis that fine-scale foliage structure of two deciduous tree
   species influences the foraging behavior of three small, insectivorous
   bird species. On sugar maple (Acer saccharum), with its orbicular leaves
   elevated above the branch, Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica
   caerulescens) and American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) captured prey
   predominantly from lower leaf surfaces, whereas Black-throated Green
   Warblers (Dendroica virens) captured prey predominantly from upper leaf
   surfaces. In contrast, on yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), with its
   oblong-ovate leaves held within the plane of the supporting branch, all
   three bird species captured prey disproportionately from upper leaf
   surfaces. Overall, aerial maneuvers were used more frequently to capture
   prey from upper than from lower leaf surfaces on sugar maple, but the
   opposite occurred on yellow birch, where non-aerial maneuvers were used
   more frequently to capture prey from upper than from lower leaf
   surfaces. Those results indicate that the leaf surface from which prey
   are more easily captured (with less energetically costly non-aerial
   maneuvers) differs between those tree species. Experimental manipulation
   of leaf dispersion and distance to prey demonstrated that leaf
   dispersion is the chief determinant of prey capture location (upper vs.
   lower leaf surfaces), and that distance to prey is the chief determinant
   of prey capture maneuver (aerial vs. non-aerial). When foraging on
   artificial branches in which vertical distance between branches was
   systematically increased experimentally, Black-throated Green Warblers
   captured a significantly smaller proportion of prey from lower surfaces
   of leaves on the upper branch than did Black-throated Blue Warblers.
   Taken together, these results indicate that different tree species, as
   well as different locations within tree species, present insectivorous
   birds with distinct foraging environments and, therefore, constitute
   distinct foraging microhabitats. Furthermore, even closely related bird
   species that are generally similar morphologically respond in
   behaviorally unique ways to differences in foliage structure. For those
   reasons, forest management practices that enhance tree species diversity
   could concomitantly enhance foraging opportunities (niche diversity) for
   forest insectivores and may thus help to promote high bird species
   diversity and maintain abundant populations.}},

Abstract = {{Intuitively, biological diversity would apparently seem the most
   unambiguous and easily studied of ecological concepts. However, when we
   look for a suitable numerical definition, we find that no single
   diversity index adequately summarizes community structure. One reason
   for this drawback is that different diversity indices confound the
   qualities of species richness and dominance concentration in a single
   number. Consequently, the characterization of community diversity can be
   substantially improved by substituting a parametric index family for
   traditional diversity indices, While traditional diversity indices
   supply point descriptions of community structure, according to
   parametric diversity indices, there is a continuum of possible diversity
   measures, which differ only in their sensitivity to the presence of rare
   species in the formulation of the indices. In this paper we first
   summarize the role of Renyi's generalized information for parametric
   biodiversity characterization. Then, we show that Renyi's generalized
   information can be expressed as a simple linear combination of the
   information associated to species richness and dominance concentration.
   Raunkiaer's life-form spectra of a Mediterranean garrigue in southern
   France one year and five years after fire are used to clarify the ideas

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{53-79}},
Abstract = {{In Morvan, one of the regions of France with the most numerous
   introduced Douglas-fir plantations, birds settle in the stands as early
   as the first preliminary clearcutting. The bird community then changes
   progressively during the cutting cycle, according to an ecological
   succession roughly similar to those observed in other analogous
   plantations (e.g. pines, beech). Schematically, this ecological
   succession goes through three main stages: (1) a pioneer phase (during
   the first ten years) when spontaneous vegetation develops vigorously
   among young Douglas-firs: open-space and low vegetation birds such as
   pipits, Stonechat, Yellowhammer, then Dunnock, Bullfinch and warblers,
   enter such places: (2) an intermediate phase defined by Douglas-fir very
   strongly dominant over all other vegetation and pioneer species
   disappearing; at that stage (which lasts several dozens of years) the
   bird community is reduced both in species and individual numbers and is
   mainly based on generalist (e.g. Song Thrush, Robin) or
   conifer-specialist (e.g. Gold- and Firecrests, Coal and Crested Tits)
   forest birds; (3) in old stands (rare), the bird community becomes rich
   again because Douglas-firs are well grown and allow grasses and bushes
   to recover. The ornithological poverty of the intermediate stages (which
   is also observed in other similar types of even-aged plantations) seems
   best explained by the sylvicultural treatment (i.e. almost single-cohort
   stands) than by Douglas-fir per se. The phenomenon is however more
   pronounced with Douglas-fir because of its very important domination
   over grassy and bushy vegetation. Moreover one observes that in these
   dense stands of intermediate age the smallest edge effect (either on
   edges or in gaps) goes with an increase in bird species richness. These
   observations allow one to expect better conditions for birds in
   Douglas-fir plantations if they were harvested in less dense,
   mixed-species or uneven-aged stands.}},

Abstract = {{We review species richness in major organism groups, mainly using
   examples from northern Europe. A high proportion of these species is
   forest living, and large numbers are dependent on decaying wood.
   Biodiversity can be assessed at various scales using two different
   principles. One is to use features. such as ancient and dead trees,
   known to be important for a large number of species. The other method is
   to choose species or groups of species known to indicate high
   biodiversity or presence of many red-listed species. We argue that any
   serious biodiversity assessment method should include the most species
   rich organism groups, for example insects. In the present paper we point
   out the most important features for high biodiversity (old trees and
   large dead trees), and review the quantities of these features in
   near-virgin forests. The natural disturbance regime of a region should
   be the basis for defining a suitable scale and the appropriate features
   for biodiversity assessment. Possible indicator species for high
   biodiversity in northern Europe are suggested. based on previous
   investigations. Among epiphytic lichens and wood-living beetles there
   are many potentially useful species in addition to vascular plants in
   the nemoral forest. Among vertebrates, woodpeckers and grouses seem to
   be the most useful. Validation tests for indicator structures and
   species are largely lacking but urgently needed. The implications of
   possible delayed local extinctions tire important to bear in mind when
   managing for sustainable forestry. The knowledge of forest history is
   useful when developing cost-efficient measures.}},

   Stands dominated by ponderosa pine had lower (P < 0.01) bird species

   or pine in aspen stands did not increase bird species richness (P

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of habitat clearance and
   fragmentation on birds of coastal heathlands in subtropical eastern
   Australia. Abundance and species composition were compared among two
   types of cleared habitat (residential suburbs and sugar cane cropland)
   and four sizes of heathland remnant (1-2 ha, 5-10 ha, 20-50 ha and >500
   ha) in summer and winter. Cleared land contained a distinctly different
   bird species assemblage from heathland remnants. Residential sites
   contained a distinct suite of species consistent with that described for
   `open/developed land' habitat elsewhere in the region. In contrast, cane
   cropland supported very few species. Heathland remnants >500 ha
   contained high densities of `natural-vegetation-dependent' species,
   whereas species of `open/developed land were absent. Remnants of 1-2 ha
   had lowered densities of many natural-vegetation-dependent species, and
   a relatively high abundance of open/developed land species. Some of the
   avifaunal differences in the >500-ha remnants and 5-50-ha range are
   probably due to confounding of remnant size with habitat, resulting from
   selective clearing of the landscape. Most of the heathland birds were
   intolerant of the matrix habitat (residential and cane cropland), but
   tolerant of decreased remnant area, down to a threshold of about 5 ha.
   However, the distinctive floristic associations of heathland vegetation
   are dependent on an environmental regime (low nutrient, low pH, fire, in
   some cases inundation) that is unlikely to persist in remnants tens of
   hectares in size, and longer-term declines in heathland birds, are
   predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Effective conservation and habitat restoration strategies in
   human-dominated landscapes must be based on an understanding of the ways
   that habitat loss and fragmentation affect native species. We studied
   avian foraging behavior and patterns of occurrence in the highly
   fragmented agricultural landscape of the Kellerberrin district of
   Western Australia to better understand the factors underlying species
   declines and losses. We conducted three surveys of 30 wandoo woodland
   patches that ranged in size from 1.3 to 101.3 ha. Some patches were part
   of larger remnants of native vegetation, ranging in size from 3.5 to
   1204.8 ha and including other habitat types. We examined the extent to
   which patterns of species richness, the occurrence and composition of
   foraging guilds, and the occurrence of individual species varied with
   features of woodland patches, remnants, and the surrounding landscape.
   Using multiple regression analyses, the best model for species richness
   included terms for the log of remnant area, the patch diversity of each
   remnant, and woodland patch condition. We delineated eight foraging
   guilds based on similarities in the substrate/method dimension and also
   using multidimensional scaling analyses. The best model for the number
   of foraging guilds present in a patch included a single variable
   representing shrub density. Analyses of nestedness based on guilds and
   on individual species were both significant; and for the latter, 11 of
   13 species made a significant contribution to the overall pattern. We
   derived separate models for the occurrence of each of eight species and
   one guild using multiple logistic regression. Significant models
   included, either separately or in combination, the following variables:
   the log of remnant area, patch area, the total area of woodland in a
   remnant, and the distance to other woodland patches. For four species
   that had sufficient records to examine shifts in foraging behavior, we
   observed significant differences in both foraging methods and substrates
   with changes in remnant size and/or the presence of other species or
   guilds.
   Our analyses indicated that remnant area was the best single variable
   for measures of community structure, in part because it was strongly
   correlated with other variables, such as total woodland area, patch
   area, remnant patch diversity, number of corridor connections, and
   measures of isolation. For foraging guilds and for individual species,
   variables other than remnant area assumed greater importance. The strong
   patterns of nestedness for foraging guilds by remnant area may reflect
   the diminished availability of certain prey items in small, degraded
   remnants. This notion is reinforced by the relatively high species and
   guild richness recorded in small patches that were either fenced from
   grazing or embedded in large remnants. The nested pattern of species
   within some foraging guilds, however, indicates the importance of
   additional aspects of their ecology. A focus on richness alone may mask
   the unique responses of bird species to fragmentation and may divert
   attention from important considerations in the development of land-use
   policy and reserve acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{We review some key features of scientific inquiry and experimental

   songbirds. We use examples from contemporary studies in eastern
   deciduous forests. Scientific methods, observational versus experimental
   studies, replication and randomization, choice of factors and models,
   and response variables are important elements in designing research
   approaches that address effects of forest management. There are
   significant gaps in our knowledge on the effects of forest management on
   birds. Many studies have addressed effects of management on species
   abundance, but we can make only limited inferences from most of these.
   The design of studies is complicated because of the range of forest
   management practices, variation in bird species responses, differences
   among forest types, and the effects of confounding factors such as
   landscape effects. Few studies have addressed effects of forest
   management on the reproductive success of forest songbirds. We believe
   the reliability of our knowledge in this area will be improved most
   quickly if we use current knowledge to generate hypotheses, use a mix of
   well-designed observational and manipulative experiments to test them,

   forested locations on coastal cheniers for three years (1993-95) in the
   spring and at one: location for three years (1996-98) in autumn to
   determine species presence and diet. One hundred and twenty-eight
   species were present during the spring and 103 species in autumn. The
   majority of these species were migrants (103 species in spring and 89
   species in autumn) and the majority of these: were Nearctic/Neotropical
   species (73 species in sprint: and 66 species in autumn). The diet of
   these migrants was more variable than expected. Many insectivorous
   species were observed to consume seeds, fruit and nectar as well as
   insects. Because of these varied diets, many species serve as seed
   dispersers, occasional pollinators and important predators of herbivorus
   insects. Wooded areas were found to be important in providing food,

Abstract = {{Timber harvest projections for aspen-dominated forests in the prairie
   region of Canada include a truncation of the current age distribution,
   whereby old stands of fire origin will become rarer on the landscape,
   while young, post-harvest stands will increase in abundance. To
   determine the effects this harvesting strategy might have on communities
   of breeding forest birds, we conducted point counts in young forests
   regenerated from clear-cutting (15-25 years), and mature (50-60 years),
   and old (80-110 years) forests regenerated from fire. Avian species
   richness was highest in old stands at the point-count station, forest
   stand, and landscape level. Increased species richness with forest age
   was associated with increases in the relative abundance of canopy- and
   cavity-nesting species. At local scales (station and stand), species
   richness of ground- and shrub-nesting birds was similar among forest
   age-classes. However, as determined by rarefaction analyses appropriate
   at the landscape scale, ground-nesting species were more common in young
   and old forests, while shrub-nesting species were more common in young
   and mature forests. Density of deciduous shrubs was an important factor
   influencing the abundance of species like American redstart, Canada
   warbler, and chestnut-sided warbler. An increase in conifer in old
   stands resulted in greater use by conifer- or mixedwood associated
   species such as bay-breasted warbler, magnolia warbler, and ruby-crowned
   kinglet. Our data indicate that vegetation and structural
   characteristics such as shrub density should be considered when
   prescribing sustainable forestry objectives. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Retention of residual trees in even-aged harvested stands is an
   alternative to traditional clearcutting, seed-tree, and shelterwood
   systems, but little is known about effects of new even-aged retention
   methods on bird communities. Clearcutting on Pennsylvania state forests
   recently has been replaced by a new forest management practice termed
   even-aged reproduction stands with reservation guidelines thereafter,
   EAR stands), in which high densities of trees in multiple crown and size
   classes (101 live trees/ha +/-28 SE on study sites) of both commercially
   and non-commercially important tree species are permanently reserved to
   maintain species and structural diversity. We compared habitat structure
   and breeding-bird communities between EAR stands (harvested) and
   reference stands (unharvested) in 2 state forests of Pennsylvania in
   1997-98 and related bird abundance within harvested stands to
   differences in habitat characteristics among EAR stands and the
   surrounding landscapes. Total abundance of all bird species combined,
   abundances of early-successional and edge-habitat guilds, and abundances
   of many early-successional bird species were significantly higher in EAR
   stands than in reference stands, but abundances of the forest habitat
   guild and of 8 forest-associated species were lower in EAR stands.
   Although EAR stands provide suitable habitat for bird species associated
   with early-successional forests, abundances of species associated with
   mature forests were lower in EAR stands than in reference stands despite
   retention of residual trees. However, some species of forest birds
   (e.g., red-eyed vireos {[}Vireo olivaceus]), which usually are absent
   from recent clearcut stands until 12-20 years post-harvest, were often
   detected in EAR stands. Thus, residual trees in EAR stands provide to
   forest birds habitat components that are generally lacking in clearcut
   stands. Because abundances of both forest habitat and forest-canopy
   nesting guilds declined and abundance of brown-headed cowbirds
   (Molothrus ater) increased with size of EAR stands (especially when >20
   ha), managers should consider limiting the size of EAR stands.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fires have been used as a forest vegetation management tool
   in the eastern United States during the past decade, but concerns have
   been raised about direct or indirect adverse effects on Neotropical
   migrant bird species that nest in forest interior habitats. Prescribed
   fires were set in 1993 and 1995 in a mature hardwood forest in southern
   Indiana, USA, to reduce shade-tolerant understory woody vegetation and
   thereby increase the abundance and diversity of ground layer vegetation
   and seedlings of tree species that require moderate light levels (e.g.,
   Quercus L. spp.). The objective of this study was to determine if
   prescribed fires reduced the abundance or reproductive success of
   ground- and shrub-nesting Neotropical migrant bird species. The burned
   area and an adjacent unburned area were studied during the summers of
   1996 and 1997. An unlimited-radius point count method was used to
   determine relative abundance. Nests were monitored to determine fledging
   success. Vegetation structure was quantified at nest sites and at random
   points to assess fire effects and bird nest-site selection. Abundance of
   birds in this nesting guild was greater in the unburned area during both
   years. The greatest difference in abundance was for ovenbird (Seiurus
   aurocappilus Linnaeus). The probability of nest success for all bird
   species in this nesting guild combined, determined by the Mayfield
   method, was significantly lower in the burned area (0.125) than in the
   unburned area (0.291). Abundance of the brood parasite brown-headed
   cowbird (Molothrus ater Boddaert) did not differ between burned and
   unburned areas. However, the probability of nest success for parasitized
   nests (0.140) was lower than that of unparasitized nests (0.735). The
   mean number of host young fledged from successful nests was
   significantly lower in parasitized nests (1.3) than from unparasitized
   nests (3.0). Prescribed fires significantly reduced vegetative cover in
   the burned area. Nest sites in the burned area had higher vegetative
   cover than random points, indicating that birds may have selected nest
   sites that were less affected by the fire. While prescribed fires that
   burn in a ``natural{''} hit-or-miss pattern may retain nesting habitat
   for bird species in this nesting guild, lower nest success in the burned
   area indicates that management for desirable vegetation and for this
   nesting guild may not be compatible within the same forest. stand at the
   same time. This argues for planning at a landscape level to attain
   objectives for both vegetation composition and maintenance of bird
   species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1975 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has managed and irrigated
   440 ha along the lower Snake River in Washington as mitigation for four
   dams constructed 1962-1975. We investigated avian use of irrigated
   Habitat Management Units (HMUs), compared to non-irrigated sites and
   streams that entered the river. We conducted bird surveys at 25 sites in
   summer and fall 1997 and in spring 1998. We compared avian abundance,
   species richness, and species diversity among habitats and seasons. We
   detected an average of 169 birds and 33 species at HMUs, 120 birds and
   28 species at non-irrigated sites, and 63 birds and 23 species along
   streams in all three seasons. We detected an average of 29 species/site
   in summer, 31 in fall, and 22 in spring. Species diversity, as measured
   by the Shannon-Wiener function, was higher in summer, indicating that
   large flocks of a few species were common in fall and spring. These data
   demonstrated that the lower Snake River is an important stopover site
   for migrating birds. We detected an average of 30 more bird species than
   a study conducted on the same area in 1974. The increase in species
   richness is attributed to the development of HMUs and to natural
   succession of palustrine vegetation since dam construction. Future
   potential changes in reservoir levels, such as breaching of dams, will
   undoubtedly affect bird communities along the lower Snake River in all
   seasons. However, our data demonstrated that habitat perturbations can
   be partially mitigated by habitat enhancement and management.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of roads and traffic on hedgehog population

   determined by means of footprints in specially designed tunnels. The
   relative density was closely correlated with the total number of
   individual hedgehogs that were caught in trays in five of the plots
   immediately after the tunnels were removed. A power analysis indicated
   that, with the resources available, we could only detect an effect
   greater than 35\%. We were unable to demonstrate a significant effect,
   i.e. hedgehog density in areas adjacent to roads is not reduced by more
   than 35\%. However, we did find about 30\% fewer tracks in road plots
   when compared to control plots and the P-values were marginally
   insignificant at the P less than or equal to 0.05 significance level.
   These results suggest that roads and traffic are likely to reduce
   hedgehog density by about 30\%, which may affect the survival

Abstract = {{By retaining patches of trees in cut blocks, managers expect to retain
   some forest birds and create bird communities more similar to those
   found after fires. We surveyed birds from a range of patch sizes (1 to >
   3000 live residual trees), at four ages (2, 15, 30, 60 years), following
   two disturbance types (harvest, fire) in mixedwood boreal forest. Bird
   communities varied among patch sizes, forest ages, and disturbance
   types. Immediately post-disturbance, bird communities from large patches
   (> 100 residual trees) were more similar to those from old forest than
   were communities from small patches ( less than or equal to 10 residual
   trees). Birds that nest or forage in open or riparian habitats had
   highest densities in small patches 2 years post-harvest, whereas birds
   that nest in large snags had highest densities in small patches 2 years
   post-fire. Throughout the chronosequence following both disturbance
   types, birds from small patches became more similar to those from old
   forest. Birds that nest and forage in small trees and shrubs were common
   15 and 30 years post-disturbance, and generalist forest birds were
   common 60 years post-disturbance. Birds associated with old forest were
   present in all patch sizes 15, 30, and 60 years post-disturbance,

Abstract = {{The conservation of biological diversity has become one of the important
   goals of managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. Ecologists
   and forest resource managers need measures to judge the success or
   failure of management regimes designed to sustain biological diversity.
   The relationships between potential indicator species and total
   biodiversity are not well established. Carefully designed studies are
   required to test relationships between the presence and abundance of
   potential indicator species and other taxa and the maintenance of
   critical ecosystem processes in forests. Other indicators of biological
   diversity in forests, in addition or as alternatives to indicator
   species, include what we call structure-based indicators. These are
   stand-level and landscape-level (spatial) features of forests such as
   stand structural complexity and plant species composition, connectivity,
   and heterogeneity. Although the adoption of practices to sustain (or
   recreate) key characteristics of forest ecosystems appear intuitively
   sensible and broadly consistent with current knowledge, information is
   lacking to determine whether such stand- and landscape-level features of
   forests will serve as successful indices of (and help conserve)
   biodiversity. Given our limited knowledge of both indicator species and
   structure-based indicators, we advocate the following four approaches to
   enhance biodiversity conservation in forests: (1) establish biodiversity
   priority areas (e.g., reserves) managed primarily for the conservation
   of biological diversity; (2) within production forests, apply
   structure-based indicators including structural complexity,
   connectivity, and heterogeneity; (3) using multiple conservation
   strategies at multiple spatial scales, spread out risk in wood
   production forests; and (4) adopt an adaptive management approach to
   test the validity of structure-based indices of biological diversity by
   treating management practices as experiments. These approaches would aim
   to provide new knowledge to managers and improve the effectiveness of
   current management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Siren (1955) studied understorey species composition, tree stand
   properties and humus-layer thickness in 64 unlogged forest stands on
   topographically and pedologically comparable sites. The stands were of
   even age (6 - 300 yr), stocked with the first or second tree generation
   after wildfire. The view of Siren and several authors after him, that
   the vegetation of old-growth boreal Picea forests is homogeneous on a
   broad scale. was examined by applying, in parallel, the partial variants
   of two ordination methods (DCA and PCA) to Siren's vegetation data. Two
   main vegetation gradients were found: a major gradient running from
   recently burnt plots with prominence of pioneer species to plots with
   stand age > 100 yr, a well stocked tree layer and a thick humus layer,
   dominance of feather-mosses and ample occurrence of shade-tolerant as
   well as light-preferring vascular plant species, and a second gradient
   along which first- and second-generation plots segregate. The more
   prominent element of Betula trees in first- than in second-generation
   stands < 100 yr contributed to the latter. A minor third gradient
   related to humus-layer thickness was recovered by partial DCA only. The
   main vegetation gradient reappeared in separate ordinations of data from
   47 mature forest stands (> 100 yr), but without being correlated with
   forest age. Variation among mature-forest stands in the importance of
   pioneer species is considered mainly to be brought about by fine-scale
   disturbance processes such as tree uprooting. Increasing importance of
   factors operating on within-stand scales {[}development of a varied gap
   structure and stronger gradients in tree influence (radiation at ground
   level), soil moisture, soil depth and nutrient availability] with time
   is also reflected in the second and third mature-forest ordination axes.
   Possible implications of the results for conservation of biological
   diversity and monitoring of changes in boreal forests are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of logging operations on bird species abundance and diversity
   was studied over an eight-year period using a variable-circular plot
   bird survey procedure and a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design in
   karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forest in south-western Australia. The
   magnitude and spatial extent of impact was assessed from sample points
   in five bands parallel to the edge between clearfelled areas and mature
   forest (unburnt-forest, burnt-forest, forest-edge, gap-edge and gap). A
   total of 24 748 birds of 53 species were detected within 30 m of the
   observer during the study. Bird species abundance, and diversity, were
   similar in the five bands prior to treatment, and observed differences
   could be attributed to spatial patterns of flowering in the overstorey.
   Following logging, 19 of the 40 species that were detected more than
   five times showed changes in relative abundance (including both,
   increases and decreases) in one or more bands. Gaps showed the greatest
   number of significant changes (15) and these were typically of the
   greatest magnitude over the four years studied post-treatment. Gap-edges
   showed fewer changes (six), while both, the burnt-forest (three) and
   forest-edge (nil) bands showed few changes in relative abundance. Both,
   the number of species detected (for a given sampling effort), and
   species diversity declined in gap and gap-edge bands following logging.
   Nevertheless, variation in bird counts between successive seasons and
   years necessitates considerable replication before changes can be
   reliably assigned to disturbance impacts. In addition, the long period
   before maturation of the overstorey suggests that me local impact of
   logging and burning is likely to extend well beyond the life of
   experimental studies. Our results support the implementation of a
   well-dispersed system of retained mature forest along road, river and
   stream zones within the regeneration mosaic. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Bird species richness and individual abundances were recorded in old,
   unrestored tin strip mine plots, in mined plots restored 1, 2, and 3
   years before the study, and in adjacent, unmined, natural secondary
   forest plots on the 11,340-km(2) Indonesian island of Bangka (2 degrees
   S, 106 degrees E). The objective was to assess the ecological recovery
   of unrestored and minimally restored mine plots compared with
   surrounding reference forest. Unrestored mines had not been mined or
   used for any other purpose for 14-30 years; plots in their first,
   second, and third year since restoration were old mines planted with
   Acacia mangium (Leguminosae) at a density of 400 trees/ha. Natural
   secondary forest plots 20 or more years since the last disturbance were
   immediately adjacent to both unrestored and restored plots. Bird surveys
   on 4-ha plots were performed during the 1995 breeding season. A
   comparison of data from unrestored plots of widely varying ages showed
   no significant differences among them for species richness, diversity
   (Shannon-Wiener index, H'), or individual abundance, indicating that
   little natural bird community recovery had occurred over time in the
   plots. However, increases did occur in restored sites over only 3 years
   for both species richness (r(2) = 0.29, p = 0.04) and diversity (r(2) =
   0.45, p = 0.009). All values for third-year restored plots, however,
   were still significantly lower than corresponding values for adjacent
   natural secondary forest plots. The quick return of bird activity on the
   plots after minimal efforts at restoration supports the idea that
   simple, inexpensive restoration can be effective for ``jump starting{''}
   degraded systems at large scales. Such a restoration strategy might be
   of particular value for degraded land in developing nations, where
   scientific, professional, and financial resources might be in short
   supply. Using this strategy, a small number of restoration professionals
   could mobilize the labor of many local people in many areas, serving to
   both improve ecological systems and to educate and engage local
   populations in restoration and conservation projects.}},

Abstract = {{Global climate change is predicted to alter growing season rainfall
   patterns, potentially reducing total amounts of growing season
   precipitation and redistributing rainfall into fewer but larger
   individual events. Such changes may affect numerous soil, plant, and
   ecosystem properties in grasslands and ultimately impact their
   productivity and biological diversity. Rainout shelters are useful tools
   for experimental manipulations of rainfall patterns, and permanent
   fixed-location shelters were established in 1997 to conduct the Rainfall
   Manipulation Plot study in a mesic tallgrass prairie ecosystem in
   northeastern Kansas. Twelve 9 x 14-m fixed-location rainfall
   manipulation shelters were constructed to impose factorial combinations
   of 30\% reduced rainfall quantity and 50\% greater interrainfall dry
   periods on 6 x 6-m plots, to examine how altered rainfall regimes may
   affect plant species composition, nutrient cycling, and above- and
   belowground plant growth dynamics. The shelters provided complete
   control of growing season rainfall patterns, whereas effects on
   photosynthetic photon flux density, nighttime net radiation, and soil
   temperature generally were comparable to other similar shelter designs.
   Soil and plant responses to the first growing season of rainfall
   manipulations (1998) suggested that the interval between rainfall events
   may be a primary driver in grassland ecosystem responses to altered
   rainfall patterns. Aboveground net primary productivity, soil CO2 flux,
   and flowering duration were reduced by the increased interrainfall
   intervals and were mostly unaffected by reduced rainfall quantity. The
   timing of rainfall events and resulting temporal patterns of soil
   moisture relative to critical times for microbial activity, biomass
   accumulation, plant life histories, and other ecological properties may
   regulate longer-term responses to altered rainfall patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological communities are spatially and temporally variable in response
   to a variety of biotic and abiotic forces. It is not always cleat,
   however, if spatial and temporal variability leads to instability in
   communities. Instability may result from strong biotic interactions or
   from stochastic processes acting on small populations. I used 10-15 yr
   of annual data from the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research site
   to examine whether plant, breeding bird, grasshopper, and small mammal
   communities in tallgrass prairie exhibit stability or directional change
   in response to different experimentally induced fire frequencies. Based
   on ordination and ANOVA, plant and grasshopper communities on annually
   burned sites differed significantly from plant and grasshopper
   communities on less frequently burned sites. Breeding birds and small
   mammals differed among sites as well, but these differences were not
   clearly related to disturbance frequency A modified time series analysis
   indicated that plant communities were undergoing directional change
   (unstable) on all watersheds, regardless of fire frequency. Contrary to
   expectations, directional change was greatest on the annually burned
   sites and lowest on the infrequently burned sites. Unlike the plant
   communities, breeding bird. grasshopper, and small mammal communities
   were temporally stable, despite high-compositional variability from 1 yr
   to the next. Stability among the consumer communities within these
   dynamic plant communities occurs because three-dimensional vegetation
   structure does not change over time, despite changes in plant species
   composition. Evidence suggests that instability in the plant community
   results from strong biotic interactions among temporally persistent core
   species and stochastic dynamics among infrequent satellite species.
   Overall, community stability cannot be assessed if the pattern of
   temporal dynamics is unknown. Long-term empirical studies of different
   taxa under different disturbance regimes are needed to determine over
   what time frames and spatial scales communities may be stable. Such
   studies are essential for the development of generalities regarding the
   relationship between disturbance frequency and community stability in
   terrestrial and aquatic systems.}},

   panini on the Philippine island of Panay revealed thus far undescribed
   information on the breeding biology of this species. Females occupied
   nest holes in March-April, after which two or three eggs are laid.
   Although cooperative breeding is suspected for the genus, at two nests
   no helpers were recorded. Nest-concealment behaviour was observed in the
   adult male. After a nestling period of 55-58 days, the adult female and
   one juvenile left the nest simultaneously. Immature birds resemble their
   respective sex. Nest site characteristics of 24 nests of the Tarictic
   Hornbill and two of the Writhed-billed Hornbill Aceros waldeni,
   respectively, were recorded on Mt Balabag, Panay Mountain Range.
   Tarictic Hornbill nests were situated in living as well as dead trees,
   at an average height of 11 m. Cavity compass direction was uniformly
   distributed around the circle. Nests are aggregated within the habitat,
   with a mean nearest-neighbour distance of 190 m. Writhed-billed
   Hornbills may require larger trees for nesting than Tarictic Hornbills.
   Nest density was calculated to be around three Tarictic Hornbill nests
   and 0.2-0.3 Writhed-billed Hornbill nests per square kilometre. Given a
   total amount of suitable hornbill habitat on Panay of 225-450 km(2),
   about 750-1,000 Tarictic Hornbill breeding pairs and 60-100
   Writhed-billed Hornbill breeding pairs may remain on Panay.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the abundance and diversity of vascular plants in seven
   types of disturbance in mixed-wood boreal forest. Disturbance treatments
   included wildfire, natural regeneration after harvest and several
   methods of silvicultural site preparation. Relative to undisturbed
   forest, all disturbance treatments increased plant diversity to about
   the same extent. The abundance of plant growth-forms differed
   significantly between disturbance treatments. Silvicultural treatments
   involving soil disturbance (disk-trenching, drum-chopping and blading)
   had higher cover of grasses and annual forbs; naturally regenerated and
   Bracke-cultivated treatments contained more perennial forbs and shrubs.
   Thus, different post-disturbance plant communities established following
   contrasting types of disturbance. Plant community biomass and tree
   growth varied among disturbance treatments. Shoot mass of aspen (Populus
   tremuloides Michx.) and the root mass of all species declined
   significantly with increasing soil disturbance intensity. Aspen and
   white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) differed in their response to
   disturbance. Aspen growth was similar among disturbance treatments. In
   contrast, aspen density was significantly lower in disk-trenched and
   bladed treatments than in burned or naturally regenerated treatments,
   and aspen basal area was significantly lower only in drum-chopped
   treatments. White spruce grew fastest in drum-chopped sites. Burned
   treatments had the highest recruitment of volunteer spruce seedlings (up
   to 3200 ha(-1)), but not significantly higher than in other disturbance
   treatments. Taken together these results suggest that the most intensive
   silvicultural treatments had the expected effects of reducing aspen
   abundance and increasing the growth of spruce, but also contained more
   grasses and forbs and had lower total root mass than burned or naturally
   regenerating sites. Further work is needed to examine long-term
   productivity and the persistence of both native and persistent weedy
   species following contrasting types of disturbance. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Recovering predator populations may present problems for
   conservationists if their prey are of economic or conservation value. We
   address this issue by examining the conflict between raptor conservation
   and management of Red Grouse (Lagopus l. scoticus) in Britain. Heather
   moorland is a distinctive habitat that supports an important assemblage
   of breeding birds. Large areas of moorland are managed by private
   landowners for shooting grouse. Although grouse shooting benefits
   conservation by retaining heather moorland, it is currently unclear
   whether grouse management directly benefits other upland birds. Human
   persecution has greatly restricted the range and abundance of most
   raptor species in Britain. Following the introduction of bird protection
   laws, the decline in gamekeeping, and the restriction of organochlorine
   pesticides, raptor populations have started to recover. Persecution of
   raptors on grouse moors is widespread and limits the range and abundance
   of Hen Harriers (Circus cyaneus), Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus)
   and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). In some circumstances, raptor
   predation can reduce both the breeding density and productivity of Red
   Grouse. Limitation of grouse populations through raptor predation is
   most likely to occur where raptors are at high density because of the
   abundance of alternative prey, and grouse are at low density either
   because of poor management or the cyclic nature of some grouse
   populations. In the long term, habitat management may reduce densities
   of alternative prey, leading to reductions in raptor densities and their
   predation on grouse. More active intervention may be required, however,
   if grouse moors are to remain viable in the short-term. Current research
   is focused on manipulating harrier diet through diversionary feeding.
   Complementary research is needed to investigate methods to reduce raptor
   numbers locally while ensuring their national status.}},

Abstract = {{A previous study comparing the abundance of bird species on organic and
   conventional farm hedgerows in England and Wales found that 8 out of 19
   species showed evidence of significantly higher density on organic
   farms. However, the precise management factors to which birds are
   responding remain unclear; organic farms also differed in field boundary
   structure in a way likely to make them more attractive to many species
   of bird. The data from this study were re-analysed by considering the
   effects of farm management on species abundance at the level of the
   individual hedgerow. All 19 species showed a significantly higher
   abundance on organic farms in at least one season of one year. Several
   species were more likely to occur in larger hedgerows. When controlling
   for hedge structure, 10 species showed reasonable evidence of a
   significantly higher abundance on organic farms, but in many cases, this
   was only in one season. Wren Troglodytes troglodytes, Blackbird Turdus
   merula and Great Tit Parus major showed the most consistent results
   across years and seasons. Only Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella showed a
   significantly higher abundance on conventional farms. Eight species no
   longer showed consistent significantly higher abundance on organic farms
   in these models, indicating that hedgerow management alone is likely to
   be important for a number of bird species. For the other 11 species,
   overall differences in abundance between farm types are likely to be
   caused by management features other than hedge structure, including food
   abundance or interactions between a number of potentially beneficial
   management practices characteristic of organic farming.}},

   the composition of bird assemblages in boreal ecosystems are still
   lacking or are limited to the short-term impacts of clear-cutting. In
   Quebec, where the boreal forest is largely dominated by black spruce
   (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands, we surveyed 140 point-count
   stations in 3 postlogging and 4 postfire development stages determined
   according to the height of the regenerating spruce trees. Species
   richness did not vary among forest development stages, but bird
   abundance was higher in recent clearcuts. Recently disturbed areas were
   characterized by open-land bird assemblages dominated by Neotropical
   migrants, which reached their highest abundance in clearcuts. Moreover,
   logged stands were distinguished from burned sites by the absence of
   cavity-nesting birds. Forest-bird assemblages reestablished themselves
   as soon as young spruces reached the sapling stage. However, the
   Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker
   (Picoides tridactylus), and Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) were
   restricted to mature stands or recent burns and are thus likely to be
   negatively affected by modern forestry, which involves fire suppression
   and short logging rotations. We suggest that retention of larger areas

Abstract = {{Fallow fields represent a large proportion of cereal steppes in southern
   Portugal. A study of the bird populations using fallows in the Castro
   Verde region during the breeding season was made during spring 1996,
   with the objective of characterizing the bird community and describing
   relationships between bird density and vegetation structure, for
   selected species. For each of 50 transects, birds were counted once and
   variables related to vegetation structure were measured. Multivariate
   analyses were used to explore the relationships between bird density and
   habitat characteristics. The bird community of fallows was characterized
   by the numerical abundance of two species - Calandra Lark Melanocorypha
   calandra (8.5 birds/km) and Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax (4.5 birds/km)
   - which represented 60\% of the total number of birds detected. Of the
   28 bird species observed, only four others reached average relative
   densities greater than 1 bird/km: Great Bustard Otis tarda, Cattle Egret
   Bubulcus ibis, Corn Bunting Miliaria calandra and Short-toed Lark
   Calandrella brachydactyla. The variables influencing bird density were
   related mainly to vegetation height, cover by bare ground and presence
   of shrubs. The results suggest that agricultural management practices
   which promote the simultaneous presence of fallouts with different
   habitat characteristics will increase species diversity at the local
   level. The models built were also used to predict changes in bird
   populations as a consequence of changes in grazing intensity and land
   abandonment.}},

Abstract = {{Small mammal and bird assemblages were compared across fence-lines
   between one communal and three adjacent commercial range-lands in
   Namaqualand, South Africa. The communal area has twice the recommended
   stocking rate of sheep and goats, and has less perennial plant cover and
   more annual plants than neighbouring commercial rangelands. Commercial
   rangelands supported a larger and more diverse assemblage of small
   mammals and birds. Small mammal species composition on communal lands
   was a subset of that on adjacent commercial rangelands, with only one
   species equally abundant in both treatments. Diurnal mammals were scarce
   in communal rangelands, apparently due to the lack of cover for predator
   avoidance and herbivory. Management to maintain a diversity of small
   mammals requires a minimum level of effective cover. Bird richness and
   diversity was also reduced on communal rangelands, with many species,
   especially insectivores, less abundant. A few bird species, notably
   granivores, were more abundant on communal rangelands, probably because
   of the increase in annual plant cover. The absence of some large bird
   species regularly found in Namaqualand, but absent from both treatments
   (e.g., bustards), suggests that neither management practice is optimal.

Abstract = {{To more effectively manage remaining native grasslands and declining
   populations of prairie passerine birds, linkages between disturbance
   regimes, vegetation, and bird abundance need to be more fully
   understood. Therefore, we examined bird-habitat relationships on
   mixed-grass prairie at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in
   northwestern North Dakota, where prescribed fire has been used as a
   habitat management tool since the 1970s. We sampled bird abundance on
   upland prairie at 310 point count locations during 1993 and 1994
   breeding seasons. We also measured vegetation structure and composition
   at each location. Complete fire histories were available for each point,
   with over 80\% having been burned one to four times in the previous 15
   years. Post-fire succession generally transformed vegetation structure
   from short, sparse, and grassy with few forbs and low litter immediately
   after fire, to increasing and moderate:amounts of forbs, litter, and
   shrubs two to eight years postfire, to tall, dense, shrubby prairie with
   little forb, grass, or litter understory when fire was absent (>80
   years). Most grassland birds (six of nine species examined) at Lostwood
   NWR were absent from prairie untreated with fire. Species richness and
   abundances of Baird's Sparrows (Ammodramus bairdii), Bobolinks
   (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum), Le
   Conte's Sparrows (A. leconteii), Sprague's Pipits (Anthus spragueii),
   and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) were positively related to
   an index of amount of fire, and these species were absent from unburned
   units. In contrast, Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) and
   Clay-colored Sparrows (Spizella pallida) both reached highest abundance
   on unburned prairie. To provide maximum grassland bird diversity,
   managers of mesic, mixed-grass prairie generally should provide areas
   with short (2-4 year), moderate (5-7 year), and long (8-10 year, or
   more) fire return intervals. Because long-term rest may create habitat
   unfavorable for most species of grassland passerines in mesic, northern
   mixed prairie, periodic defoliations by disturbances such as fire should
   be considered essential to restore and maintain native biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important disturbance that stimulates aspen regeneration and
   expansion in the western United States. We investigated the impacts of
   burning aspen-dominated habitats on landbird community structure in the
   western foothills of the Wind River Range, Wyoming. Habitat structure,
   breeding bird species composition, richness, and relative abundance were
   compared in 1994 and 1995 between six independent pairs of sites, each
   pair consisting of a recently burned aspen site and a control site.
   Burned sites typically had lower canopy cover and depth, greater snag
   densities and aspen regeneration, and less shrub growth. We observed 45
   diurnal woodland bird species overall. Western Wood-Pewees (Contopus
   sordidulus) and Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus) were detected
   significantly less often in the burned sites, while Mountain Bluebirds
   (Sialia currucoides) and Pine Siskins (Carduelis pinus) were detected
   significantly more often in the burned sites. Orange-crowned Warblers
   (Vermivora celata), Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), and
   chickadees (Poecile spp.) were significantly less abundant in the burned
   aspen when burn size or year was factored into the analysis. For many
   other commonly detected species, we had relatively low power to detect
   meaningful differences in abundance between recently burned and unburned
   aspen stands. Bird species richness was similar between treatments. Bird
   species composition differed consistently among burned-control pairs,
   but our data suggested that intersite variability in species composition
   in aspen is the norm in the absence of burning.}},

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{594-606}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Marshes in the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain provide important winter
   habitats for many species of birds. Many of these marshes are managed
   intensively through a combination of fall/winter burning and
   construction of impoundments to improve wintering waterfowl habitat,
   reduce wetland loss, and create emergent wetlands. Little information is
   available on effects of this management on wintering birds, particularly
   passerines. We conducted experimental burns in impounded and unimpounded
   marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwest Louisiana and
   recorded species composition and abundance of birds during the 1996 and
   1997 winters. We found that burning and impoundment influenced
   vegetation structure, which in turn influenced bird abundance and
   species composition. Blackbirds (Icteridae) preferred recently burned
   plots. Sparrows (Emberizidae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) avoided recently
   burned plots but recolonized these plots after one year of vegetation
   recovery. Sparrows and wrens present in burned plots during the first
   winter following burning generally were observed in scattered patches of
   unburned vegetation. Suitability of Chenier Plain marshes as winter
   habitat for several bird species was reduced during the winter in which
   burning was conducted, particularly if a high proportion of the plot was
   burned. We recommend that patchy burns be used, at both the landscape
   level and within specific burned areas, to achieve management objectives
   and still provide suitable winter habitat for non-target species.
   Although many groups of birds depend on Chenier Plain marshes for winter
   habitat, these groups differ in their specific habitat requirements. We
   recommend that a diverse wetland complex (e.g., impoundments managed for
   waterfowl foraging habitat interspersed with those managed for passerine
   winter cover) be maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Within the range of the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), the
   only bird species endemic to Florida, there was a need for a population
   risk assessment that considered the impacts of declining habitat
   availability and declining fire frequency associated with rapid human
   population expansion. We developed a population risk model to examine
   influence of population size, catastrophes (epidemics and hurricanes),
   and habitat management scenarios on Florida scrub-jay populations.
   Extinction risk declined rapidly when initial population sizes increased
   from 20 to 100 breeding pairs. Hurricanes increased extinction risk for
   coastal populations by 10-30\% compared to inland populations. Our
   results suggested that habitat in poor condition was unlikely to support
   a population for more than a few decades. Poor habitat quality
   conditions were common throughout the species' range because of fire
   suppression or inadequate fire management. Habitat management was more
   effective than habitat restoration because population recovery occurred
   slowly after restoration and only if habitat was restored to optimal
   conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed that fecundity and survival of
   experienced breeders without helpers (adult nonbreeders) were the most
   important model parameters. Slow recovery rates occurred because helpers
   were the only rapid source of colonists in restored habitat and because
   an absence of helpers reduced breeder survival and fecundity. Small
   population sizes and habitat degradation make the Florida scrub-jay
   vulnerable to rangewide decline and extinction unless habitat is
   protected, restored, and managed to maintain optimal conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A census of four species of syntopic parrots was carried out using

   the 33 593 ha island is covered by mature and secondary Atlantic
   rainforest. Almost 80\% of these forests are within the Ilhabela Park.
   Although the species counted have marked differences in size and weight,
   density (individuals/km(2)) and estimated population size in 23 500 ha
   of well-preserved forests were similar: Amazona farinosa (13.82 +/-
   5.94; 3247 +/- 1395), Pionus maximiliani (15.79 +/- 7.04; 3712 +/-
   1654), Brotogeris tirica (15.05 +/- 4.87; 3537 +/- 1143) and Pyrrhura
   frontalis (13.06 +/- 5.53; 3068 +/- 1298). Encounter rates of Forpus
   crassirostris and Pionopsitta pileata were very low, which suggests that
   there is only a small population of these species on the island. The Sao
   Sebastiao forests still support healthy populations of parrots. Although
   woodpecker population estimates on the island are large enough to
   provide nesting sites for parrots, competition for holes with other
   secondary cavity nesters such as toucans, flycatchers and tytiras, and
   the selective cutting of dead trees for canoe construction, which is a
   common practice on the island, may limit hole availability for parrots.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{849-863}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A current paradigm in conservation biology is that forest harvest
   practices that better approximate natural disturbance processes are more
   likely to conserve biodiversity. We contrasted bird communities in three
   replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following
   wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were
   chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having greater than
   or equal to 95\% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested
   sites retaining an average of 6\% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For
   all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird
   abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment
   types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five
   major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and
   harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified
   similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities
   occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of
   communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance.
   Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats
   were associated primarily with I-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed
   Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P.
   arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or
   nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in
   avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on
   postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were
   apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete
   convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry
   practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood
   forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper
   (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American
   Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfire than on
   postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder
   Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina),
   Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Redstart (Setophaga
   rutticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted
   Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis),
   and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest
   stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger
   live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest
   designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention
   of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire
   salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of
   standing dead trees on the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{A conflict exists in managed forests between the maintenance of snags
   (standing dead trees) for biological diversity and the requirement to
   remove snags for worker safety. This conflict could be mitigated by the
   identification of safe classes of snags, those with low rates of fall,
   that can be easily identified and retained in forest operations. I
   outline an approach to estimating rates of fall of identifiable decay
   classes of snags based on static life-table analysis of the current age
   distribution and relative abundance of classes of snags in a stand,
   applying the analysis to subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) snags. The two
   most recent classes of snags, identified by the presence of fine
   branches and intact bark, showed fall rates of 0.17-0.20\%/yr, similar
   to or lower than live subalpine fir trees. Fall rates increased to
   0.70\%/yr for the third class of snags, identified by loss of fine
   branches and cracking of bark, and to 3.79\% and 6.16\%/yr for the
   fourth and fifth classes, respectively, identified by increasing loss of
   bark and incipient softening of outer wood. Snags in the two earliest
   classes could be retained during forest operations without substantial
   increase in risk to workers. The static life-table approach to
   estimating fall rates of snags can complement long-term monitoring of
   snags in older forests where the assumption of a stationary age

   model and a data management system. In boreal forests, decaying wood is
   important from the standpoint of biological diversity. Many organisms,
   such as saproxylic beetles and polypores, live in decaying wood. The
   structure of a forest determines which species select it as a habitat,
   because the habitat requirements vary between species. In this study,
   the stand structure includes living and dead trees, their diameter
   distribution by tree species and the stage of decay. Forest management
   strongly modifies stand structure. We used the simulation model to
   investigate the stand structure and databases on the habitat
   requirements of beetle and polypore species to assess the number of
   species in a stand. We tested our system with four management examples
   and compared the results to experimental results. Both our study and the
   experimental results showed that intensive forest management decreases
   the number of large deciduous trees in boreal forests and therefore
   reduces the number of beetle and polypore species. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A rapid development and approval process was employed by Ducks Unlimited
   Canada and other stakeholders to restore a 1246-ha (3079-acre) northern
   prairie wetland in southern Alberta, Canada, with 3640 m(3)/day (800,000
   US gallons) of municipal wastewater and beef processing wastewater. A
   large nongovernmental organization hastened restoration with a
   development process that outlined restoration goals and management
   objectives to satisfy a dual mandate of wastewater treatment and
   wildlife habitat creation. In 1995, after five years of wastewater
   additions, the basins had been refilled and the surrounding uplands had
   been acquired and restored. The Frank Lake Conservation Area currently
   provides high-quality habitat for a variety of wildlife in a region
   where many of the native plants and animals species have been lost due
   to habitat loss and fragmentation. The success of upland and water
   management strategies is reflected in the increase of target species'
   abundance and richness: 50 shorebird species, 44 waterfowl species. 15
   raptor species, and 28 other new bird species have returned to the marsh
   since restoration. As well, significant N and P reduction occurs as
   waters flow through the first basin of the marsh. The management
   strategies of this project that satisfied a dual mandate serve as a
   model to guide managers of other large-scale wetland restoration
   projects.}},

Abstract = {{Public agencies are required to manage for threatened and endangered
   species and for biodiversity. However, at times, management for
   threatened and endangered species precludes consideration of other
   species. We investigated how managing for red-cockaded woodpeckers
   (Picoides borealis) and biodiversity at the Savannah River Site (SRS),
   South Carolina, affected communities of bird species that use
   early-successional scrub habitat thereafter, scrub-successional
   species). Management for red-cockaded woodpeckers at the SRS involved
   both (1) manipulating mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-wiregrass
   (Andropogon spp.) stands via canopy thinning, removal of midstory trees,
   and prescribed bunting; and (2) even-aged timber harvesting. The former
   management practice encouraged red-cockaded woodpeckers to establish new
   colonies in previously unoccupied stands thereafter, ``recruitment{''}
   stands). The latter management practice is used to remove offsite
   planted pines and replant with preferred longleaf pines. We conducted a
   constant-effort mist net study in recruitment and regenerating stands
   (stands clearcut and planted with longleaf pine) during the breeding
   seasons of 1995-96. We hypothesized that the scrub-successional bird
   community in recruitment stands would have greater species richness and
   higher survival and reproductive rates per species than in regenerating
   stands. However, recruitment stands always had fewer scrub-successional
   species (1995: 36 species: 1996: 31 species) than regenerating stands
   (1995: 54 species; 1996: 55 species), and all species that occurred in
   recruitment stands also occurred in regenerating stands. Species which
   commonly occurred in both recruitment and regenerating stands had
   similar adult:juvenile ratios (P > 0.15) and relative proportion of
   adults in breeding condition (P > 0.05). We detected no difference in
   survival rates of Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis). indigo
   buntings (Passerina cyanea), and of ``combined{''} scrub-successional
   birds between stand types (P > 0.05). We found that even-aged forestry
   is an important management practice for maintaining and increasing avian
   biodiversity on public lands, as well as an acceptable management
   practice for red-cockaded woodpeckers.}},

Abstract = {{We optimize the trade-off between economic and ecological concerns in
   conservation biology by using a novel method to link a spatially
   explicit individual-based model to a dynamic programming model. To date,
   few optimality models have been presented to optimize this trade-off,
   especially when the common currency cannot be easily measured in
   dollars. We use a population simulation model (e.g. spatially explicit
   individual-based model) to model a hypothetical forest bird population's
   response to different cutting and planting regimes. We then link these
   results to a dynamic programming model to determine the optimal choice a
   manager should make at each time step to minimize revenue foregone by
   not harvesting timber while maintaining a given population of birds. Our
   results show that if optimal management choices are made further back in
   time, future (terminal) reward may be greater. As the end of the
   management period approaches, past management practices influence the
   terminal reward more than future practices can. Thus if past revenue
   lost is high, the future reward will be low as compared to when past
   revenue lost is low. The general strategy of setting some minimum viable
   population size and then using a population simulator linked to a
   dynamic programming model to ask how to maintain such a population size
   with minimum economic loss should have nearly universal applicability in
   conservation biology. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   burned sites and sis unburned sites. We measured gross habitat features
   in 0.04-ha circles centered on each point count station. We calculated
   productivity estimates at nests of seven of the most common nesting
   species. Habitat components we measured in 1-, 2-, and 3-yr post-burn
   sites were similar, but most components differed between burned and
   unburned sites. Although 98 species were detected during point counts,
   we report only on the 46 species that nested in the area and were
   detected greater than or equal to 10\% of the counts in either habitat
   class. Twenty-one species preferred burned sites and six preferred
   unburned sites. Avian species richness and evenness were similar for
   burned and unburned sites. Burned sites were preferred for nesting over
   unburned sites. Only nine nests of six species were found in unburned
   sites. Productivity; estimates were low in burned sites. One or more
   eggs hatched in only 59 of 187 nests monitored, and an avenge of only
   0.82 chicks per nest were estimated to have fledged. Predation was the
   most common probable cause for nest failure, ranging from 45\% in the
   Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) to 64\% in the Summer Tanager
   (Piranga rubra). Because the sources of predation at the refuge are

Abstract = {{The goals of current management practices in riparian areas in the
   Pacific Northwest include protecting and maintaining habitat for
   terrestrial wildlife. However, little is known about the use of riparian
   buffers by terrestrial wildlife, particularly how buffer width may
   affect abundance and species composition of wildlife communities. In
   this study, I compared bird assemblages in logged and unlogged riparian
   areas along headwater streams and assessed the relations between bird
   abundance and riparian buffer width. The abundances of 4 species of
   forest-associated birds that were more abundant in unlogged than in
   logged headwater riparian stands (Pacific-slope flycatcher {[}Empidonax
   difficilis], brown creeper {[}Certhia americana], chestnut-backed
   chickadee {[}Poecile rufescens], winter wren {[}Troglodytes
   troglodytes]) increased with increasing width of riparian buffers.
   However, 4 other species that also were more abundant in unlogged than
   logged riparian stands (Hammond's flycatcher {[}Empidonax hammondii],
   golden-crowned kinglet {[}Regulus satrapa], varied thrush {[}Ixoreus
   naevius], hermit warbler {[}Dendroica occidentalis]) were rarely
   observed in even the widest buffers sampled (40-70 m on 1 side of the
   stream). Although riparian buffers along headwater streams are not
   expected to support all bird species found in unlogged riparian areas,
   they are likely to provide the most benefit for forest-associated bird
   species if they are >40 m wide, and density of large trees within
   buffers is not reduced by harvesting.}},

   composition differed considerably between buffers and references, and
   also between main stems and tributaries. Density of the more common
   species (those detected >20 times) was significantly higher along main
   stems than along tributaries. Four species (bay-breasted warbler,
   black-throated green warbler, blue jay, Cape May warbler) were more
   abundant along main stems than along tributaries; no species was more
   abundant along tributaries. The overall density of less common species
   was significantly higher in buffer strips than in reference sites, but
   four of the more common species (bap-breasted, blackburnian,
   black-throated green, and Cape May warblers) were more abundant in
   reference sites than in buffer strips. We did not detect differences in
   species diversity or richness among the different site types, but
   edge-species were significantly more common in buffer strips than in
   reference sites. Interior-species, in contrast, were significantly more
   common in reference sites.}},

Abstract = {{Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) is one of several grassland
   bird species that has declined during the last several decades. Although
   several studies have characterized the habitat requirements of breeding
   Henslow's Sparrows, winter habitat requirements for the species remain
   poorly known. The purpose of our study was to identify habitat variables
   associated with occupancy by Henslow's Sparrow on silvicultural lands in
   the core of its winter range in the Gulf Coastal Plain. Forty-one study
   sites were chosen on lands managed for timber production in Baldwin
   County, Alabama. Henslow's Sparrows selected moist sites that occurred
   as pitcher plant bogs or as transition areas between wet pitcher plant
   bogs and drier upland areas. A multiple logistic regression model
   identified the density of the grass Panicum verrucosum and the density
   of pitcher plants as the variables best able to explain the presence of
   Henslow's Sparrows. Sites occupied by Henslow's Sparrows had higher
   herbaceous vegetation densities and had been disturbed by timber harvest
   and/or fire more recently than unoccupied sites. Within occupied sites,
   Henslow's Sparrows chose areas with higher densities of herbaceous
   vegetation, especially P. verrucosum.}},

Abstract = {{In 1994 we began a study of the habitat relations and breeding biology
   of grassland birds in western New York. Most fields contained fewer than
   four grassland species, with Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorous) and
   Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) being the two most common
   species. Species of management concern in the Northeast, such as
   Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) and Upland Sandpiper (Bartramia
   longicauda), were absent from the study area. Bird-habitat models
   generated through Principal Components Analysis and stepwise multiple
   regression indicated that field area, or variables correlated with area,
   explained most of the Variation in overall grassland bird species
   richness (partial r(2) = 0.43) and abundance (partial r(2) = 0.60) and
   in the abundance of Bobolinks and Savannah Sparrows. Grassland birds
   were generally absent from fields smaller than 5 hectares. Areas with
   few shrubs and low horizontal heterogeneity supported more grassland
   bird species than did fields with more shrubs and high horizontal
   heterogeneity, and fields with shorter, less dense vegetation had more
   individuals than did fields with taller, dense vegetation. Few grassland
   birds occurred in fields planted in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum)
   monocultures. More than 90 percent of all known nesting pairs hedged
   young by the end of the first week in July. Nest success was generally
   high; the proportion of nests fledging one or more young was 0.76 for
   Savannah Sparrows, 0.54 for Bobolinks, and 0.67 for Eastern Meadowlarks
   (Sturnella magna).
   Grassland bird populations in this study may benefit from management
   practices that increase held area, control shrub invasion, and encourage
   the growth of grasses other than switchgrass. The current low levels of
   grazing at Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge, with cattle allowed in
   pastures only after 15 July, do not appear to be harmful to grassland
   bird populations.}},

   a stratified sampling method were collected. A distribution model of 5

   landscape factors (habitat heterogeneity, variability, etc.).
   Preliminary results show for one of the 3 regions that spider assemblage
   is most influenced by the type of habitat which is correlated with
   management practices but also with plant species richness. Landscape
   features (heterogeneity, variability) have no significant influence.
   Butterfly assemblage is influenced by both habitat type and landscape
   descriptors. Quality of surrounding habitats and plant species richness

   pre-treatment data in 1995, burned experimental plots in January 1996,
   and collected post-treatment data in 1996. Data were analyzed in a
   randomized, complete-block design with winter-burn and control
   treatments replicated 3 times each within 2 blocks (i.e., herbicide and
   non-herbicide). Relative abundance (P = 0.246) and species richness (P =

   abundance of wintering birds was greater (P = 0.002) in burned
   treatments, but species richness was not different (P = 0.602).
   Prescribed burns on mesquite grasslands had minimal effects on bird

Abstract = {{Empirical studies of the effects of forestry on cavity-nesting birds
   largely neglect weak cavity excavators and instead focus on large,
   strong cavity excavators such as woodpeckers (Picidae). Weak cavity
   nesters tend to be smaller and may be less limited by the availability
   of large trees but more dependent on suitably softened wood. In this
   paper, we describe availability, use, and preference for nesting habitat
   of a small cavity-nesting bird, the red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta
   canadensis), in mature coniferous forest in southeastern British
   Columbia. We describe nesting habitat at 3 spatial scales: (1) the level
   of forest stands proposed for logging (cutblocks), which ranged from 8.1
   to 18.4 ha in size; (2) the level of 0.04-ha patches of forest centered
   on nest trees (nest plots); and (3) the level of individual nest trees.
   In addition to considering basic structural habitat features, we
   analyzed the relation between nesting use and several factors related to
   forest health, including Armillaria root disease (Armillaria ostoyae),
   stemwood decay, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae)
   infestation, and dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.). Red-breasted
   nuthatches nested at higher densities on cutblocks with more dead trees
   (snags) and higher levels of root disease. Within nest plots, we also
   detected a preference for nesting in Armillaria-infected trees. Cavity
   nesting of nuthatches was influenced by both forest structure and the
   disease agents that contribute to it. We recommend that standing
   diseased and dead trees be retained in patches during logging
   operations. Retention of such trees in distinct patches more likely
   satisfies requirements for worker safety and for limiting the spread of
   diseases than does retention of single dead and diseased trees
   throughout cutblocks. Wildlife values not only should be incorporated
   into timber harvesting regulations but also should be considered when
   planning activities designed to improve forest health for timber
   production.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Throughout its geographic range, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus) is rare and appears very similar in its foraging ecology to 2
   broadly sympatric congeners, the three-toed (P. tridactylus) and hairy
   woodpecker (P. villosus). The purposes of our study were to test for
   differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and
   hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the
   importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the
   black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic
   population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and
   black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek
   fire near Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased
   markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained
   high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2
   years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ ha.
   Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately
   to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval
   wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on
   less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark
   beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to
   earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in
   foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology
   of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly
   females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy
   woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than
   males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from
   foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following
   initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts,
   woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986. Our
   results suggest the black-backed woodpecker is extremely specialized in
   its foraging niche, exploiting outbreaks of wood-boring beetles in dying
   conifers for only 2-3 years after fires. Consequently, this species may
   be particularly vulnerable to local and regional extinction as fire
   suppression intensifies and programs of intensive salvage logging are
   pursued following fires.}},

Abstract = {{Because logging has replaced fire as the most extensive and frequent
   disturbance regime in northeastern Minnesota, monitoring bird
   populations and their habitats has become increasingly important. We
   surveyed early-successional forests created by fire or logging for birds
   and their habitat during the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons. We found
   that overall bird species richness and number of individuals
   (territorial males/ha) were higher (P < 0.05) in burned forests than in
   logged forests. The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), house wren
   (Troglodytes aedon), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas),
   clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), song sparrow (Melospiza
   melodia), Lincoln's sparrow (M. lincolnii), and brown-headed cowbird
   (Molothrus ater) were more abundant in burned areas. The Nashville
   warbler (Vermivora ruficapilla), chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica
   pensylvanica), black-throated green warbler (D. virens), and mourning
   warbler (Oporornis agilis) were present in greater numbers in the logged
   areas. We related these differences in bird presence and abundance to
   vegetation differences in the burned and logged habitat types. Burned
   areas had higher densities of dead trees, wider size ranges of dead
   trees, and greater heterogeneity in the shrub layer. Logged areas had
   higher densities of live trees, more live tree species, and wider size
   ranges of live trees. Red maple (Acer rubrum) was the live tree species
   found in greatest abundance in logged areas. If management goals include
   simulating natural disturbances like fire and maintaining bird
   populations, more dead trees should be left within logged habitats and
   the variability among logged areas should be increased.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of drained wetlands may contribute significantly to
   conservation of habitats for wetland birds, and state and federal
   agencies throughout the country rely on restoration and creation of
   wetlands to mitigate habitat losses to development. However, it is
   unclear if restored systems replace the habitat functions of natural
   wetlands, and few direct comparisons of multiple sites have been made.
   Three years after restoration, we compared the relative abundance and
   density of birds using 18 restored wetlands and 8 natural wetlands
   located in northern New York. Birds were classified as wetland
   dependent. wetland associated or nonwetland. Abundances of species and
   of individuals in all 3 groups did not differ (P > 0.05) between
   restored and natural wetlands in any year. Densities of species in all 3
   groups were consistently but not significantly lower at restored sites.
   Densities of individuals in the wetland-associated category and
   nonwetland category were significantly lower at restored sites for the
   first 2 years following restoration. Bird communities were significantly
   less similar between restored and natural sites than among restored
   sites. However, many of these differences may not persist following
   natural successional development of the restored sites. The long-term
   persistence of appropriate plant communities will determine whether or
   not restored sites provide bird habitat comparable to natural wetlands.
   The restoration program successfully increased the amount of bird
   habitat available in the region. However, hectare-for-hectare, the
   restored wetland sites did not replace the habitat functions of natural
   wetlands during the time period of this study.}},

   The potential role of timber plantations}},

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Large areas of the world's tropical forests are being degraded, with a
   consequent loss of species diversity. Only some of these are able to
   recover unaided. Where attempts are being made to restore such forests,
   the scale of the attempts is usually small. Timber plantations are one
   of the few means by which large areas of cleared or degraded landscape
   can be reforested. These usually restore the productive capacity of the
   landscape but do little to recover biological diversity. But a number of
   approaches might be used to redesign such plantations so that they would
   both yield the timber needed to justify the investment and also contain
   some proportion of their former biodiversity. These approaches include
   using indigenous species rather than exotic species, creating species
   mosaics by matching species to particular sites, embedding the
   plantation monocultures in a matrix of intact or restored vegetation,
   using species mixtures rather than monocultures, or encouraging the
   diverse plant understories that can often develop beneath plantations.
   The degree of ecological restoration possible using these alternatives
   ranges from modest to significant, although none is likely to achieve
   complete restoration. Any improvements in regional biodiversity brought
   about by these changes might be seen as being at the expense of
   plantation productivity, But many of these approaches have advantages
   other than just restoring former biodiversity, I discuss some of the
   trade-offs and implications for plantation managers and restorationists.}},

Abstract = {{Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) is widely distributed in the Southwestern
   United States, where it frequently occurs in association with ponderosa
   pine (Pinus ponderosa). Fire suppression and fuelwood harvest likely
   have reduced oak abundance within the pine-oak type. Gambel oak occurs
   in multiple age-related growth forms, from small shrubs to large, old
   trees, and may provide important foraging and nesting habitat for
   breeding birds. I compared attributes of breeding bird communities in 16
   northern Arizona ponderosa pine stands from 1993-1995, that were
   structurally similar except for the presence or absence of Gambel oak.
   Overlap in bird species composition was high; pine and pine-oak stands
   had a mean Jaccard similarity value of 0.67. Five species were unique to
   pine stands, whereas 10 species were largely restricted to or only found
   in pine-oak stands. Overall bird diversity was significantly higher in
   pine-oak stands, which also had more species of Neotropical migrants,
   ground nesters, primary cavity excavators, and secondary cavity users
   than did pine stands. Pine and pine-oak stands had similar species
   evenness and similar rates of annual species turnover. Total bird
   abundance did not differ between cover types; however, primary cavity
   excavators were more abundant in pine-oak stands. Because of the
   apparent positive influence of oak on breeding birds, forest managers
   are encouraged to use treatments that retain and enhance the various
   growth forms of Gambel oak found in pine-oak stands.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the potential of bog ecosystems to recover following peat
   mining, we compared bird species richness, abundance, and assemblages
   and vegetation among naturally revegetated and undisturbed bog sites in
   southeastern Quebec. Based on mining history, we selected 28 sites (12
   natural, 9 abandoned after blockcut extraction, and 7 abandoned after
   vacuum extraction) in 15 bogs. We estimated percent cover for six
   vegetation strata in 106 plots with 100 m radius, on which bird point
   counts were conducted in 1993 and 1996. Vegetation structure differed
   significantly between natural, post-blockcut and post-vacuum sites.
   While vegetation cover was almost complete in natural sites, abandoned
   sites, especially post vacuum, were less vegetated, even after 20 years.
   Bird species richness and abundance were similar in natural and
   post-blockcut sites and both were higher than in post-vacuum sites. Ten
   of the 28 species studied in detail responded to site perturbation.
   Among them, the Palm Warbler was most closely associated with natural
   sites. Bird communities were closely associated with vegetation
   structure. Communities of post-blockcut sites were more similar to those
   of natural bogs than were bird communities of post-vacuum sites. Since
   the blockcut method of peat mining is no longer economically feasible,
   we conclude that bog habitat restoration should be accompanied by a
   preservation ``safety net{''} area to counteract the lasting effect of
   vacuum peat mining on bird species assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{We studied indicators of rangeland health on benchmark sites with long,
   well documented records of protection from stress by domestic livestock
   or histories of environmental stress and vegetation change. We measured
   ecosystem properties (metrics) that were clearly linked to ecosystem
   processes. We focused on conservation of soil and water as key processes
   in healthy ecosystems, and on maintenance of biodiversity and
   productivity as important functions of healthy ecosystems. Measurements
   from which indicators of rangeland health were derived included: sizes
   of unvegetated patches, cover and species composition of perennial
   grasses, cover and species composition of shrubs and herbaceous
   perennials, soil slaking, and abundance and species composition of the
   bird fauna. Indicators that provided an interpretable range of values
   over the gradient from irreversibly degraded sites to healthy sites
   included: bare patch index, cover of long-lived grasses, palatability
   index, and weighted soil surface stability index. Indicators for which
   values above a threshold may serve as an indicator of rangeland health
   include: cover of plant species toxic to livestock, cover of exotic
   species, and cover of increaser species. Several other indicator metrics
   were judged not sensitive nor interpretable. Examples of application of
   rangeland health indicators to evaluate the success of various
   restoration efforts supported the contention that a suite of indicators
   are required to assess rangeland health. Bird species diversity and ant
   species diversity were not related to the status of the sample site and
   were judged inadequate as indicators of maintenance of biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Species composition reflects a combination of environmental and
   historical events at a site; hence, changes in species composition can
   provide a sensitive measure of ecologically relevant changes in the
   environment. Here, we consider the analysis of species composition when
   multiple sites are followed through time.
   Analyses of temporal trends in species composition either summarize
   species composition into a few metrics (indices or axis scores) or
   analyze the similarity among sites. We develop and illustrate the
   similarity approach. Each pair of samples represents a pair of
   replicates, a pair from the same site at different times, a pair from
   different sites at the same time, or an unrelated pair. Differences
   among times can be estimated by comparing average temporal dissimilarity
   to average replicate dissimilarity. Temporal trends can be described by
   one of three statistics that measure progressive change, the correlation
   of temporal dissimilarity with the length of time between samples. These
   methods are illustrated using data on changes in a South Carolina
   zooplankton assemblage following disturbance, and changes in bird
   species composition on Skokholm Island, Wales.
   It is difficult to define and interpret temporal trends. Some
   definitions of interesting trends, like increasing divergence from
   another set of sample plots, place additional requirements on the
   sampling design. Including replicate samples or clustering sample plots
   and including ``control{''} plots for comparison with sentinel sites
   would contribute to an understanding of changes in species composition.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Forest Service plans to restore >40,000 ha of the
   fire-dependent shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)-grassland community on
   the Ouachita National Forest and potentially and >780,000 ha of the
   pine-grassland community throughout the Southeast to benefit the
   endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Concern has
   arisen over impacts of large-scale conversion of closed-canopy forests
   to open pine-grassland woodlands. We evaluated how an ecosystem approach
   to habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected small
   mammals. During 2 winters wee compared small mammal occurrence and
   abundance in untreated pine-hardwood stands to stands following wildlife
   stand improvement (WSI; midstory removal), and With WSI-treated stands
   in the first, second, and third dormant seasons following prescribed
   fire. Total abundance of small mammals was highest in WSI stands and was
   a more direct response to WSI (change in stand structure) than to fire.
   Increased species richness and diversity in the second year of this
   study was strongly related to both WSI and fire. No species was
   adversely affected by WSI or by fire. Rather, WSI and fire-reduced
   midstory, increased dead debris in the understory, promoted herbaceous
   production, and increased woody sprouting. Total community abundance,
   richness, and diversity were lowest in untreated stands. White-footed
   mice (Peromyscus spp.; primarily white-footed mouse {[}P. leucopus])
   were the dominant species, accounting for 68\% of the 611 individuals
   collected. Restoration efforts may be particularly beneficial to
   generalist species such as P, leucopus as well as to more specialized
   species, such as golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli) and fulvous harvest
   mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens) that historically may have depended
   upon pine-grassland habitats. Restoration of pine-grassland communities
   may enhance small mammal communities by reestablishing a landscape
   element that was present during presettlement times.}},

Abstract = {{The native wildlife of Mauritius is highly threatened by a variety of
   influences other than habitat destruction. Protection from habitat
   destruction atone cannot guarantee its conservation and the damage
   already sustained is not fully reversible Therefore, the ideal for
   conservation-maintenance or restoration of self-sustaining populations
   of all species in native ecosystems-is presently unattainable. We
   assessed three long-term strategies for maintaining and increasing
   populations of threatened native birds on the mainland and offshore
   islets of Mauritius, with respect to efficacy, sustainability, and
   side-effects. Rehabilitation of native vegetation on the mainland is
   likely to improve food availability over limited areas, but it can only
   form the basis of a long-term bird conservation strategy when population
   density of introduced animals, especially predators, can he reduced
   sustainably, at low financial cost, and without adversely affecting
   native wildlife. Marooning bird populations on ecologically
   rehabilitated islets can eliminate the predator problem, but they would
   be vulnerable to catastrophes (especially cyclones) and possibly disease
   and much habitat manage ment work is still needed. A third novel
   strategy-enhancement of mainland habitat using exotic plants-allows
   creation of source habitats, greatly reducing the predator threat. It
   also permits larger areas to be managed and at lower cost, than is the
   case with intensive rehabilitation. Habitat management regimes for
   conservation of threatened species or communities must be designed
   specifically to alleviate population-limiting factors. Ln altered
   environments certain exotic plants can be essential to the survival of
   native animal species. The most effective conservation measure must not
   be assumed always to be the rehabilitation of native vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{We reviewed the literature to assess the impact of the Conservation
   Reserve Program (CRP) on bird populations in the central USA. The CRP
   replaced production agriculture fields with grassland habitat used by
   more than 90 species of birds. At least 42 bird species nested in CRP
   habitats. Bird species richness in CRP fields was similar to Chat in
   rowcrop fields, but relative abundance was 1.4 to 10.5 times higher in
   CRP plantings. Nest abundance was 13.5 times higher in CRP than crop
   fields, although nesting success of songbirds was only slightly higher
   in CRP fields (40\% vs. 36\% in crops). Limited evidence suggests that
   the CRP has positively affected the population growth rates of several
   nongame grassland bird species. Waterfowl nest densities and nesting
   success in CRP fields were similar to those occurring in grassland
   habitats managed specifically for waterfowl. The presence of CRP
   grassland has been postulated to have improved the quality of existing
   duck nest habitat by dispersing nests over a larger area. Ring-necked
   pheasant (Phasianus colchicus L.) populations seemingly increased
   substantially with CRP acres. Little evidence of positive population
   response by northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus L.) to the CRP is
   available. Overall, grassland birds known to be declining throughout
   North America were seemingly the most benefitted by the CRP.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation of forested landscapes can reduce the reproductive success
   of birds occupying residual forest patches. Previous studies,however,
   have focused primarily on how nest predation can change when landscapes
   become fragmented by agriculture rather than by logging. To determine if
   predation on artificial nests in forest patches was influenced by the
   surrounding landscape, we placed ground and shrub ness along the edge
   and interior of forest patches located in agricultural, logged,and
   contiguous forest landscapes within a single region of the southern
   boreal mixedwood forest of central Canada. Nest predators were
   identified using remotely triggered cameras and by marks left in
   plasticine eggs, whereas the relative abundance of nest predators such
   as corvids and small mammals was estimated by surveys and live-trapping.
   The percentage of ground nests destroyed at the edge and interior of
   patches in the logged and contiguous forest landscapes was significantly
   lower than the edge or interior of patches in the agricultural
   landscape. No differences in predation rate were observed for shrub
   nests among landscapes. We attributed higher rates of predation in the
   agricultural landscape to higher densities of red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in the interior and a greater diversity of
   predators along edges. The similarity in predation rate between logged
   and contiguous forest landscape suggest that fragmentation caused by
   logging may result in little change in predator communities and in this
   respect, might be similar to fragmentation caused by natural disturbance
   regimes such as fire. In contrast, fragmentation by agriculture seems to
   have more serious consequences for nesting birds. Policy changes that
   limit the growth of agriculture in the southern boreal mixedwood forest
   are required to conserve the diverse avifauna of this region.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In 1989 a wildfire destroyed 300 ha of natural pine forest and
   Mediterranean woodland on Mt. Carmel, Israel. Consequently an
   interdisciplinary scientific effort in fire ecology was initiated in
   order to propose recommendations to the management authorities, Field
   data gathered on soil erosion in the Mt. Carmel site implied that
   erosion is severe only during the first winter after fire, but it does
   not seem to present a significant threat to longterm ecosystem recovery.
   The recovery of the natural vegetation mitigates erosion, and there is
   no special need for any precautions to be taken immediatly following
   fire. Salvage cutting of burned trees had no effect on pine seedling
   recruitment, on vegetation development and on plant species diversity.
   Salvage cutting did affect passerine bird community by slowing down
   succession rate. For successful regeneration of the pine forest the
   burned site need not to be planted, since the number of natural pine
   seedlings is sufficiently great, and there is a need to conserve the
   genetic and spatial variability of the forest. Although thinning has a
   positive effect on short-term pine survival and growth, such action is
   not recommended since pine seedlings are susceptible to pine bast scale
   (Matsococcus josephi) up to seven years, and to severe damage by
   porcupines. Selection caused by this bast scale might improve the
   resistance of the new pine forest stand. Pine seedling growing in
   the:microsites of the old burned pine trees should be treated carefully,
   since some of them, due to their fast development, appear to be the next
   generation of the forest. Thinning of these groups can be considered
   after seven years, accompanied by removal of Cistus dwarf shrubs.
   However, where porcupine damage is observed, thinning should be done at
   low rates and with no pruning of side twigs. Since animal succession is
   a consequence of the change and progress in vegetation structure, there
   is no need for animal resettlement. The concept of ``fuel breaks{''},
   combining a single massive thinning of the woody vegetation and an
   annual short but heavy grazing, is a management option for decreasing
   fire danger and future fire damage.}},

Title = {{Territory distribution and breeding success of skylarks Alauda arvensis
   on organic and intensive farmland in southern England}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1462-1478}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1, Skylark numbers declined by 51\% between 1968 and 1995 on UK lowland
   farmland; a loss of approximately 3 million breeding birds. This study
   examined whether distribution and breeding success of skylarks varied
   with the cropping of organically and intensively managed fields in
   southern England in accordance with the hypothesis that changes in
   agricultural land-use and intensity of management have contributed to
   this decline.
   2, Density was lowest on fields surrounded by tall boundary structures
   or unsuitable habitat, and those with tall, dense vegetation cover.
   After controlling for these effects, set-aside and organically-cropped
   fields supported significantly higher skylark densities throughout the
   breeding season than intensively cropped fields or grazed pasture. Nests
   were usually built in crops between 20 and 50 cm tall. In fast-growing
   broadleaved crops (e.g. oilseed rape, legumes), skylarks held
   territories, but no nesting activity was observed. Rapid crop growth
   probably allows too little time for nesting to begin.
   3. Breeding success was higher on set-aside than on intensively managed
   cereals. Predation caused most nest failures, but did not vary in
   frequency with crop type. Silage cutting and trampling caused many
   failures on grass fields, and all cases of apparent brood starvation
   occurred in cereal fields. These breeding success data, together with
   published estimates of survival rates, suggest that skylark pairs must
   make 2-3 nesting attempts per season in order for populations to be
   self-sustaining. A single crop type rarely provides a suitable
   vegetation structure for nesting throughout the breeding season.
   Skylarks therefore require structurally diverse crop mosaics in order to
   make multiple nesting attempts without territory enlargement or
   abandonment. Mixed farms are more likely to fulfil these requirements
   than those dominated by winter cereals and broad-leaved crops.
   4, These results are consistent with the hypothesis that loss of mixed
   farming and rotational cropping, and concomitant increases in autumn
   sowing of crops, agrochemical inputs, multiple silage cuts and grazing
   intensities since the 1950s have reduced the breeding productivity and
   population density of skylarks on lowland farmland in southern England.
   5, The following recommendations are made for changes in farming systems
   that would assist the conservation of breeding skylark populations on
   lowland farmland. Organic farming systems, set-aside and habitat
   management for gamebirds are all likely to improve nesting and feeding
   conditions for skylarks, More generally, breeding skylark populations
   are only likely to increase on farms that reduce agrochemical inputs,
   reduce grazing intensity and frequency of silage cutting, and increase
   the structural diversity of field vegetation by adopting mixed rotations
   of winter and spring cereals, root crops and grass. Traditional mixed
   farming systems of this kind are now rarely economically desirable. Only
   agricultural policy reforms motivated in part by environmental concerns
   rather than solely by production control are likely to direct subsidy
   support to reduced-intensity, mixed farming enterprises of this kind,
   and thus help to restore populations of breeding skylarks on lowland
   farmland.}},

Abstract = {{I examined the long-term dynamics of wintering and breeding bird
   communities at the Barrens Grouse Habitat Management Area (HAM) in
   central Pennsylvania. I compared community structure (species richness
   and population abundances) among three forested sectors that varied in
   extent of clearcutting and among forested plot types of different age
   since clearcutting from 1993-95 (termed period 2). These results, which
   were obtained six-eight years subsequent to a third cutting cycle, were
   then contrasted to those from a previous study (1988-90, termed period
   1). The Barrens Grouse HMA consisted of three distinct sectors: a
   contiguous uncut stand, a series of uncut strip corridors, and a mosaic
   of small (1 ha) forest patches (plots). I observed 12 wintering bird
   species in period 2; most species (67\%) were trunk-bark foragers. Uncut
   plots were used more often (P < 0.05) by wintering birds than clearcut
   plots, perhaps because uncut plots contained rough-barked trees as
   foraging substrate and more favorable microclimatic conditions. Of the
   40 breeding bird species noted in period 2, most were ground-shrub
   foragers occurring principally in forested corridor and patch sectors.
   Abundances of six ground-shrub foraging species were higher (P < 0.05)
   in the forested parch than in other sectors in period 2; these species
   were found primarily in recent clearcut plots, Abundances of
   sallier-canopy foragers were higher (P < 0.05) than expected in
   contiguous forest and forested corridor sectors in period 2. Species
   richness, abundances of all wintering species combined, and abundances
   of two foraging guilds (trunk-bark and ground-shrub foragers) were
   similar among sectors in periods 1 and 2 in both winter and the breeding
   season. Abundances of three wintering species, however, were greater (P
   < 0.05) in period 2 than in period 1. In contrast to winter, abundances
   of all breeding species combined, sallier-canopy foragers, and five
   species increased I:P < 0.05) between periods, whereas abundance of
   three species declined. Significant changes in abundances of wintering
   and breeding birds between periods at the Barrens Grouse HMA may be
   explained partially by plant succession or regional trends in population
   abundances.}},

Abstract = {{Probability of occurrence of selected avian species was modeled as a

   to test whether (1) exotic and generalist avian species will continue to

   grassland avian species will continue to increase in a low density rural
   population landscape. Landscape cover types were modeled with logistic
   regression based on temporal changes between 1966 and 1990.
   Demographic-economic regression models also were used to predict

   types suggests the continued use of intensive agriculture management
   practices in the high density rural population landscape while extensive

Volume = {{98}},

Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Fire history and stand structure was examined in twelve virgin forest
   stands situated within forest reserves in northern Sweden. The selected
   stands represented fire refuges as well as different successional stages
   after fire. Six of the stands were dominated by Norway spruce (Picea
   abies L. Karat.), three were dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris
   L.), and three were dominated by hairy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) or
   aspen (Populus tremula L.). In 3 of the southernmost stands, the average
   fire interval was 34 to 65 years during the late 1600s to late 1800s,
   but since 1888 no fires had occurred in any of the stands. The absence
   of fire disturbance since 1888 is probably caused by the fire
   suppression in the overall landscape. The standing volume of living
   trees ranged between 87 and 511 m(3) ha(-1) while the volume of dead
   trees, including both snags and logs, ranged between 27 and 201 m(3)
   ha(-1). The volume of dead trees constituted ca. 30\% of the total stem
   volume. In the conifer dominated stands, there was a statistically
   significant relationship between total stem volume, including both
   living and dead trees, and site productivity. A comparison between the
   amount of dead and living trees indicated substantial changes in tree
   species composition in several stands. It is suggested that data on the
   amount of dead trees, especially logs, and its distribution over decay
   classes could be used to examine the continuity of certain tree species.
   All stands had a multi-sized tree diameter distribution, which in most
   cases was similar to a reversed J-shaped distribution. In general spruce
   was numerous in the seedling cohort and in small diameter classes,
   indicating that its proportion in the stands was stable, or was
   increasing at the expense of pioneer tree species such as pine, aspen
   and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.). The most numerous species in
   the seedling cohort, rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.), was almost totally
   missing in the tree layer, indicating a high browsing pressure
   preventing rowan seedlings from growing into trees. The general increase
   of spruce and the sparse regeneration of pioneer species, in the stands
   previously affected by fire, are discussed in relation to natural
   disturbance regimes, biological diversity and nature conservation
   policies. It is proposed that reintroduction of fire disturbance is a
   necessity for future management plans of forest reserves. Other
   management practices to increase species diversity within forest
   reserves are also discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Title = {{Temporal and spatial dynamics of beaver-created patches as influenced by
   management practices in a south-eastern North American landscape}},

Abstract = {{1. Beavers create habitat diversity across catchment landscapes by
   impounding small streams. This increased habitat diversity leads to
   increased species richness of plants and animals in small streams. As
   managers work to balance conflicting management goals (e.g. protection
   of timber and human structures versus maintenance of biological
   diversity) the influence of beaver population management practices on
   habitat availability needs to be assessed. Two questions of initial
   concern are: (i) how do different levels of management influence the
   availability of beaver created habitats and (ii) do relationships
   developed in one region apply to other regions?
   2. To address these questions, historical aerial photography was used to
   determine the extent and rate of impoundment of streams by beavers
   Castor canadensis over a 77 000 ha south-eastern North American
   landscape during a 40-year period of beaver population recovery. Between
   1950 and 1983, beaver populations were protected from trapping and
   hunting. From 1983 to the present, beaver numbers were reduced by fatal
   trapping, to protect roads, railroads and timber. Trapped beavers were
   assigned to specific colonies associated with beaver-created patches in
   the landscape, and growth rates and size after management of individual
   patches receiving different levels of management were compared. Results
   from this study were also compared with previous studies conducted in
   Minnesota, USA.
   3, Growth rate, patch size following management and the composition of
   habitat types within patches were not related to management activity,
   suggesting that the levels of management used in this study did not
   influence the temporal dynamics of beaver-created patches. The extent
   and rate of beaver impoundment on the southeastern Upper Coastal Plain
   of North America was less than that reported from central North American
   landscapes over comparable periods.
   4, These results have the following implications for management: (i)
   management activities should be monitored on a regional basis; (ii)
   conflicting beaver population management goals should be addressed,
   evaluated and balanced; and (iii) beavers do not present a threat to
   flowing-water species in south-eastern North America and need not be
   controlled for this reason.}},

Abstract = {{Bird species diversity and guild composition between the edge (5-10 m
   from the margin) of primary forest abutting grassland and the deep
   interior(> 500 m from the margin) in the Ongoye Forest Reserve were
   compared. Edge and interior sites were chosen that were homogeneous with
   respect to habitat physiognomy i.e. influences of habitat structure and
   complexity were insignificant. There were no statistical differences in
   bird species diversity between the forest edge and interior. However,
   there was significantly greater species turnover at the edge. The
   difference in bird species composition between the forest edge and
   interior was due to various edge-effects: removal of dead wood for
   firewood, soil compaction by cattle, and generally greater levels of
   disturbance. We question the wisdom of the generally applied edge-effect
   principle in the conservation of forest biodiversity. We suggest that
   the principle be applied only once there has been critical appraisal of
   the extent, nature, and effect of an edge and a clear conservation
   objective with regard to forest birds.}},

Abstract = {{Song rate in birds is known to be influenced by the social status and

   Wood Thrushes and Ovenbirds sang more often in blocks of continuous
   forest, while Northern Cardinals sang more often in forest patches.
   Individuals > 50 m from the observer sang more often than closer birds,
   and individuals in higher density populations sang more often than
   individuals at low density sites. The spatial variability in song rate
   was not severe enough to significantly change species-detection rates
   for 5-min song counts, but did significantly affect our population
   density estimates for those species. A key assumption of song count
   censuses, that all individuals of a species sing at comparable rates and

Abstract = {{By late 1985, the population of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides
   borealis) at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, had declined to a
   low of four individuals. Because of extensive timber harvesting prior to
   the 1950s, the older live pine trees that Red-cockaded Woodpeckers
   require for cavity construction were limited. We monitored the response
   of the population to intensive habitat enhancement that included
   construction of artificial cavities, control of cavity competitors, and
   removal of the hardwood mid-story to improve nesting habitat quality.
   Translocations of Red-cockaded `Woodpeckers from on-site and donor
   populations were undertaken to enhance the number of breeding pairs, the
   overall population size, and to minimize potential adverse genetic
   consequences of a small population size. From 1986-1995, we carried out
   54 translocations, installed 305 artificial cavities, and removed 2304
   southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) (a cavity competitor).
   Concomitant intensive population monitoring revealed that the number of
   breeding pairs of woodpeckers increased from 1 to 19 and the overall
   population size grew from 4 to 99 individuals, reflecting the highly
   focused habitat restoration effort. Intensive management has been
   successful in rehabilitating this critically small population of
   endangered birds.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa nebulosa) populations in North America
   have likely been stable over the past 10-100+ yr. Local populations
   fluctuate in response to food supply and/or nest-site availability.
   Breeding Great Gray Owls require preexisting nest structures in forest
   stands that are adjacent to open foraging habitat, preferably with
   hunting perches. Current forestry practices have the potential to affect
   about 75\% of the Great Gray Owls' breeding range in North America.
   Intensive timber management typically removes large diameter and
   deformed nest trees, leaning trees used by juveniles for roosting before
   they can fly and stands with dense canopy closure used by juveniles and
   adults for cover and protection. Modified forest management can,
   however, create new foraging habitat by opening up large, dense forest
   stands. Specific recommended guidelines include restriction of harvest
   unit size (less than or equal to 5-10 ha), but within a mosaic of
   multi-sized units, retention of forest stands within 300 m of known or
   potential nest trees/sites, provision of hunting perches in cut-over
   areas, ensuring irregularly shaped harvest units and maintenance of
   forested travel corridors between cut-over areas. Because Great Gray
   Owls can breed on home ranges up to 800 km apart in successive years,
   integration of local management regimes at a landscape scale is
   recommended. Ideally, spatio-temporal patterns of natural disturbance
   (e.g., fire) should be emulated in a management plan to sustain the
   region's natural biological diversity, including Great Gray Owls when
   appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the avifauna of sun and shade coffee plantations and
   associated mid-elevation habitats during the dry season of 1995. The
   three plantation types (Inga, Gliricidia, and sun) showed high faunistic
   similarities with each other and were both distinct and depauperate
   compared to matorral and forest patch habitats. Of all the coffee
   plantation habitats, Inga shade had the highest diversity. Species
   associated with wooded vegetation were more common in shade plantations,
   particularly in Inga. A second census showed a decline in bird numbers
   that was more pronounced in sun and Gliricidia than in Inga plantations.
   Overall, differences between the plantation types were small and all
   coffee plantations were less diverse than traditional coffee farms
   previously studied in nearby chiapas, Mexico. The relatively low bird
   diversity was probably due to the low stature, low tree species
   diversity, and heavy pruning of the canopy. These features reflect
   management practices that are common throughout Latin America. The most
   common species of birds in all coffee plantation habitats were common
   second-growth or edge species; more specialized forest species were
   almost completely absent from plantations. Furthermore, many common
   matorral species were rare or absent from coffee plantations, even sun
   plantations with which matorral shares a similar superficial structure.
   Coffee plantations probably will only be important for avian diversity
   if a tall, taxonomically and structurally diverse canopy is maintained.
   We suggest that is most likely to occur on farms that are managed for a
   variety of products rather than those designated entirely for the
   production of coffee.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms which prevent gene flow will maintain differentiation between
   species, and therefore contribute to biological diversity. We describe
   an experimental study of such mechanisms in a hybrid zone between the
   fire-bellied toad Bombina bombina and the yellow-bellied toad B.
   variegata. In this system, preference for different breeding habitats
   reduces the frequency of hybridization. A comparison of habitat ecology
   shows that the semi-permanent ponds in which B. bombina usually breeds
   have higher densities of aquatic predators than the temporary puddles
   typically used by B. variegata. We test for behavioural adaptations in
   tadpoles to these different levels of predation. B. bombina tadpoles are
   significantly less active than B. variegata, both before and after the
   introduction of a predator to an experimental arena; this reduces their
   vulnerability as many predators detect prey through movement.
   Behavioural differences translate into differential survival: B.
   variegata suffer higher predation rates in laboratory experiments with
   three main predator types (Triturus sp., Dytiscus larvae, Aeshna
   nymphs). This differential adaptation to predation will help maintain
   preference for alternative breeding habitats, and thus serve as a
   mechanism maintaining the distinctions between the two species.}},

Abstract = {{Threatened and endangered species are a significant component of
   Oregon's flora, comprising 0.2\% to over 15\% of the state's plant taxa,
   depending on one's definition of endangerment. With such a potentially
   large group of plants to conserve, generalizations regarding types of
   rarity and threats to these species would help improve our basic
   understanding and management of them. To evaluate the types of rarity in
   Oregon's threatened and endangered nora, we classified all Oregon
   Natural Heritage Program species (lists 1 and 2) according to geographic
   range (wide vs. narrow), habitat specificity (broad vs, restricted), and
   local population size (large vs. small). This 2x2x2 classification
   results in seven possible forms of rarity (and one type that is common).
   We also listed primary and secondary threats to these rare species and
   identified each plants' habit (annual, biennial, perennial, etc.). The
   distribution of rare plant populations in Oregon appears to be
   positively correlated with the distribution of biological diversity in
   the state, as well as the distribution of individual rare species and
   zones of collecting by botanists. The majority of Oregon's rarities have
   a narrow geographic range, restricted habitat, and small populations.
   There is also a large group of widely distributed species with small
   populations in restricted habitats. As might be expected, taxa with wide
   ranges that occur in several habitats are poorly represented among
   Oregon's threatened and endangered species. Local planning and
   conservation efforts will be important to the survival of local
   rarities, while widely distributed taxa will require the coordination
   and awareness of many land managers. The primary threats to threatened
   and endangered species in Oregon are the following, ranked (from
   greatest to least): livestock grazing, logging, recreation,
   urbanization, agriculture, mining, natural causes, ``other,{''}
   horticultural collection, fire suppression, dams, and scientific
   collection. Herbaceous perennial species form the highest percentage of
   Oregon's rare flora, followed by annuals, shrubs, biennials, and trees.
   The percentage of annual species appears to increase as categories of
   rarity increase from ``endangered in Oregon but more common elsewhere,
   `` to ``endangered everywhere,{''} to ``possibly extirpated.{''}
   Therefore, annuals may be especially vulnerable and understudied. Our
   results support the assertions that rare plants are idiosyncratic and
   management actions, including ecosystem management, should incorporate
   species-specific biological information.}},

   effect attributable to the reduction in area of old forest? Pairs of
   landscape blocks (25 by 25 km) were selected to maximize area difference
   in human-induced disturbance, clear-cut as opposed to semi-natural old
   forest.
   Median distance to natural edge (wetlands, open water) from randomly
   selected points in forest was 250 and 200 m in high and low impact
   landscapes, respectively, indicating a high degree of `natural'
   fragmentation of the pristine boreal landscape in the area. By contrast,
   median distance to clear-cut in uncut forest was 750 and 100 m,
   respectively. Clear-cuts in high impact landscapes were
   disproportionally more common in areas with contiguous forest land than
   in areas with spatially disjunct forest, implicating that forestry
   increases natural fragmentation of the landscape by subdividing larger
   forest tracts.
   Point counts along forestry roads showed that species richness and
   relative abundance of forest birds were higher in landscapes with low
   forestry impact. These differences can partly be explained by
   differences in age composition of forest and composition of tree
   species. After controlling for patch size, forest age and tree species
   composition, a significant effect of forestry impact remained for
   Sibirian species and the Tree pipit Anthus trivialis. Our results thus
   imply that this group of species and the Tree pipit may be sensitive to
   forest fragmentation.
   In contrast to previous Finnish studies, we found relatively small
   negative effects on relative abundance of species hypothesized to be
   negatively affected by large-scale clear-cutting forestry. However, our
   picture of the present does not contradict results from Finnish
   long-term population studies. Five factors may account for this: 1)
   clear-cut areas are not permanently transformed into other land use
   types, 2) planted forests are not completely inhabitable for species
   preferring older forest, 3) the majority of species in the regional pool
   are habitat generalists, 4) the region studied is still extensively
   covered with semi-natural forest, and 5) our study area is relatively
   close to contiguous boreal forest in Russia, a potential source area for
   taiga species.}},

Abstract = {{Very little is known about some key variables that would be involved in
   any sound program to conserve biodiversity in temperate forests. For
   example, the distributions of both species and population diversity are
   almost totally unexplored. How well species diversity in different
   groups is correlated at a local scale is unknown; as a result it is
   unclear whether there are any `indicator groups' that can serve as
   surrogates for overall species diversity when designing specific
   conservation projects. Equally, the areal extent of both Mendelian
   populations and demographic units in forests of various types is
   essentially unknown, as is the frequency of occurrence of
   metapopulations.
   There is thus a need for a geographically and ecologically stratified
   sample of studies evaluating patterns of both species and population
   diversity. That sample should also provide information in other areas
   where much more understanding is required for the formulation of sound
   policies. These include issues of: time-scale (maintenance of
   appropriate successional stages and disturbance regimes, the long-term
   viability of heavily harvested forests or plantations, and rates of
   evolutionary response to global change); edge effects and their
   penetration into forest; `vulnerability', including interactions between
   climatic stress and insect infestation, susceptibility to invasions or
   to extinction cascades, and other subtle effects such as habitat
   dilution.
   Such information is essential to judge how easily management practices
   may be adapted to different forests. It can be used to improve
   `internal' conservation strategies: those based on knowledge of the
   systems to be conserved. There are, however, internal strategies whose
   adoption requires no more scientific information than is available now.
   These include a ban on further timber harvesting in old-growth or
   riparian zones; limited harvests in mature second growth with careful
   monitoring; concentration of exploitation in present plantations; and
   restoration of degraded lands to conservation or plantation status.
   `External' strategies are designed to limit and then to reduce the scale
   of human enterprise to make the internal strategies feasible. While what
   needs to be done there is very clear, how to accomplish it is not.
   In the face of all this ignorance, some priorities are suggested for
   research, and some `common sense' strategies of conservation that can be
   used faute de mieux while awaiting more thorough understanding of
   temperate forest ecosystems. The most important is that conservation
   biologists spend much more time on external strategies.}},

   southeastern Australian eucalypt forests by urbanisation, agriculture

Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{1-3}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation of eucalypt forests has been common in southeastern
   Australia. Urbanisation, agriculture and the establishment of
   plantations of the exotic tree Pinus radiata are major agencies of
   fragmentation. The study of the effects of these agencies on adjacent
   forested land has lacked a suitable framework. By constructing
   generalized trophic-level diagrams for each fragmenting system-farm,
   urban area and pine plantation-the major potential impacts on adjacent
   forested land can be examined. Urban areas, for example, have a
   relatively large non-native predator biomass (especially cats and dogs)
   compared with the original forest, whilst farms support a relatively
   large biomass of exotic herbivores. In pine plantations, by way of
   contrast, the biomass of native or exotic herbivores and predators is
   relatively small. Landscape fires are an integral part of the ecology of
   native eucalypt forests but are kept out of suburban areas, farms with
   improved pastures and standing plantations as much as possible. To
   explore the potential impacts on biodiversity of fire regimes in forests
   at the edges of urban areas, farms and plantations, we constructed and
   sought evidence for, a series of scenarios (each a compound hypothesis).
   Urban interface scenario: `There is a low frequency of unplanned fire in
   forest remnants. To prevent losses of life and property in adjacent
   urban areas, regular frequent prescribed burning is practiced. Regular
   frequent prescribed burning reduces biodiversity'. Support for the first
   two parts of this scenario was strong although the frequency of fires,
   prescribed or unplanned, may be a function of distance from the urban
   edge, the size of management unit and the nature of the fuels. Urban
   predators may be expected to reduce vertebrate biodiversity, especially
   after fires. Agricultural interface scenario: `Clearing for agriculture
   leaves only small forest remnants which become fire free. Fire-free
   fragments eventually decline in plant species biodiversity'. Forest
   fragments in rural areas vary widely in size and occur as roadside
   remnants, farm woodlots, Travelling Stock Reserves, State Forests and
   designated conservation reserves. The circumstances of burning vary
   widely. Grazing from domestic stock, especially combined with fire, may
   negatively affect biodiversity. Absence of fire may also reduce
   biodiversity. Pine interface scenario: `Pines spread from plantations to
   neighbouring forest areas, reducing native plant and animal species
   diversity. This situation can be reversed by a prescribed burning regime
   that has fires intense enough to cause pine death and frequent enough to
   prevent pine seed set'. There was considerable support for this scenario
   although at this stage the spread of pines may be only in areas
   peripheral to plantations. Because fires have effects on biodiversity,
   crops, lives and property in fragmented forests and adjacent areas,
   integrated management-across landuses and jurisdictions-is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of birds and mammals in Paspalum quadrifarium grasslands
   managed with fire, located in Beunos Aires Province, Argentina, was
   performed. Relative abundances of birds and micromammals, their habitat
   relations and fire effects, were studied with the aim of providing
   information for a sustainable management of this ecosystem. The study
   area has a sustainable management of this ecosystem. The study area had
   a patchy structure, constituted by three principal habitats: tall-grass
   (mostly P. quadrifarium), short-grass (Distichlis sp., Botriochloa sp.,
   Stenotaphrum sp., Stipa sp. y Mentha sp.) and marsh (Solanum sp.).
   Thirty five of the 39 bird species registered in these grasslands,
   mainly were found in habitats where p. quadrifarium was predominant.
   Thirteen of these species showed a strong dependence on P. quadrifarium
   for food, refuge and nesting requirements mainly (Spartonica maluroides,
   Asthenes hudsoni, Cranioleuca sulphurifera y Cistothorus platensis).
   Fifteen mammals species were registered. Among micormammals, 3 rodents
   (Oxymyxterus rutilans, Oryzomys flavescens, Akodon azarae) and the small
   opossum Monodelphis dimidiata were the more strongly related to the P.
   quadrifarium grassland. A preliminary account of the effects of grazing
   after fire, in an experimentally burned area, showed an absence of
   micromammal captures and a replacement of bird species linked to P.
   quadrifarium by species that prefer short grasslands (Vanellus
   chilensis, Milvago chimango, Anthus correndera). Finally, we emphasize
   the importance of considering the fauna in the management of this

Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{741-749}},

Abstract = {{Two assumptions underlie the current conservation focus worldwide. The
   first is that democratic governments can restrict human resource use
   within protected areas, and the second is that human land use for
   subsistence leads to degradation and is incompatible with the
   maintenance of high levels of biological diversity. An examination of
   official policy documents over the past century indicates that Gaddi
   borders of Himachal Pradesh, northwestern Indian Himalaya, have used
   political influence to circumvent bureaucratic policies of exclusion and
   that there is an absence of scientific evidence to support the notion
   that Gaddi grazing leads to land degradation. Although grazing intensity
   has profoundly shaped the structure and composition of the Siwalik
   forests (the Gaddi winter grazing grounds), as demonstrated by
   transect-based data presented here, deviations from a supposed
   `'climax'' community need not constitute degradation. A growing rather
   than declining cattle population attests to the regenerative capacities
   of these forest. Within the alpine meadows graced by the Gaddi in
   summer, mean plant species richness increased along transects
   originating at border camps and extending 250 m north of herder camp
   site. Intense grazing pressure or heavy manuring by livestock bedded at
   night are likely to be responsible for the observed low species
   diversity adjacent to the campsite, but the effect is insignificant at
   the level of the overall landscape. interviews with herders also suggest
   the presence of a sizable, though hunted, mammalian fauna in these high
   altitude meadows. Recognition of the difficulties associated with
   implementing restrictive policies, and the fact that human land-sue
   practices need not lead to degradation or to a decline in biological
   diversity, should lead to more inclusive conservation policies within
   protected areas as well as an expansion of the conservation focus beyond
   protected-area boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Bird use of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and row-crop fields was

   bird species were recorded in CRP fields and 34 in row-crop fields. The
   most abundant species in both habitats was the red-winged blackbird
   (Agelaius phoeniceus), accounting for 35\% of all birds in CRP and 24\%
   in row-crop fields. The dickcissel (Spiza americana), grasshopper
   sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus),
   common yellowthroat (Geothypis trichas), brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus
   ater), savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and ring-necked

   abundant species in row-crop fields.
   Nests of 16 bird species were found in CRP fields, with red-winged
   blackbirds accounting for 48\% of all nests found. The vesper sparrow
   and horned lark were the only species nesting in row-crop fields. The
   major cause of nest loss for all species was predation, accounting for

   red-winged blackbird and dickcissel nests, respectively.
   The Conservation Reserve Program has likely contributed to an increase

   row-crop habitat that it replaced has lower bird abundance and supports
   fewer nesting species. The vegetation structure and composition of CRP

   Integrating habitat for wildlife}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL \& ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{93-113}},
Abstract = {{Industrialized agriculture currently substitutes many of the ecological
   functions of soil micro-organisms, macroinvertebrates, wild plants, and
   vertebrate animals with high cost inputs of pesticides and fertilizers.
   Enhanced biological diversity potentially offers agricultural producers
   a means of reducing the cost of their production. Conservation of
   biodiversity in agricultural landscapes may be greatly enhanced by the
   adoption of certain crop management practices, such as reduced pesticide
   usage or measures to prevent soil erosion. Still, the vast monocultures
   comprising the crop area in many Canadian agricultural landscapes are
   often of limited conservation value, thus the inclusion of appropriate
   wildlife habitat in and around arable lands is a fundamental
   prerequisite for the integration of wild species within agricultural
   landscapes. This review of current literature considers the potential
   for non-crop areas within agricultural landscapes to be reservoirs of
   agronomically beneficial organisms including plants, invertebrates, and
   vertebrate species. Non-crop habitats adjacent to crop land have been
   identified as significant for the maintenance of plant species
   diversify, for the conservation of beneficial pollinating and predatory
   insects, and as essential habitat for birds. A key component for
   enhancement of biodiversity is the reintroduction of landscape
   heterogeneity by (1) protection and enhancement of key non-crop areas,
   (2) smaller fields and farms, and (3) a greater mixture of crops,
   through rotation, intercropping and regional diversification. The
   benefits of increased biodiversity within arable lands are reviewed for
   various species groups. In the Canadian. context, any serious attempt to
   derive significant agronomic benefit from increased biodiversity will
   require considerable changes in the agricultural programs and policies
   which shape mainstream industrialized agriculture. The problems of crop
   depredation by vertebrate species, weed and insect competition, which
   still represent significant impediments to the creation and proper
   management of wildlife habitat, are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The results of the monitoring of woodpecker abundance on the island of

   mainland Finland in the case of the Grey-headed Woodpecker Picus canus

   Dendrocopos minor correlated positively with mean January and February

Abstract = {{Much of the original hardwood bottomland in the Mississippi Alluvial
   Valley is converted to crop lands. Land management agencies began
   restoring hardwood bottomland because of its importance to wildlife. To
   provide an initial evaluation of progress toward restoration, we used
   point counts to compare bird communities among plantations of 0 to 4, 7
   to 15, and 21 to 27 years in age with natural sawtimber stands (>50
   years in age) in the southern Delta region of Mississippi in 1994 and
   1995. Mean number of species per point (species richness) increased with
   stand age (P < 0.05). Mean total abundance did not differ among age
   classes. Relative to bird communities of natural sawtimber forest at
   Yazoo National Wildlife Refuge and Delta National Forest, respectively,
   Morisita's index of similarity was 85.4\% and 74.3\% for 21- to
   27-year-old plantations, 41.9\% and 35.0\% for 7- to 15-year-old
   plantations and 4.6\% and 2.6\% for 0- to 4-year-old plantations.
   Plantations in the 21- to 22- and 7- to 15-year-old age classes
   supported a substantial portion of the potential forest bird community,
   but still lacked area-sensitive and certain late-successional species.
   Plantations in the youngest age class were dominated by 2 abundant
   species, red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) and dickcissel
   (Spiza americana). Nevertheless, young plantations provide temporary
   habitat for regionally declining grassland bird species. Management
   prescription that mimic natural succession such as mixed plantings or
   thinning might enhance the restoration effort and promote earlier
   colonization by mature forest birds.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of ecosystem restoration is gaining momentum in western
   Europe. This is necessary because in most managed nature reserves one or
   more of the following processes, which are analogous to those that have
   led to the dramatic loss of biological diversity in Europe, are still
   operating: continuing nutrient output, continuing high level of
   disturbance and fixing the system in some successional stage. This is
   partly because most management activities have been derived from, or
   copy, former agricultural practices. The study of natural ecosystems has
   revealed the key role large herbivores have in maintaining structural
   diversity in the vegetation and so biological diversity. Because of this
   they have been used as tools in achieving a variety of conservation
   goals. Here, various effects large herbivores can have on plant species
   composition, structural diversity of the vegetation and fauna are
   briefly reviewed. Attention is given to pasture-woodlands in southern
   Europe, which often have a relatively high biological diversity and
   share some key features with natural ecosystems: very low nutrient
   input, extensive prating with large herbivores and the presence of
   natural tree cover. In a number of European countries attempts are being
   made to restore normal functioning multi-(herbivore) species ecosystems.

Abstract = {{Boreal plant communities are strongly nutrient limited, and the animals
   of the boreal forest may therefore experience bottom-up nutrient
   limitation. We conducted a 5-year experimental study of the impact of
   aerial nitrogen fertilization on birds of the boreal forest near Kluane
   Lake, southwestern Yukon, to test for such bottom-up effects.
   Specifically, we tested if avian abundance and species richness
   increased after fertilization. Variable circular-plot point counts were
   made to estimate bird numbers and species richness each summer from 1988
   to 1992. Fertilization had no effect on abundance for the first two
   summers, but total abundances of the seven commonest passerine bird
   species increased by an average of 46\% over the final 3 years.
   Fertilization had no effect on bird species richness. Population
   densities and species richness were both low at Kluane compared with
   patterns seen in temperate forest. Yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica
   coronata), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyernalis), and Swainson's thrushes

Abstract = {{With the exception of the tropics, nowhere has the relationship between
   resource management and conservation of biological diversity been more
   controversial than in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.
   Widespread loss and fragmentation of old-growth ecosystems have
   stimulated critical review and revision of existing forest management
   policies. However, studies of the consequences of forest management for
   plant species diversity are sorely lacking. We present data from
   permanent-plot and chronosequence studies in managed and unmanaged
   forests of western Oregon and Washington to describe the early responses
   of understory communities to forest harvest, and to suggest how
   post-harvest practices that alter natural successional processes may
   influence longterm patterns of diversity and species occurrence.
   Permanent-plot studies of early succession in old-growth Pseudotsuga
   forests suggest that changes in understory diversity are fairly
   short-lived following clear-cut logging and slash burning. Populations
   of most vascular plant species recover to original levels prior to
   canopy closure. However, diversity may remain depressed for more than
   two decades on severely burned sites, and some species may experience
   local extinction. Evidence of the effects of post-harvest practices on
   vascular plant diversity is limited by an absence of community-level
   studies in older, managed forests.
   Chronosequence studies of natural forest stands indicate that, following
   canopy closure, vascular plant species diversity tends to increase with
   time, peaking in old growth. Few understory species are restricted to,
   or absent from, any stage of stand development (i.e., young, mature, or
   old growth). However many species differ significantly in their
   abundance among stages. A majority of these showed greatest abundance in
   old growth. Changes in levels of resources (increased shade), changes in
   the spatial variability of resources and environments (increased
   horizontal and vertical heterogeneity), and species' sensitivity to fire
   and slow rates of reestablishment/growth may drive these trends during
   natural stand development.
   Silvicultural prescriptions that maintain or foster spatial and temporal
   diversity of resources and environments will be most effective in
   maintaining plant species diversity. Practices associated with
   intensive, short-rotation plantation forestry, that preclude or de:ay
   the development of old-growth attributes, may result in long-term loss
   of diversity. Ultimately, it may be necessary to manage some stands on
   long rotations (150-300 yr) Co maintain understory species that require
   long periods to recover from disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{During the two breeding seasons immediately following the numerous and
   widespread fires of 1988, I estimated bird community composition in each
   of 34 burned-forest sites in western Montana and northern Wyoming. I
   detected an average of 45 species per site and a total of 87 species in
   the sites combined. A compilation of these data with bird-count data
   from more than 200 additional studies conducted across 15 major
   vegetation cover types in the northern Rocky mountain region showed that
   15 bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire
   communities than in any other major cover type occurring in the northern
   Rockies. One bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus)
   seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing
   dead forests created by stand-replacement fires. Bird communities in
   recently burned forests are different in composition from those that
   characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including
   early-successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding
   guilds are especially abundant therein; woodpeckers, flycatchers, and
   seedeaters. Standing, fire-killed trees provided nest sites for nearly
   two-thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites.
   Broken-top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for
   cavity-nesting species significantly more often than expected on the
   basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the
   broken-top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest
   conditions prior to a fire (especially for presence of snags) may be
   important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity-nesting
   birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or
   relatively restricted to burned forests, stand-replacement fires may be
   necessary for long-term maintenance of their populations. Unfortunately,
   the current fire policy of public land-management agencies does not
   encourage maintenance of stand-replacement fire regimes, which may be
   necessary for the creation of conditions needed by the most
   fire-dependent bird species. In addition, salvage cutting may reduce the
   suitability of burned-forest habitat for birds by removing the most
   important element-standing, fire-killed trees-needed for feeding,
   nesting, or both by the majority of bird species that used burned
   forests.}},

Abstract = {{Diversity of passerine birds and mammals was estimated in well-drained
   areas located at proximity of the hydroelectric reservoir La Grande-3,
   where natural fire regime still prevails in the absence of forest
   exploitation. Forest stands were divided up into four post-fire stages:
   (i) recent burns (4 years old), (ii) shrubs (25 years old), (iii) young
   forests (50 years old), and (iv) mature forests (greater than or equal
   to 71 years old). Richness and species diversity were highest in middle
   stages, in shrubs and young forests. The degree of opening seems to have
   affected more the composition of bird communities than stand age. Some
   bird species, typical of shrub stands, in particular white-crowned
   sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys Forster), Lincoln's sparrow (Melospiza
   lincolnii Audubon), and alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum Brewster),
   appeared after the falling bf dead trees, approximate to 15 years after
   fire, and disappeared progressively as forests matured. Deer mice
   (Peromyscus maniculatus Wagner), moose (Alces alces L.), and black bears
   (Ursus americanus Pallas) were more common at the beginning of
   succession, whereas northern red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi
   Vigors) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus L.) were typical of late stages.
   Mammal presence was mostly associated to their feeding requirements.
   Fire creates a mosaic of forest stands through periodic killing of trees
   in the north of the boreal forest, which contributes to maintain
   regional wildlife diversity; its suppression would reduce biodiversity.}},

   richness than young forests, which in turn had greater richness than
   mature forests. Twenty-seven, 3, and 10 bird species had their highest

   species that nest and forage in canopy gaps and three bird species that

Abstract = {{We examined nest-site and nest-cavity characteristics for six species of
   cavity-nesting birds in montane riparian and snowpocket aspen (Populus
   tremuloides) woodlands in the northwestern Great Basin. Live trees and
   snags with DBH >24 cm were favored as nest sites by all species.
   Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis) and Northern Flickers
   (Colaptes auratus) provided different sizes of nest cavities for a suite
   of nonexcavator species. Flickers preferentially nested in snags;
   sapsuckers nested primarily in live trees, but used live trees and snags
   in proportion to their availabilities. Relative abundances of excavators
   and nonexcavators were associated positively with numbers of cavities.
   Nest-site variables overlapped extensively among species; Tree Swallows
   (Tachycineta bicolor) relied heavily on sapsuckers for provision of nest
   cavities, European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and Mountain Bluebirds
   (Sialia currucoides) primarily used flicker-excavated cavities, and
   House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) used nest cavities across the broadest
   range of nest-site characteristics. Compass orientation of nest-cavity
   entrances was strongly bimodal, with most facing east or southwest.
   Cavity entrances of species that foraged largely outside of riparian
   woodlands were oriented toward woodland edge, in contrast to nest
   cavities used by species that foraged largely within riparian woodlands.
   Snowpocket woodlands were much more extensive than riparian aspen, but
   birds strongly preferred riparian aspen stands as nesting habitats,
   presumably due to the scarcity of large aspen in snowpockets. Nest
   cavities appear to be a limiting resource with high potential for
   interspecific nest-site competition in these woodlands. Decades of
   livestock overuse and fire suppression have greatly diminished the
   availability of large aspen in riparian habitats throughout the region.}},

   California Vegetation Type Map (VTM) Survey. By using the same sampling
   methods, we documented changes-over approximately 60 years and during a
   period of fire suppression management-in tree density by both species
   and size class. In general we found increasing stand densities, a
   transformation from old-growth age structure to young growth, and a
   compositional shift from Pinus ponderosa and P. jeffreyi to Abies
   concolor and Calocedrus decurrens. Density of trees of more than 12 cm
   diameter at breast height (dbb) increased by 79\%, including three to
   ten-fold increases in the youngest cohorts 12-66 cm dbh. The magnitude
   of change depended upon initial forest composition and local annual
   precipitation. Monotypic stands of P. jeffreyi or those initially
   dominated by Abies concolor showed the least change in species
   composition; the most xeric stands of P. jeffreyi showed the least gain
   in density and mesic mixed P. ponderosa stands showed the most dramatic
   change in composition and density. We compared these data to records of
   past and present forests in the Sierra Nevada and found parallel trends
   but magnified by the increased precipitation of the Sierra Nevada. We
   also compared VTM data from the San Bernar dino Mountains to mixed
   conifer forests in the Sierra San Pedro Martir of Baja California. These
   Mexican sites and forests are ecologically similar to those in
   California but they still experience unmanaged fire regimes. Californian
   forests of 60 years ago are remarkably similar to modern forests in the
   Sierra San Pedro Martir. Thus, we conclude that forest changes in the
   San Bernardino Mountains are primarily due to lengthening fire
   intervals. Forest changes as a result of fire suppression have important
   conservation consequences for bird species diversity in general and for
   Spotted Owl and Neotropical migrants in particular.}},

Abstract = {{Human-caused fragmentation of forests is increasing, yet the
   consequences of these landscape changes to vertebrate communities are
   poorly understood. Although bird community response to forest
   fragmentation caused by agricultural or urban development has been well
   studied, we have little understanding of these dynamics in landscapes
   undergoing intensive forest management, where late-seral forest stands
   are separated by younger forest stands of varying ages and are part of a
   spatially and temporally dynamic forest landscape.
   We investigated the relationship between landscape structure and
   breeding bird abundance in the central Oregon Coast Range. We sampled
   vegetation and birds in 30 landscapes (250-300 ha) distributed equally
   among three basins. Landscapes represented a range in structure based on
   the proportion of the landscape in a late-seral forest condition and the
   spatial configuration of that forest condition within the landscape. We
   computed a variety of landscape metrics from digital vegetation cover
   maps for each landscape. Using analysis of variance and regression
   procedures, we quantified the independent effects of habitat area and
   configuration on 15 bird species associated with late-seral forest.
   Species varied dramatically in the strength and nature of the
   relationship between abundance and several gradients in habitat area and
   configuration at the landscape scale. Landscape structure (composition
   and configuration) typically explained <50\% of the variation in each
   species' abundance among the landscapes. Species' abundances were
   generally greater in the more heterogenous landscapes; that is, they
   were associated with the more fragmented distribution of habitat. Only
   Winter Wrens showed evidence of association with the least fragmented
   landscapes.
   These results must be interpreted within the scope and limitations of
   our study. In particular, the scale of our analysis was constrained by
   the lower and upper limits of resolution in our landscapes, as set by
   minimum patch size and landscape extent, respectively. Thus, our results
   do not preclude much stronger and different relationships at finer
   and/or coarser scales. In addition, our community-centered habitat
   classification scheme and artificially discrete representation of patch
   boundaries may not have captured the functionally meaningful
   heterogeneity for each species. Finally, our analysis was limited to
   relatively common and widespread diurnal breeding bird species. Species
   sensitive to habitat fragmentation at the scale of our analysis may have
   been rare already and therefore not subject to the parametrical
   statistical approach that we employed.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that similar bird assemblages will occur in
   like-structured habitat that results from both clearcutting and
   high-intensity wildfire followed by salvage logging. To test this, we
   compared bird communities of sand pine scrub in mature forest and three
   disturbance treatments (1) high-intensity wildfire, salvage logged, and
   naturally regenerated, (2) clearcut, roller chopped, and broadcast
   seeded, and (3) clearcut and bracke-seeded. We analyzed communities
   based on residency status and nesting guilds. Migatory breeding birds
   were nearly restricted to mature forest. Bird communities of mature
   forest were significantly more species rich and diverse than those of
   disturbance treatments in spring. However, species richness and
   diversity of migratory winter residents did not differ among treatments,
   indicating that they are habitat-structure generalists on their
   wintering grounds. Canopy- and cavity-nesters and canopy- and
   bark-foraging species were virtually restricted to mature forest. Most
   species recorded in mature sand pine forest or disturbance treatments
   were either habitat-structure generalists or also occurred in other
   similarly structured vegetation types. However, the threatened and
   endemic Florida Scrub Jay (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) occurred only in
   disturbance treatments (no differences). Silvicultural disturbance
   appears to mimic the natural high-intensity disturbance regime by
   creating habitat structural features required by open scrub species and
   may be an important habitat management tool where the use of wildfire is
   impractical. However, long-term effects, unsalvaged burns, and landscape
   patterns created by clearcutting were not addressed and may also be
   important in structuring bird communities of sand pine scrub.}},

   traditional and innovative land management practices, primarily for
   waterfowl. Ecosystem monitoring, however, will be aimed primarily at
   documenting the response of vegetation, neotropical birds, small
   mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish-to-game management practices.
   Monitoring will involve the use of Sherman live traps, drift fence
   arrays, point counts, point intercept transects, bag seines, and trammel
   nets. To date, 22 small mammal species, 301 bird species, 43 reptile and
   amphibian species, and 53 fish species have been documented. Monitoring

Abstract = {{Riparian forests are important for maintaining vertebrate species
   richness in the southwestern United States, but they have become
   restricted in distribution due to both historical and current management
   practices. In order to counteract continued loss of this habitat,
   several mitigation programs were developed in the middle Rio Grande
   Valley of New Mexico. Three areas ranging from 50 to 140 ha were
   revegated with native trees using pole planting and cattle exclosures,
   and changes in vegetation structure were quantified after 2, 3, and 5
   years of growth. As expected, the older site contained the most
   heterogeneous mix of plant species and the greatest structural
   diversity. We compared year-round avian use of the revegetated sites
   with a mature cottonwood forest site of approximately 30 years of age.
   As the revegetated sites matured and salient habitat features changed,
   the population dynamics of individual avian species and patterns of
   guild structure varied. The older revegetated sites showed a greater
   similarity to the mature cottonwood site, suggesting that reclamation
   efforts established quality riparian habitats for birds in as little as
   5 years. The revegetated sites appeared especially important for
   neotropical-migrant birds. We suggest that a mosaic of riparian
   woodlands containing mixtures of native tree and shrub species of
   different size classes is necessary to maintain avian species richness
   in the middle Rio Grande drainage, and probably throughout the
   southwestern United States.

Abstract = {{A search of 4600 ha of the McCurtain County Wilderness Area (MCWA),
   Oklahoma, in 1989-1990 yielded 15 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers
   (Picoides borealis).  The number of groups and number of individuals in
   a 3795-ha area that was surveyed in 1977 and 1989-1990 declined by 62\%
   and 75\%, respectively.  The productivity of the population was low
   during 1989-1990; 0.69 young were fledged per nesting attempt.  To
   assess the adequacy of foraging habitat, forest structure was measured
   in an area with a high density of groups (1.95/km2) in 1990 and in an
   area where the group density had declined from 2.92 groups/km2 in 1977
   to 0.74 groups/km2 in 1990.  Forest structure in both areas was adequate
   but approached the limits recommended in the Red-cockaded Woodpecker
   Recovery Plan.  To determine if isolation of groups was related to
   population decline, we estimated nearest neighbor distances from cluster
   locations (a cluster is the cavity trees used by a group of woodpeckers)
   in 1977 and 1990.  Cluster sites had longer nearest neighbor distances
   in 1977 than in 1990, which may indicate that isolation by distance
   reduces the influx of dispersing breeders from elsewhere in the
   population.  Periodic fires occur naturally in the MCWA but have been
   suppressed since 1926.  Re-establishment of a fire regime is important
   in maintaining the integrity of the MCWA and may be beneficial to its
   red-cockaded woodpecker population.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation and restoration ecology efforts may conserve or restore a
   particular image of a community, a variety of plausible images, or
   maximum biological diversity.  The choice is a policy decision that
   should reflect relevant history and sound science.  Here I argue that
   common methods of conserving and restoring tallgrass prairie have a weak
   scientific rationale, are not consistent with plausible history, and
   threaten prairie biodiversity.  Dormant-season burns and grazer
   exclusion are human interventions that may promote artificially
   consistent dominance of large grasses utilizing the C4 photosynthetic
   pathway, thereby relegating hundreds of other prairie plants to small
   populations that are vulnerable to local extinction.  I recommend an
   experimental approach to large remnant conservation and restoration in
   which varied conditions alter dominance, thereby increasing short-term
   species richness.  I also recommend prescribed burning during the

   grazing by different ungulates, to simulate historical grazing history. 
   Both should favor plants that are consistently infrequent or rare in
   many managed prairies.  Varied regimes of burn season, burn interval,
   and large-mammal grazing should promote greater overall species

Abstract = {{Cape fynbos communities are species-rich but apparently include many
   species with similar growth forms. Many of these species may be
   functional analogues with similar pathways for nutrient and water
   cycling, and carbon flux. This apparent functional redundancy suggests
   that the extinction of some analogues should have little impact on
   ecosystem-level processes. Much of the biological diversity in fynbos is
   associated with postfire regeneration traits which facilitate
   competition for space. Lottery and regeneration niche models can explain
   the coexistence of functionally analagous proteoid and ericoid shrubs.
   The diversity of regeneration traits within functional types provides a
   `backup' in the event of fire-related stochastic population
   fluctuations. This ensures long-term stability of community structure,
   possibly maintaining functional diversity and ecosystem processes.
   Research to test hypotheses on the relationships between species
   diversify and ecosystem processes in fynbos communities may lack a
   tractable protocol; some directions are, however, given.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive rowcrop farming in the Midwest has eliminated much wildlife
   grassland habitat; yet some linear habitat remains in areas such as
   roadsides. To determine the importance of roadsides to nesting birds in
   intensively farmed areas, this study evaluated nest densities and
   nesting success of birds in roadsides in central Iowa during 1990 and
   1991. One hundred and twenty nests of eight species were found in 34
   roadsides (10.2 ha). Red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) nest
   density was greatest in roadsides with tall dense vegetation; vesper
   sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) nests were most dense in areas of sparse
   vegetation. Gray partridge (Perdix perdix) and ring-necked pheasant
   (Phasianus colchicus) nest densities were greatest in roadsides with the
   most residue cover. Red-winged blackbirds usually placed their nests in
   the bottom or in the fencerow of a roadside; all vesper sparrows nested
   in the short vegetation of the roadside nearest the road. Daily survival
   rates for the red-winged blackbird and for all species combined were
   0.9471 and 0.9428, respectively. Fifty-five percent of red-wing nests
   and 52\% of the nests of all species were destroyed by predation.
   Red-wing nests placed in forbs, shrubs and the fence were more
   successful than those built in grasses other than reed canarygrass
   (Phalaris arundinace). Roadside management which includes seeding native
   grasses and forbs in roadsides may make these areas more attractive to
   birds that use such habitats for nesting. Fences were used by some birds
   in place of vegetation for nest support and should be retained in
   roadsides. Periodic prescribed burns in roadsides would increase the
   vigor and structural heterogeneity of roadside vegetation; mowing
   roadsides should be discouraged except at the roadside shoulder.}},

Abstract = {{The urgent need to integrate evolutionary theory into applied habitat
   management and land-use planning endeavors has become a focus for much
   conservation and biodiversity related research. Only recently have
   scientists begun to incorporate a holistic ecosystem approach, focusing
   on relationships among plant and animal resources rather than on
   individual species, into their management philosophies. Swept up in
   these emerging efforts to sustain biological diversity and functional
   ecosystems, genetic concepts have been incorporated into habitat
   management with an alarming mixture of excellence, generalization, and
   unfortunately even misconception. This does not imply that evolutionary
   theory has no bearing on the applied sciences but rather that more
   attention must be given to the interface between theoretical and applied
   research. The need to integrate genetic theory into ongoing conservation
   and management efforts is clear; however, much controversy remains as to
   how this integration may be accomplished for individual management
   situations. For vertebrates, the transfer of genetic information between
   generations or within and among various breeding components of
   populations is inextricably linked to the ecosystem in which they exist.
   Changes in the structure of an ecosystem can and must influence the
   ecology of its component species to some extent. However, genetic
   consequences resulting from changes in the ecology of species or species
   complexes are not clearly understood. Undoubtedly, alterations in the
   transfer and conservation of genetic information occur concomitantly
   with large-scale changes in the landscape. It is likely that these small
   undetected changes at the genetic level impact species to a similar
   extent as larger more obvious landscape level factors. In this work we
   will discuss concepts that are integral to the long-term existence of
   organisms in managed landscapes and to maintenance of gene diversity in
   general. Specifically, we will focus on the concept of effective
   population size, confusion associated with this concept, and its
   applicability to the maintenance of biologically diverse and sustainable
   landscapes.}},

Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{55-60}},
Abstract = {{Herrera (1978) found an inverse relationship between relative densities
   of resident and migrant passerines in European breeding bird
   assemblages. He hypothesized that the decreasing proportion of migrants
   to the south would be due to interspecific competition with residents.
   The putative competition between resident titmice (Parus montanus and P.
   major) and migrant conguilders (Fringilla coelebs and Phylloscopus
   trochilus) was tested by a playback experiment in northern Finland. If
   competition was important between individual birds, it could reduce
   overlap between territories. The spatial configuration of the two
   migrant species was studied in relation to the nests of the two
   residents during the breeding season in late May - early June, in 1989
   and 1990. The experiment was carried out at 13 (year 1989) and 17 (year
   1990) tit-nest plots. To control habitat effects, the tape was also
   played at control plots where the tit pair had bred in the previous year
   and at randomly chosen plots. The data were analysed using log-linear
   models, which test for dependencies between categorical variables. In
   1990, there were far fewer positive responses at the study points than
   in 1989, possibly due to changes in the population densities of the
   migrants. We found that migrants did not avoid settlement near or in
   resident territories. There was a tendency that migrants aggregated more
   at the vicinity of tit-nests compared with the random- and control
   plots. This result is consistent with the `heterospecific attraction'
   hypothesis generated by Monkkonen et al. (1990).}},

Abstract = {{The area of salt marshes does no longer increase. The recent erosion
   coincides with a rise on MHT-level in the last 25 years. Despite the
   decrease in area, sedimentation continues, especially in the lower salt
   marsh, which acts as a sink of nitrogen. Assimilation and mineralization
   of nitrogen are in balance in most plant communities along the gradient
   from lower to higher salt marshes. Mineralization of nitrogen increases
   towards the higher salt marsh, whereas the above-ground production and
   the mean nitrogen content of plants decrease. There is a positive
   correlation between quality of food plants in salt marshes and breeding
   success of Brent geese in the arctic tundra.Sedimentation on mainland
   salt marshes can compensate for the expected sea level rise. This is not
   the case for island salt marshes, if the relative sea level rise is more
   than 0.5-1.0 cm yr-1. The natural succession on salt marshes results in
   an accumulation of organic material, which is related to the dominance
   of single plant species. It is not clear to which extent this process is
   enhanced by eutrophication from acid deposition and seawater. Human
   exploitation of unprotected salt marshes is old and heavy in the system
   of mound settlements. Reclamation rates by dikes in the last centuries
   were higher than the rate of area increase.Grazing by cattle as a
   management practice results in both a higher plant species-richness and
   community diversity than abandoning; hay-making is intermediate, but
   shows less structural diversity than grazing with low stocking density.
   The invertebrate fauna is favoured by a short period of abandoning, but
   eventually characteristic salt marsh invertebrates are replaced by
   inland species. Many bird species prefer grazed salt marshes.The final
   section gives some perspectives. Provided that no further embankments
   take place the optimal nature management option for plants and animals
   is a vegetation pattern, which includes areas with a low canopy (grazed)
   and areas with a tall canopy.}},

Abstract = {{Land managers face the difficult challenge of maintaining biodiversity
   on lands also used for commodity production. We present an approach for
   managing the habitats of terrestrial vertebrates at the landscape scale
   on multiple-use lands. The approach is based on the hypothesis that
   animal community response to landscape change is a function of species
   life histories and local patterns of landscape change. Key steps are:
   (1) set clear objectives; (2) associate target species with specific
   habitat configurations; (3) assess the potential sensitivity of species
   by mapping habitat suitability and examining species life histories; (4)
   evaluate alternative management prescriptions using simulation models;
   and (5) implement preferred or experimental strategies and monitor the
   responses of habitats and species.
   The approach was demonstrated for a watershed in western Oregon.
   Management objectives were to maximize habitat diversity for early- and
   late-successional bird species and to produce saw timber at levels
   compatible with the habitat goals. Habitat associations of 51 bird
   species were described by four variables that encompass three spatial
   scales. An analysis of species sensitivity to landscape change revealed
   several species that may merit special attention. The landscape model
   LSPA and the gap model ZELIG.PNW were used to simulate four
   disturbance/management scenarios over a 140-yr period: natural fire,
   wood production, multiple use, and no action. The results indicated that
   65\% more saw timber would be produced under the wood production run
   than the multiple-use run, but the former would maintain habitats for
   many fewer bird species than the latter. The multiple-use scenario was
   selected as the preferred alternative. We suggest carrying out
   management experiments and rigorous monitoring during the implementation
   phase.
   While this approach has various limitations, it is an incremental step
   towards the effective management of species diversity on multiple-use
   lands.}},

Abstract = {{The bird species composition of 88 patches of monsoon rainforest in the

   period April-November 1987. The monsoon rainforest avifauna is a
   `cut-and-paste' community, comprising species derived from wet tropical
   rainforests, from Eucalyptus open forests, from mangroves, from
   paperbark woodlands and habitat generalist species. Its composition may
   be seasonally unstable, and is re-arranged between monsoon rainforests
   of differing floristics or environment. For most bird species
   considered, the distribution was well associated with a division of
   monsoon rainforests into six groups: coastal, subcoastal, lowland
   springs, sandstone springs, escarpment and rock outcrop. Escarpment and
   rock outcrop rainforests were relatively depauperate. Monsoon
   rainforests are fragmented into small patches. The distribution of many
   characteristic rainforest birds (e.g. Orange-footed Scrub-fowl, Rainbow
   Pitta, Grey Whistler), bird species diversity and a Conservation Index
   were correlated with patch size. Bird species more typical of Eucalyptus
   open forests were abundant in patches most disturbed by buffalo, pigs,
   weeds and fire. No species were particularly associated with the edges
   of monsoon rainforests, but several open forest species occurred more
   commonly at edges than in the interior of monsoon rainforests (e.g.
   Bar-shouldered Dove, White-throated Honeyeater and Double-barred Finch).
   Birds occurring in monsoon rainforests are probably highly vagile, a
   response mainly to the marked seasonality of the environment and the
   fragmented nature of monsoon rainforests.}},

   greater than expected in the 75\% area but lower than expected in the
   0\% and 50\% areas; abundance of sallier-canopy foragers was greater
   than expected in the 0\% area and less in the 75\% area. Two Neotropical
   migrants, Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) and Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo
   olivaceus), were more sensitive than other area-dependent species to
   increased fragmentation via forest clear-cutting resulting from the
   third cycle. I conclude that the creation of a mosaic of small (I ha),
   even-aged stands for management of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus)
   habitat does not have a detrimental long-term effect on most species of
   breeding and wintering forest birds on a localized basis.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by livestock is often used to reduce litter, improve plant
   vigor, and alter plant species composition, but additional information
   is needed on the effects of these management practices on upland-nesting
   birds. Thus, we conducted an experimental study of the effect of grazing
   on nest density and nest success of upland sandpipers (Bartramia
   longicauda) in southcentral North Dakota from 1981 to 1987. Our
   experimental design consisted of 4 treatments and 1 control, each
   applied to 1 field in each of 3 study areas. The treatments represented
   options available to grassland managers: spring grazing, autumn grazing,
   autumn-and-spring grazing, season-long grazing, and control (ungrazed
   during the study). Nests (n = 342) were found by searching study areas
   with a cable-chain drag. Nest density was lower (P = 0.006) for
   treatments where cattle were present (spring, autumn-and-spring, and
   season-long) than where cattle were not present (autumn and control)
   during the nesting season. We concluded that grazing during the nesting
   season reduced the nest density of upland sandpipers. Nest success
   varied among years (P = 0.01) and was low in the first year of grazing
   and higher at the end of the study period. We found little evidence that
   the grazing treatment influenced nest success. We recommend that public
   lands with breeding populations of upland sandpipers include a complex
   of fields under various management practices, including fields
   undisturbed during the nesting season.}},

Abstract = {{We determined home range size and habitats used by pileated woodpeckers

   (xBAR = 407 ha) than birds (xBAR = 597 ha) whose mates had died (n = 9).
   Habitat use within home ranges was not random. Stands with old growth,
   grand fir (Abies grandis), no logging, and greater-than-or-equal-to 60\%
   canopy closure were used more (P < 0.01) than expected, and all other

   management for pileated woodpeckers in northeastern Oregon include
   increasing density of snags for nesting and foraging, increasing density
   of downed logs in foraging areas, and increasing management areas from
   the existing 121 ha to 364 ha of forest. Within these areas, we

Title = {{GAP ANALYSIS - A GEOGRAPHIC APPROACH TO PROTECTION OF BIOLOGICAL
   DIVERSITY}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{1993}},
Number = {{123}},
Pages = {{1-41}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The conventional approach to maintaining biological diversity generally
   has been to proceed species by species and threat by threat. We suggest
   that piecemeal approaches are not adequate by themselves to address the
   accelerating extinction crisis and, furthermore, they contribute to an
   unpredictable ecological and economic environment. Here, we describe a
   methodology called Gap Analysis, which identifies the gaps in
   representation of biological diversity (biodiversity) in areas managed
   exclusively or primarily for the long-term maintenance of populations of
   native species and natural ecosystems (hereinafter referred to as
   biodiversity management areas). Once identified, gaps are filled through
   new reserve acquisitions or designations, or through changes in
   management practices. The goal is to ensure that all ecosystems and
   areas rich in species diversity are represented adequately in
   biodiversity management areas. We believe this proactive strategy will
   eliminate the need to list many species as threatened or endangered in
   the future.
   Gap Analysis uses vegetation types and vertebrate and butterfly species
   (and/or other taxa, such as vascular plants, if adequate distributional
   data are available) as indicators of biodiversity. Maps of existing
   vegetation are prepared from satellite imagery (LANDSAT) and other
   sources and entered into a geographic information system (GIS). Because
   entire states or regions are mapped, the smallest area identified on
   vegetation maps is 100 ha. Vegetation maps are verified through field
   checks and examination of aerial photographs.
   Predicted species distributions are based on existing range maps and
   other distributional data, combined with information on the habitat
   affinities of each species. Distribution maps for individual species are
   overlaid in the GIS to produce maps of species richness, which can be
   created for any group of species of biological or political interest. An
   additional GIS layer of land ownership and management status allows
   identification of gaps in the representation of vegetation types and
   centers of species richness in biodiversity management areas through a
   comparison of the vegetation and species richness maps with ownership
   and management status maps. Underrepresented plant communities (e.g.,
   present on only 1 or 2 biodiversity management areas or with a small
   total acreage primarily managed for biodiversity) also can be identified
   in this manner. Realization of the full potential of Gap Analysis
   requires regionalization of state data bases and use of the data in
   resource management and planning.
   Gap Analysis is a powerful and efficient first step toward setting land
   management priorities. It provides focus, direction, and accountability
   for conservation efforts. Areas identified as important through Gap
   Analysis can then be examined more closely for their biological
   qualities and management needs. As a coarse-filter approach to
   conservation evaluation, Gap Analysis is not a panacea. Limitations
   related to minimum mapping unit size (where small habitat patches are
   missed), failure to distinguish among most seral stages, failure to
   indicate gradual ecotones, and other factors must be recognized so that
   Gap Analysis can be supplemented by more intensive inventories.}},

Abstract = {{Effective integration of the three main goals of rangeland management -
   economic gain through livestock production, management of game animals
   for recreational use, and conservation of biological diversity - is
   essential and will form a cornerstone of conservation of biological
   diversity for future generations. Rangelands encompass nearly 50\% of
   the earth's land area and is defined as land where people have
   intervened to manage the vegetation with livestock for economic gain.
   The introduction of domestic animals to a natural plant community has
   profound effects on the composition of the vegetation, soil erosion by
   wind and water, and on the population density and species composition of
   native organisms. Rangelands vary in their biological and economic
   productivity throughout the world and the greatest impacts on
   biodiversity usually occur on sites with the highest productivity.
   Worldwide overgrazing is the primary issue in range management. The
   basic tenet of range science is that the reduction of number of
   livestock animals will lead to greater productivity per unit area. Other
   factors affecting rangelands are discussed including perturbations by
   traditional grazing practices, management of western rangelands,
   problems with animal management, introduced domestic animals, and
   management of native animals for meat production. A classification of
   rangelands into four categories is presented with opportunities for
   proper management to enhance biological diversity and range productivity
   discussed for each type. Ways to manage rangelands for biodiversity
   include fire and utilization of restoration techniques.}},

   restoring productivity, ecosystem stability, and biological diversity to
   degraded tropical lands. The present study, conducted at a degraded
   coastal pasture site in Puerto Rico, compares 4.5-year-old Albizia
   lebbek (L.) Benth. plantation stands and adjacent control areas with
   respect to biomass production, understorey species diversity and
   nutrient storage patterns within vegetation, forest floor organic
   matter, and mineral soil compartments.
   Mineral soil (0-20 cm depth) organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN)
   were both significantly higher in plantation plots (1.70\% OC, 0.095\%
   TN) than in control plots (1.44\% OC, 0.074\% TN), while available
   phosphate and exchangeable cations were similar between treatments.
   Standing crop biomass of understorey vegetation, forest floor organic
   matter and fine (less than 2 mm) roots averaged 160 g m-2, 349 g m-2,
   and 362 g m-2 in the plantation plots and 420 g m-2, 311 g m-2, and 105
   g m-2 in the control plots. Nitrogen concentrations within each of these
   biomass components were, however, consistently higher in the plantation
   plots, Plantation understorey species appear to be efficient
   `scavengers' of biologically fixed nitrogen, and appear to help buffer
   the system against leaching losses.
   Species richness was considerably greater in plantation than control
   plots for grasses, vines, and forbs. Seedlings of several secondary
   forest species were abundant in the plantation understorey but absent in
   control plots, suggesting an important role for such plantations in
   accelerating natural regeneration of native forest species on certain

Abstract = {{A spatially explicit hydroecological landscape model of water, carbon
   and energy balances (Topog-IRM) is described. The landscape is envisaged
   as a catchment forested with a single stratum comprising Eucalyptus
   maculata trees. The model was used to simulate the direct effects of a
   2X elevation in atmospheric carbon dioxide at two levels of nitrogen on
   catchment water yield, soil moisture status and tree growth,
   Experimental results used to parameterise the model are detailed. Key
   features of the model are (1) an ability to scale hydrological processes
   at the catchment scale in three dimensions, and (2) a means to integrate
   multiple factors/stresses on plant growth.
   The effects of CO2 on catchment hydrology (water yield or soil moisture
   content) and forest growth (expressed as leaf area index, LAI) were
   modelled for a 2-year period, and contrasted with the effects of added
   nitrogen. Results were expressed as totals for the catchment or
   spatially distributed across the catchment. For the total catchment,
   water yield increased in the order: high CO2 with low N, high CO2 with
   high N, ambient CO2 with low N, ambient CO2 with high N. LAI increased
   from 3.3 to 5.7 in the order: ambient CO2 with low N, ambient CO2 with
   high N, high CO2 with low N, high CO2 with high N. These results agree
   with previous data. New findings are: (1) with elevated CO2 a new
   equilibrium in transpiration is established in which leaf area increases
   offset decreases in stomatal conductance; (2) the addition of nitrogen
   increases transpiration without any indication of a new equilibrium
   being reached during the simulated period; (3) the spatial distribution
   of soil moisture changes, presenting a new resource base for spatial
   changes to species composition and growth rates.
   The major hydroecological responses to elevated CO2 are seen as
   increased maximum upper canopy leaf area, increased litter inputs,
   especially at times of drought (hence changed fire regimes), changes in
   the composition of the understorey (hence litter composition, soil
   microfauna, and the spatial expression of biological diversity) and a
   slight increase in water yield.}},

Abstract = {{The habitat selection and foraging ecology of scarlet robins (Petroica
   multicolor) and flame robins (Petroica phoenicea) were observed for
   three years at a site of breeding-season sympatry in order to examine
   seasonal patterns of foraging behaviour, habitat and resource use, and
   the significance of competition for food as a cause of interspecific
   aggression. Both species occupied habitats with open ground layers of
   grass or bark, and a sparse shrub-and-sapling layer. Flame robins
   occupied more mesic habitats; scarlet robins occurred in drier habitats.
   Seven habitat variables provided 73\% separation between habitats
   occupied by the two species of robin. Both species foraged mostly on the
   ground during the cooler months. In summer and autumn, scarlet robins
   became snatchers of arthropods from bark and foliage substrates, and
   flame robins hawked for flying insects close to the ground. High overlap
   between their use of available foraging space, especially vertical
   foraging space, probably caused interspecific competition for food and
   space, leading to interspecific aggression and territorial behaviour.
   Such competition, in conjunction with the flame robin's interspecific
   dominance and apparently greater resilience to practices such as timber
   harvesting, may cause long-term changes to the distribution and relative
   abundance of each species. Recommendations for habitat management are
   considered briefly.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding bird populations were monitored for three years after an
   October prescribed burn in a fescue grassland near Saskatoon,
   Saskatchewan.  Breeding populations of 12 species were recorded on a
   12.9 ha burned plot and an adjacent 5.6 ha unburned plot, each with
   similar vegetation.  The two most common species, Savannah Sparrow
   (Passerculus sandwichensis) and Clay-coloured Sparrow (Spizella pallida)
   were both adversely affected by the burn.  By the third post-burn year,
   density of Savannah Sparrows was 68\% of the value (1.70 pairs/ha)
   observed in the unburned area, while Clay-coloured Sparrows were only
   33\% of the density (1.07 pairs/ha) noted in the unburned area.  Other
   important species, Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii) and Western
   Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) were adversely affected initially by the
   burn but by the third year, population densities in the burned and
   unburned areas were comparable.  Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii)
   did not use the burned area in the first year, but as the grassy canopy
   became reestablished, the burned area was utilized at moderate densities
   in the second year, and in the third post-burn year densities were
   identical in burned and unburned ares (0.27 pairs/ha).  Only the Vesper
   Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) showed a preference for the burned area in
   the first year after the burn.}},
