abstract={Recent studies have shown the importance of accounting for burn severity when assessing the effects of forest fires on avian communities. We add to this growing literature with one of the first studies to assess these effects in boreal and hemiboreal regions of North America. We conducted point counts in control and treatment areas for 2–3 years before (2009–2011) and 4–5 years after (2012–2016) the Pagami Creek Fire in northern Minnesota, USA. Our primary objectives were to (1) assess the effects of burn status, burn severity and burn heterogeneity on avian communities and patterns of abundance in individual bird species and (2) compare these results when counts were either restricted to 100 m count radii or corrected for potential detection heterogeneity. Species richness and total abundance of birds were best described by a burn severity by year interaction, with lower-severity burns having similar patterns to control areas and higher-severity burns showing reduced abundance and richness following the fire. Nevertheless, values associated with higher-severity burns returned to near-control levels after five years. Of 43 species analyzed, 27 showed detectable responses to the fire through shifts in abundance. Nearly equal proportions of these species had generally positive versus negative effects of the fire. Sixteen (59%) of these fire responses were mediated by burn severity, while four (15%) and seven (26%) were best predicted by burn heterogeneity or burn status, respectively. Of the species whose response to the fire was mediated by burn severity, the majority (81%) had decreased abundance as burn severity increased. However, all species responding to burn heterogeneity or burn status showed positive relationships to these metrics. Results were similar between analytical methods that adjusted for species detectability vs those that did not, with 78% of species having the same interpretation of fire effects. Burn severity and heterogeneity, in addition to the sole distinction of whether an area was burned, dictate the response of birds to forest fire in hemiboreal forests. Mixed-severity fires, which include a range of burn severities and associated vegetation change, will likely benefit the most bird species in this region. When possible, management should focus on retaining this spectrum of post-fire conditions, though of primary importance is the inclusion of wildfire in forest planning and conservation efforts. © 2019},

abstract={Restoration is underway to restore lost or degraded remnants of savanna and woodland in the Midwestern United States in the hopes of restoring floristic and wildlife diversity. Information is needed on the effects of pine savanna-woodland restoration on bird abundance to inform management decisions. We conducted point-count surveys for 19 bird species across the gradient of savanna, woodland, and forest in restored and non-restored areas throughout the Ozark-Ouachita Highlands in parts of Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma during the 2013–2015 breeding seasons. We estimated densities of 16 species using distance sampling to account for detection probability, and we determined relationships of bird abundance with management and vegetation variables by evaluating support for a priori models. Densities of early-successional and generalist species were positively related, and interior-forest species negatively related, to restoration. Densities of Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla), Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens), Pine Warbler (Setophaga pinus), Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor), Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus), and Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) were positively related to prescribed fire activity. Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera), Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa), and Yellow-breasted Chat densities were positively related to tree thinning. Many species had higher densities in areas with less canopy cover, tree density, and forest cover. Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum) were negatively related to one or more aspects of restoration treatment and generally preferred areas with greater tree density and canopy cover. Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra) were abundant but density was not strongly related to management or vegetation variables. Restoration provided breeding habitat for disturbance-dependent species and woodland generalists, many of which are species of conservation concern, but canopy cover generally remained too great for species that require more open savanna. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aim: To evaluate changes in breeding bird communities and assess implications for conservation. Location: Madrean Sky Islands and northern Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico. Methods: I compared observations from recent fieldwork (2009–2012) with an extensive historical data set (1887–1954) and used modelling and multivariate techniques to assess spatiotemporal changes in species occurrence, richness and assemblage composition, and associations with climate, land use and landscape factors. Results: Breeding species richness peaked in larger ranges often in the south and east, and regional beta diversity was attributable much more to turnover (0.80) than nestedness (0.07). Although richness increased across time, spatial assemblage heterogeneity declined due only to changes in nestedness, with temporal shifts in beta diversity equally attributable to variation in nestedness and turnover. Community change was associated with variation in climate, land use and landscape factors in ways that depended on species’ traits. Major gains in Madrean and lowland Neotropical species from the south contrasted little change in Nearctic species, and there was some evidence lowland species expanded eastward into the higher-elevation interior, suggesting poleward and up-elevation shifts now occurring globally. Some such patterns were associated with increasing temperature and summer–fall precipitation typical of the south suggesting climate forcing. Despite regional gains in pine-dependent species linked to post-logging forest recovery, losses and turnover were greater in smaller more arid ranges due likely to climate-mediated habitat loss. High regional losses of cavity-nesting species in forest were greater in ranges subjected to past logging indicating effects of historical habitat degradation persist today. Main conclusion: Despite ongoing forest recovery and potential for northward range expansion to offset climate-mediated losses of montane species, further assemblage homogenization seems likely. Active forest restoration that promotes large old trees, snags and mature forest conditions combined with increasing the capacity of local communities to implement best management practices will enhance conservation. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={The intensification of agricultural practices that Western nations have experienced after World War II has led to an alarming decline in farmland biodiversity. With the aim of stopping and even reversing this decline, agri-environment schemes (AES) have been implemented in many European countries since the 1990s. In Switzerland, farmers are required to manage at least 7% of their land in the form of biodiversity promotion areas (BPA), which are extensively managed, wildlife-friendly farmland habitats such as hay meadows and traditional orchards. We investigated how the occurrence and characteristics of these BPA influence birds and butterflies in the Swiss lowlands. Butterfly species richness and abundance increased by 22% and 60%, respectively, when the proportion of BPA in the landscape increased from 5% to 15%. Likewise, bird species richness increased, but to a lesser extent, with the proportion of BPA in the landscape. For birds, the proportion of BPA characterized by a high ecological quality played a role in promoting both priority-farmland and red-listed species. For both taxonomic groups, the amount and quality of BPA habitats contributed more to species richness than their spatial configuration, connectivity included. This study shows that AES measures implemented at the field scale have positive effects on mobile species that are noticeable at the landscape scale, and that the fraction of AES in the cultivated landscape matters more than their spatial configuration, which has strong implications for designing multi-functional agro-ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Agricultural intensification and the associated loss of non-cropped habitats have caused a major decline in UK farmland bird populations since the 1970s. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to implement effective conservation and habitat restoration measures in agricultural landscapes. Over the last 40–50 years, due to the cessation of traditional management practices, the majority of UK farmland ponds have become highly terrestrialised, resulting in major reductions in the diversity and abundance of aquatic plant and invertebrate assemblages. Recent research undertaken at farmland ponds in early summer, has shown restored open-canopy, macrophyte-dominated ponds support an increased abundance and diversity of farmland birds, compared to non-managed, overgrown ponds. Here, we expand on this previous research with a year-long field study to assess the implications of pond management for farmland birds by comparing bird diversity, abundance and activity at managed open-canopy ponds with those at unmanaged overgrown ponds. Driven strongly by pond management and connectivity to semi-natural landscape features such as hedgerows and woodland patches, bird abundance and species richness, as well as foraging and parental behaviour, were all significantly higher at managed open-canopy ponds. Further, a wider landscape analysis found that terrestrial land-use patterns in the vicinity of the ponds were not significant predictors of bird communities at the pond sites. In light of the numerous potential benefits to conservation-listed birds and other wildlife, we conclude that farmland pond management has been undervalued as a conservation measure to assist farmland birds. Consequently, we conclude that future agri-environment schemes, should more fully embrace farmland ponds. © 2018},

abstract={Conservation management in the buffer and transition zones of Biosphere Reserves play an important role in ensuring enhanced core zone protection. Tambolongan and Polassi are two islands located in the administrative region of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and part of the transition zone area of UNESCO’s Taka Bonerate-Kepulauan Selayar (TBKS) Biosphere Reserve (BR). These two islands can be considered as some of the most populated islands in the region, containing a variety of human activities. These human activities, such as the ever expanding agriculture and the building of human habitation have put pressures toward ecosystem and species conservation in the BR. Bird are often the focus of conservation efforts, due to their roles in supporting the ecological functioning of their habitats. This study aims to provide baseline data of bird diversity in Tambolongan and Polassi that can be used as a proxy indicator of ecosystem health and input to conservation strategies within the BR area. A Visual Encounter Survey (VES) method is used to examine bird diversity index. Results from the observation recorded a total of 29 species were found in both islands, with 5 listed as protected species and 3 categorized as migratory species. The comparison between the two islands showed that the bird diversity index (H’) differs only slightly (H’Tambolongan=2.98; H’Polassi=2.71). This study provided the initial attempt in understanding the role of habitats or land cover types, guild types and human interferences in determining the diversity of bird population - and related ecosystem health - in the area. Such knowledge is essential in providing the information necessary for sustainable management practices. This work represents the first study to inventorize avian species diversity in the transition zone of TBKS BR. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A wide range of different biodiversity indicators have been identified in different biomes and types of environments. However, we currently lack a clear understanding under which circumstances proposed biodiversity indicators are valid indicators and when they are not. Here we conducted a large-scale restoration experiment by emulating natural disturbances through prescribed burning and gap-cutting. From this experiment data of resident forest birds was used to, (1) identify biodiversity indicators in the middle and northern boreal zone, (2) test the effect of forest restoration practices on biodiversity indicators and (3) explore the patterns when biodiversity indicator analyses are performed across a wider range of forest types including both restored and unrestored sites. Additionally, to understand the occurrence of species we correlated their occurrence with local habitat structures across different forest types. We found that both the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) were important biodiversity indicators for the middle/northern boreal zone. The occurrence of these species can generally be used to identify species rich areas across different forest types. However, the three-toed woodpecker, the best indicator for unrestored forest, lost its indicator value after prescribed burning; in these stands the goldcrest (Regulus regulus) was the best biodiversity indicator. Based on habitat associations, we suggest that biodiversity indicators in boreal forest not only indicate high species richness but also structural habitat complexity. Our results draw attention to the fact that one must be careful about using previously identified biodiversity indicators in ecosystems subjected to ecological restoration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Disturbance legacies structure communities and ecological memory, but due to increasing changes in disturbance regimes, it is becoming more difficult to characterize disturbance legacies or determine how long they persist. We sought to quantify the characteristics and persistence of material legacies (e.g., biotic residuals of disturbance) that arise from variation in fire severity in an eastern ponderosa pine forest in North America. We compared forest stand structure and understory woody plant and bird community composition and species richness across unburned, low-, moderate-, and high-severity burn patches in a 27-year-old mixed-severity wildfire that had received minimal post-fire management. We identified distinct tree densities (high: 14.3 ± 7.4 trees per ha, moderate: 22.3 ± 12.6, low: 135.3 ± 57.1, unburned: 907.9 ± 246.2) and coarse woody debris cover (high: 8.5 ± 1.6% cover per 30 m transect, moderate: 4.3 ± 0.7, low: 2.3 ± 0.6, unburned: 1.0 ± 0.4) among burn severities. Understory woody plant communities differed between high-severity patches, moderate- and low-severity patches, and unburned patches (all p < 0.05). Bird communities differed between high- and moderate-severity patches, low-severity patches, and unburned patches (all p < 0.05). Bird species richness varied across burn severities: low-severity patches had the highest (5.29 ± 1.44) and high-severity patches had the lowest (2.87 ± 0.72). Understory woody plant richness was highest in unburned (5.93 ± 1.10) and high-severity (5.07 ± 1.17) patches, and it was lower in moderate- (3.43 ± 1.17) and low-severity (3.43 ± 1.06) patches. We show material fire legacies persisted decades after the mixed-severity wildfire in eastern ponderosa forest, fostering distinct structures, communities, and species in burned versus unburned patches and across fire severities. At a patch scale, eastern and western ponderosa system responses to mixed-severity fires were consistent. © 2019 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Habitat modification by fire and habitat loss via anthropogenic vegetation clearance and fragmentation both impact animal populations. Yet, there has been limited investigation as to whether animals that decline under one of these types of habitat change also decline under the other, and how their cumulative impacts affect the status of species and communities. Using a ~400-year chronosequence in the world's largest extant temperate woodland in south-western Australia, we examine how time since fire affects bird community richness, reporting rates and composition, and whether taxa grouped on the basis of responses to vegetation clearance and fragmentation in an adjoining agricultural landscape are associated with either recently-burnt or long-unburnt woodlands. Consistent with substantial changes in vegetation composition and structure after fire in obligate-seeder eucalypt woodlands, woodland bird communities were strongly affected by fire. Species richness and total reporting rates increased with time since fire, and community composition changed across the entire multi-century span of the chronosequence. Woodland birds most negatively impacted by vegetation clearance and fragmentation were strongly associated with long-unburnt woodlands. In a regional south-western Australian context, where extensive vegetation clearance has substantially reduced the range and populations of many woodland bird species, the ability of remaining unfragmented woodlands to support populations of these species will be strongly contingent on appropriate fire management. Specifically, as stand-replacement fires have affected 25–30% of extant woodland over recent decades, management to limit the extent of fire in remaining long-unburnt woodlands would appear a priority for conservation of woodland bird diversity. © 2018},

abstract={Populations of grassland songbirds continue to decline, and grasslands devoted to conservation are rare across the Great Plains. To gain the most value from grasslands for grassland birds, we must understand what types of management benefit these species. We evaluated the relative abundance of grassland birds on ownership types and the association of different land use activities with their abundance. We surveyed a wide range of grasslands (e.g., from idle to heavily managed, from remnant prairie to reconstructed) across western Minnesota and northwestern Iowa, USA, in 2013 and 2014. Sites surveyed covered a gradient of landscape context, management history (fire, grazing, reconstruction), and public and private ownership. We evaluated the influence of ownership and management history on the abundance of 12 species of grassland birds by comparing Akaike's Information Criterion values of linear models that included the variables of interest to models that included only local and landscape habitat factors. Ownership explained additional variation in bird abundance beyond local and landscape variables for 7 of the 12 species, and 5 species were more common on private lands. Fire or grazing history explained variation in bird abundance for 11 species, and 7 species had greater abundance on remnant prairie than on reconstructed grassland. For all but 1 species, ownership and management factors significantly improved models above a base model of local and landscape variables typically used to predict abundance. Our results suggest remnant prairie plays an important role for grassland birds, and that grazing could be a tool to increase abundance of some grassland bird species in the region. Furthermore, tracking management history of public lands in a consistent and accessible way could help improve landscape-based models for these species. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

abstract={Complex environments support high biodiversity and diverse microhabitat availability, which may reduce the intensity of competition among species. Both natural and anthropogenic disturbances reduce the structural complexity of habitats, leading to homogenization. High abundances of common, generalist species in disturbed habitats may be driven by reduced competition from specialists in similar habitats. We quantified habitat availability for and utilization of three co-occurring arboreal geckos (Australian native house geckos [Gehyra dubia], northern velvet geckos [Oedura castelnaui] and eastern spiny-tailed geckos [Strophurus williamsi]) in four replicated grazing regimes in an experimental grazing trial in north-east Queensland, Australia. Native house geckos were most abundant in heavily grazed habitats, whereas the two other species rarely co-occurred (either with each other or with native house geckos). Geckos displayed resource partitioning of habitat features, such as tree species and structural characteristics. We found evidence of interspecific competition among gecko species, in which native house geckos shifted their habitat selection in the presence of velvet geckos. In the absence of other geckos, native house geckos preferred rough, peeling bark and dead trees, yet in the presence of velvet geckos, native house geckos shifted away from dead trees, and used more structurally complex trees, probably due to high niche overlap with velvet geckos. Native house geckos were more resistant to the negative effects of livestock grazing than either velvet or spiny-tailed geckos. In the absence of other species, native house geckos used a wider range of microhabitats. Synthesis and applications. Species assemblages are often the results of multiple or complex factors, including predation pressure, habitat availability or competitive interactions. The homogenizing effects on habitat structure caused by livestock grazing reduce diversity and suitability for microhabitat specialists. Reduced competition can therefore promote the abundance of microhabitat generalist species, such as Australian native house geckos, suggesting that livestock grazing leads to homogenization and simplification of habitat structure, which ultimately leads to changes in species composition through reduced competition. Understanding species’ responses to disturbance, and more broadly, habitat complexity, is crucial for maintaining or increasing biological diversity in anthropogenically modified landscapes. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Data collected by forest inventories like the third National Forest Inventory (NFI-3, 2011–2012) in Germany was proposed to monitor forest biodiversity and evaluate existing forest management practices on a national scale. A data set was created from the NFI-3 data for analysis purposes which contained variables relevant to the habitat requirements of native forest bird species. Information on the distribution and abundance of 20 native forest bird species was taken from the Atlas of German Breeding Birds (2005–2009, 3003 grid cells). They form two important ecological groups: cavity-nesting and deciduous forest birds. For the first time, this data was combined with NFI-3 data and analysed using Random Forest models and partial dependence plots to determine which forest variables recorded by the NFI-3 were most closely related to forest bird species richness and diversity in temperate forests. It was shown that changes in forest bird species diversity and richness correlate with the NFI data but the different sampling methods of the NFI and bird species data also created methodological challenges which are discussed. The most important drivers of the richness and diversity of deciduous forest and cavity-nesting bird species are forest stand age and forest ownership. Deciduous forest and cavity-nesting birds show a preference for the way state, federal and municipal forests are managed over private forests. Private forests have significantly lower deadwood volumes and high proportions of coniferous trees, both of which are forest characteristics that lower the richness and diversity of bird species. Our findings show that efforts to protect forest birds should target managed forests older than 100 and 200 years and forests with total deadwood volumes &gt;46.3 m3/ha. Protected areas also exhibited higher diversity and richness of forest birds which highlight their importance as suitable target areas for the protection of forest birds. © 2018},

abstract={Ensuring adequate conifer regeneration after high severity wildfires is a common objective for ecologists and forest managers. In the Klamath region of Oregon and California, a global hotspot of botanical biodiversity, concerns over regeneration have led to post-fire management on many sites, which involves salvage logging followed by site preparation, conifer planting, and manual shrub release. To quantify the impacts of post-fire management, we sampled 62 field sites that burned at high severity nearly 20 years ago in the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountain bioregion, stratifying by management and aspect. We measured cover of shrubs and trees and density and frequency of trees and used Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling to compare community composition, plant community assemblage based on regenerative traits, and density of tree species between aspect and management. On average, shrub cover exceeded the cover of conifers, hardwoods or grasses, regardless of management history or aspect. The average number of species was lower and resprouting species were less abundant on south aspect sites; seed banking species were most abundant on north aspects. Post-fire management was associated with greater cover of seed banking and nitrogen-fixing species but it did not affect diversity. Management had no impact on Douglas-fir regeneration, the main species of concern in the region. Regeneration of ponderosa pine was higher on sites with post-fire management, but only on south slopes. The frequency of Douglas-fir was associated with aspect, while the frequency of ponderosa pine was associated with management. Overall, our study demonstrates the important role that aspect plays in determining the effectiveness of management after high severity wildfires. Indeed, the effect of aspect on site conditions often overwhelmed the ability of management to influence community composition (including different regenerative strategies), species diversity, and regeneration. Managed sites differed from unmanaged sites in several diverse ways with varied implications for longer-term forest development. Managed sites had taller dominant conifers, which suggests that post-fire management could hasten the period needed to achieve fire resistance. Managed sites were similar in plant community composition but had more homogeneous structure–e.g., managed sites had fewer snags, which are an important habitat feature for several bird species in the region. Finally, management was not associated with conifer regeneration success on north slopes, suggesting that interventions may not be needed uniformly across post-fire landscape. New policies of ecosystem-based management in the Klamath region should consider the important interactions between aspect and post-fire management, and tailor management practices based on specific objectives and landscape context. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we evaluated how grain size (i.e. the dimension of sampling units) and type of data (abundance vs. presence/absence) impact the analysis of the response to restoration management activities aiming at halting the loss of European beech forests with Abies alba in the central Apennines (Italy). The proposed analysis relies on forests sampled in three Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) located in central Italy. For each treatment (reference, control and impact), randomly located multi-scale plots were selected. Vascular plant occurrences were recorded twice in every plot during summer 2010 or 2011 (before restoration) and in 2013 or 2014 (after restoration). Analysis of species abundances, recorded at the largest grain size available (20 X 20 m plot), showed a significant change in plant species composition in restored sites just after two years from the restoration management. When presence/absence data were used previous results were less visible, for all the examined grains, in two out of the three sites, suggesting a site-dependent response. © 2018, © 2018 Società Botanica Italiana.},

abstract={Wildfires affect biodiversity at multiple levels. While vegetation is directly changed by fire events, animals are often indirectly affected through changes in habitat and food availability. Globally, fire frequency and the extent of fires are predicted to increase in the future. The impact of fire on the biodiversity of temperate wetlands has gained little attention so far. We compared species richness and abundance of plants and birds in burnt and unburnt areas in the Amur floodplain/Russian Far East in the year of fire and 1 year after. We also analysed vegetation recovery in relation to time since fire over a period of 18 years. Plant species richness was higher in burnt compared to unburnt plots in the year of the fire, but not in the year after. This suggests that fire has a positive short-term effect on plant diversity. Bird species richness and abundance were lower on burnt compared to unburnt plots in the year of the fire, but not in the year after. Over a period of 18 years, high fire frequency led to an increase in herb cover and a decrease in grass cover. We show that the effects on biodiversity are taxon- and species-specific. Fire management strategies in temperate wetlands should consider fire frequency as a key driving force of vegetation structure, with carry-over effects on higher trophic levels. Designing fire “refuges”, i.e., areas that do not burn annually, might locally be necessary to maintain high species richness. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Aim: The hypothesis that habitat fragmentation negatively influences biodiversity stems from island biogeography and metapopulation theory which predict negative impacts of decreasing patch size on richness and distribution patterns. Empirical support of this idea is weak in terrestrial systems, though tests of fragmentation effects are typically confounded with landscape composition and potentially obscured by imperfect detection. Here, we used multispecies occupancy models and a mensurative experimental design to test competing hypotheses about how forest fragmentation influences distributions of breeding forest bird species and communities. Location: Southern Indiana, USA. Methods: During the breeding seasons of 2011–2013, we recorded over 80,000 bird detections in 202 forest fragments using a sampling design that isolated the effects of patch size per se from the effects of forest amount within a 2 km radius, edge distance, local vegetation and sampling area. We modelled the effects of these covariates on distributions of individual species categorized by ecological trait groups (i.e., forest, forest interior or forest edge), and evaluated how forest loss and fragmentation impact species richness. Results: Though our results indicated little effect of patch size on total species richness, decreasing patch size had a negative effect on interior species, and a positive effect on edge species. The effects of total forest amount were much more variable, and surprisingly had a negative influence on many species, particularly cavity nesters. Main conclusions: Our results do not support theoretical predictions that forest patch size should positively influence bird species richness. However, composition of bird communities shifted towards edge species from interior species with decreasing patch size. Maintaining large forest patches is thus critical for supporting forest interior species, which tend to be of the greatest conservation concern. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Populations of birds inhabiting wetlands and grasslands are decreasing globally due to farmland expansion and subsequent agricultural intensification. In addition to conserving natural habitats, managing cultivated farmland and abandoned farmland are likely to be important future conservation measures; however, their relative suitability as avian habitat remains understudied. In this study, we evaluated five habitat types (wetland, pasture, cropland, abandoned farmland, and solar power plant) for openland birds in an agricultural landscape in central Hokkaido, northern Japan. Abandoned farmlands had bird species richness and total bird abundance values similar to those of wetlands. These values were generally higher in abandoned farmlands and wetlands than in croplands, pastures, and solar power plants. The per pair reproductive success of Stejneger's Stonechat Saxicola stejnegeri and the amount of its prey (arthropods) did not differ among the five habitat types. Three species (Black-browed Reed Warbler Acrocephalus bistrigiceps, Common Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus, and Japanese Bush Warbler Cettia diphone) arrived earlier in wetlands than in other habitat types. These results suggest that, although protecting the remaining wetlands is of prime importance for the conservation of openland birds in agricultural landscapes, valuing and managing abandoned farmlands would be a promising alternative. © The Ornithological Society of Japan 2019.},

abstract={One of North America's major avian migratory pathways occurs along a large anthropogenically modified coastal region of southeastern Virginia, USA. Because hundreds of avian species migrate along the east coast of North America, understanding factors affecting birds and their health is of ecological and conservation interest. Within southeastern Virginia, 14 tick species have been documented, all of which may serve as vectors of vertebrate pathogens. We tested 5 hypotheses to understand how varying levels of urbanization within an urban matrix of a coastal region affected avian parasitism rates. We sampled resident and migratory birds for ticks across an urbanization gradient at 5 permanent and 6 ad hoc sites from August 2012 to August 2014 and determined parasitism rates at the landscape and site scales. At the landscape scale, the proportion of birds parasitized by ticks was reduced at more urbanized sites. Urbanized sites were largely associated with higher water and impervious surfaces in the surrounding area, which may have prevented dispersal of ticks or hosts to isolated urban locations, and lower tree cover, which likely reduced tick survival because of decreased leaf litter. At the site scale, properties associated with being on or near the ground (i.e., foraging guild and age) were the best predictors of tick parasitism. These findings demonstrate that the effects of urbanization are neither uniform nor straightforward. In addition to affecting avian species composition, anthropogenic changes to the landscape are affecting the relationship between avian hosts and their parasites, a finding that has important implications for avian conservation efforts and management practices. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2019},

abstract={Landslides and erosion processes cause a high level of morphological diversity which, over the course of time, results in an increased level of forest species and habitat biodiversity. According to the principles of landscape ecology, information concerning points of convergence—understood as transition zones between elementary parts of a slope—could be interpreted as a surrogate for biodiversity. To recognize locations of land surface disruption, points of convergence derived from a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) were used in the research. It was assumed that relationships exist between landslide geodiversity and biodiversity and that from the DEM it is possible to select bare-earth surface structures where points of convergence can be identified. In order to verify this hypothesis, indicators of biodiversity such as richness of plant species and species diversity were checked. Based on the spatial distribution of points of convergence, locations of sample plots were planned and these indicators were verified during fieldwork. Samples were taken both in areas with a high concentration of points of convergence and in areas with a low concentration (or absence) of points of convergence. The results show that species diversity in the areas having a high concentration of points of convergence was significantly higher than in the areas having a low concentration of points of convergence. The proposed method allows the selection of parts of forested landslides that have the potential to develop a high level of biological diversity; it thus supports the management of areas of forest ecosystems with high levels of biodiversity within the scope of a cutting system. This may entail avoiding the traversal of areas that potentially possess high biological diversity with skid roads, preserving parts of these areas with thick vegetation for forest game purposes or leaving predominant and dead trees. The proposed method may also be used in scientific research into processes of biodiversity appearing on forested landslides. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Land sparing has been proposed as a strategy to reconcile biodiversity conservation with agricultural production, with empirical studies on five continents indicating that most species would benefit if food demand was met through high-yield farming combined with the protection or restoration of natural habitat. Most such studies come from landscapes covered by large areas of natural habitat and without a long history of intense human modification. However, much of Europe consists of human-dominated landscapes, where biodiversity responses to land sparing may differ. To test this, we use estimates of bird population density in different (semi-)natural habitats, and forecasts of population density in farmland habitat, to assess the future consequences for birds of land-sparing scenarios in the United Kingdom. Our scenarios predict that whilst up to 18 of the 156 species assessed (predominantly farmland associated species) might decline in UK conservation status under land sparing, up to 35 UK bird species (mainly woodland and wetland species) might improve in status. This contrasts with a maximum of eight species likely to improve in conservation status without land sparing, with up to seven species deteriorating. Combining land sparing with demand management measures (reducing food waste and the consumption of animal products) led to more positive population changes under all scenarios. Synthesis and applications. Land sparing has the potential to benefit UK bird populations in aggregate but would likely have negative impacts on farmland bird species. These findings are likely to be applicable across human-dominated landscapes beyond the UK, though effects on other taxa, implementation mechanisms and the sustainability of higher yields all require careful consideration. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Climate change is driving species to shift their distributions toward high altitudes and latitudes, while habitat loss and fragmentation may hamper species ability to follow their climatic envelope. These two drivers of change may act in synergy, with particularly disastrous impacts on biodiversity. Protected areas, PAs, may thus represent crucial buffers against the compounded effects of climate change and habitat loss. However, large-scale studies assessing the performance of PAs as such buffers remain scarce and are largely based on species occurrence data. Conversely, abundance data have proven to be more reliable for addressing changes in wildlife populations under climate change. We evaluated changes in bird abundance from the 1970s–80s to the 2000s inside and outside PAs at the trailing range edge of 30 northern bird species and at the leading range edge of 70 southern species. Abundances of retracting northern species were higher and declined less inside PAs at their trailing range edge. The positive effect of PAs on bird abundances was particularly marked in northern species that rely strongly on PAs, that is, their density distribution is largely confined within PAs. These species were nearly absent outside PAs in the 2000s. The abundances of southern species were in general lower inside PAs and increased less from the 70s–80s to 2000s. Nonetheless, species with high reliance on PAs had much higher abundances inside than outside PAs in the 2000s. These results show that PAs are essential in mitigating the retraction of northern species, but also facilitate northward expansions of southern species highly reliant on PAs. Our study provides empirical evidence documenting the role of PAs in facilitating species to adjust to rapidly changing climatic conditions, thereby contributing to the mitigation of impending biodiversity loss. PAs may thus allow time for initiating wider conservation programs on currently unprotected land. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Agricultural intensification has negatively affected biodiversity throughout the world. In the United States, population declines of many early successional bird species have been linked with habitat loss due to agriculture. In light of this, recent efforts have attempted to prioritize conservation actions at continental scales. Importantly, these efforts have used existing data to estimate the global population size for declining species and set future population goals. Though these efforts consider broad scales for conservation efforts and provide population targets, they lack explicit plans to achieve established goals. One way to achieve these population goals is through the process of habitat restoration, such as voluntary private-land conservation programs that restore habitat in agricultural landscapes and are implemented at a sufficiently large scale to achieve population goals. Our goal was to understand how private-land conservation programs can be used to achieve population goals for declining species. To do this, we examined the population-level impacts of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, a program that has created more than 57,000 ha of restored habitat in Illinois, for four declining conservation priority species, the Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii bellii), Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla), Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), and Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax trailli trailli). We surveyed 172 randomly chosen restored fields in 10 counties in central and west-central Illinois during the 2012–2015 breeding seasons. We found that current private-land conservation efforts in Illinois are probably effective in achieving state population goals for rare species with restricted habitat preferences such as the Bell's Vireo and may be close to achieving the goal for the Willow Flycatcher. However, more than 10 times the current amount of restored habitat (~1% of land used for agriculture in Illinois) would be required to achieve the population goals set for all of our focal species. Our results suggest that achieving population goals for early successional bird species using land restored through private-land programs may be possible for some rare species, but the large amount of habitat needed for many species makes achieving these goals only possible with significant increases in private-land habitat. © 2019 The Authors.},

abstract={Hybrid cattails (Typha x glauca) are an invasive, emergent aquatic plant that often form monodominant stands, which can alter wetland vegetation structure and negatively affect wildlife populations. Wetland managers often apply prescribed burning, grazing, and herbicide treatments to reduce cattail density but how these management actions influence wetland wildlife is largely unknown. Our objectives were to investigate the effect of hybrid cattail control methods on secretive marsh bird and wetland passerine abundance in central Minnesota, USA. Specifically, we assessed how environmental variables and cattail treatments (e.g., burning, grazing, and herbicide) influenced bird densities and community composition. We used the North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol to assess wetland bird communities across sixteen wetlands comprised of eight treatments with a full-factorial design. Species-specific density estimates and community-wide ordination offered little evidence for a substantial effect of treatments on marsh birds and passerines. However, gradients in vegetation height and mean biomass did have a significant relationship with both passerine and marsh bird community composition, which suggests changes in the bird community following cattail management might require time to develop. To support diverse wetland bird communities, treatments must create contrast among wetland habitats with high and low vegetative biomass. Because secretive marsh birds are under-surveyed, our baseline population estimates are valuable for future local and regional management and for gaining preliminary understanding of the effect of invasive species management on wetland birds in the Upper Midwest. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Anthropogenic disturbance may cause birds to flush and relocate, abandon breeding sites, experience increased nest failure, or fledge fewer young. Ground-based military activities are of particular concern for ground-nesting birds because of the increased risk of nest destruction and trampling of vegetation. We investigated how different intensities of disturbance from ground-based military training affected reproductive ecology of Bachman's sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) from 2014–2016, on Fort Bragg Military Installation, North Carolina, USA. We designated 2 training intensity regimes and monitored sparrows at 6 observation areas, 3 in high-intensity training areas (i.e., foot traffic every 1–3 days) and 3 in low-intensity training (i.e., foot traffic <1 per month) areas. We compared seasonal productivity metrics and daily nest survival between training intensities. Additionally, we compared male sparrow relative abundance and micro-habitat use between high- and low-intensity training areas. We monitored 106 male territories and located 110 nests opportunistically and by tracking telemetered female sparrows. We used fixed-radius point counts to estimate relative abundance in each observation area and measured vegetation composition and structure at a subset of 10 locations in each male territory. Seasonal productivity metrics, daily nest survival, relative abundance, and vegetation composition and structure at male locations did not differ between areas with high and low military training intensity. In 2015, 1 sparrow nest was trampled by military personnel, but ≥1 nestling force-fledged and the nest was considered successful. Bachman's sparrow nesting ecology was not affected by intensity of ground-based military training activity, likely because activity was sufficiently dispersed across the landscape, even in high-intensity training areas. We recommend ground-based training attempts to minimize ground vegetation destruction by dispersing large groups and traversing variable routes when in forested uplands. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

abstract={Fire disturbance in tropical savannas is integral to maintaining habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity, but its impact on avian species is highly variable. Savannas in northern Australia have recently been invaded by gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus), a perennial tussock grass that fuels late season fires at eight times the intensity of native vegetation. As gamba grass rapidly outcompetes native species and promotes more frequent and intense fires, it greatly decreases landscape heterogeneity and alters the effect of fire in tropical savannas. To investigate how a small passerine, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus), responds to fire disturbance and gamba grass cover, we studied their fine-scale habitat use throughout the dry season before and after a high intensity fire. We used two spatially distinct approaches, radio-telemetry and a transect-based population census, to quantify fairywren habitat use at the group and population level, respectively. Radio-telemetry and transect surveys revealed no direct mortality associated with the severe bushfire during the middle of the study season, suggesting fairywrens are resilient in the short-term to fire disturbance. Our results indicate that fairywrens are largely flexible in their habitat use – instead of relocating after fire, they re-centre their home range around the most photosynthetically productive habitats, dominated by saplings. While we found substantial variation in habitat use among social groups, red-backed fairywren groups generally avoided dense habitat areas dominated by mature gamba grass. We conclude that red-backed fairywrens are resilient to fire and flexible in their habitat use in the short-term; however, in the long-term, gamba grass may pose a threat to population viability. The importance of flexible behavioural strategies in tropical passerines will increase as fire regimes are exacerbated by invasive species and climate change. © 2018 Ecological Society of Australia},

abstract={Background: Pine savannas are primarily managed with frequent prescribed fire (≤ 3 years) to promote diversity of flora and fauna, and to maintain open, park-like conditions needed by species such as the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of bobcat (Lynx rufus) habitat selection in longleaf pine savannas and research is warranted to direct our future management decisions. Methods: We examined bobcat habitat selection in a pine savanna managed with frequent fires at two spatial scales (i.e., study area boundary [hereafter, landscape scale]) and annual area of use [95% kernel density; local scale]), and assessed effects of prescribed fire on bobcat habitat selection. Specifically, we monitored 45 bobcats (16 males and 29 females) during 2001–2007. Results: We found differential habitat selection by sex. At the landscape scale, female bobcats were closer to mixed pine-hardwoods, young pine, and secondary roads, but farther from mature pine and hardwoods stands relative to males. We found no difference in selection of agriculture, shrub-scrub, and primary roads between sexes. At the annual area of use scale, female bobcats were closer to secondary roads, but farther from agriculture and shrub-scrub relative to males. We found no difference in selection of mature pine, mixed pine-hardwoods, hardwoods, young pine, and primary roads between sexes. Bobcats primarily selected for stands burned ≤ 1.1 years post-fire. Conclusions: Our results show that bobcats exploit a broad range of habitat types in pine landscapes managed with frequent fire and commonly use recently burned stands (≤ 1.1 year post-fire), suggesting prey in many areas of this system are at risk of bobcat predation. Additionally, we suggest land managers consider scale of selection by bobcats when developing habitat management strategies. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Forest biodiversity conservation requires precise, area-wide information on the abundance and distribution of key habitat structures at multiple spatial scales. We combined airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with color-infrared (CIR) aerial imagery for identifying individual tree characteristics and quantifying multi-scale habitat requirements using the example of the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) (TTW) in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany). This bird, a keystone species of boreal and mountainous forests, is highly reliant on bark beetles dwelling in dead or dying trees. While previous studies showed a positive relationship between the TTW presence and the amount of deadwood as a limiting resource, we hypothesized a unimodal response with a negative effect of very high deadwood amounts and tested for effects of substrate quality. Based on 104 woodpecker presence or absence locations, habitat selection was modelled at four spatial scales reflecting different woodpecker home range sizes. The abundance of standing dead trees was the most important predictor, with an increase in the probability of TTW occurrence up to a threshold of 44-50 dead trees per hectare, followed by a decrease in the probability of occurrence. A positive relationship with the deadwood crown size indicated the importance of fresh deadwood. Remote sensing data allowed both an area-wide prediction of species occurrence and the derivation of ecological threshold values for deadwood quality and quantity for more informed conservation management. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={To mitigate biodiversity loss, it is essential to understand how areas altered by human land use can act as alternative habitats for functional groups of species, which are in decline. In forested landscapes, power-line clearings can be valuable habitats for early successional plant species, which in turn provide important food resources for pollinating insects. However, we know little about how management practices affect plant diversity, or how changes in species diversity translate into the functional diversity of floral resources. We conducted an experiment at 19 sites in power-line clearings across southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was (1) cut and left to decay, (2) cut and removed, or (3) uncut. We assessed the effects of treatments on species diversity (richness, evenness, diversity) and functional diversity (functional evenness, functional dispersion) of understory plant communities of insect-pollinated plants. We also investigated the influence of environmental conditions within the power-line clearings, the surrounding landscape, and climatic factors on species and functional diversity. We found that the cut and cut–remove treatments were effective in increasing biological diversity of insect-pollinated plants. The species and functional diversity showed contrasting responses to treatments, and the treatment effects depended on the environmental context. This shows that ecosystem functioning is not necessarily predictable from the ecological processes that drive species composition. The treatment effects on species diversity were partly explained by the stress-gradient hypothesis; species richness was higher in the cleared plots in areas of low environmental stress from precipitation and elevation. In contrast, the treatment effects on functional diversity were positively influenced by productivity, stem density, temperature, available source habitats, elevation, and canopy density. Functional diversity, based on effect traits, should be emphasized when the aim is to maintain a broad range of pollination functions and services in power-line clearings. This study shows that inclusion of power-line clearings in conservation plans can mitigate biodiversity decline in forested landscapes. We recommend the cut–remove treatment in productive areas with available source habitats and high stem density. In low productive areas, with high stem density and high temperatures, the standard cut treatment is sufficient, but a higher cutting frequency is recommended. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Forest structural complexity could be a good predictor of overall species diversity. Since tree harvesting has a negative effect on forest structure, it is important to analyse the effects of this disturbance on sensitive groups, as forest birds. In this study, we aimed to shed light on this aspect by analysing a set of univariate metrics in bird communities breeding in three coppiced forest habitats (coppiced of chestnut, coppiced of Turkey oak and high forest of beech) along a gradient in age classes. We hypothesised that, with increasing forest age, (i) breeding bird communities will progressively increase in diversity and, (ii) due to higher habitat heterogeneity due to coppicing, a higher species turnover in the first age classes could appear. In each forest habitat, all the metrics significantly increased, from recently coppiced to more mature forests, due to progressively higher availability of resources and niches along the gradient. When comparing paired forest habitats, abundance and richness were significantly different only in the two oldest age classes, highlighting that responses to different tree composition were more marked in the mature phase. In all forest habitats, species turnover (βw diversity) decreased progressively along the age gradient and was highest in the youngest age classes where many vegetation layers were present. Due to different coppice management practices, growth regime and consequent habitat heterogeneity, chestnuts showed a different pattern when compared to other forest habitats, with an increase in species turnover (βw diversity) at intermediate level. With increasing age of the forests, all the diversity metrics increased and species turnover decreased, highlighting the role of older forests as strategic habitats for highly structured bird communities. © Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={An increase in tree mortality is expected to occur worldwide due to climate-induced drought and increasing temperatures. The 2000–2002 drought in the southwestern United States was one of the most severe in the last 50 years. It led to a severe outbreak of bark beetles that resulted in high mortality of piñon pine (Pinus edulis) trees on the Pajarito Plateau in Northern New Mexico beginning in 2002. Many areas in piñon-juniper habitat had entire stands of piñon die leaving only juniper (Juniperus spp.). Point count surveys were used to determine avian responses to tree mortality from 2003 to 2013. We also tested whether birds responded differently in sites that were mechanically thinned in 2002 and 2003 on Los Alamos National Laboratory property compared to sites not thinned. Junipers and dead piñon pines due to bark beetles and drought were removed on thinned sites. Richness, diversity, and abundance steadily declined after 2003. There was a 73% decrease in abundance and a 45% decrease in richness from 2003 to 2013. There was no difference in community composition between thinned and unthinned sites. Bird abundance and species richness declined faster in thinned sites than unthinned sites, but diversity decreased similarly in both treatments. Several species disappeared over time and some declined substantially. Our results suggest a delay in bird responses to tree mortality on the Pajarito Plateau. Piñon mortality may be a significant threat to bird communities in the southwestern U.S., and tree thinning to control fire may be an added risk. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Land use intensification caused severe population declines in many grassland bird species. For the Corncrake, a multi-brooded, ground-breeding rail that inhabits mostly agricultural grassland, more frequent mowing at earlier dates is a threat to nests and broods and induces dispersal of adults. We used an occupancy model that allows for staggered arrival and departure times to estimate within-season movements of male Corncrakes and analysed how departure probabilities, calling site occupancy and habitat suitability were affected by land use. This study covered two study periods before (1998–2000) and after (2012–2015) a change in the local management regime. Male Corncrakes showed continuous arrival and departure during the breeding season, but delayed mowing dates reduced departure probability in the second study period, which should enhance the probability for second broods because less calling sites were affected by mowing especially during early July. Late mowing, however, implies economical losses for farmers and cessation of land use expanded. On unused meadows litter heights increased and plant species richness and forb cover declined, thus preferred habitat conditions deteriorated. Calling sites in unmanaged meadows were abandoned by male Corncrakes after few years without land use. Postponing first mowing dates until broods fledge is effective in protecting Corncrake broods, because more chicks should have survived until fledging but habitat quality depends on annual management. Because currently mowing late in the season is unattractive to farmers, we suggest that future Corncrake habitat conservation should along with financial compensations promote and evaluate the utilization of late-cut biomass for energy production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Ecotones, or transitional zones between ecosystems, are often hotspots for biodiversity and targets for conservation. Where the Great Plains meet the sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe, an opportunity exists to conserve habitat for the two most imperiled avian guilds in North America, grassland and shrub-steppe birds. This ecotone creates a unique challenge with respect to the management of disturbance processes, such as fire and grazing, because grassland and sagebrush-shrubland birds respond quite dissimilarly to disturbance. To address this management challenge and maximize conservation opportunities, we examined the responses of grassland and sagebrush bird communities to disturbance at a grassland–sagebrush ecotone in northeast Wyoming, USA. Specifically, we surveyed bird communities on active black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies and burned areas, as well as on paired undisturbed points in 2016 and 2017. Bird community structure varied in response to both the presence and type of disturbance. Although alpha diversity of avian species was highest on undisturbed sites and burned areas, only prairie dog colonies provided breeding habitat for the imperiled shortgrass-obligate mountain plover (Charadrius montanus), and species turnover (beta diversity) was greatest between on-colony and off-colony points. Furthermore, bird communities were shaped by both disturbance-dependent (e.g., disturbance age) and disturbance-independent (e.g., topography and soils) landscape features. Managers must balance the benefits of high species diversity in undisturbed sagebrush with habitat requirements of other imperiled species like the mountain plover. This may entail prioritizing the amount and distribution of disturbances in relation to population goals for species of conservation concern while simultaneously maintaining a mosaic of all three patch types in this landscape. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Forest restoration, fuel reduction, and wildlife conservation management requires understanding if, and how repeated prescribed fire, fire severity, or mechanical methods can promote goals. We examined breeding bird response to repeated fuel reduction treatments by mechanical understory reduction (twice; Mechanical-only), prescribed burning (four times; Burn-only), or mechanical understory reduction plus burning (then three subsequent burns; Mechanical + Burn). Initial burns were hotter in Mechanical + Burn than Burn-only resulting in heavy tree mortality, canopy openness, thick shrub density, and abundant snags lasting several years. Relative density and species richness of birds increased in Mechanical + Burn within three breeding seasons of high-severity burns, and remained greater throughout subsequent burns. Increases were due to an influx of species associated with young forest conditions, with little change in most mature forest species. Repeated burning in Mechanical + Burn likely impeded forest maturation, allowing many scrub-shrub bird species to persist. Species richness in Burn-only did not differ from any treatment, but modest increases over time were apparent as structural heterogeneity increased with delayed tree mortality. Cavity-nester density was highest in Mechanical + Burn, but remained high even as snags fell to pretreatment levels. Ground-nester density was lower in Mechanical + Burn than Control and Mechanical-only, but ground-nesting species responded differently. Open woodlands were not created by any treatment due to persistent re-sprouting of top-killed trees and shrubs. We note that breeding birds appear to respond similarly to high-severity burns and silvicultural treatments with heavy canopy reduction, offering possible alternatives in managing upland hardwood forests for diverse breeding bird communities. © 2018},

abstract={Due to their complex structure and traditional low-intensity management, Portuguese oak woodland rangelands known as montados are often considered high nature value (HNV) farming systems, and as such, they may be deemed eligible for subsidies and incentives by governmental and nongovernmental agencies. Too little is known about how the HNV concept might be applied to conserve complex silvopastoral systems. These systems, due to their structural and functional complexity at multiple scales, tend to support high levels of biodiversity. Montados are in sharp decline as a result of the rapid specialization of land management that, through simplification, undermines multifunctionality. Understanding how changes in management influence these systems and their biodiversity is needed for prioritizing conservation efforts and for ensuring they remain HNV systems. On the basis of a field survey in 58 plots distributed among 29 paddocks on 17 farms, we conducted an integrated analysis of the relationship between grazing intensity and biodiversity in montados of similar biophysical and structural characteristics. Data on management were obtained through interviews, and biodiversity data (vegetation, macrofungi, birds, herpetofauna) were obtained through specific field protocols. Additional spatial data, such as soil characteristics, slope, land cover, and linear landscape elements, were also analyzed. The results show no overall biodiversity variation as a result of different management practices. However, different groups of species react differently to specific management practices, and within a pasture, grazing impacts are heterogenous. In low grazing intensity plots, macrofungi species richness was found to be higher, while bird species richness was lower. Using tree regeneration as proxy for montado sustainability, results show less tree regeneration in areas with higher forage quality and more intense grazing. Pathways for future progress are proposed, including creating areas within a paddock that attract grazing away from where regeneration is desired. © 2018 The Society for Range Management},

abstract={Monitoring wildlife responses is essential to assess restoration projects. Birds are widely used as bioindicators of ecosystem restoration, but most studies use only taxonomic descriptors to compare categories of reference and restoring sites. Here, we used forest structure as a continuous predictor variable to evaluate avifaunal taxonomic and functional indicators in riparian forest reference and restoration sites on southeastern Brazil. Reference sites were riparian forest remnants, and restoration sites were pasture before seedling reintroduction. Forest structure variables (mean tree height, canopy depth, mean diameter at breast height, basal area, tree layering, tree density, and grass cover) were reduced into two axes using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Forest Axis 1 (tree biomass vs. grass cover) and Forest Axis 2 (canopy depth vs. tree density). Bird species were classified in relation to five functional categories (i.e., diet, foraging stratum, nest height, cavity dependence for nesting, and forest dependence). Forest Axis 1 influenced the functional diversity of bird assemblages and the relative abundance within levels of each functional category (except for nest height). The relative abundance of all functional categories combined was also affected by Forest Axis 2. Therefore, forest structure affected the predominant functional traits of bird species in riparian sites under restoration. Sites with higher tree biomass were the richest, with canopy birds that were insectivores and frugivores of high forest dependence, whereas more open sites were associated with birds of low forest dependence and ground-foraging insectivores. Forest structures of similar-aged sites were strongly variable, due to natural and anthropic disturbances, so restoration age was a poor indicator of forest development. These unpredictable disturbances can change the development of sites under restoration, so that forest structure can be a better descriptor of the trajectory of these ecosystems. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Ecological restoration is becoming a primary strategy to increase provisions of ecosystem services and reverse biodiversity losses. In cultural landscapes undergoing land use extensification, rewilding has been proposed as a viable approach to reverse biodiversity loss through reducing human impacts. The world's largest ecological restoration campaign is taking place on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) to combat grassland degradation and enhance the upper stream region's water retention capacity. However, little is known about whether the large-scale rewilding also benefits the unique bird assemblage of the eastern QTP. Our study aims to make science-based conservation recommendations for the Tibetan avifauna by detecting their diversity and endemism distribution patterns at the local scale. In the breeding seasons of 2014 and 2015, we carried out bird surveys and conducted a habitat mapping using three Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We developed a comprehensive set of 2D and 3D habitat feature parameters from the high-resolution (10 cm level) UAV-derived images. Meanwhile, we employed the participatory GIS approach to acquire farm-scale human land-use data. Our results indicate that the distributions of avian diversity, endemism and abundance are not congruent across the eastern QTP, which calls for the conservation of different habitat types. Vertical and horizontal habitat heterogeneity maintain the local bird diversity with anthropogenic elements significantly enriching the overall bird abundance. Degraded pastures provided key habitats for two highly abundant endemic passerines—the White-rumped Snowfinch Onychostruthus taczanowskii and the Ground Tit Pseudopodoces humilis. At the landscape scale, historical human-nature interactions between Tibetan nomads and the alpine environment formed the landscape's patchy vegetation structure. Our results reveal that the Tibetan cultural landscape maintains the structural heterogeneity needed to achieve multiple bird conservation objectives on the eastern QTP. Restoring the cultural landscape to a ‘natural’ tall-grass or dense-shrubland state of high water-retention capacity may result in the loss of both high-abundance avian communities and endemic species diversity. Our empirical study also indicated that rewilding abandoned agricultural landscape will not necessarily lead to a desired conservation outcome, especially when the requirements of habitat specialists and endemics are not taken into account. Moreover, ecological restoration projects should evaluate the divergences between their ecosystem service and biodiversity objectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Williamson's Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus thyroideus) are montane woodpeckers threatened by widespread tree removal activities and climate change. Current forest management plans focus on nesting trees, but the incorporation of foraging trees would lead to a more effective management strategy to mitigate habitat loss for this species. We investigated the selection of foraging trees in forests managed for timber extraction and maintenance of wildlife values using foraging observations of 27 radio-tagged adult Williamson's Sapsuckers during the breeding season in 2 regions (Okanagan and Western) of their limited Canadian range. Characteristics of foraging trees (88% of observations on live trees, 11% on dead trees) differed with foraging mode. Large, live Douglas-firs (Pseudotsuga menziesii; ≥22.5 cm dbh) were used for gleaning and sap feeding on tree trunks in both regions, whereas trees used for trunk pecking were mostly large, senescent western larches (Larix occidentalis) in the Okanagan region and large, dead ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) in the Western region (average dbh = 46 cm). For overall foraging activities, Williamson's Sapsuckers selected large, live Douglas-firs with signs of resin exudation and blistering (pitching), and avoided live lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta), quaking aspens (Populus tremuloides), and ponderosa pines. Larger trees and standing dead conifer trees were reused more often for foraging than smaller and live trees. The quality of Williamson's Sapsucker habitat could decrease over the long term if forest management practices reduce the overall size of trees or alter tree species composition to promote lodgepole pine. Forest management should focus on retaining and promoting large live Douglas-fir trees and large senescent or standing dead conifers (also used for nesting), which can be achieved by using thinning, prescribed fire, partial harvesting, and tree retention strategies. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Forests world-wide are increasingly subject to natural and human disturbances, including wildfires and logging of varying intensity and frequency. Understanding how biodiversity responds to different kinds and combinations of natural and human disturbance is critical to enhanced forest management. We completed an 8-year study of bird responses across a spectrum of disturbance types in Australian mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests following wildfires in 2009. We found evidence of a gradient in bird species richness over the study duration. It was highest in unlogged and unburned (least disturbed) sites, decreasing through burnt unlogged forest (subject to high or low intensity fire), lower still in logged forest, and lowest in the most disturbed sites (subject to salvage logging without island retention). Retention of uncut islands within logged areas increased bird species richness above that found in areas that had been clearcut. The greatest rate of increase per year after disturbance in bird species richness was on sites burnt by high-severity fire but which were not subject to any form of logging. The level of disturbance affected the composition of the bird assemblage. Sites that were unlogged and unburned were more likely to support species that were larger, more mobile, and nested at greater heights above the ground. Synthesis and applications. All forms of logging on burned sites impaired recovery in bird species richness relative to sites subject to high-severity fire. Alterations in stand structure and plant species composition (and hence modification in bird habitat suitability) due to logging are the most likely reasons for reduced bird species richness and delayed patterns of recovery. This study highlights the importance for native bird species of retaining patches of unlogged forest not only within otherwise clearcut forest, but also in areas that are burned and subject to salvage logging. We therefore suggest that the adoption of retention harvesting be expanded to include stands disturbed by wildfires. © 2018 The Authors. Journal of Applied Ecology © 2018 British Ecological Society},

abstract={Chaparral, a type of shrubland common throughout the California Floristic Province, is subject to management and removal in regions where wildfire threatens human lives and property. Management practices include conducting prescribed burns outside of the historical fire season and employing mechanical fuel reduction (mastication). As the wildland–urban interface grows, particularly in coastal California, more of this ecosystem is subject to active management. To understand the ecological implications of current California chaparral fire management practices, we studied bird species composition, abundance and foraging guilds in managed and unmanaged chaparral over 5 years. Study areas were located in Mendocino County in the coast ranges of northern California. We contrast six chaparral removal or “fuels manipulation” treatments: (1) fall fire, (2) winter fire, (3) spring fire, (4) fall mastication, (5) spring mastication and (6) untreated control. Treatments and controls were implemented in plots 2 ha or larger, and replicated four times each. We find that species richness in prescribed fire treatments reaches comparable levels to controls in the first 3 years following treatment, whereas masticated units always have lower species richness. Generalized linear mixed models additionally confirm that mastication has highly negative effects on observed abundances of birds compared to controls and to prescribed fire. The season in which fuels reduction occurred was less important to species richness, although fall fire was more beneficial to bird abundance than spring or winter fire. Fire treatments in all seasons maintain the same general bird community structure as controls, while mastication results in strongly differentiated assemblages, increasing granivores while nearly excluding foliage gleaners. Synthesis and applications. We compare two California chaparral management techniques, prescribed fire and mastication, in three seasons (fall, winter and spring) in northern California, USA. We tracked chaparral bird community response in 23 experimental units for 2–5 years. We conclude that prescribed fire and mastication are not interchangeable management techniques, and that mastication negatively impacts bird communities, altering guild structure and reducing both diversity and abundance. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={In a mountain context, the forest-shrub ecotone is an area of high biodiversity. Relatively little is known about the habitat requirements of birds in this habitat, yet it is facing potential threats from changes in grazing practices and climate change. Moreover, it is not clear at which scale habitat associations should be assessed in Alpine birds. Further information on key habitat components affecting bird communities of the ecotone is needed in order to inform management strategies to counteract potential habitat loss, and to better inform predictions of how bird communities may be affected by future environmental change. Data on bird occurrence and broadscale (land cover) and finescale (vegetation structure and shrub species composition) habitat variables were collected in an Alpine forest-shrub ecotone in Val Troncea (northwestern Italian Alps) in order to address two objectives: to identify the key habitat variables associated with the occurrence of individual species and with the diversity of the bird community; and, to assess which scale of habitat measurement (broadscale, finescale or both combined) is needed to model bird occurrence. Broadscale variables, or combinations of broadscale and finescale variables, tended to have the best performing models. When combined models performed best, shrub species identity was included in many cases. Shrubs also played an important role in explaining variations in species diversity and richness. Vegetation structure was of relatively little importance, either for individual bird species or for species richness and diversity. These findings suggest that management should strive to maintain a mosaic of habitats whilst minimizing forest encroachment, which could be achieved through targeted grazing. Broadscale habitat data and data on shrub species composition should provide a sufficient basis for identifying relevant species-specific habitat parameters in a mountain environment in order to model future scenarios of effects of habitat change on the bird community of the alpine forest-shrub ecotone. © 2018, Dt.

abstract={One response to biodiversity decline is the definition of ecological networks that extend beyond protected areas and promote connectivity in human-dominated landscapes. In farmland, landscape ecological research has focused more on wooded than open habitat networks. In our study, we assessed the influence of permanent grassland connectivity, described by grassland amount and spatial configuration, on grassland biodiversity. We selected permanent grasslands in livestock farming areas of north-western France, which were sampled for plants, carabids and birds. At two spatial scales we tested the effects of amount and configuration of grasslands, wooded habitats and crops on richness and abundance of total assemblages and species ecological groups. Grassland connectivity had no significant effects on total richness or abundance of any taxonomic group, regardless of habitat affinity or dispersal ability. The amount of wooded habitat and length of wooded edges at the 200 m scale positively influenced forest and generalist animal groups as well as grassland plant species, in particular animal-dispersed species. However, for animal groups such as open habitat carabids or farmland bird specialists, the same wooded habitats negatively influenced richness and abundance at the 500 m scale. The scale and direction of biodiversity responses to landscape context were therefore similar among taxonomic groups, but opposite for habitat affinity groups. We conclude that while grassland connectivity is unlikely to contribute positively to biodiversity, increasing or maintaining wooded elements near grasslands would be a worthwhile conservation goal. However, the requirements of open farmland animal species groups must be considered, for which such action may be deleterious. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Land use change alters species' abundance and distributions by affecting habitat availability and quality. The decline of bird populations worldwide is of major concern, and habitat protection and restoration are primary conservation actions. However, conservation decisions largely consider only short-term habitat changes and species’ population dynamics in a given area. Disregarding long term modifications in species’ available habitat, and the role of a given population for a species’ global population may lead to misdirected conservation action. Our goal here was to combine the assessment of conservation responsibility, with that of century-long available habitat dynamics, in order to inform better conservation practice. We compiled available habitat data for 170 bird species in the Carpathian Region from 1860 to 2010 from historic maps and satellite data. We analyzed these species’ range distributions, IUCN extinction risk and population trends, and we identified 29 species of high conservation responsibility, and all of them were forest or and grassland specialists. Furthermore, we found major land use trends including cropland abandonment and increase in forests and grasslands that resulted in increases in potential habitat for the species for which the Carpathians have high conservation responsibility. The loss of row-crop agriculture, on the other hand, reduced habitat for species for which the Carpathians do not have high responsibility, and thus subsidizing agriculture may not be warranted from a conservation perspective. More broadly, many regions worldwide are undergoing rapid land use changes, and we suggest that these should be analyzed relative to a given regions’ conservation responsibility to see if there are opportunities for conservation, i.e., cases similar to the Carpathians, where conservation efforts ‘only’ have to foster current land use trends, and make them permanent, rather than to try to revert the loss of habitat. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The Black Hills population of black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) was petitioned, but deemed not warranted, to be listed as a threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act and more information on their population size in the region is needed. Our objective was to map abundance and provide a population estimate of black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains of South Dakota and Wyoming, USA. We conducted 3,666 and 3,384 5-minute point count surveys from late-March to late-June in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We characterized vegetation around each point using geographic information system-derived landscape variables and fit 3-level hierarchical time-removal models in R package unmarked using gmultmix. The global abundance model received the most support and included year, latitude, and percent area of green trees, beetle-killed trees, dead trees, 1- to 2-year-old wildfire, 3-year-old wildfire, and 4- to 5-year-old wildfire. Points with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees had the greatest density of black-backed woodpeckers, followed by 1- to 2-year-old wildfires. After 4 years, areas burned by wildfire supported lower densities of black-backed woodpeckers than undisturbed forests. Mean density was 0.528 birds/km2 in 2015 and 0.626 birds/km2 in 2016. There were an estimated 2,920 and 3,439 black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We suggest areas with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees may support high densities of black-backed woodpeckers and are important to sustaining populations when the availability of recent (&lt;4 years old) wildfire is declining or scarce.

abstract={Non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire may help explain how pyrodiversity promotes biodiversity in fire-adapted systems. We built on previous research on avian responses to fire by investigating how complex effects of burn severity and time since fire influenced avian community composition across the northern Sierra Nevada, California. We conducted avian point counts from 2009 to 2015 in 10 fires that burned between 2000 and 2014, resulting in a chronosequence of 1–15 yr post-fire. We estimated the effects of burn severity, time since fire, non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire, pre-fire forest conditions, and several physiographic parameters on the density of 44 breeding bird species using hierarchical distance sampling models. In addition, we fit separate models to observations of each species in unburned forest to compare species’ densities between burned and unburned forests. At least one of the non-linear or interaction fire effects was significant for 27 (61%) of the 44 bird species. The quadratic effect of time since fire was an important predictor of post-fire densities of 20 species, illustrating the dynamic nature of this post-wildfire avian community. Greater maximum densities were estimated at some combination of burn severity and time since fire than in unburned forest for 13 of the 44 (30%) species, only one of which reached maximum density following low-severity fire. In contrast, all of the 12 species that were more abundant in unburned forest reached maximum post-fire densities in fires that burned at low severity. Results from the study suggest that consideration of the non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire is important to fully understanding post-wildfire responses for a majority of birds. Moreover, the study supports a growing body of literature that indicates mixed-severity fire is essential for conserving avian diversity in many fire-maintained systems. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Restoration projects are often implemented to address specific issues in the environment. Consequences of a restoration project, if any are measured, typically focus on direct changes to the projects focus. However, changing habitat structure likely results in changes to the environment that affect the communities living there. Rock weirs have been used for channel stabilization in many midwestern rivers. Previous research in a southern Illinois river found that weirs benefitted aquatic macroinvertebrate and riparian bird communities by enhancing habitat heterogeneity and insect emergence production. We hypothesized that fishes would also benefit from weirs through enhanced habitat and food availability. We collected fishes in the Cache River in southern Illinois using hand nets, seines, and electroshocking at sites where weirs had been installed and at non-weir sites. Gut contents were identified and individual food items measured. Fish species richness, but not diversity, was higher at weir sites. Fish communities also differed between site types, with benthic feeders characterizing weir sites. Gut content biomass and abundance differed among fish guilds but not between weir and non-weir sites. Fishes from both site types selected for prey taxa predominately found at weirs. Differences between site types were not always captured by univariate metrics, but connecting fish prey to habitat suggests a reach-scale benefit for fishes through increased abundance of favored prey and enhanced prey diversity. Additionally, given the paucity of rocky substrata in the river as a whole, rock weirs enhance fish species richness by providing habitat for less common benthic species. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This overview of relationships between biodiversity and management focuses on Central European Fagus forests. Present management and conservation activities are embedded in the geographic and historic background of Central European forest flora, including endangered, protected, and plant species for which Germany has taken special responsibility to ensure their future survival. Managed and unmanaged forests are compared with respect to plants and other organisms. Based on the floristic background, management for climate change and consequences of conservation on a global ecological footprint will be discussed. The Central European tree flora contains only about 7% of the tree diversity of East Asia. Only a few genera re-migrated to Central Europe after the Pleistocene, while others were lost during the Pleistocene, e.g. the genus Pseudotsuga. In this study the forest flora is characterized by specialized plant species that only grow in forests. These forest specialists contribute only 10% of the plant species of the total German flora. This fraction is even less (4–5%) for Romania which is generally regarded as a region with close to “natural” forest conditions. Also, the forest flora of Germany and Romania contains fewer apomictic and hybrid plant species than the non-forest flora. No forest plant species have gone extinct in Germany in the past 250 years, which is the time since the first floristic documentation of a plant species that was lost in Thuringia, despite intense forest use including changes in dominant tree species. With respect to the Natura 2000 goals of maintaining species diversity of Europe, the deciduous forest, as managed by rotation forestry, contain more protected and endangered species, and species for which Germany has taken responsibility than protected forest. Forests managed with permanent forest cover (so-called “management close-to-nature”) contain fewer plant species than age-class (rotation) forestry. The abundance of dead wood-fungi and of soil bacteria is higher in rotation forest than in protected forests. For the initial phase of decay, a dead wood experiment identified two important tree species, Carpinus betulus and Picea abies, as the most preferred tree species for xylobionts. Carpinus has the most diverse fungal flora among all wood types and is a typical species for managed forests. The Natura 2000 habitat types were defined by plant species, but the assessment of ecosystem health is based on bird species in Central Europe. A time series extending from 1927 until 2015 indicates that most non-migratory forest bird species show an increasing abundance since 1970. Adding migrating and rare bird species populations resulted in constant average abundances since 1970. There is no evidence that sustainable forest management has led to decreased biodiversity in Central Europe. In view of climate change and increasing presence of tree diseases, Europe should avoid enlarging its ecological footprint by taking Central European forests out of management. © 2017},

abstract={Community-level climate change indicators have been proposed to appraise the impact of global warming on community composition. However, non-climate factors may also critically influence species distribution and biological community assembly. The aim of this paper was to study how fire–vegetation dynamics can modify our ability to predict the impact of climate change on bird communities, as described through a widely-used climate change indicator: the community thermal index (CTI). Potential changes in bird species assemblage were predicted using the spatially-explicit species assemblage modelling framework – SESAM – that applies successive filters to constrained predictions of richness and composition obtained by stacking species distribution models that hierarchically integrate climate change and wildfire–vegetation dynamics. We forecasted future values of CTI between current conditions and 2050, across a wide range of fire–vegetation and climate change scenarios. Fire–vegetation dynamics were simulated for Catalonia (Mediterranean basin) using a process-based model that reproduces the spatial interaction between wildfire, vegetation dynamics and wildfire management under two IPCC climate scenarios. Net increases in CTI caused by the concomitant impact of climate warming and an increasingly severe wildfire regime were predicted. However, the overall increase in the CTI could be partially counterbalanced by forest expansion via land abandonment and efficient wildfire suppression policies. CTI is thus strongly dependent on complex interactions between climate change and fire–vegetation dynamics. The potential impacts on bird communities may be underestimated if an overestimation of richness is predicted but not constrained. Our findings highlight the need to explicitly incorporate these interactions when using indicators to interpret and forecast climate change impact in dynamic ecosystems. In fire-prone systems, wildfire management and land-use policies can potentially offset or heighten the effects of climate change on biological communities, offering an opportunity to address the impact of global climate change proactively. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Context: In agricultural landscapes, small woodland patches can be important wildlife refuges. Their value in maintaining biodiversity may, however, be compromised by isolation, and so knowledge about the role of habitat structure is vital to understand the drivers of diversity. This study examined how avian diversity and abundance were related to habitat structure in four small woods in an agricultural landscape in eastern England. Objectives: The aims were to examine the edge effect on bird diversity and abundance, and the contributory role of vegetation structure. Specifically: what is the role of vegetation structure on edge effects, and which edge structures support the greatest bird diversity? Methods: Annual breeding bird census data for 28 species were combined with airborne lidar data in linear mixed models fitted separately at (i) the whole wood level, and (ii) for the woodland edges only. Results: Despite relatively small woodland areas (4.9–9.4 ha), bird diversity increased significantly towards the edges, being driven in part by vegetation structure. At the whole woods level, diversity was positively associated with increased vegetation above 0.5 m and especially with increasing vegetation density in the understorey layer, which was more abundant at the woodland edges. Diversity along the edges was largely driven by the density of vegetation below 4 m. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that bird diversity was maximised by a diverse vegetation structure across the wood and especially a dense understorey along the edge. These findings can assist bird conservation by guiding habitat management of remaining woodland patches. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={The impact of forest management on the ecology of natural Chamaecyparis (cypress) forests previously caused momentous disputes in Taiwan. However, the scientific questions behind this issue have never been settled and thus require further investigations. This study was conducted in the Chilanshan area of northeastern Taiwan, where there is a long history of forest management, and extensive natural Chamaecyparis forests are still preserved. We investigated the ground vegetation and naturally regenerating seedlings in stands under 4 different management regimes to compare their plant diversity and tree regeneration. Our results showed that the diversity of ground vegetation was higher in the old-growth forest where snags and logs had previously been harvested, while the diversity of tree seedlings was higher in the natural old-growth forest. The lowest diversities of ground vegetation and seedlings were both observed in the naturally regenerated stand established after selective cutting. The natural old-growth forest was also distinct from the other stand types in terms of the species composition. The natural regeneration of seedlings significantly differed among stand types. The natural old-growth forest contained the greatest amount of both cypress seedlings (all of which were Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana; 87%) and overall seedlings (77%). Moreover, 91% of cypress seedlings were established on coarse woody debris, revealing a distinct substrate preference from the other species. Our study indicated long-term impacts of management regimes on the ground vegetation and natural regeneration in Chamaecyparis forests. After 20~40 yr of recovery, stands that had experienced management practices were still dissimilar to natural old-growth forests. Therefore, we would argue that natural old-growth forests should be protected and ecologically monitored, and that old-growth forests where snags and logs had previously been removed could offer various vegetation stages to create more-heterogeneous habitats and thus enhance the overall biological diversity. As for plantations and naturally regenerated stands, middle- or later-stage tending practices should promptly be applied to improve tree growth and stand conditions. © 2018 Editio Cantor Verlag GmbH.

abstract={Worldwide species density of bats is highest in forests ecosystems. European primeval forests are now reduced to a few small and isolated patches because almost all forests are subject to management. Therefore, knowledge about bats in ancient and near-natural forests in Europe is scarce. In the well-preserved forest stands of the Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park in Belarus we studied the bat community (1), the presence of maternity colonies and their preference in tree roost selection (2) and parameters of roosts used by forest dwelling bats (3). By mist-netting surveys, we identified 13 bat species and acoustic data suggested the presence of another three species. We detected 15 maternity colonies of seven bat species by radio-tracking reproductive females and 40 tree roosts within the forest. Roosts of Barbastella barbastellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Plecotus auritus were almost exclusively behind the loose tree bark of decaying trees, or within narrow crevices. Myotis nattereri and Nyctalus leisleri showed a preference towards hollows (e.g., woodpecker-made cavities) within oak trees (Quercus robur). Our study shows that all tree-dwelling bat species are highly dependent on natural processes within forests that allow the formation of roost sites. Therefore, we strongly support that the natural aging process of trees, as well as the consequences of natural disturbance (e.g. through weather), should be permitted. This should extend beyond the protected zones of National Parks. In contrast, sanitary cuttings decrease the habitat's suitability for forest-dwelling bats. Finally, our results indicate that the forest complex of Belovezhskaya Pushcha and Białowieża is one of the most important bat areas in Europe. © Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.},

abstract={The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a snag-associated species that colonizes and utilizes patches of burned forests typically within 10 years of fire. Previous research has indicated that salvage logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species. In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following logging operations that covered 45% of the burned area. We systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year, which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed Woodpeckers postlogging. © 2018 by the author(s).},

abstract={Birds are considered a good model for indicators of biodiversity response to habitat variations, as they are very sensitive to environmental change. However, continuous observations of habitat alterations from undisturbed landscapes to human-dominated ones, as well as the associated effects on bird biodiversity, are lacking. In this study, New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai, China was selected to illustrate the response of bird species, and thus biodiversity, to habitat loss and fragmentation. Land use/land cover (LULC) data and bird records from 2002 to 2013 were collected and analyzed. The results suggested that, due to urban sprawl, the area of wetland and shrub land had dropped by 82.4% and 87.3% by the end of 2013. Four different urbanization stages were identified in terms of the spatio-temporal variations in the landscape. To measure bird biodiversity, species richness and relative abundance were calculated, and they could account for the overall trend in biodiversity but might mask the process of species replacement. As an indicator of biodiversity accounting, the mean species abundance (MSA) of the original species would not include exotic or invasive species in its calculation, and its value decreased from 100% to 76.8% to 52.2% to 24.5% in the four corresponding stages. Finally, suggested by redundant analysis, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bird biodiversity differed in various bird communities, and the area and connectivity of wetlands were the most significant variables. Our findings could provide important information to inform bird biodiversity protection and habitat restoration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Landscapes are showing increased fragmentation and habitat loss due to land-use conversion and intensification, leading to species-poor and homogeneous communities. The identification of ecological thresholds above which major changes in community composition take place, may prevent the critical downfall of biodiversity while improving the effectiveness of conservation, resource management and restoration practices. In this study, we provide a new insight on how species distribute along a highly variegated agro-ecosystem in the Mediterranean region. We aim to define the thresholds of occurrence of a bird community inhabiting a tree canopy gradient, and determine the patterns of community change. We fit Huisman-Olff-Fresco models to bird occurrence data (assuming non-linear responses) to identify species-specific responses to the gradient, species richness, and turnover patterns. The tree canopy gradient is responsible for major changes in bird community likely related to the variation of the tree stratum and canopy enclosure which reflect different niche segregation opportunities. Maximum species richness was reached at 10% canopy cover while total turnover rate was higher than expected from a null model up to 10% canopy cover. Ecological thresholds can be used as indicators of specific resource limits responsible for changes in community composition and species occurrence, identifying where populations may be more sensitive. Choosing a single management scheme will invariably result in winners and losers, but optimal levels of management can be explored in order to maximize species diversity across Mediterranean agro-ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Disturbances are important natural factors affecting biological diversity, community composition, and ecosystem structure. The European ground squirrel is a semi-fossorial organism, and through disturbances caused by burrowing activities, it can play an important role as an ecosystem engineer of grasslands in central and south-eastern Europe. The aim of this study was to assess the response of grassland vegetation to disturbances by the European ground squirrel. We conducted a pairwise survey within a 1-ha study site with homogenous environmental conditions. We compared the vegetation characteristics of 2 × 2-m plots placed on 30 mounds, with paired control plots situated at a distance of 10 m from each mound. The results showed that plots disturbed by the European ground squirrel achieved a higher species richness and diversity and a distinct species composition compared to the undisturbed control plots. Vertical structure of vegetation was also significantly different with a higher proportion of the high and medium vegetation layers on the mounds. Shifts in the composition of plant life forms and life strategies were reflected by the reduction of graminoids and plant competitors, and support of forbs on the mounds. These findings suggest that the European ground squirrel helps to maintain heterogeneity in grassland ecosystems and creates patches of higher diversity and higher structural complexity in the relatively homogenous grassland vegetation of the Western Carpathians. © 2017, Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Białowieża, Poland.},

abstract={We studied how interactions between disturbances, succession, human alterations and other habitat and landscape attributes affect bird community patterns in a lower reach of a large West Carpathian river Váh with complex disturbance and alteration histories. Breeding-bird communities, their habitats (54 variables) and surrounding landscapes (11 metrics) were sampled using standardized point counts with limited distances at 40 riparian sites divided among two transects along a 12.9 km river stretch. The most frequent and abundant birds were generalists typically associated with forest edge habitats, such as Parus major, Sylvia atricapilla, Fringilla coelebs, Oriolus oriolus, Phylloscopus collybita, Sturnus vulgaris, Turdus merula and Luscinia megarhynchos. Abundances show significant increase at the lower transect responding apparently to greater size and heterogeneity of riparian habitats and more abundant food supply linked to more diverse and intense human influences in a suburban zone. Both indirect (NMDS) and direct ordination (CCA) revealed remarkably large number of evenly important factors underlying riparian bird-habitat interactions. It suggests considerable environmental heterogeneity and complexity of these interactions as a likely outcome of long and complex disturbance and alteration histories of the area. Yet structure and relative importance of first two gradients (longitudinal and lateral linkages) remains simple and stable, complying well with predictions of river continuum concept and stream ecosystem theory. Of the nine statistically significant variables most strongly correlated with first two CCA axes, percentages of Helianthus tuberosus, footpaths, fields, Calystegia sepium and steep banks uphold our hypotheses predicting significant effects of invasive species, visitor disturbances, agricultural land use and unaltered river banks/bed on bird community composition and structure. A small but significant contribution of patch size standard deviation within a 150 m radius to the CCA model provides the sole evidence for a hypothesized effect of adjacent terrestrial landscapes on riparian bird communities over different scales of patch size variability. Percentages of fields, invasive species and vertical banks along with average tree diameter were also the most productive predictors across our generalized linear models of riparian bird species diversity, evenness and abundance. Adopting an integrated river basin management, maintaining or restoring both longitudinal and lateral connectivity, taking advantage of natural processes and traditional management practices to maintain or restore riverine biodiversity can be recommended by our data in support of more systematic and evidence-based decision-making. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Ecosystem function and resilience are compromised when habitats become fragmented due to land-use change. This has led to national and international conservation strategies aimed at restoring habitat extent and improving functional connectivity (i.e., maintaining dispersal processes). However, biodiversity responses to landscape-scale habitat creation and the relative importance of spatial and temporal scales are poorly understood, and there is disagreement over which conservation strategies should be prioritized. We used 160 years of historic post-agricultural woodland creation as a natural experiment to evaluate biodiversity responses to habitat creation in a landscape context. Birds were surveyed in 101 secondary, broadleaf woodlands aged 10–160 years with ≥80% canopy cover and in landscapes with 0-17% broadleaf woodland cover within 3000 m. We used piecewise structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect relationships between bird abundance and diversity, ecological continuity, patch characteristics, and landscape structure and quantified the relative conservation value of local and landscape scales for bird communities. Ecological continuity indirectly affected overall bird abundance and species richness through its effects on stand structure, but had a weaker influence (effect size near 0) on the abundance and diversity of species most closely associated with woodland habitats. This was probably because woodlands were rapidly colonized by woodland generalists in ≤10 years (minimum patch age) but were on average too young (median 50 years) to be colonized by woodland specialists. Local patch characteristics were relatively more important than landscape characteristics for bird communities. Based on our results, biodiversity responses to habitat creation depended on local- and landscape-scale factors that interacted across time and space. We suggest that there is a need for further studies that focus on habitat creation in a landscape context and that knowledge gained from studies of habitat fragmentation and loss should be used to inform habitat creation with caution because the outcomes are not necessarily reciprocal. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={The Convention on Biological Diversity’s Aichi Target 15 requires global restoration of degraded ecosystems including complex examples. A case is made for the deliberate creation of woodlands with ancient characteristics. In the temperate biome, efforts to restore such communities will be accelerated by intervention facilitating natural succession. Negative rhetoric regarding the irreplaceability of ancient communities may hinder such considerations. Some facets of ancient woods are irreplaceable and their destruction is discouraged. Nevertheless, as human population and impact increase, this resource will degrade. Though understanding of many ecological processes is incomplete, ecological restoration requires proactivity. Physicians need not fully understand the healing process to rely upon it and, fortunately, ecology carries similar intangible reliables; natural succession occurs and complex communities actively self-assemble. Accepting this, then woodland with many characteristics of ancientness can be deliberately created. Thermodynamic principles may assist and seeking to initiate a biodiversity cascade is proposed as a pragmatic approach. The intricacy that defines ancient woodland might thus be assembled in timescales of less than a century. Ascension Island’s anthropogenic cloud forest provides a precedent. For utilitarian purposes, human-mediated plant dispersal (deliveries of plants to the island), led to the transformation of species-poor, fern-dominated hillsides to species–rich cloud forest in about 100 years.

abstract={Environmental pollution is an important driver of biodiversity loss. Yet, to date, the effects of chemical exposure on wildlife populations have been quantified for only a few species, mainly due to a lack of appropriate laboratory data to quantify chemical impacts on vital rates. In this study, we developed a method to quantify the effects of toxicant exposure on wildlife population persistence based on field monitoring data. We established field-based vital-rate-response functions for toxicants, using quantile regression to correct for the influences of confounding factors on the vital rates observed, and combined the response curves with population viability modelling. We then applied the method to quantify the impact of DDE on three bird species: the White-tailed Eagle, Bald Eagle, and Osprey. Population viability was expressed via five population extinction vulnerability metrics: population growth rate (r1), critical patch size (CPS), minimum viable population size (MVP), probability of population extirpation (PE), and median time to population extirpation (MTE). We found that past DDE exposure concentrations increased population extirpation vulnerabilities of all three bird species. For example, at DDE concentrations of 25 mg/kg wet mass of egg (the maximum historic exposure concentration reported in literature for the Osprey), r1 became small (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey) or close to zero (Bald Eagle), the CPS increased up to almost the size of Connecticut (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey) or West Virginia (Bald Eagle), the MVP increased up to approximately 90 (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey) or 180 breeding pairs (Bald Eagle), the PE increased up to almost certain extirpation (Bald Eagle) or only slightly elevated levels (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey) and the MTE became within decades (Bald Eagle) or remained longer than a millennium (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey). Our study provides a method to derive species-specific field-based response curves of toxicant exposure, which can be used to assess population extinction vulnerabilities and obtain critical levels of toxicant exposure based on maximum permissible effect levels. This may help conservation managers to better design appropriate habitat restoration and population recovery measures, such as reducing toxicant levels, increasing the area of suitable habitat or reintroducing individuals. © 2018 The Authors Ecological Applications published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Despite the fact that the structure of a forest, its vegetation composition and the species diversity in its tree stands are among the key factors shaping avian communities in forests in general, there are few studies on this topic relating to the deciduous forests of Central and East-Central Europe. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the relationship between the forest structure and the occurrence of common chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, common chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and Eurasian blackcap Sylvia atricapilla, and also investigate habitat occupancy as expressed by territory size, in certain areas of NW Poland. The hypothesis tested was that if a habitat is rich, then the territory should be smaller. The mean territory size was 0.704 ha in the case of F. coelebs, 0.307 ha for P. sibilatrix, 0.148 ha for P. collybita and 0.312 ha for S. atricapilla. The use of a generalised linear mixed model demonstrated statistically significant relationships between the environmental variables and the territory size of the target bird species, the number of trees being the most significant environmental variable positively correlated with the territory size of birds. With regard to the canopy, a statistically significant negative relationship was demonstrated between the environmental variables and the territory size, whereas in the case of shrubs it was positive. The obtained results indicate need to restore the diversified structure of beech forests by ensuring the heterogeneity of forest stands, to increase avian diversity in managed forests. © 2017 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.},

abstract={Summary Knowledge of a species' ecological requirements is a prerequisite for effective conservation, particularly if the species is assumed to be declining due to modification of its primary habitats. Information about habitat suitability allows both the inference of specific habitat management measures as well as population size estimates which can facilitate the setting up of conservation priorities. As one of the least known Palaearctic breeding birds, the current knowledge of Baillon's Crake Zapornia pusilla comprises only very general information about the species' ecological requirements, habitat selection, extent and dynamics of home ranges or population densities within its Palaearctic-Afrotropical range. We used a multi-scale approach to assess the species' habitat requirements in the Senegal River Delta, north-west Senegal. At the individual level, we calculated Manly selection indices for 17 radio-tracked Baillon's Crakes, allowing for different levels of resource availability. Considering the entire Djoudj area including the Parc National des Oiseaux du Djoudj (PNOD), we modelled presence probability as well as population density of Baillon's Crakes based on high-resolution satellite images and capture data from field surveys in 2009-2013. Using 95% kernels, home range size was on average 1.77 ± 0.86 ha with significant differences between habitats. Both at the individual as well as population level, Baillon's Crakes preferred edge structures, selecting for trampling paths and edges along open water bodies as well as boundaries of specific vegetation stands while species composition was of less importance. Based on the regression models, we identified 9,516 ha of suitable habitat within the Djoudj area and a potential population size of 10,714 individuals (range 3,146-17,408). Although global population estimates are highly tentative, we assume the Senegal River Delta and the PNOD of outstanding significance for African and possibly also European populations of Baillon's Crake.

abstract={Impacts on birds of intensive management practices and of landscape simplification have been widely studied, but there is a lack of knowledge about impacts on birds of landscapes associated with intensive livestock production. The objective of this work was to investigate changes in several bird community descriptors along different production gradients. Production of arable crops and from grazing livestock was computed over French agroecosystems and expressed in terms of edible energy. Using data from the French Breeding Bird Survey along with data from national agricultural statistics, we modeled the relationship between production and five bird community descriptors, namely, community trophic index, community specialization index, and three group-specific species richness indices. Bird communities were shaped by two production gradients. Along a gradient of increasing crop production, we observed a shift from locally species-diverse communities dominated by generalist or grassland specialist species towards species-poor communities dominated by granivorous species specialized in arable habitats (all p-values ≤ 0.002). Second, we observed a shift towards homogenized communities dominated by generalists along a gradient of increasing livestock production (p-values ≤ 0.001). Our research highlights the need to consider crop and livestock separately when investigating their impacts on biodiversity. It also hints towards the need for differentiated strategies to protect farmland birds in crop regions and in livestock regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Biodiversity in agricultural environments is considered to be undergoing steep declines in most European countries. Among taxa which experienced consistent decreases, birds are of central importance, both for their value as ecological indicators and for the high number of species of conservation concern associated with agricultural ecosystems. In this paper, using data from the Italian Common Breeding Bird monitoring programme collected in the period 2009–2014, we analysed the effect on breeding birds of four Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) in Emilia-Romagna region, one of the most important agricultural areas of Italy. Specifically we compared the values of three community parameters (total, farmland and generalist species richness) and the abundance of seven species (Alauda arvensis, Hirundo rustica, Motacilla flava, Serinus serinus, Chloris chloris, Carduelis carduelis and Passer montanus) in areas covered by AES and not. The results of the analyses show that, at the scale we investigated, the positive effects of these measures are very limited and often not positive, particularly for farmland specialist species. These findings seem to suggest that the application of these measures, albeit widespread over the Region, is not able to counteract the negative effects of the simplification and impoverishment of the agricultural landscape. Our results show the AES management related more with single species metrics than community measures. Therefore to improve the effectiveness of AES, and to try to contrasts the dramatic decline of farmland bird species, we think these schemes should be designed on the specific needs of species and habitats of high conservation priority. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Forests are the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems and their biological diversity includes trees, but also other plants, animals, and micro-organisms. One-third of the forested land is in boreal zone; therefore, changes in biological diversity in boreal forests can shape biodiversity, even at global scale. Several forest attributes, including size variability, amount of dead wood, and tree species richness, can be applied in assessing biodiversity of a forest ecosystem. Remote sensing offers complimentary tool for traditional field measurements in mapping and monitoring forest biodiversity. Recent development of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable the detailed characterization of forest ecosystems through providing data with high spatial but also temporal resolution at reasonable costs. The objective here is to deepen the knowledge about assessment of plot-level biodiversity indicators in boreal forests with hyperspectral imagery and photogrammetric point clouds from a UAV. We applied individual tree crown approach (ITC) and semi-individual tree crown approach (semi-ITC) in estimating plot-level biodiversity indicators. Structural metrics from the photogrammetric point clouds were used together with either spectral features or vegetation indices derived from hyperspectral imagery. Biodiversity indicators like the amount of dead wood and species richness were mainly underestimated with UAV-based hyperspectral imagery and photogrammetric point clouds. Indicators of structural variability (i.e., standard deviation in diameter-at-breast height and tree height) were the most accurately estimated biodiversity indicators with relative RMSE between 24.4% and 29.3% with semi-ITC. The largest relative errors occurred for predicting deciduous trees (especially aspen and alder), partly due to their small amount within the study area. Thus, especially the structural diversity was reliably predicted by integrating the three-dimensional and spectral datasets of UAV-based point clouds and hyperspectral imaging, and can therefore be further utilized in ecological studies, such as biodiversity monitoring. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={With ongoing degradation of natural forests and spread of forest plantations, plantations must play an increasingly important role in biodiversity conservation. Study of habitat selection and reproductive success of surrogate species in plantations can guide forest management decisions for increasing biodiversity. In this paper we studied the suitability of exotic Eucalyptus plantations managed at low intensity in northwestern Spain as breeding habitat for Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), a top predator frequently considered a surrogate species in conservation. Goshawks showed high breeding density, high reproductive success and a regular spatial distribution of nesting territories. Territoriality was the most important determinant of habitat selection. Goshawks selected extra-mature Eucalyptus trees in areas of high structural complexity (high tree density, tree species richness, and number of tree strata) in the most heterogeneous forest stands (old-mixed Eucalyptus). Reproductive success decreased with increasing local density of breeding pairs, but reproductive success was not related to structural characteristics of nest stands. The studied plantations provided a suitable breeding habitat for Goshawks. The birds preferred to nest in large Eucalyptus trees with appropriate structure in their immediate surroundings. The strong preference of Goshawks for structurally mature forest patches may make them useful as a surrogate species for assessing the ability of forest management practices to promote overall biodiversity in exotic Eucalyptus plantations exploited at low intensity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Understanding the effects of landscape modification on gene flow of fauna is central to informing conservation strategies that promote functional landscape connectivity and population persistence. We explored the effects of large-scale habitat loss and fragmentation on spatial and temporal patterns of gene flow in a threatened Australian woodland bird: the Grey-crowned Babbler Pomatostomus temporalis. Using microsatellite data, we (1) investigated historical (i.e., pre-fragmentation) and contemporary (i.e., post-fragmentation) levels of gene flow among subpopulations and/or regions, (2) identified first-generation migrants and likely dispersal events, (3) tested for signatures of genetic bottlenecks, (4) estimated contemporary and historical effective population sizes, and (5) explored the relative influences of drift and migration in shaping contemporary population structure. Results indicated that the functional connectivity of landscapes used by the Grey-crowned Babbler is severely compromised in the study area. The proportion of individuals that were recent immigrants among all subpopulations were low. Habitat fragmentation has led to a clear division between subpopulations in the east and west, and the patterns of gene flow exchange between these two regions have changed over time. The effective population size estimates for these two regions are now well below that required for long-term population viability (Ne &lt; 100). Demographic history models indicate that genetic drift was a greater influence on subpopulations than gene flow, and most subpopulations show signatures of bottlenecks. Translocations to promote gene flow and boost genetic diversity in the short term and targeted habitat restoration to improve landscape functional connectivity in the long term represent promising conservation management strategies that will likely have benefits for many other woodland bird species. © 2018 Stevens et al.},

abstract={In the final decades of the nineteenth century, concern was building about the status of migratory bird populations in North America. In this literature review, we describe how that concern led to a landmark conservation agreement in 1916, between the United States and Great Britain (on behalf of Canada) to conserve migratory birds shared by Canada and the United States. Drawing on published literature and our personal experience, we describe how subsequent enabling acts in both countries gave rise to efforts to better estimate population sizes and distributions, assess harvest rates and demographic impacts, design and fund landscape-level habitat conservation initiatives, and organize necessary political and regulatory processes. Executing these steps required large-scale thinking, unprecedented regional and international cooperation, ingenuity, and a commitment to scientific rigor and adaptive management. We applaud the conservation efforts begun 100 years ago with the Migratory Bird Treaty Convention.

abstract={Between 2001 and 2015 territories of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker were mapped using play-back of the territorial song on 15 deciduous forest plots around Jena (Ilm-Saale-Ohrdruf plateau). Moreover, timber volume and dead wood abundance were estimated in the Middle Spotted Woodpecker habitats. Almost all plots are situated in NATURE 2000-reserves or other protected areas. The abundance (territories/100ha) is correlated positively with timber volume and relative frequency of trees with rough bark. In Thuringian state forests including reserves, oak harvest has increased about threefold until the mid 2000s. Reduced stocks of wood and felling of rough barked trees, especially little-leaf linden, degrade the habitat quality for Middle Spotted Woodpecker. In contrast to plots with low-intensity cutting (single tree-felling, Pienter wald), the abundance of Middle Spotted Woodpecker is significantly lower on plots with high intensity harvesting. It declined on plots of both times until roughly 2007 before it increased again. The difference in density was even higher then. Some proposals for the improved management of Middle Spotted Woodpecker habitats are given, e. g. selective cutting of single trees resulting in multilayered forests with high mass of timber favouring oak, linden and other rough-barked deciduous tree species, enhancement of timber volume per > 400 cubic metres of solid wood/ha and maintenance of dead trees. © 2018 Verlagsdruckerei Schmidt GmbH.

abstract={Wildfires and windstorms are dynamic processes that can heavily impact habitats and alter their species compositions. Especially species of open and semi-open habitats can benefit from such disturbances, among them several bird species. In this study, we investigated the species-specific changes of the breeding bird community in the burnt forest of Leuk between 2006 and 2016, starting three years after the wildfire of 2003. Several species increased or decreased significantly in abundance after the fire event. A few species showed a complex reaction, where territory numbers increased after the fire, reaching a maximum after a few years and subsequently decreased. Interestingly, many of these bird species (e.g., Eurasian Wryneck, Common Redstart) are threatened and are priority species for conservation action. They may have benefitted from the first, open successional stages with a high proportion of bare ground, but are expected to decrease in abundance with the ongoing densification of the vegetation layers. Our study demonstrates that a large-scale forest fire can promote threatened bird species of open and semi-open habitats also in temperate regions. To what extent forestry measures, grazing or controlled fires can imitate the positive effects of wildfires is an open question and should be part of future research in the combined fields of forestry and conservation biology. © 2018 Inferenze Scarl.All right reserved.},

abstract={Wildfires and windstorms are dynamic processes that can heavily impact habitats and alter their species compositions. Especially species of open and semi-open habitats can benefit from such disturbances, among them several bird species. In this study, we investigated the species-specific changes of the breeding bird community in the burnt forest of Leuk between 2006 and 2016, starting three years after the wildfire of 2003. Several species increased or decreased significantly in abundance after the fire event. A few species showed a complex reaction, where territory numbers increased after the fire, reaching a maximum after a few years and subsequently decreased. Interestingly, many of these bird species (e.g., Eurasian Wryneck, Common Redstart) are threatened and are priority species for conservation action. They may have benefitted from the first, open successional stages with a high proportion of bare ground, but are expected to decrease in abundance with the ongoing densification of the vegetation layers. Our study demonstrates that a large-scale forest fire can promote threatened bird species of open and semi-open habitats also in temperate regions. To what extent forestry measures, grazing or controlled fires can imitate the positive effects of wildfires is an open question and should be part of future research in the combined fields of forestry and conservation biology. © 2018, Schweizerischer Forstverein.

abstract={Land use changes occurring in Europe in recent decades are generating important changes in the forest landscape characteristics and are having important effects on avian species richness and abundance. This is particularly important for some bird species of particular conservation concern that require heterogenous landscapes where breeding habitats are proximal to foraging habitats. Among these birds, the European Turtle Dove Streptopelia turtur is particularly important because of its marked population decline. In southern Europe, forest landscapes have been considered important breeding areas for Turtle Doves. We assessed the influence of the foraging area characteristics-distance to cereal crops and wild seed species abundance-and water availability on Turtle Dove breeding habitat suitability in a Mediterranean forest landscape in southern Spain. Forty-six point locations were surveyed during the spring of 2014 and 2015 on two nearby farms of a forest protected area. The average local abundance of Turtle Doves found at each point location was 1.25 ± 1.31 males, and it was significantly higher at the point locations closest to cereal crops, as well as at nesting sites where the wild seed species included in its local diet were abundant, especially Echium plantagineum. Distance to water in the studied range (average distance 475 m) did not show a significant effect on Turtle Dove local abundance, although the high availability of water in the study area could have a positive influence on the overall Turtle Dove breeding habitat suitability. To benefit Turtle Dove breeding habitat suitability, cultivated areas with cereals/legumes near those forest areas where Turtle Doves reproduce should be promoted. Likewise, the promotion of those herbaceous species that are locally important in the Turtle Dove diet, available, for example, through specific grazing management, should be taken into account when nesting habitat restoration is designed in forest areas, regardless of whether the distances to food resources are long. © 2018 Polish Academy of Sciences.All rights reserved.},

abstract={We evaluated how fire impacts the ecological coherence of Aleppo pine forests and their biodiversity over a 40-year period. The study area forms part of an insular ecosystem of Zakynthos Island (Zante) in western Greece, which forms part of the Ionian Islands. Post-fire effects were studied for both plant and bird diversity at 20 sampling plots, using stratified random sampling, during the summer of 2012. The plots were selected based on the frequency of burning since the 1970s. Sites were categorized as: 1) no burning for >40 years, 2) burnt once in the 1970s, 3) burnt twice, first in the 1970s and again in 2000–2010, 4) burnt three times, first in the 1970s, and twice more in 2000–2010, and 5) burnt four times, first in the1970s, twice more in 2000–2010, and again in 2011. A total of 79 plant species and 26 bird species were recorded at the studied sites. One-way ANOVA analysis showed that fire intensity has a significant impact on alpha floristic diversity. Average plant species richness at sites that burned in 2011 was significantly higher than in those that burned in the 1970s. Detected differences in bird species richness were not significant; however, more species were documented in the forested habitats (unburnt for >40 years, and burnt in the 1970s). The highest Jaccard similarity index was observed between the sites that had not burned for more than 40 years and the sites that burned in the 1970s. The lowest floristic similarity to non-burnt sites was observed between the recently burnt sites in 2011 and the sites that burned in the 1970s. The lowest bird similarity was detected between recently burnt sites in 2011 and sites that had not burned for more than 40 years. DCA ordination showed the presence of a clear fire gradient, from intensively burnt open sites to non-burnt forest sites. We suggest that fire is essential to maintain biodiversity in Aleppo pine forests, but only at intermediate frequency. © 2018, Editura Silvica. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The decline of savanna habitat in the upper Midwest has resulted in a decline of savanna and grassland birds. Many savanna restoration efforts involve the re- introduction of fire, a method which kills fire-sensitive trees, often leaving them standing as snags. The purpose of this study was to assess how the number of snags (standing dead trees) is associated with the breeding bird community and to document how the number of snags at a site varied over a 23 y period of restoration by fire. The effect of snags on bird communities was studied by establishing bird census plots along a wide range of snag abundances. To determine for what purposes birds utilized snags, observers documented all visits during an hour-long period for pairs of a dead and live tree. Change in the abundance of snags over time was documented over 23 y in a 16 ha grid. We found both bird species richness and abundance were positively associated with the number of snags and that birds used dead trees for mating and reproductive purposes more than live trees. We found the introduction of fire for restoration purposes initially resulted in an increase in the number of snags, but repeated fires eventually caused the number of snags to decline substantially. If a primary goal of savanna restoration is to enhance breeding bird community, our results show how burn regimes can be managed to maximize the number of dead tree snags for as long as possible.},

abstract={Deforestation of tropical forests has led to widespread loss and extirpation of forest bird species around the world, including the Hawaiian Islands which have experienced a dramatic loss of forests over the last 200–800 years. Given the important role birds play in forest ecosystem functions via seed dispersal and pollination, a bird community's response to forest restoration is an important measure of the success of such conservation actions. We evaluated the bird response to reforestation at an important bird sanctuary, Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hawai′i Island, using 26 years of bird count data. We show that most species from within the diverse avian community increased significantly, but species colonized the restoration forest at different rates. Distance from intact forest and time since restoration were both important predictors of colonization rate, interacting such that for most species it took more time to colonize areas farther from the intact forest. In addition, both forest cover and understory diversity helped to explain bird densities, but the effect varied among species, suggesting that different habitat requirements may help drive variation in colonization rates. This article provides the first detailed evaluation of how a diverse community of birds has responded to one of the largest, ongoing reforestation projects in Hawai′i. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration},

abstract={Background: Tropical lowland rainforests are threatened by deforestation and degradation worldwide. Relatively little research has investigated the degradation of the forests of South-east Asia and its impact on biodiversity, and even less research has focused on the important peat swamp forests of Indonesia, which experienced major losses through severe fires in 2015. Methods: We acoustically sampled the avifauna of the Berbak National Park in 2013 in 12 plots split in three habitats: primary swamp forest, secondary swamp forest, and shrub swamp, respectively representing non-degraded, previously selectively logged, and burned habitats. We analysed the species richness, abundance, vocalisation activity, and community composition across acoustic counts, plots, feeding guilds and IUCN Red List categories. We also analysed community-weighted means of body mass, wing length, and distribution area. Results: The avifauna in the three habitats was remarkably similar in richness, abundance and vocalisation activity, and communities mainly differed due to a lower prevalence of understory insectivores (Old-World Babblers, Timaliidae) in shrub swamp. However primary forest retained twice as many conservation-worthy species as shrub swamp, which harboured heavier, probably more mobile species, with larger distributions than those of forest habitats. Conclusions: The National Park overall harboured higher bird abundances than nearby lowland rainforests. Protecting the remaining peat swamp forest in this little-known National Park should be a high conservation priority in the light of the current threats coming from wildlife trade, illegal logging, land use conversion, and man-made fires. © 2018 Darras K et al.},

abstract={Agricultural landscapes play an important role in biodiversity conservation. The Tree Pipit (Anthus trivialis) was once a widespread breeding bird in European farmlands. Today, however, its numbers are sharply declining in most European countries. The aim of our study was to compare territory densities of Tree Pipits in common pastures and control plots in the surrounding pre-alpine agricultural landscape in southern Bavaria (Germany). Additionally, we determined the drivers of territory and home-range establishment in Tree Pipits. Habitat composition in common pastures and control plots reflected distinct differences in land-use intensity. Common pastures had larger areas of nutrient-poor habitats and higher landscape diversity compared to control plots. In line with this, we detected a clear response of Tree Pipits to differences in habitat composition. Territories were nearly exclusively found in common pastures. Within the common pastures, Tree Pipits preferred those parts that had higher landscape diversity and, additionally, at the territory scale, larger areas of groups of trees. The common pastures are important refuges for the threatened Tree Pipit in the pre-alpine agricultural landscape of the study area. In contrast to the control plots, the common pastures provided (i) sufficient suitable song posts and (ii) heterogeneous vegetation with appropriate nesting sites and a high availability of arthropod food resources. Our study corroborates findings from other studies across Europe highlighting the prime importance of traditionally used wood pastures for the Tree Pipit, and for biodiversity in general. © Dt.

abstract={Resolving human-wildlife conflicts requires the assessment and implementation of appropriate technical measures that minimize negative impacts on socio-economic uses, including agriculture, and ensure the adequate protection of biological diversity. Rice paddies are widely distributed in the western Mediterranean region. Because of their high productivity, they can be a good habitat for waterbirds, including the purple swamphen Porphyrio porphyrio, particularly in areas where natural wetlands have been removed or reduced. As a result of its population growth, there have been increasing levels of damage caused by this species in rice fields due to stem-cutting and opening of bald patches in rice fields. With the aim of reducing damage, we evaluated the effectiveness of passive and active measures that would limit access to rice fields and deter/scare away purple swamphens in affected areas of the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). We selected the techniques according to the growth phase of rice and the activity of birds in the rice fields (perimeter fences and clearing vegetation around the rice plots during sprouting and growing phases, and falconry at maturation). There were positive results during the sprouting and growing phases thanks to fences and clearing vegetation, reducing the affected area by 37.8% between treatment and control plots. This would mean an economic savings of 18,550 €/year in compensation payments by regional administrations including the investment in implementing and maintaining passive protection measures. Active deterrence through falconry did not reduce the level of damage. The analysis of purple swamphen home range, activity centers (centroids), and the proportion of locations in and outside of rice fields showed no differences before and after dissuasive practices. These results were influenced by multiple concurrent factors including weather, the structural configuration of the rice plots and their location. In summary, we recommend the establishment of protection measures (perimeter fences + clearing vegetation around the rice plots) to reduce the level of damage. © 2018 Moreno-Opo and Piqué.},

abstract={The expansion of coal-fired power stations in South Africa has resulted in growing environmental concerns as they are the largest emitters of sulphur dioxide (SO2). Sulphur dioxide emissions from power plants pose a potential threat to avian populations. However, the effect of SO2 pollution on bird communities is poorly understood. Using point counts we investigated the relationships of bird species richness and species-specific density with SO2 concentrations around Matimba power station. Environmental parameters were derived from remotely sensed data and data reduction was performed using principal component analysis. Generalised linear mixed models were then used to infer the relationships of bird species richness and species-specific densities with SO2 concentrations and the environmental variables. Our results revealed that SO2-polluted air had no influence on bird species richness and densities in our study sites, but SO2 levels were below annual national ambient air quality standards. Vegetation productivity was found to have a greater influence on species densities than SO2 pollution. Monitoring of bird population changes around Matimba power station once neighbouring Medupi power station is fully operational is recommended, as SO2 content of the air will increase significantly, and species may be sensitive to this increase in SO2 levels. © 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract={Determining how ecological communities will respond to global environmental change remains a challenging research problem. Recent meta-analyses concluded that most communities are undergoing compositional change despite no net change in local species richness. We explored how species richness and composition of co-occurring plant, grasshopper, breeding bird and small mammal communities in arid and mesic grasslands changed in response to increasing aridity and fire frequency. In the arid system, grassland and shrubland plant and breeding bird communities were undergoing directional change, whereas grasshopper and small mammal communities were stable. In the mesic system, all communities were undergoing directional change regardless of fire frequency. Despite directional change in composition in some communities, species richness of all communities did not change because compositional change resulted more from reordering of species abundances than turnover in species composition. Thus, species reordering, not changes in richness, explains long-term dynamics in these grass and shrub dominated communities. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS},

abstract={Standing dead trees (or snags) are an important component of forest ecosystems, especially for tree cavity-nesting vertebrate species, but their prevalence in South African forests remains under studied. Consequently, we investigated forest structure, and the presence and abundance of snags in six southern mistbelt forests in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. These forests have had varying levels of timber extraction over the past 150 years or more. We found snags were relatively rare in all six forests (<4.3% of trees sampled). Mean diameter at breast height (dbh) of snags ranged from 52 to 82 cm across the forests, with smaller snags in Kologha Forest and larger snags in Tyume Forest. A bimodal distribution of snag successional stages was found, with frequencies peaking at early and late stages, and few in the intermediate stages. Tree species diversity in the forests was relatively low (twelve–nineteen species across forests; only 28 species in total). There was no significant difference in dbh of trees between forests, with most occurring in the 20–29-cm dbh size class. Future studies are required to identify trees that most likely support suitable cavities for tree cavity-nesting bird species, and to determine cavity-nester assemblage requirements in southern African forests. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Many objectives motivate ecological restoration, including improving vegetation condition, increasing the range and abundance of threatened species, and improving species richness and diversity. Although models have been used to examine the outcomes of ecological restoration, few researchers have attempted to develop models to account for multiple, potentially competing objectives. We developed a combined state-and-transition, species-distribution model to predict the effects of restoration actions on vegetation condition and extent, bird diversity, and the distribution of several bird species in southeastern Australian woodlands. The actions reflected several management objectives. We then validated the models against an independent data set and investigated how the best management decision might change when objectives were valued differently. We also used model results to identify effective restoration options for vegetation and bird species under a constrained budget. In the examples we evaluated, no one action (improving vegetation condition and extent, increasing bird diversity, or increasing the probability of occurrence for threatened species) provided the best outcome across all objectives. In agricultural lands, the optimal management actions for promoting the occurrence of the Brown Treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus), an iconic threatened species, resulted in little improvement in the extent of the vegetation and a high probability of decreased vegetation condition. This result highlights that the best management action in any situation depends on how much the different objectives are valued. In our example scenario, no management or weed control were most likely to be the best management options to satisfy multiple restoration objectives. Our approach to exploring trade-offs in management outcomes through integrated modeling and structured decision-support approaches has wide application for situations in which trade-offs exist between competing conservation objectives. © 2017 Society for Conservation Biology},

abstract={Emulating natural disturbance has become a paradigm for biodiversity retention in forest management. This study evaluates the extent to which harvest management practices have created stands that emulate natural fire disturbance from the perspective of bird communities in Ontario, Canada. We compared the relative abundance of forest landbirds at the stand level in mature forest (> 80 years old) with that in early-regenerating (0–20 years) and midregenerating (21–80 years) forests originating from fire or timber harvest across the boreal forest of Ontario using over 7000 point counts. Our results indicate that forest harvest management practices in Ontario have created stands that only partially emulate natural fire disturbances in terms of the bird community composition. Total bird abundance and species richness were significantly lower postharvest than postfire in midregenerating forests, although they did not differ in early-regenerating stands. Species-level comparisons revealed several differences between postharvest and postfire stands, as well as among age classes. Although no species was completely missing from any stand type, 8% of species in early- and 34% in midregenerating stands were detected significantly less often in postharvest than postfire forests. Some other species were found significantly more often in postharvest stands, while the majority of species detected (84% and 71% in early- and midregenerating stands, respectively) showed no significant difference between disturbance types. Collectively, these results suggest that widespread replacement of fire with logging as the dominant disturbance type will shift the relative abundance of species within Ontario’s boreal forest bird community. Quantifying the population-level implications of these shifts requires extrapolating these stand level effects to the landscape level, while considering the actual or anticipated abundance and distribution of forest age classes across the province under different forest management regimes. © 2017 by the author(s).},

abstract={Bird–plant species associations can be an important component of habitat selection in forest birds. We assessed tree species preferences of foraging insectivorous birds in a primeval beech–fir forest in north-west Slovakia, hypothesizing that bird population densities are negatively associated with foraging specialization. We sampled foraging behaviour by random point observations from mid-May until the end of July during 1997−2003. Significant preference or avoidance patterns were found in 16 of 17 bird species. Based on the tree preference index, we distinguished four main foraging specializations: generalists, deciduous specialists, coniferous specialists, and dead wood specialists. Many bird species showed strong preferences for such rare and uncommon tree species as wych elm (Ulmus glabra), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), and Norway spruce (Picea abies). European beech (Fagus sylvatica), hazel (Corylus avellana), and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) were generally avoided. Birds with low densities tended to be most selective, but that effect was not statistically significant. Population variability was not significantly associated with foraging specialization. We hypothesize that impoverishment of tree species diversity within forest stands could lead to less diverse bird assemblages composed of species specialized on those tree species remaining and of generalist foragers able to adapt to a wide range of foraging substrates. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Prescribed burning is a commonly adopted fire-management strategy that attempts to protect human life and assets by removing accumulated, flammable biomass. Heterogeneous burning patterns are often favoured in an attempt to balance fuel-reduction and biodiversity goals under the ‘pyrodiversity begets biodiversity’ paradigm. Using comprehensive spatiotemporal monitoring data, we quantified the impacts of fire on bird assemblages in the peri-urban temperate woodlands of the Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia, where the frequency of prescribed burning is increasing. After accounting for regional trends and site effects, sites burnt 20 years previously accommodated 15% fewer birds than unburnt sites, while sites burnt in the preceding year had 22% fewer birds. Fire also modified bird assemblages, favouring generalists and ground-feeding species. Of 60 species considered, 37% were both declining and negatively impacted by recent burning, while burning reinforced increasing trends in 30% of species, particularly large, common birds (e.g., magpies, ravens, wattlebirds). Simulations of avian alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity under different fire-management scenarios predicted higher avian diversity for scenarios that retained unburnt woodlands relative to those that managed all sites. Relative to a no-fire scenario, for example, burning sites once every 10 years was simulated to reduce the abundance of woodland generalists by 7% and woodland specialists by 10%, while retaining some long-unburnt woodland ameliorated these effects. There is a trade-off between fuel-reduction burning and conservation goals; to maximise avian diversity and avert the replacement of woodland bird species with generalists, fire-management planning should preserve long-unburnt woodland habitat. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent decades, large forested areas in southern Mexico have been degraded and even eliminated, often due to conversion of these areas to pastures for cattle grazing. Silvopastoral systems combine livestock raising with tree use, favor conservation of biological diversity, and provide a variety of services to the environment and to farmers. In this study, we evaluated tree regeneration in cattle pastures in the Tulijá River Valley of Chiapas, Mexico. We argue that density of seedlings/saplings in the pastures studied is associated with the density of adult trees, with the type of dominant grass (induced or introduced), and with the practice of weeding around seedlings and saplings. We sampled trees in pastures according to categories of size, as well as herbaceous vegetation in 35 cattle pastures, and interviewed farmers with respect to their practices of weeding around seedlings and saplings. We evaluated specieś capacity for regeneration, and classified species as having adequate or limited natural regeneration capacity (ANR and LNR, respectively). Furthermore, we constructed a generalized least squares model to identify whether density of adult trees, type of grass cover (induced vs. introduced), and farmerś practice of weeding affect the density of seedlings and saplings of tree species. Finally, we identified dispersal agents of each tree species recorded and then compared the relative abundance of seedlings/saplings with adult trees for each dispersal agent, using chi-square goodness-of-fit test. In the 35 cattle pastures, we found 17 species (28%) with ANR capacity, 90% of which belonged to secondary vegetation, and 44 species (72%) with LNR capacity; most of these belonged to late successional tree species. Density of seedlings/saplings was positively associated with density of adult trees and the practice of manual weeding. The greatest abundance of seedlings/saplings corresponded to species dispersed by cattle, followed by those dispersed by wind. For adult trees, the most common type of dispersal was by wind, followed by cattle. These results suggest that native tree species are principally dispersed by cattle and wind, and cattle have a positive effect on the regeneration capacity of the most abundant tree species in the pastures studied. We conclude that Chol Mayan silvopastoral management practices in the study communities in Chiapas, Mexico allow for and promote regeneration of native tree species, most of which belong to secondary vegetation, although some belong to late successional species. These simple management practices allow for harvesting some trees in the pasture while also maintaining the regeneration process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Forests play critical roles in global ecosystem processes and provide numerous services to society. But forests are increasingly affected by a variety of human influences, especially those resulting from biological invasions. Species invading forests include woody and herbaceous plants, many animal species including mammals and invertebrates, as well as a variety of microorganisms such as fungi, oomycetes, bacteria and viruses. These species have diverse ecological roles including primary producers, herbivores, predators, animal pathogens, plant pathogens, decomposers, pollinators and other mutualists. Although most non-native species have negligible effects on forests, a few have profound and often cascading impacts. These impacts include alteration of tree species composition, changes in forest succession, declines in biological diversity, and alteration of nutrient, carbon and water cycles. Many of these result from competition with native species but also trophic influences that may result in major changes in food web structure. Naturally regenerating forests around the world have been substantially altered by invading species but planted forests also are at risk. Non-native tree species are widely planted in many parts of the world for production of wood and fibre, and are chosen because of their frequently exceptional growth in their new environment. This greater growth is due, in part, to escape from herbivores and pathogens that exist in their native ranges. Over time, some pest species can “catch-up” with their hosts, leading to subsequent declines in forest productivity. Other impacts result when native herbivores or pathogens adapt to exotic trees or when novel associations form between pathogens and vectors. Additionally, planted non-native trees are sometimes invasive and can have substantial adverse effects on adjacent natural areas. Management of invasions in forests includes prevention of arrival, eradication of nascent populations, biological control, selection for resistance in host trees, and the use of cultural practices (silviculture and restoration) to minimize invader impacts. In the future, the worlds’ forests are likely to be subject to increasing numbers of invasions, and effective management will require greater international cooperation and interdisciplinary integration. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).},

abstract={Ecological restoration is increasingly recognised as a useful tool for biodiversity conservation in boreal forests. Most restoration methods in this environment aim to emulate natural disturbances, and thereby promote the development of key ecological structures. However, research about forest ecosystem restoration is still in its infancy and the responses of many boreal species groups remain to be described. We established a large-scale field experiment to evaluate the short-term effects of two restoration treatments – prescribed burning and gap cutting involving the creation of dead wood – on breeding bird assemblages in boreal Sweden. We censused breeding birds using territory mapping during two years in forest stands subjected to the two restoration treatments, in untreated controls and in old-growth references (nature reserves) (n = 10 per treatment). Averaged over the two census years, we found 1145 territories of 36 bird species. Total bird species richness and abundance did not differ among treatments. However, prescribed burning led to clear changes in the structure of the bird assemblages. When dividing species according to four functional categorizations (migration, foraging, nesting and successional stage), we found that the abundance of long-distance migrants, ground breeders, strong cavity excavators and species preferring early-successional habitat was higher in burned stands than in untreated controls and gap-cut stands, as was the species richness of bark feeders and strong cavity excavators. In contrast, abundance of off-ground breeders and species richness of crown feeders were lower following prescribed burning than in the controls. The gap cutting treatment did not have any significant effects on the bird assemblages. Ecological restoration through prescribed burning can be a useful tool for the conservation of boreal forest birds, including the ecologically important strong cavity excavators (i.e. woodpeckers (Picidae)). Forest managers should therefore be encouraged to use prescribed burning as a restoration tool to quickly provide habitat for bird species adapted to natural disturbances in boreal forest. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The invasion of exotic species is considered to be a major threat to the preservation of biodiversity. In the Parque Nacional de Brasília (National Park of Brasília), the invasive Melinis minutiflora (molasses grass) occupies more than 10 % of the area of the park. The present, long-term, study compared two treatments of exposure to molasses grass: 1) fire and 2) integrated management (fire + herbicide sprays + manual removal). The aerial biomass of molasses grass in the experimental area initially represented ca. 55 % of the total aerial biomass, a percentage that apparently did not influence native plant species richness at this site. Fire alone was not sufficient to control molasses grass, which attained its pre-treatment biomass values after two years. Integrated management reduced, and maintained, biomass to less than 1 % of its original value after ten years, and maintained this level throughout the study, demonstrating that it is a promising strategy for the recovery of areas invaded by molasses grass in the Cerrado. However, because of the recolonization by molasses grass, long-term monitoring efforts are targeting outbreaks, which would require immediate intervention in order to maintain the native biological diversity of the region. © 2017, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

abstract={Managing ecological disturbances at different spatial scales is paramount for maintaining or restoring faunal diversity in grasslands. Whereas some studies have reported varying net effects of livestock disturbance intensity upon species richness in grasslands, most analysis reveal strong effects on beta-diversity. However, beta-diversity can be further partitioned into a nestedness and turnover components, which allows complementary insights on the effects of disturbance on biodiversity across spatial scales. Here we tested for differences in avian species richness and beta-diversity across three intensity levels of livestock disturbance in southern Brazilian grasslands under commercial livestock production. We also tested how disturbance influences the nestedness and turnover components of beta-diversity separately. We found no difference in rarified-extrapolated species richness between disturbance levels. In contrast, we found a significant difference in species composition between disturbance levels, which was attributable to the turnover, but not to the nestedness component. Specifically, livestock disturbance had a predictable effect upon beta-diversity, with turnover of species composition occurring along the gradient of vegetation height in pastures. Our study illustrates the importance of differentiating the turnover and nestedness components of beta-diversity to detect effects of disturbance gradients on biodiversity patterns. We argue that conservation strategies should focus on preserving the mosaic of short- and tall-grass physiognomies associated with the disturbance gradient imposed by livestock production. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Over the last decade, the conversion of annual-rotation based crops or grassland areas into non-food perennial crops has been increasingly prevalent in European farming systems. This shift is associated with major changes in management practices and has created new environmental conditions and resources for wildlife. Impacts on birds have been examined for bioenergy agricultural systems, such as miscanthus plantations and short-rotation willow coppice. However, they remain largely unknown for Christmas tree plantations (CTPs) that have recently increased considerably in some European countries. We examined the extent to which CTPs alter bird species assemblages in the farmland areas of southern Belgium, where they mainly replace intensive grassland. The abundance of birds was recorded during the breeding season in randomly selected sites located in grassland and in CTP. Results show that introduction of CTP into landscapes dominated by grassland with low hedge densities locally increases bird species richness and abundance without leading to biotic homogenization. Differences in species richness and abundance between grassland and CTP decrease with increasing hedge densities. A community analysis indicates that the plantation of Christmas trees enriches the bird assemblage of intensive grassland areas. In intensive grassland with few hedges, small-size CTPs could constitute an option to increase structural heterogeneity and provide new potential breeding conditions for some farmland birds. However, questions remain about the genuine quality of the resources available in CTP and further research is needed to examine the breeding success and survival of birds that settle in this type of habitat. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Functional diversity indicators are increasingly used to monitor forest function recovery because they connect biodiversity to ecosystem functions. However, identifying which functions deviate from a reference forest has not received much attention, despite its potential to inform restoration interventions. In this study, we used functional groups to assess the recovery of ecosystem functions in regenerating coastal dune forests. We surveyed birds and trees in forest of different ages and a reference old-growth forest in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We classified species into functional groups for each taxa based on functional traits or a priori defined categories (i.e. guilds) and quantified the number of species within functional groups as a proxy of function stability. Bird species density followed an asymptotic trajectory, reaching old-growth forest values after 25 years. Insectivores and granivores showed saturating trajectories, whereas small frugivores and generalists increased linearly. With the exception of large frugivores, relative abundances of bird functional groups progressed towards old-growth forest values as the forest aged. Tree species density increased linearly with forest age. In contrast to old-growth forests, large-canopy trees and understory shrubs were under-represented, while mid-canopy trees dominated regenerating forests. Our result suggests that most bird, but not tree, functions may have been restored. The trend in large frugivore numbers may warrant further investigation, as their low numbers may have hampered the recovery of tree functions. We conclude that functional group trajectories can track functions that deviate from a benchmark, and may therefore direct adaptive actions to recover the stability of regenerating forest. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration},

abstract={Invasion of riparian habitats by non-native plants is a global problem that requires an understanding of community-level responses by native plants and animals. In the Great Plains, resource managers have initiated efforts to control the eastward incursion of Tamarix as a non-native bottomland plant (Tamarix ramosissima) along the Cimarron River in southwestern Kansas, United States. To understand how native avifauna interact with non-native plants, we studied the effects of Tamarix removal on riparian bird communities. We compared avian site occupancy of three foraging guilds, abundance of four nesting guilds, and assessed community dynamics with dynamic, multiseason occupancy models across three replicated treatments. Community parameters were estimated for Tamarix-dominated sites (untreated), Tamarix-removal sites (treated), and reference sites with native cottonwood sites (Populus deltoides). Estimates of initial occupancy (ψ2006) for the ground-to-shrub foraging guild tended to be highest at Tamarix-dominated sites, while initial occupancy of the upper-canopy foraging and mid-canopy foraging guilds were highest in the treated and reference sites, respectively. Estimates of relative abundance for four nesting guilds indicated that the reference habitat supported the highest relative abundance of birds overall, although the untreated habitat had higher abundance of shrub-nesters than treated or reference habitats. Riparian sites where invasive Tamarix is dominant in the Great Plains can provide nesting habitat for some native bird species, with avian abundance and diversity that are comparable to remnant riparian sites with native vegetation. Moreover, presence of some native vegetation in Tamarix-dominated and Tamarix-removal sites may increase abundance of riparian birds such as cavity-nesters. Overall, our study demonstrates that Tamarix may substitute for native flora in providing nesting habitat for riparian birds at the eastern edge of its North American range. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration},

abstract={Forests used for timber production provide essential ecosystem services to society, as well as potential breeding habitat for bird communities. In southern Sweden, 90% of productive forest land is used for timber production and stands dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) constitute approximately 40% of the forested area. Due to their homogeneous structure, these spruce production forests are often regarded as depauperate. Despite this perception, knowledge about the biodiversity found in these stands is scarce. Here we synthesize the results of four separate bird surveys conducted within 35 spruce production stands of southern Sweden. The results are compared to recent population trends within the general study area. In total 49 bird species were recorded, with a strong difference in species composition between newly planted clear-cuts (forest age <15 years) and forests older than 15 years. The majority of species encountered in the older forest category were common forest birds, with a single red-listed species among the regularly occurring species. In contrast, three red-listed “farmland species” were frequently encountered in the newly planted forests, revealing the capacity of those birds preferring open and recently disturbed habitats to utilize clear-cuts. A higher diversity of tree sizes and the inclusion of even relatively small proportions (<15%) of broadleaved tree species had a positive effect on bird species richness. Several species encountered in spruce production forests are declining in numbers, but it is not clear whether these stands are acting as source or sink environments for their populations. However, our results indicate that relatively small adjustments to spruce forest management should improve the quality of this widespread habitat. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Biodiversity of semi-natural grasslands depends on the management practices used. However, management systems suitable for one taxon, such as plants, can be detrimental to other taxa, such as insects, and vice versa. This study attempts to support conservation management planning by clarifying the effects of different grassland management practices on species richness and species composition of vascular plants, butterflies, moths, orthopterans and ground beetles, also taking into account the effects of climate and the landscape context. The study was performed in the White Carpathians Protected Landcape Area and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (Czech Republic), which is famous for its grasslands with the globally highest fine-scale plant species richness. Different management practices (mowing, grazing, abandonment and mixed management; the latter including the previous three) were applied for at least five consecutive years at 34 sites, where plants and different insect groups were subsequently sampled. Effects of management on species richness of different taxonomic groups were assessed using generalised linear models, whereas the effects on species composition were assessed using redundancy analysis. Management influenced plant, butterfly and moth species richness, but the effects of particular management practices on all species and species of regional conservation importance differed between these taxonomic groups. Plant and moth species richness increased with mowing, but moth species richness decreased with grazing. Mixed management favoured plant and butterfly richness. Plant species composition was infuenced by mowing, grazing and mixed management while that of moths by mowing and grazing. Orthopterans and ground beetles did not respond significantly to management. Our results indicate that conservation management should comprise the traditional practices that have historically contributed to the formation of the biological diversity of the semi-natural grasslands in the study area. In particular, grazing may not be optimal for traditional hay-meadows and mowing should be carried out similarly as in pre-intensive farmland, creating spatio-temporal heterogeneity rather than uniformly cutting large grassland areas during a short period. In general, the optimal management should be heterogeneous, applying different practices in a mosaic or at different times during the season. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Monoculture farming is pervasive in industrial oil palm agriculture, including those RSPO plantations certified as sustainably managed. This farming practice does not promote the maintenance of farmland biodiversity. However, little scientific attention has been given to polyculture farming in oil palm production landscapes. Polyculture farming is likely to increase the floristic diversity and stand structural complexity that underpins biodiversity. Mist nets were used to sample birds at 120 smallholdings in Peninsular Malaysia. At each site, 12 vegetation structure characteristics were measured. We compared bird species richness, abundance, and composition between monoculture and polyculture smallholdings and used predictive models to examine the effects of habitat quality on avian biodiversity. Bird species richness was significantly greater in polyculture than that of monoculture smallholdings. The number of fallen and standing, dead oil palms were also important positive predictors of species richness. Bird abundance was also strongly increased by standing and dead oil palms and decreased with oil palm stand height. Our results indicate that polyculture farming can improve bird species richness in oil palm production landscapes. In addition, key habitat variables that are closely associated with farming practices, such as the removal of dead trees, should and can be managed by oil palm growers in order to promote biodiversity. To increase the sustainability of oil palm agriculture, it is imperative that stakeholders modify the way oil palms are currently planted and managed. Our findings can guide policy makers and certification bodies to promote oil palm production landscapes that will function more sustainably and increase existing biodiversity of oil palm landscapes. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Changes in fire frequency, extent, and intensity mean that understanding the effects of fire on plants and animals is a primary concern for ecologists and land managers. Given the potentially conflicting fire responses of species both within and across taxonomic groups, prescribing fire regimes based on the response of one or only a few species may have negative consequences for other species. Here, we integrate data collected from a series of independent but complementary studies spanning a 75 + year chronosequence in a semi-arid shrubland ecosystem in south-western Australia to consider how fire management can best promote biodiversity both within and across taxonomic groups (plants, birds, small mammals, and reptiles). Younger fire ages (6–14 years) contained sparse shrubs, large areas of bare ground, and lacked a distinct litter layer and canopy. The oldest vegetation (60–85 years) had a distinct canopy, a well-developed litter layer and cryptogamic crust, higher variability in patch width, and more woody debris. Plant species richness and diversity decreased with time since fire, whereas bird species richness and diversity increased with time since fire, and mammal and reptile species richness and diversity showed no trend. The composition of all four taxonomic groups varied according to time since fire and the presence of 11 species was confined above or below certain fire-age thresholds. Our results support the need to maintain a mix of both younger and older fire ages across the landscape to maximise species diversity, and highlight the particular importance of older fire ages for many species. Future fire management for biodiversity conservation will benefit from identifying and reconciling cross-taxa contrasts and complementarities. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Land-use change is the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss in the tropics. Biodiversity models can be useful tools to inform policymakers and conservationists of the likely response of species to anthropogenic pressures, including land-use change. However, such models generalize biodiversity responses across wide areas and many taxa, potentially missing important characteristics of particular sites or clades. Comparisons of biodiversity models with independently collected field data can help us understand the local factors that mediate broad-scale responses. We collected independent bird occurrence and abundance data along two elevational transects in Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania and the Taita Hills, Kenya. We estimated the local response to land use and compared our estimates with modelled local responses based on a large database of many different taxa across Africa. To identify the local factors mediating responses to land use, we compared environmental and species assemblage information between sites in the independent and African-wide datasets. Bird species richness and abundance responses to land use in the independent data followed similar trends as suggested by the African-wide biodiversity model, however the land-use classification was too coarse to capture fully the variability introduced by local agricultural management practices. A comparison of assemblage characteristics showed that the sites on Kilimanjaro and the Taita Hills had higher proportions of forest specialists in croplands compared to the Africa-wide average. Local human population density, forest cover and vegetation greenness also differed significantly between the independent and Africa-wide datasets. Biodiversity models including those variables performed better, particularly in croplands, but still could not accurately predict the magnitude of local species responses to most land uses, probably because local features of the land management are still missed. Overall, our study demonstrates that local factors mediate biodiversity responses to land use and cautions against applying biodiversity models to local contexts without prior knowledge of which factors are locally relevant. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London},

abstract={The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) uses data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to assist in monitoring and management of some migratory birds. However, BBS analyses provide indices of population change rather than estimates of population size, precluding their use in developing abundance-based objectives and limiting applicability to harvest management. Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa) are important harvested birds in the Atlantic Flyway (AF) that are difficult to detect during aerial surveys because they prefer forested habitat. We integrated Wood Duck count data from a ground-plot survey in the northeastern U.S. with AF-wide BBS, banding, parts collection, and harvest data to derive estimates of population size for the AF. Overlapping results between the smaller-scale intensive groundplot survey and the BBS in the northeastern U.S. provided a means for scaling BBS indices to the breeding population size estimates. We applied these scaling factors to BBS results for portions of the AF lacking intensive surveys. Banding data provided estimates of annual survival and harvest rates; the latter, when combined with parts-collection data, provided estimates of recruitment. We used the harvest data to estimate fall population size. Our estimates of breeding population size and variability from the integrated population model (N = 0.99 million, SD = 0.04) were similar to estimates of breeding population size based solely on data from the AF ground-plot surveys and the BBS (N = 1.01 million, SD = 0.04) from 1998 to 2015. Integrating BBS data with other data provided reliable population size estimates for Wood Ducks at a scale useful for harvest and habitat management in the AF, and allowed us to derive estimates of important demographic parameters (e.g., seasonal survival rates, sex ratio) that were not directly informed by data. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={The worldwide increase in human outdoor activities raises concerns for wildlife. Human disturbances, even at low levels, are likely to impact species during sensitive periods of the annual cycle. However, experimental studies during the putative sensitive period of territory establishment of birds which not only investigate low disturbance levels, but which also exclude the effect of habitat modification (e.g. walking trails) are lacking. Here, we experimentally disturbed birds in forest plots by walking through twice a day during territory establishment. Later we compared the breeding bird community of experimentally disturbed plots with that of undisturbed control plots. We discovered that the number of territories (-15.0%) and species richness (-15.2%) in disturbed plots were substantially reduced compared with control plots. Species most affected included those sensitive to human presence (assessed by flight-initiation distances), open-cup nesters and above-ground foragers. Long-distance migrants, however, were unaffected due to their arrival after experimental disturbance took place. These findings highlight how territory establishment is a sensitive period for birds, when even low levels of human recreation may be perceived as threatening, and alter settlement decisions. This can have important implications for the conservation of species, which might go unnoticed when focusing only on already established birds. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Surrogate grasslands established through federal set-aside programs, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), provide important habitat for grassland birds. Warm season grass CRP fields as a group have the potential for providing a continuum of habitat structure for breeding birds, depending on how the fields are managed and their floristic composition. We studied the nesting activity of four obligate grassland bird species, Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and Henslow's Sparrow (A. henslowii), in relation to vegetative composition and fire management in warm season CRP fields in southwest Wisconsin during 2009-2011. Intraspecific variation in apparent nest density was related to the number of years since the field was burned. Apparent Grasshopper Sparrow nest density was highest in the breeding season immediately following spring burns, apparent Henslow's Sparrow nest density was highest 1 y post burn, and apparent Bobolink and Eastern Meadowlark nest densities were higher in post fire years one to three. Grasshopper Sparrow nest density was highest on sites with more diverse vegetation, specifically prairie forbs, and on sites with shorter less dense vegetation. Bobolink, Eastern Meadowlark, and Henslow's Sparrow apparent nest densities were higher on sites with deeper litter; litter was the vegetative component that was most affected by spring burns. Overall nest success was 0.487 for Bobolink (22 d nesting period), 0.478 for Eastern Meadowlark (25 d nesting period), 0.507 for Grasshopper Sparrow (22 d nesting period), and 0.151 for Henslow's Sparrow (21 d nesting period). The major nest predators were grassland-associated species: thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), milk snake (Lampropeltis triangulum), American badger (Taxidea taxus), and western fox snake (Elaphe vulpina). Overall depredation rate was not affected by the number of years since the site had been burned. The diversity of vegetation on warm season CRP fields created by management using fire provides a continuum of structure for obligate grassland birds to use for breeding and habitat for a diversity of nest predators.},

abstract={Anthropogenic loss of biodiversity is often indicated by the disappearance of top predators. However, some of them have adapted to man-made agricultural landscapes. Among raptors, one such example is the Lesser Spotted Eagle. We compiled an exhaustive data set on foraging habitat composition of this species by direct field mapping and detailed land cover maps to study the effect of various agricultural management practices on its occupancy of home ranges and productivity, as well as on its habitat utilization and hunting success. Home ranges of the Lesser Spotted Eagle contained more natural grasslands (7.6%) and other agricultural biotopes (29.9%) than expected by random, and they preferred to breed close to managed agricultural biotopes. They hunted preferably on grasslands, where they spent 86% of their time, especially on managed grasslands, but avoided arable fields. In total, 51% of the Lesser Spotted Eagle attacks were successful, and we detected no differences in hunting success among habitats. Nests of successfully breeding birds were surrounded by more crops/cultivated grassland on a rotational basis (19.0%), as well as by managed natural grassland (1.1%), than those of unsuccessful pairs (16 and 0.7%, respectively). We also detected a negative impact of oilseed rape fields and mowed cultivated grassland on the reproductive success of the Lesser Spotted Eagle, but these effects were not consistent over the years. Our results suggest that, although the Lesser Spotted Eagle is well adapted to foraging in traditional farmland, it is threatened by changes in agricultural practices and an increasing sown area of some crops, such as oilseed rape. Cultivation of various crops and retaining of grasslands, interspersed with set-aside and non-agricultural habitat patches, promoted by the European Union greening policy, would be favourable to the Lesser Spotted Eagle. © 2017, Dt.

abstract={Weed removal experiments provide strong evidence for weed impacts, validating management techniques and demonstrating the means by which biodiversity can be maintained. We examined the effects of removing Lantana (Lantana camara) through herbicide application in eucalypt-dominated sclerophyll forest and, then measured the response of soil carbon and nitrogen levels, tree canopy health and the density of Bell Miners (Manorina melanophrys) a bird species thought to amplify the negative impacts of Lantana on tree health. Four sites in northern New South Wales were monitored for 2.5 years. We measured Lantana health, (index of height, number of stems and leaves present), soil nutrients (nitrogen and carbon at two depths: 0–10 cm and 20–30 cm), Bell Miner density (using acoustic methods) and eucalypt canopy health (5 trees/quadrat) in six 50 × 50 m quadrats per site (n = 24; 12 treated, 12 untreated). Lantana foliage in treated quadrats was sprayed with glyphosate. Lantana showed significant reductions in health within 6 months of treatment and remained in a debilitated state compared to control quadrats for the duration of the project. Despite this, soil nutrients, Bell Miner density and canopy health did not differ between intact and treated quadrats for up to 2 years after treatment. The lack of impact on soil nutrient level or tree canopy health despite large changes in Lantana abundance in treatment sites was unexpected, and may indicate that Lantana is unimportant in shaping these measures. However, a more likely explanation is that longer term monitoring is required before the full impact of Lantana removal can be detected. The level of habitat modification following herbicide application was insufficient to stimulate relocation of Bell Miner colonies. Further investigation is required into how Lantana removal affects Bell Miner density, soil nutrient levels and canopy health in the medium to long term. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Urban vacant lots can vary considerably in their vegetation structure, from dense, shrubby habitats to wooded remnant fragments that may provide habitat for a variety of birds. By identifying which features promote diverse bird communities, we can determine at which scale management practices should focus and the necessary habitat structure and composition features. We surveyed 150 vacant lots throughout Baltimore, Maryland for their bird communities, lot vegetation, and landscape-level forest cover. An ordination of the bird community indicated a response to a gradient of canopy cover and canopy height at the vacant lot. We also found that forest cover within 100 m of the vacant lot was the most important predictor of abundance for five bird species of interest. Species richness was spatially autocorrelated among sites, indicating that bird communities may also be driven by species’ dispersal and environmental gradients across the city. Overall, bird communities are responding to habitat features across multiple scales, from the vacant lot vegetation, to landscape-level forest cover, to city-wide dynamics. Thus, we recommend management practices to focus on increasing city-wide forest cover in order to increase species richness, yet with awareness regarding where the lot occurs within the city. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Nature in cities is concentrated in urban green spaces, which are key areas for urban biodiversity and also important areas to connect people with nature. To conserve urban biodiversity within these natural refugia, habitat restoration such as weed control and revegetation is often implemented. These actions are expected to benefit biodiversity, although species known to be affected by urbanization may not be interacting with restoration in the ways we anticipate. In this study, we use a case study to explore how urban restoration activities impact different bird species. Birds were grouped into urban sensitivity categories and species abundance, and richness was then calculated using a hierarchical species community model for individual species responses, with “urban class” used as the hierarchical parameter. We highlight variable responses of birds to revegetation and weed control based on their level of urban sensitivity. Revegetation of open grassy areas delivers significant bird conservation outcomes, but the effects of weed control are neutral or in some cases negative. Specifically, the species most reliant on remnant vegetation in cities seem to remain stable or decline in abundance in areas with weed control, which we suspect is the result of a simplification of the understorey. The literature reports mixed benefits of weed control between taxa and between locations. We recommend, in our case study site, that weed control be implemented in concert with replanting of native vegetation to provide the understory structure preferred by urban sensitive birds. Understanding the impacts of revegetation and weed control on different bird species is important information for practitioners to make restoration decisions about the allocation of funds for conservation action. This new knowledge can be used both for threatened species and invasive species management. © 2017 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Summary Mountain systems are often recognised as biodiversity hotspots; however, most montane forests are human-modified. Understanding the conservation value of human-modified forests is essential to mountain biodiversity conservation. In this study, mist-nets and point-counts were used to compare the bird communities of primary forests on ridges in the Ailao Mountains of Yunnan, China, and secondary forests, firewood forests, and pine plantations in nearby lower elevation zones. We found that community turnover among habitats was very high using both methods. Although the percentage of forest interior species and insectivores in each habitat was higher in the primary forests than in the human-modified forests, relatively high percentages of forest interior species and insectivores were recorded in the human-modified forests. Moreover, many bird species, forest interior species, insectivores and babblers were only recorded in the human-modified forests. Our study indicated that the primary forests are important for sustaining mountain bird diversity. However, given that primary forests are restricted to ridges, secondary forests, firewood forests, and pine plantations at lower elevations also play important roles in bird conservation in mountainous regions by increasing landscape diversity and partially offsetting species loss from primary forests. Therefore, conservation efforts should also be concentrated on human-modified forests at lower elevations in mountainous regions in south-west China. Copyright © BirdLife International 2016.},

abstract={We organized environmental observations (Sea Surface Temperature, chlorophyll concentration, and primary productivity) and biological diversity indices based on reconstructed fisheries landings obtained from the Sea Around Us project to address two objectives: 1) to understand whether adjacent Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) of the Americas form megaregions for assemblages of commercially-valuable fish; and 2) to assess changes in the diversity of fisheries landings in LMEs of the Americas over time (1982 to 2010). To test for similarities between LMEs, we used the seascape approach of unsupervised clustering of annual mean environmental observations and fisheries-derived diversity indices. Beta-diversity estimates based on fisheries landings were used to evaluate the degree to which species spanned LMEs. Temporal trends were computed for each dataset by linear least-squares. Three megaregions emerged when considering similarities in species composition of fisheries landings, fisheries-derived diversity indices, and characteristic environmental conditions among LMEs. These include (A) the South Brazil Shelf, East Brazil Shelf, and North Brazil Shelf LMEs, (B) the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf LMEs, and (C) the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf, Scotian Shelf, and Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf LMEs. No megaregions emerged for the Pacific Ocean. While there were some shared species assemblages between the California Current and the Gulf of Alaska, the Gulf of California, and the Pacific Central-American Coastal LMEs, these showed different average environmental conditions and fishery-derived diversity indices, so they did not cluster as a megaregion. In the Pacific Ocean, the high dissimilarity in the fisheries is in part related to different top-down pressures and strong regional differences in oceanographic properties, including upwelling and impacts of El-Niño Southern Oscillation events. Overall, between 1982 and 2010, seven LMEs diversified their fisheries (Pacific Central-America Coastal, Patagonian Shelf, South Brazil Shelf, East Brazil Shelf, North Brazil Shelf, Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf, and Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf). This may be due to a number of reasons including decreasing fishing pressure but expansion of target stocks due to management quotas, changes in regional markets, competition, effort, or a decrease in particular target stocks. Three LMEs showed increasingly less diversified fisheries, namely the California Current, the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf, and the Caribbean Sea LMEs. While in some cases this may be related to historical overfishing, such as in the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf LME, the California Current LME has been subjected to strong and conservative management practices. The Caribbean Sea LME was likely subjected to heavy fishing at a time of rapid environmental change. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Birds breeding on ocean beaches are threatened globally, often requiring significant investments in species conservation and habitat management. Conservation actions typically encompass spatial and temporal threat reductions and protection of eggs and broods. Still, populations decline or recover only slowly, calling for fresh approaches in beach-bird conservation. Because energetic demands are critically high during the nesting and chick rearing phases, and chick survival is particularly low, supplementing prey to breeding birds and their offspring is theoretically attractive as a means to complement more traditional conservation measures. Prey for plovers and similar species on ocean beaches consists of invertebrates (e.g. small crustaceans, insects) many of which feed on stranded masses of plant material (e.g. kelp and seagrass) and use this ‘wrack’ as habitat. We added wrack to the upper beach where plovers nest and their chicks forage to test whether algal subsidies promote the abundance and diversity of their invertebrate prey. Adding wrack to the upper beach significantly increased the abundance and diversity of invertebrate prey items. At wrack subsidies greater than 50% of surface cover invertebrate assemblages became highly distinct compared with those that received smaller additions of wrack. Substantial (2–4 fold) increases in the abundance amphipods and isopods that are principal prey items for plovers drove these shifts. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of food provisioning for birds on ocean shores. Whilst novel, it is practicable, inexpensive and does not introduce further restrictions or man-made structures. Thus, it can meaningfully add to the broader arsenal of conservation tools for threatened species that are wholly reliant on sandy beaches as breeding and foraging habitats. © 2017},

abstract={The impacts of invasive plant control on native animals are rarely evaluated. Using data from an eight-year study in southeastern Australia, we quantified the effects on native bird, mammal, and reptile species of (1) the abundance of the invasive Bitou Bush, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata, and (2) a Bitou Bush control program, which involved repeated herbicide spraying interspersed with prescribed burning. We found that overall species richness of birds, mammals, and reptiles and the majority of individual vertebrate species were unresponsive to Bitou Bush cover and the number of plants. Two species including the nationally endangered Eastern Bristlebird (Dasyurus brachypterus) responded positively to measures of native vegetation cover following the control of Bitou Bush. Analyses of the effects of different components of the treatment protocol employed to control Bitou Bush revealed (1) no negative effects of spraying on vertebrate species richness; (2) negative effects of spraying on only one individual species (Scarlet Honeyeater); and (3) lower bird species richness but higher reptile species richness after fire. The occupancy of most individual vertebrates species was unaffected by burning; four species responded negatively and one positively to fire. Our study indicated that actions to remove Bitou Bush generally have few negative impacts on native vertebrates. We therefore suggest that controlling this highly invasive exotic plant species has only very limited negative impacts on vertebrate biota. © 2017 Lindenmayer et al.},

abstract={Insectivorous birds are increasingly recognized for the crucial pest control services they provide to agroecosystems. While both the foraging activity and functional diversity of birds are enhanced by multiscale habitat heterogeneity, little is known about how these relationships may influence avian top-down control of insects. Specifically, interactive effects of bird community structure and habitat heterogeneity on pest control across spatial scales have rarely been explored. We sampled bird communities and measured avian predation on plasticine model prey, as a proxy for lepidopteran pest control, in 20 vineyards of south-western France. Vineyards differed both in sward heterogeneity at the local scale and amount of surrounding semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale. Functional diversity metrics and community-weighted mean traits were computed for bird communities based on a species–trait table including diet, foraging method, nesting site, migration strategy, laying date, home range size, clutch size and body mass. We used mixed models to test for the interacting effects of habitat heterogeneity and bird functional diversity on avian predation rates of plasticine prey. Contrary to expectations, bird functional diversity decreased with landscape-scale heterogeneity, but was higher in vineyards managed with heterogeneous sward structures. In contrast, foliage-gleaning insectivores were more abundant in landscapes supporting more semi-natural habitats, suggesting an increase in their contribution to pest control along the landscape heterogeneity gradient. Accordingly, we found that avian predation on plasticine prey increased with bird functional evenness both in more heterogeneous vineyards at the local scale and in landscape mosaics supporting more semi-natural habitats. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that habitat heterogeneity at both local and landscape scales influenced avian insectivory in vineyard agroecosystems by interacting with bird community structure. It provides important insights for ecological intensification in vineyards, pointing out that management options need to be adapted to both the functional composition of local bird communities and landscape context. We suggest that both on-field and off-field management can be used to enhance natural pest control services provided by birds in vineyards, especially by favouring sward heterogeneity and patches of semi-natural habitats within large vineyard stands at the landscape scale. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Background: World-wide grassland birds are in decline due to habitat loss and degradation resulting from intensive agricultural practices. Understanding how key grassland habitat attributes determine grassland bird densities is required to make appropriate conservation decisions. We examine drivers of bird densities in a South African grassland area that has been managed for biodiversity conservation with reduced grazing pressure. Methods: We estimated the density of the eight most common grassland bird species encountered in our area to evaluate the effects of recent grassland management changes on the avifauna. We collected data on birds and habitat from the austral summers of 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2010/2011. We used hierarchical distance sampling methods to estimate density of birds relative to two main habitat variables, i.e., grass cover and height. In addition, we used regression splines within these distance sampling models as a more flexible description of suitable ranges of grass height and cover for each species. Results: For most species, density is related to grass height and cover as expected. The African Quailfinch (Ortygospiza atricollis) and Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix) preferred relatively short and open grass. The Yellow-breasted Pipit (Anthus chloris), African Pipit (Anthus cinnamomeus) and Red-capped Lark (Calandrella cinerea) preferred short and relatively dense grass, while the Wing-snapping Cisticola (Cisticola ayresii) preferred grass of intermediate height and cover. The Cape Longclaw (Macronyx capensis) and Zitting Cisticola (Cisticola juncidis) preferred tall and dense grass. Our results agree with previous studies that grass height combined with grass cover are the most important habitat features that managers should manipulate in order to increase the density of target species. The regression splines show that the effect of these two habitat variables on density is well described by linear relationships for most species. Conclusions: This study supports previous studies suggesting that grazing and fire are important tools for management to use in order to create a mosaic of grass height and cover that would support high densities of desired species. We suggest that conservation managers of these grasslands combine fire and grazing as management tools to create suitable habitats for grassland birds in general. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The effects of streets on biodiversity is an important aspect of urban ecology, but it has been neglected worldwide. Several vegetation attributes (e.g. street tree density and diversity) have important effects on biodiversity and ecological processes. In this study, we evaluated the influences of urban vegetation-represented by characteristics of street trees (canopy size, proportion of native tree species and tree species richness)-and characteristics of the landscape (distance to parks and vegetation quantity), and human impacts (human population size and exposure to noise) on taxonomic data and functional diversity indices of the bird community inhabiting streets. The study area was the southern region of Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais, Brazil), a largely urbanized city in the understudied Neotropical region. Bird data were collected on 60 point count locations distributed across the streets of the landscape. We used a series of competing GLM models (using Akaike's information criterion for small sample sizes) to assess the relative contribution of the different sets of variables to explain the observed patterns. Seventy-three bird species were observed exploiting the streets: native species were the most abundant and frequent throughout this landscape. The bird community's functional richness and Rao's Quadratic Entropy presented values lower than 0.5. Therefore, this landscape was favoring few functional traits. Exposure to noise was the most limiting factor for this bird community. However, the average size of arboreal patches and, especially the characteristics of street trees, were able to reduce the negative effects of noise on the bird community. These results show the importance of adequately planning the urban afforestation process: increasing tree species richness, preserving large trees and planting more native trees species in the streets are management practices that will increase bird species richness, abundance and community functional aspects and consequently improve human wellbeing and quality of life. © 2017 Pena et al.

abstract={Wildfires play a determining role in the composition and structure of many plant and animal communities. On the other hand, climate change is considered to be a major driver of current and future fire regime changes. Despite increases in drought in many areas of the world, the effects of aridity on post-fire colonization by animals have been rarely addressed. This study aims to analyse how a regional aridity gradient affects post-fire recovery of vegetation, bird species richness and the numbers of four early to middle-successional warbler species associated with the shrub cover. The database contains bird relative abundance and environmental variables from 3072 censuses in 695 transects located in 70 recently burnt areas (1 to 11 years after wildfire) in Catalonia (Spain), which were sampled between 2006 and 2013. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) showed that plant cover was affected by time since fire, aridity and forest management. However, only the highest vegetation height layer (>100 cm) recovered slower in arid areas after fire. Time since fire positively influenced bird species richness and the relative abundance of the four focal species. The post-fire recovery of Melodious (Hippolais polyglotta) and Subalpine warblers (Sylvia cantillans) was hampered by aridity. Although this was not demonstrated for Dartford (S. undata) and Sardinian warblers (S. melanocephala), their occurrence was low in the driest areas during the first three years after fire. Overall, this study suggests that future increases in aridity can affect plant regeneration after fire and slow down the recovery of animal populations that depend on understorey and shrublands. Given the recently highlighted increases in aridity and fire frequency in Mediterranean-climate regions, improved knowledge on how aridity affects ecological succession is especially necessary. © 2017 Puig-Gironès et al.

abstract={Reintroduction projects aim to reestablish a self-sustaining population of an endangered species within its historical range. Adequate post-release monitoring by gathering demographic data is important to evaluate the success of a reintroduction. Survival and reproduction rates of a reintroduced population can be compared with a self-sustaining wild population to evaluate the success of a reintroduction. In early 2007, Nipponia nippon (Crested Ibis) was reintroduced into the Qinling Mountains (Shaanxi, Central China). In this study, we attempt to evaluate the demographic status of the reintroduced population. Age-specific survival rates of 56 released adults and 77 wild-born fledglings were estimated using mark-recapture data obtained from 2007 to 2014. Survival rates for the yearlings (0.599, with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.467–0.719) were lower than the estimates from a wild population in Yangxian County, but the survival rates of the adults (0.678, with 95% CI: 0.603–0.745) were similar. The number of breeding pairs gradually increased since 2008, although breeding success (52.5%) was somewhat less than that of the wild population (67.6%). The stochastic estimation of population growth rate (1.084 with 95% CI: 1.069–1.098) and population size (5-fold increase) estimated from an age-classified Leslie matrix indicate that the reintroduced population of the Crested Ibis is more likely in regulation phase over the next 25 years. We conclude that the reintroduction of the Crested Ibis in Qinling Mountains has great promise, and progress toward a self-sustaining population has been made under some interventions. Governments, local communities, and scientists need to facilitate habitat restoration for the long-term survival of this endangered species. © 2016 Society for Ecological Restoration},

abstract={Avian communities in urban environments of continental Africa are generally poorly understood. Gauteng, one of South Africa's nine provinces and the second largest mega-urban region in sub-Saharan Africa, includes the conurbation of Johannesburg and Pretoria. Rapid urbanisation in the province began in the 1880s after the discovery of gold and is, by northern hemisphere standards, a recent urbanisation event; extrapolating patterns of urban ecology from Europe and North America may therefore not be entirely appropriate. The urban transformation and establishment of an anthropogenically modified to natural vegetation gradient, the extension of woodiness (through bush encroachment and fire exclusion) from the savanna biome into grassland, and the 'greening' of suburbia with an increase in exotic trees and open water, have resulted in a transformed bird community. This tolerant subset of the local avifauna (both native and alien species), derived from species losses (e.g. grassland-specific species) and gains (species responding to more wooded habitats, e.g. dominated by cavity nesters, frugivores, obligate waterassociated species, and cliff nesters), is remarkably diverse and is probably driven and supported by an increase in habitat heterogeneity. An assessment of the bird community at fine- to broad-scale highlights (1) the modifying effect of anthropogenic transformation and the establishment of an urban-resilient bird community brought about by this change, (2) the value of landscape heterogeneity (species composition and structural diversity) in supporting a species-rich bird community, and (3) the value of urban and suburban green spaces as refugia for avian species impacted by urban transformation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Old boreal forests are considered quality habitats for birds associated with decaying and dead trees. However, the quantity and quality of these structural attributes in old forest stands are likely to be influenced by important latitudinal changes in tree species composition and productivity from the southern boreal mixed to the northern coniferous forests. We measured habitat occupancy of cavity and bark nesting birds in old forests when the boreal forest landscape shifts from a mixed to a dominant coniferous matrix in the Clay Belt of Québec and Ontario, a region where paludification dominates. Using playback calls, songs, and recent woodpeckers’ foraging signs on trees, we measured the occurrence and foraging habitat use of 11 bird species associated with deadwood in 86 unmanaged forest stands along a forest age gradient in both mixed and coniferous stands. In coniferous stands dominated by black spruce, deadwood birds showed a modal distribution in response to the aging of black spruce forests that reached a peak in stands of 160 years and then declined. Unproductive paludified stands, which made up more than 40% of our study area, were associated with a significantly lower species richness of deadwood birds. At the opposite, although they represented less than 4% of the forest cover in our study area, old boreal mixedwood forests (>90 years) were highly utilized habitats by deadwood birds. Structural diversity of trees (diversity of degradation stages and diameter of trees) was the variable that best explained species richness of this functional group of birds whereas at the individual species level, the quantity and quality of dead trees (degradation and size) in stands best explained species occurrence and abundance of foraging signs. Conservation efforts for deadwood birds should focus on old productive stands of both mixed and coniferous composition. However, our study pinpoints old mixedwood stand as habitats of special concern given their disproportionate importance for deadwood birds in northern boreal forests. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Every stage of succession may provide certain species with habitat requirements which are impossible in other stages of succession. This study attempts to evaluate the different stages of succession in terms of composition and structure of bird populations in Hyrcanian forests. Bird–habitat relationships were investigated by comparing vegetation characteristics in three successional stages including late, initial stage, and urban areas. Bird richness, diversity, and abundance were measured within a 25-m radius of each of the 120 sampling points in various stages of succession and urban areas from May to April (2014) in the Ziarat catchment. This study indicated that every stage of succession may support certain species. Based on bird–habitat associations along the various stages of succession, two groups were distinguished. Conventional comparative analysis separated two groups of understory birds: interior specialists and edge specialists. The interior-specialist group was positively correlated with the number of dead trees, tall trees with high values of dbh and height and canopy cover. In contrast, edge specialists groups mainly included terrestrial insectivores and were positively correlated with open area and shrub cover, and percentage of shrub cover between 1 and 2 m in height. In summary, bird communities in Hyrcanian forests are highly dynamic in different vegetation covers suggesting that it is critical to increase diverse and abundant bird populations by conserving forests composed of mosaics of differently disturbed stands and mature forest patches. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Changes in forestry practices and on-going climate change may both have large impacts on forest bird populations. However, large-scale analyses of the effects of temporal changes in forest structure on forest bird numbers are largely lacking. We compared temporal trends from two Swedish nationwide long-term monitoring schemes, the Swedish Bird Survey (1998–2015) and the Swedish National Forestry Inventory (1983–2014), giving representative values for both forest and bird changes over an area of 35 million ha. Since 1998 the total area of middle-aged and mature forest increased by 6.4%. In parallel, several forest structures potentially beneficial to birds (dead wood, retention trees on clear cuts, multi-layer forests, old forest and broadleaved forest) increased somewhat in abundance, most likely as a result of legislation changes and increasing areas under forest certification schemes. Summer temperatures also increased, with warm summers dominating since 2002. In 1998–2015, the population sizes of 58 forest bird species on average increased, as did the number of species observed per route, with no general difference between forest specialists (16 species) and generalists (42 species). However, from around 2005, the positive trends in bird numbers and many forest structures have levelled out. An analysis of species population trends in relation to a measure of climate sensitivity (Species Temperature Index, STI) suggested that forest birds, just like Swedish birds in general, have indeed been affected by a warming climate. But given their STI, forest birds on average had more positive trends than non-forest birds, suggesting that other factors than climate have affected them positively. Strong candidate factors are the documented changes in forest quality and quantity. Whereas our data and analyses are correlational, and no firm conclusions on causality therefore can be drawn, it is reasonable to assume that the recent increases in forest quantity, forest quality, and summer temperatures, all have contributed to the general increase in forest bird numbers in Sweden. But the relative contribution of these driving forces remains to be determined. When it comes to the potentially positive effects of improving forest quality in terms of increases in old forest, stratification, retention trees and dead wood, it is noteworthy that many of the positive trends in forest structures since the mid-1990s seem to have ceased recently. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Human actions have led to loss and degradation of wetlands, impairing their suitability as habitat especially for waterbirds. Such negative effects may be mitigated through habitat management. To date scientific evidence regarding the impacts of these actions remains scarce. We studied guild specific abundances of breeding and staging birds in response to habitat management on 15 Finnish wetlands. In this study management actions comprised several means of vegetation removal to thwart overgrowth. Management cost efficiency was assessed by examining the association between site-specific costs and bird abundances. Several bird guilds exhibited positive connections with both habitat management as well as with invested funds. Most importantly, however, red-listed species and species with special conservation concern as outlined by the EU showed positive correlations with management actions, underlining the conservation value of wetland management. The results suggest that grazing was especially efficient in restoring overgrown wetlands. As a whole this study makes it clear that wetland habitat management constitutes a feasible conservation tool. The marked association between invested funds and bird abundance may prove to be a valuable tool for decision makers when balancing costs and impact of conservation measures against one another. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Despite the introduction of agri-environmental schemes, no general increase of farmland biodiversity in Europe has been observed. Farmers take decisions about the implementation of agri-environmental schemes at the farm scale, and it is thus highly relevant to assess the relationship between farm management and biodiversity at this scale to increase the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes. The present study quantifies to what extent and with which practices farmers can influence biodiversity on their farm and to what extent conditions outside farmers’ control may mediate biodiversity. We grouped 27 variables into four variable sets: (1) ecological compensation (mainly semi-natural habitats), (2) in-field options (e.g. no growth regulator, insecticide and herbicide treatment), and (3) farm characteristics, which can be influenced by farmers (e.g. land-use types) as well as (4) farm settings, which cannot be influenced by farmers (e.g. altitude). As biodiversity metrics, plant, grasshopper, butterfly and bird richness and abundance of farmland target species were assessed on 133 farms of the Swiss Central Plateau from 2009 to 2011. Variance partitioning and generalised linear mixed models were used to analyse the impact of each variable set on farmland species diversity. Our results provide evidence that farmers can indeed positively influence biodiversity by ecological compensation and in-field options. The variables of the ecological compensation set explained the highest proportion in the variation of plant richness and butterfly abundance. We found a significant positive relationship between in-field options and plant abundance. Our study illustrated that the effects of biodiversity-related farming practices differ between species and biodiversity metrics. Conditions outside farmers’ control explained a high variation in grasshopper and bird diversity. One variable within the set of farm settings, the degree of consolidation, had a significant negative impact on five out of eight biodiversity metrics (plant, butterfly and bird richness; plant and bird abundance). We demonstrate that farmers can substantially enhance biodiversity on their farms and provide knowledge on how such biodiversity improvements can be achieved by farmers. Further, we highlight the value of new biodiversity-related management practices such as in-field options. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Determining species occurrence in ecosystems of high conservation concern is especially important for recommending habitat management techniques and identifying suitable restoration sites. We investigated (1) how stand- and landscape-scale attributes affect occupancy of priority bird species associated with longleaf pine (Pinus palutris) ecosystems, (2) if these priority birds can be used as indicator species for desired open pine forest structure, and (3) if these indicator species are positively correlated with greater avian richness. We compared priority bird occupancy among 12 stand types (habitat types) throughout the historic range of longleaf pine in Mississippi. We found stands resembling the historic longleaf pine ecosystem were positively associated with Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) and Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) occupancy probabilities, but were not significantly correlated with Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) or Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla) occupancy. Both of which were too generalized in their occurrence to be useful indicators. Red-cockaded Woodpecker and Bachman's Sparrow occupancy probabilities positively correlated with desired forest structure metrics of longleaf pine ecosystems such as low midstory density (&lt;10%) and basal area (9.2–16.1 m2/ha) and 40–60% canopy cover suggesting they are effective indicators of historic longleaf pine conditions. Co-occurrence of Red-cockaded Woodpecker and Bachman's Sparrow was positively correlated with avian richness, indicating these species can be used in conjunction as effective indicators for desired open pine endpoints used for restoration and management. Inclusion of priority bird species in management efforts provides assurance that restored areas will incorporate desired forest structure endpoints that have been linked to open pine priority bird presence. Correlation between priority bird species and avian species richness ensures restored areas provide suitable habitat for local avian communities. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Orchards are parts of agriculture and apart from their economic role they may preserve biodiversity in highly transformed farmlands. An increasing intensity of orchards management is known to be threat for some species, especially pollinators and birds. On the other hand, the biodiversity of abandoned orchards was hardly investigated. Here, I present a survey of orchards in Poland to estimate how bird's diversities differ in response to the intensity of orchards management. In 2014, 66 orchards of three types – abandoned, extensively and intensively managed – were investigated. Bird species’ richness and abundance were found to be highest in abandoned orchards but overall bird diversity and species composition in abandoned did not differ from these found in extensively managed orchards. In abandoned and extensively managed orchards, hollow-dwellers and insectivores (with some rare old-forest associated species) dominated, whereas in intensively managed orchards the most diverse were ground-dwellers. Among the several selected environmental features, the highest impact on bird diversity was related to the tree diversity, abundance of older trees, presence of multilayer understory and heterogeneous surrounding. The preliminary study point that traditional orchards could play a important role for wood-dwelling species in agriculture and because of that the removal or replacement of all traditional orchards by intensively managed orchards should be avoided and needs of orchard protection should be implemented into Agri-Environmental Schemes/High Nature Value farming systems and possibly also into habitat directive of EU. Unfortunately, the number of abandoned and extensively managed orchards is declining from agricultural landscapes, and traditional orchards are replaced by conventional fruit plantations. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS},

A semi-structured questionnaire survey was used to collect data on human activities affecting birds and their habitats among forest users and forest protectors in North Nandi Forest. Habitat destruction (70%) was the main detrimental human activity on avifaunal habitats, while hunting of birds for subsistence use (10%) only affected certain bird species. The age group between 20 and 40 years used the forest most frequently and most activities were undertaken in indigenous forest habitat. Significantly, men undertook timber extraction and livestock grazing, while women undertook collection of firewood and medicinal herbs. Illegal forest exploitation should be curbed in order to ensure future survival of avifaunal diversity in North Nandi Forest.},

abstract={Availability of comprehensive biodiversity maps and standlevel habitat management recommendations to forest services is often limited, despite the need for such information for multifunctional forestry. Here, we combined forest structural parameters derived from nation-wide available Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data with parameters describing climate, topography and soil pH, to analyse and spatially predict the species richness of different taxa on two different scales. Vascular plants, bryophytes and land snails were analysed on the stand scale (900 m2), where we also identified target variables for habitat management by using data from the National Forest Inventory. On the landscape scale (1 km2), we analysed vascular plants, butterflies and breeding birds with a tight association to forests. LiDAR-derived forest structure parameters were consistently important predictors of species richness across taxa. Species richness patterns tended to be taxon-specific with low spatial congruence across taxa. The habitat quality for many forest land snail species, for example, increased with increasing proportions of trees from the genera Fraxinus, Tilia, Ulmus and Acer, or with increasing overstory cover and deadwood volume. Many butterfly species, on the other hand, responded positively to a heterogeneous understory. This study shows that important structural parameters for forest biodiversity can be derived area-wide and across large regions by using LiDAR. The growing availability of LiDAR data thus provides very useful information for conserving and promoting biodiversity in multifunctional forestry.},

abstract={The restoration of habitat corridors and the conservation of remnant forest strips or riparian habitats have been proposed as tools to enhance connectivity in fragmented landscapes. To determine corridor effectiveness some studies have evaluated species presence and movements, but life cycle activities are rarely used as measurements of success. In this study we gathered molt and breeding evidences for 20 individuals of 15 bird species in three corridors that were actively restored between 2003 and 2006 to reconnect two Andean forest fragments. Overall, 25% of the captured individuals displayed overlap between molt and breeding. Our findings indicate that restored corridors that improve connectivity in fragmented landscapes are highly important, not only for the movement of individuals but also as habitat to perform important life cycle activities, like molt and breeding. We propose that recording those life cycle activities for bird species is a reliable indicator to determine whether restoration efforts have been successful. © 2017, Asociacion Colombiana de Ornitologia.

abstract={The overabundance of Yellow-throated Miner (Manorina flavigula) has been shown to negatively affect the abundance and richness of small birds in areas they occupy, leading to homogenization of the avifauna across the fragmented landscape. In this study, we took advantage of a planned management cull to ask the question, does the removal of Yellow-throated Miner colonies cause an immediate change in avian species richness and abundance? This cull was undertaken around the Bronzewing Flora and Fauna Reserve (north-western Victoria, Australia) in order to protect a resident population of endangered Black-eared Miner (M. melanotis) from hybridization. We conducted avian surveys along roadsides surrounding the reserve at Yellow-throated Miner colonies (n = 6), control sites with no miners (n = 7), and where colonies were removed (n = 3). We found that the cull was followed by only a very modest increase in the species richness and abundance of small birds, with no significant effects on avian assemblage overall. This result contrasts with far more dramatic increases following culls of other species of miner. Sites where miners were removed were not depauperate of other species prior to the cull, which could have been due to a combination of proximity to refuge for small birds in a neighbouring reserve or the low numbers of miners that made up each culled colony. This study highlights that assumed effects of a management action may be highly dependent upon spatial and temporal context. © 2017 Ecological Society of Australia and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

abstract={Continuing disappearance and degradation of primary tropical rainforests in Indonesia, and the ongoing conversion of degraded forest to monoculture plantations, threaten many bird species with local extinction. Yet, information on bird populations from the Sundaic region, which covers western Indonesia, is generally lacking, limiting our understanding of species responses to disturbance, extinction risks, and potential ways to counteract local species extinction processes. On the Indonesian island of Sumatra, bird density information is only known from two studies (on four hornbill species and one pheasant species). Here, we compare bird densities between less degraded and highly degraded forests within the Harapan Rainforest Ecosystem Restoration Concession in Sumatra. From a total of 148 bird species recorded, densities were calculated for 47 species with the highest encounter rate, 33 of which were recorded in forests of both disturbance levels, allowing comparisons to be made. We found five species with higher densities in the highly degraded forest and seven species with higher densities in the less degraded forest. While our species-specific results were generally consistent with previous biological insights, there were exceptions, such as a species previously considered to be sensitive to habitat degradation, the sooty-capped babbler Malacopteron affine, being more abundant in the highly degraded forest. Our study revealed that despite its condition, degraded forest retains much value for Sumatran lowland forest birds, providing a compelling argument for securing its important conservation status under improved management, rather than assigning it for clearance as typically happens. © National University of Singapore.},

abstract={Montane birds are regularly exposed to extreme weather variations. Taiwan’s subtropical montane avifauna has many endemic species which are regularly exposed to large weather fluctuations. From 2010 to 2013, we conducted monthly censuses to study the influence of monthly weather variations on species richness and bird density of a montane bird community (> 3000 m a. s. l.) in Shei-Pa National Park. Censuses were conducted along a trail which traverses four distinct habitats with increasing altitude: bush forest ecotone, post-fire grassland, conifer forest, and rocky bushland. The highly variable weather corresponded with large fluctuations in the bird community. We found that lower temperatures had a negative effect on species richness and bird density, and this effect was strongest in the highest elevation habitat, the rocky bushland. Rainfall was positively correlated with bird density, but only explained 15% of the variation, while the effects of wind speed were inconsistent and small. This is the first study to demonstrate such weather effects in Taiwan and probably East Asia. We briefly discuss adaptations to harsh weather conditions in birds, which might be a profitable future research field for montane birds in Taiwan. © Academia Sinica, Taiwan.},

abstract={Provision of artificial surface water has been suggested as a management practice that can benefit wildlife in arid and semi-arid regions. With unprecedented droughts predicted for many of these areas in North America in coming decades, understanding species response to the provision of artificial surface water should be evaluated. Moreover, a dearth of knowledge exists in the understanding of avian response to artificial surface water during the non-breeding season. To address this lack of knowledge, we sampled the avian community at varying distances from water sources in Beaver County, Oklahoma, USA from February-March 2013-2014. A total of 20 species were detected. We found no relationship to avian species richness and distance to water. Likewise, pooled data of detections across all species indicated no relationship in relation to artificial surface water. Analysis on individual species indicated that western meadowlarks Sturnella neglecta did not respond to water. However, American tree sparrows Spizella arborea (plateau model β = 0.05, SE = 0.01) were attracted to surface water sources up to a distance of 100 m (SE = 40.19 m). Furthermore, white-crowned sparrows Zonotrichia leucophrys (linear β = -0.01, SE = 0.006) were attracted to surface water sources up to distance of 250 m. Additionally, analysis indicated that used water sources by American tree sparrows had significantly more mixed shrub cover (%) when compared to unused water sources (β = 6.04, SE = 2.64; p = 0.03) and that use of water sources by white-crowned sparrows was influenced by the amount of mixed shrub cover within 50 m of the water source (β = 0.36, SE = 0.16; p = 0.02). Our results suggest that some overwintering sparrows will alter space use in response to the presence of artificial surface water, however, it is unknown whether provision of water influences overwinter survival of sparrows. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Aridland riparian ecosystems are limited, the climate is changing, and further hydrological change is likely in the American Southwest. To protect riparian ecosystems and organisms, we need to understand how they are affected by disturbance processes and stressors such as fire, drought, and non-native plant invasions. Riparian vegetation is critically important as foraging, resting, migrating, and breeding habitat to birds and other animal species in the southwestern United States. Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii), and other woody species provide birds with nesting sites and foraging opportunities, some of which are absent or rare in adjacent plant communities. The structurally diverse, species-rich vegetation along many southwestern streams supports high densities of territories and nest sites for a variety of birds including several species of high conservation priority. Survival and reproduction of woody riparian plants is largely determined by periodic floods and droughts. As in other regions, rivers and streams of the American Southwest have been heavily altered by human activity, resulting in significant changes to disturbance regimes. Hydrological models, incorporating greenhouse gas emission scenarios, project that these changes will be exacerbated by climate change. In this report, we review the ecohydrology of southwestern streams and share results from our study sites along the Middle Rio Grande to describe effects of hydrological changes, wildfire, and invasions on plant communities and riparian-nesting birds. We also examine climate change projections and output from population models to gauge the future of aridland riparian ecosystems in an increasingly arid Southwest. © 2017, USDA Forest Service.

abstract={Woodpeckers are a very good indicators of forest naturalness. The fact that many species of these birds are in decline in centra! and western Europe resulted from changcs in forest management (e.g. favouring coniferous forest, removal of dead trees). The aim of this research was to evaluate the importance of patches of deciduous species for the occurrence of some specialized woodpeckers in the conditions of Scots pine dominated stands. The study focused on spccics associated with deciduous forest, i.e. middle spotted woodpecker Uiopicus rnedius (L), white-backed woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos (Bechstein) and grey-headed woodpecker Picus can us (Gmelin). Statistical analyses were performed for the woodpeckers, which occurred in more than 10 territories. The studies were performed in 2015-2017 in the southern part of the Sandomierz Basin in three study areas (52,6-59 km2). Two plots were dominated by black alder Altius glutinosa and oak Quercus sp., while the third one was characterized by the highest share of black alder, followed by silver birch Betulapetidula and oak. Deciduous trees at the age over 80 years accounted for less than 2% of the total area of each plot. The most abundant bird species in patches of deciduous forest was the middle spotted woodpccker (25 territories), while the rarest was white-backed woodpecker (1 territory). Grey-headed woodpecker appeared in 12 territories. The density of woodpeckers in deciduous forest areas ranged from 0.45 territories/100 ha for grey-headed woodpecker to 1.54 territories/100 ha for the middle spotted woodpecker. In the alder patches we found all territories of grey-headed woodpecker, 24% territories of the middle spotted woodpecker and single territories of white-backed woodpecker. The patches dominated by oak accountcd for about 76% of territories of middle spotted woodpecker. The average area of the patches with presence of middle spotted woodpecker and grey woodpecker was significantly higher than the patches where woodpeckers were absent. The middle spotted woodpecker occurrcd in the forest patches with the highest average age. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) demonstrated that the occurrence of middle spotted woodpecker was most strongly associated with the area of the patches over 10 ha, while the grey-headed woodpecker preferred mature forest stands of alder. These species abundance was negatively correlated with a patch area less than 10 ha.},

abstract={Riparian ecosystems provide important ecosystem services and recreational opportunities for people, and habitat for wildlife. In California's Central Valley, government agencies and private organizations are working together to protect and restore riparian ecosystems, and the Central Valley Joint Venture provides leadership in the formulation of goals and objectives for avian conservation in riparian ecosystems. We defined a long-term conservation goal as the establishment of riparian ecosystems that provide sufficient habitat to support genetically robust, self-sustaining, and resilient bird populations. To achieve this goal, we selected a suite of 12 breeding riparian landbird focal species as indicators of the state of riparian ecosystems in each of four major Central Valley planning regions. Using recent bird survey data, we estimated that over half of the regional focal species populations are currently small (< 10,000) and may be vulnerable to extirpation, and two species have steeply declining population trends. For each focal species in each region, we defined long-term (100-year) population objectives that are intended to be conservation endpoints that we expect to meet the goal of genetically robust, self-sustaining, and resilient populations. We then estimated the long-term species density and riparian restoration objectives required to achieve the long-term population objectives. To track progress toward the long-term objectives, we propose short-term (10-year) objectives, including the addition of 12,919 ha (31,923 ac) of riparian vegetation in the Central Valley (by planning region: 3,390 ha in Sacramento, 2,390 ha in Yolo-Delta, 3,386 ha in San Joaquin, and 3,753 ha in Tulare). We expect that reaching these population, density, and habitat objectives through threat abatement, habitat restoration, and habitat enhancement will result in improvements to riparian ecosystem function and resilience that will benefit other wildlife populations and the people of the Central Valley and beyond.},

abstract={Recent and unprecedented scale of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) conservation in the American West enables assessment of community-level benefits afforded to other sagebrush-obligate species. We use North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) count data and machine-learning to assess predictors influencing spatial distribution and abundance of three sagebrush-obligate songbirds (Brewer's sparrow [Spizella breweri], sagebrush sparrow [Artemisiospiza nevadensis], and sage thrasher [Oreoscoptes montanus]). We quantified co-occurrence of songbird abundance with sage-grouse lek distributions using point pattern analyses and evaluated the concurrence of songbird abundance within sage-grouse habitat restoration and landscape protection. Sagebrush land-cover predictors were positively associated with the abundance of each songbird species in models that explained 16-37% of variation in BBS route level counts. Individual songbird models identified an apparent 40% threshold in sagebrush land-cover, over which songbird abundances nearly doubled. Songbird abundances were positively associated with sage-grouse distributions (P b 0.01); range-wide, landscapes supporting N 50% of males on leks also harbored 13-19% higher densities of songbirds compared with range-wide mean densities. Eighty-five percent of the conifer removal conducted through the Sage Grouse Initiative coincided with high to moderate Brewer's sparrow abundance. Wyoming's landscape protection (i.e., "core area") strategy for sage-grouse encompasses half the high to moderate abundance sagebrush sparrow and sage thrasher populations. In the Great Basin half the high to moderate abundance sagebrush sparrow and sage thrasher populations coincide with sage-grouse Fire and Invasive Assessment Tool priorities, where conservation actions are being focused in an attempt to reduce the threat of wildfire and invasive plants. Our work illustrates spatially targeted actions being implemented ostensibly for sage-grouse largely overlap high abundance centers for three sagebrush obligate passerines and are likely providing significant conservation benefits for less well-known sagebrush songbirds and other sagebrush-associated wildlife. © 2017 The Society for Range Management.

abstract={Background The North Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and Selvagens present a unique biological diversity including, presently, 56 endemic spider species. Several recent projects provide valuable information on their distribution across most islands and habitats. To date, the only endemic spider assessed according to the IUCN Red List criteria is Hogna ingens. The objective of this paper is to assess all remaining endemic species and advise on possible future conservation actions critical for the survival of endangered species. New information Seven species were found to have a continuing decline in either range or population size. Their decline can be mostly attributed to habitat destruction or degradation, invasive plant species that reduce quality of habitat, forest fires at high mountain regions and possible competition for resources from invasive congeners. The tetragnathid M. barreti is considered as possibly extinct due to the suspected impact of a competing species. Although most endemic spiders from the Madeira and Selvagens archipelagos have relatively low extinction risk due to the good condition and protection of the laurisilva forests where many live, there are a number of species requiring urgent attention and protection measures. These include all cave and mountain-restricted species as well as those threatened by competing congeners or invasive plants. Extending current protected areas, restoring original habitats of threatened species and the control of invasive taxa should remain a priority for species survival. © Cardoso P et al.},

abstract={The native vegetation of the Sabana de Bogota’s flat area has been replaced by agricultural lands, pastures and urbanizations over the years. The last relict of this native vegetation is a small forest (ca 10 ha) at Hacienda Las Mercedes, in the northern border of Bogota. The forest’s small size and isolation from other areas of natural vegetation have resulted in the loss of many species. The problem was exacerbated by uncontrolled growth of invasive vegetation (vines and wild blackberry). However, in recent years restorative action including control of these vegetation has been undertaken and the forest is now immerse in a natural reserve where more restorative actions are being planned. Using point count stations the authors recorded all the birds seen and heard in 2001-2002 and in 2014 in order to evaluate the changes in the bird community and estimate the effects of the restorative actions. We recorded 27 forest species in the first census and 30 in the second. The relative abundance of at least 1/3 of the species also increased indicating a positive result in the forest restoration. The results highlight the capacity of degraded ecosystems to recover and the importance of continuing the restorative actions in the reserve area. © 2016 Author(s) retain the copyright of this article.},

abstract={Habitat availability might be the most important determinant of success for a species reintroduction programme, making investigation of the quality and quantity of habitat needed to produce self-sustaining populations a research priority for reintroduction ecologists. We used a stochastic model of population dynamics to predict whether attempts to improve existing breeding territories using artificial nest platforms improved the population growth rate and persistence of a reintroduced population of Northern Aplomado Falcons Falco femoralis septentrionalis in South Texas. We further assessed whether the creation of new territories, i.e. conversion of entire areas to suitable habitat and not simply the erection of nest platforms, would lead to a subsequent increase in the nesting population. Our model was able to reproduce several characteristics of the wild population and predicted the number of breeding pairs per year strikingly well (R2 = 0.97). Simulations revealed that the addition of nest platforms improved productivity such that the population would decline to extinction without them but is stable since their installation. Moreover, the model predicted that the increase in productivity due to nest platforms would cause the population to saturate available breeding territories, at which point the population would contain a moderate proportion of non-territorial birds that could occupy territories if new ones become available. Population size would therefore be proportional to the increase in available territories. Our study demonstrates that artificial nest-sites can be an effective tool for the management of reintroduced species. © 2016 British Ornithologists’ Union},

abstract={Military training areas (MTAs) cover 6% of the earth's land surface, but the impact on biodiversity of weapons use in MTAs remains largely unknown. We quantified the effects of military training on vertebrates in a 5-year study at Beecroft Weapons Range in south-eastern Australia by contrasting the occurrence of birds, mammals and reptiles between 24 sites within an area subject to repeated weapons use and a matched set of non-impacted sites. Species richness of mammals and reptiles was similar within versus outside the impact area, although many individual species responded to fire, which occurred more frequently in impacted sites. Bird species richness, the occurrence of larger-bodied and migratory bird species, and the occurrence of most individual bird species, was reduced within the impact area. Many bird species that displayed low prevalence in impacted sites also declined over time across the whole study area. Differences in biota between the impact and non-impact areas were detectable after controlling for the effects of recent fire, suggesting that weapons use impacted vertebrates through mechanisms additional to altered fire regimes. Overall, our data indicated that Beecroft Weapons Range maintained considerable biodiversity value despite prolonged military use. Hence, MTAs have the potential to make a substantial contribution to conservation outside the formal protected area network. However, managers of MTAs need to explicitly state their environmental objectives. This is because management practices may be different if the aim is to maximize species richness rather than to secure populations of particular species. © 2016},

abstract={Landscape-level wildfires have a major role in structuring faunal assemblages, particularly in fire-prone landscapes. These effects are mediated by changes to vegetation structure and composition that directly influence the availability of shelter, feeding and breeding resources. We investigated the response of a semi-arid shrubland bird community in Western Australia to the prevailing fire regime by examining the abundance, diversity and guild structure in relation to time since fire. We also examined vegetation structural attributes in relation to time since fire. We surveyed 32 sites ranging in age from 12 to 84 years since last fire. A total of 845 birds from 40 species were recorded. Vegetation structure varied with fire history with old and very old sites characterised by less bare ground, more leaf litter cover and greater canopy cover. Bird community composition varied with time since fire, driven by increased bird species richness and abundance of insectivores, granivores/frugivores, golden whistlers, grey shrike-thrush and red-capped robins with time since fire. Frequent, intense landscape-scale fires transform the landscape into homogeneous young shrublands, which may render vegetation unsuitable for several species and guilds. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Agricultural intensification has been a major factor in the loss of global biodiversity. Still, agricultural landscapes provide important habitat for many bird species, particularly in the Central Valley of California, USA, where >90% of the natural wildlife habitat has been lost. As wildlife professionals increasingly work with agricultural producers to promote 'wildlife-friendly' farming, it is important to understand the relative value of specific crops and field management practices to birds. The value to wintering waterbirds of seven treatments (crop and management practice combinations) across two crops (corn and winter wheat) was assessed at Staten Island in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta of the Central Valley. Significant variation in the relative abundance of waterbirds was found among management practices, and post-harvest flooding and chopping and rolling (mulching) of corn were most beneficial to waterbirds. As expected, most waterbirds were common in flooded treatments, but geese, cranes and long-legged waders also were numerous in some dry treatments. Our data suggest that a greater waterbird species richness and abundance can be achieved by maintaining a mosaic of dry and flooded crop types, varying water depths and continuing the chop-and-roll practice for flooded corn. The observed benefits of particular crops and field management practices in this study should aid in the development of incentive-based programs to improve the habitat value of other working lands both within, and outside, the Delta.

abstract={The conservation of biological diversity is one of the main goals for managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. Presence and abundance of microhabitats, such as tree cavities or bark pockets, can be conveniently used as indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of sustainable forest management measures. In Mediterranean forest ecosystems, the relationships between stand-structure attributes and species-diversity indicators are still poorly studied. We described the structural attributes, deadwood characteristics and microhabitat occurrence in a silver fir forest of Central Apennines (Italy), which has not been submitted to silvicultural interventions for several decades. We assessed linkages between these characteristics and the abundance, distribution and diversity of saproxylic beetle fauna. A systematic aligned sampling method was conduced on 240 ha, examining 50 plots of 530 m2 each. Saproxylic beetles were sampled using window flight traps and emergence traps in relation to abundance and species richness at the plot level, but also on decaying deadwood. The heterogeneity in types and frequencies of microhabitats, and the link between structural attributes associated with stand complexity and saproxylic species, were also analysed. With the aim of describing the complex saproxylic ecological network, beetle species were classified according to the type of interactions with wood and other insects fauna, but also in relation to the trophic guilds. Linear regressions were conducted for highlighting metric variability and relationships between parameters, while geostatistical analyses were used to describe the spatial variability of structural features and the spatial pattern of beetle distributions. Results of linear regression and geostatistical analysis showed how the saproxylic beetle community is influenced by the amount, type and stage of decay of deadwood, but also by the forest structural complexity and the occurrence of microhabitats. Gap dynamics and natural disturbances had effects on deadwood amounts and microhabitat abundance, which was significantly higher than in managed and structurally simplified forest stands. Most of the entomological variables (namely, Families, Species, Total individuals, Saproxylic individuals, Staphylinidae, Elateridae, Nothodes parvulus, Curculionidae, Ernoporus fagi, Phyllobius emery) were clumped, highlighting the existence of aggregation areas in the sampled forest. In several cases the insect distribution was linked to the spatial pattern of forest attributes, particularly deadwood components. © 2016},

abstract={Aims: To investigate how habitat change and different levels of protection interact to determine variation in the (alpha and beta) diversity of bird communities in three bioclimatic zones, considering the impacts of non-native species, and the contribution of these effects to global (gamma) diversity. Location: Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve, central Mexico. Methods: We carried out bird surveys in a number of locations which varied according to their underlying vegetation type, their level of protection and the degree to which they had undergone modification by humans. We conducted a range of analyses to determine the impacts of protection and modification on the richness and mean global population trends of the species found in each location. We compared community composition to assess the homogenization effect of habitat modification. Results: Human-modified environments in each of three bioclimatic zones held significantly greater numbers of species (alpha diversity) than unmodified habitats. Human-mediated changes to local bird communities altered patterns of beta diversity in opposite directions; communities across bioclimatic zones were more similar to one another in modified areas than in unmodified areas but, on a local scale, modification of vegetation increased community dissimilarity. The changes are likely to contribute to a decline in global (gamma) diversity, given that globally vulnerable (declining) birds were mostly associated with unmodified, strictly protected areas. Main conclusions: We highlight that assessment of human impacts and conservation need depends on the metric of biodiversity used and scale considered: small-scale habitat change increased local and regional avian diversity but strictly protected areas are still required to protect globally vulnerable species. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={This report provides a strategic approach developed by a Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies interagency working group for conservation of sagebrush ecosystems, Greater sage-grouse, and Gunnison sage-grouse. It uses information on (1) factors that influence sagebrush ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to nonnative invasive annual grasses and (2) distribution and relative abundance of sage-grouse populations to address persistent ecosystem threats, such as invasive annual grasses and wildfire, and land use and development threats, such as oil and gas development and cropland conversion, to develop effective management strategies. A sage-grouse habitat matrix links relative resilience and resistance of sagebrush ecosystems with modeled sage-grouse breeding habitat probabilities to help decisionmakers assess risks and determine appropriate management strategies at both landscape and site scales. Areas for targeted management are assessed by overlaying matrix components with Greater sage-grouse Priority Areas for Conservation and Gunnison sage-grouse critical habitat and linkages, breeding bird concentration areas, and specific habitat threats. Decision tools are discussed for determining the suitability of target areas for management and the most appropriate management actions. A similar approach was developed for the Great Basin that was incorporated into the Federal land use plan amendments and served as the basis of a Bureau of Land Management Fire and Invasives Assessment Tool, which was used to prioritize sage-grouse habitat for targeted management activities. © 2016, USDA Forest Service.

abstract={An emerging hypothesis in fire ecology is that pyrodiversity increases species diversity. We test whether pyrodiversity—defined as the standard deviation of fire severity—increases avian biodiversity at two spatial scales, and whether and how this relationship may change in the decade following fire. We use a dynamic Bayesian community model applied to a multi-year dataset of bird surveys at 1106 points sampled across 97 fires in montane California. Our results provide strong support for a positive relationship between pyrodiversity and bird diversity. This relationship interacts with time since fire, with pyrodiversity having a greater effect on biodiversity at 10 years post-fire than at 1 year post-fire. Immediately after fires, patches of differing burn severities hold similar bird communities, but over the ensuing decade, bird assemblages within patches of contrasting severities differentiate. When evaluated at the scale of individual fires, fires with a greater heterogeneity of burn severities hold substantially more species. High spatial heterogeneity in severity, sometimes called ‘mixed-severity fire’, is a natural part of wildfire regimes in western North America, but may be jeopardized by climate change and a legacy of fire suppression. Forest management that encourages mixed-severity fire may be critical for sustaining biodiversity across fire-prone landscapes. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Moist high-altitude grasslands in South Africa are renowned for high avifaunal diversity and are priority areas for conservation. Conservation management of these areas conflicts with management for other uses, such as intensive livestock agriculture, which requires annual burning and leads to heavy grazing. Recently the area has become target for water storage schemes and renewable electricity energy projects. There is therefore an urgent need to investigate environmental factors and habitat factors that affect bird species richness in order to optimise management of those areas set aside for conservation. A particularly good opportunity to study these issues arose at Ingula in the eastern South African highaltitude grasslands. An area that had been subject to intense grazing was bought by the national power utility that constructed a pumped storage scheme on part of the land and set aside the rest for bird conservation. Since the new management took over in 2005 the area has been mostly annually burned with relatively little grazing. The new management seeks scientific advice on how to maintain avian species richness of the study area. We collected bird occurrence and vegetation data along random transects between 2006 and 2010 to monitor the impact of the new management, and to study the effect of the habitat changes on bird species richness. To achieve these, we convert bird transect data to presence only data to investigate how bird species richness were related to key transect vegetation attributes under this new grassland management. First we used generalised linear mixed models, to examine changes in vegetation grass height and cover and between burned and unburned habitats. Secondly, we examined how total bird species richness varied across seasons and years. And finally we investigated which habitat vegetation attributes were correlated with species richness of a group of grassland depended bird species only. Transects that were burned showed a larger decrease in vegetation cover compared to transects that were not burned. Grass height increased over time. Bird species richness was highest in summer compared to other seasons and increased over time. Overall bird species richness increased over the three summer surveys but species richness of birds that prefer heavily grazed habitat showed little change over the three years. Changes in bird species richness were best explained by the model with grass height for combined species richness of grassland depended birds but also for birds that prefer heavy grazing when treated alone. On one hand birds that prefer moderate grazing were best explained by a null model. However, overall bird species richness was better positively correlated to grass height than grass cover or dead grass. We conclude that frequent burning alone with relatively reduced grazing led to higher but less dense grass, which benefited some species and disadvantaged others. We suggest that management of this grassland use combination of fire and grazing and leave some areas unburned to accommodates birds of various habitat needs. © 2016 Maphisa et al.

abstract={Fire is a major ecological process in ecosystems globally. Its impacts on fauna can be both direct (e.g., mortality) and indirect (e.g., altered habitat), resulting in population recovery being driven by several possible mechanisms. Separating direct from indirect impacts of fire on faunal population recovery can be valuable in guiding management of biodiversity in fire-prone environments. However, resolving the influence of direct and indirect processes remains a key challenge because many processes affecting fauna can change concomitantly with time since fire. We explore the mechanisms influencing bird response to fire by posing the question, can temporal changes in vegetation structure predict changes in bird occurrence on sites, and can these be separated from other temporal changes using the surrogate of time since fire? We conducted a 12-yr study of bird and vegetation responses to fire at 124 sites across six vegetation classes in Booderee National Park, Australia. Approximately half of these sites, established in 2002, were burned by a large (>3000 ha) wildfire in 2003. To disentangle collinear effects of temporal changes in vegetation and direct demographic effects on population recovery that are subsumed by time since fire, we incorporated both longitudinal and cross-sectional vegetation effects in addition to time since fire within logistic structural equation models. We identified temporal changes in vegetation structure and richness of plant and bird species that characterized burned and unburned sites in all vegetation classes. For nine bird species, a significant component of the year trend was driven by temporal trends in one of three vegetation variables (number of understory or midstory plant species, or midstory cover). By contrast, we could not separate temporal effects between time since fire and vegetation attributes for bird species richness, reporting rate, and the occurrence of 11 other bird species. Our findings help identify species for which indirect effects of vegetation dominate recovery and thus may benefit from vegetation management where conservation actions are required and, conversely, those species for which direct effects of time since fire drive recovery, where simply leaving a system to recover following the last disturbance will be sufficient. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Pristine areas are becoming rare everywhere, resulting in scattered fragments of natural environments. In the Brazilian steppe savanna, this situation requires attention because habitats with higher economic value are underrepresented by the protected area system. Between 2009 and 2010, we surveyed 60 sites with differing landscapes such as plateaus, slopes, and lowlands in the Serra de Santana. At each site, we applied standardized bird survey methods and compared the observed and projected richness of each landscape. We recorded 189 species, with the highest species richness in the slope habitat, followed by plateaus, and then lowlands. In the slope habitat, there were more forest-dependent species, as well as more species with high and medium sensitivity to disturbance. Endemic species with high and medium sensitivity to disturbances were restricted to slopes and some fragments of the plateaus. Our results show that the region is an important area due to the high bird species richness and presence of endemic and threatened species. The slope areas were the richest due to more recent human occupation. As priority measures for Serra de Santana, we suggest the control of deforestation and the designation of a protected area that encompasses all the altitudinal variation in the region. © 2016 Istituto per lo Studio degli Ecosistemi of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Firenze.},

abstract={Increased demand for oil palms has led to a massive expansion of logging and conversion of peat swamp forests in Southeast Asia. Although palm oil is a primary driver of economic growth, the unsustainable expansion of the oil palm industry has led to the widespread degradation of peat swamp forests. Birds have been studied to determine their responses to landscape changes in the North Selangor Peat Swamp Forest (NSPSF). We captured 1045 birds from 72 species of the NSPSF and 168 individual birds from 13 species in oil palm plantations using mist-netting. Our results show that peat swamp forest supports more bird species than the oil palm areas. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling revealed that both vegetation types had an influence on bird species composition. SIMPER analysis also showed that the percentage of the assemblage similarity within the oil palm areas was 51.30 %, while it was 31.32 % in the peat swamp. We found that the populations of frugivores, insectivores, and omnivores were significantly higher in the peat swamp forest, whereas there was no significant difference in the granivores between the two sites. To conserve peat swamp forests, stakeholders should implement habitat restoration, maintain landscape connectivity, and retain a forest area network. © 2016, Society of Wetland Scientists.},

abstract={Capsule: Restoration of grasslands on ski-pistes caused a recovery in the bird community, but not to the extent that it was equivalent to a natural Alpine grassland community. Aim: To test whether revegetation of ski-pistes in open habitat areas results in bird community recovery. Methods: The bird communities in two ski resorts in the Italian Maritime Alps were surveyed using a standardized area count method in three different plot types: non-restored ski-pistes (newly constructed), restored ski-pistes and control plots in grassland far from ski-pistes. Results: In 49 independent plots, 32 species were recorded. Species richness and abundance of birds were significantly higher on restored than on non-restored ski-pistes, independently of the species group considered and the analyses carried out. Bird community parameters of restored ski-pistes were still lower than those of natural grassland, as shown by results of typical grassland species. Conclusion: Our results suggest that an apparently successful restoration of ski-pistes may be not enough to promote a complete recovery of bird communities. The complete recovery of local bird communities may be promoted only if an integral recovery of the original vegetal communities is achieved. We suggest the best conservation option is to adopt techniques to maintain as far as possible original grassland if construction of new ski-pistes is unavoidable. © 2016 British Trust for Ornithology.},

abstract={Oak savanna, once widespread across central North America, has functionally vanished from most of its range due to land conversion or fire suppression and subsequent afforestation. Savanna-associated bird species have exhibited population declines as a result. One of the few areas containing remnant oak savanna is the vast Cross Timbers ecoregion of the south-central Unites States. Previous research in the Midwest showed some bird species exhibited higher rates of nest success (i.e., lower predation of eggs and nestlings) in restored savannas than in closed-canopy forests. Our objective was to quantify patterns of avian nest success across a gradient from open-canopy oak savanna to closed-canopy forest in the Cross Timbers ecoregion of southeastern Kansas. Daily nest survival rates for four common bird species-mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus), brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum), and northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos)-were modeled against covariates of woodland structure along the habitat gradient. Tree density and canopy cover had no significant effects on daily nest survival rate, but daily survival rates of brown thrasher and northern mockingbird nests showed positive trends with increasing shrub density. We expect restoration of oak savanna habitat would have little effect on nest survival of some common bird species in the naturally heterogeneous Cross Timbers ecoregion.},

abstract={Knowledge about plant diversity along disturbance gradients is essential for conservation and management of fragmented coastal habitats. This study examined the effects of human disturbance intensity in coastal habitats of Kuwait on diversity, composition, identity and assemblage of vascular plant species. Plant survey data from 113 plots (5 m×5 m each) were randomly selected in 51 sites at coastal fragmented habitats at three levels of disturbance intensities (high, moderate and low) and were statistically analyzed. The results revealed that about 76% of the recorded species are considered threatened species in Kuwait, most of which are being lost in high disturbed habitats. Disturbance led to the dominance of Zygophyllum qatarense, Cornulaca aucheri and Salsola imbricata, which are species of disturbance indicators. Richness, total plant cover and species diversity were higher in moderate and low disturbed habitats than in high disturbed habitats. Beta diversity between high and low disturbed habitats was higher than either between high and moderate, or between moderate and low disturbed habitats. Cluster analyses showed statistically significant differences in composition of plant assemblages, which indicate high beta diversity between the habitat types. Intensive urbanization and industrialization are among the most serious threats that contribute to declines in biological diversity and rapid fragmentation of coastal habitats in Kuwait. Establishing protective enclosures in the disturbed habitats, planting endangered and vulnerable species, and establishing a natural reserve at Nuwaiseeb are recommended conservation actions to avoid loss of the fragmented coastal habitats and to facilitate restoration of native plants. © 2016, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer - Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Reintroductions aim to re-establish species within their historical ranges through the release of wild- or captive-bred individuals following extirpation (or extinction) in the wild. There is no general agreement on what constitutes a successful reintroduction but the probability of the population achieving long-term persistence should be addressed. Here we review a 10-year trial reintroduction of the great bustard Otis tarda, a globally threatened bird species, to the UK and assess the long-term population viability. Despite changes in rearing and release strategy, initial post-release survival probability remained consistently low, with only 11.3% of bustards (n = 167) surviving from release to 1 year post-release. Nineteen breeding attempts were made by eight females; however, only one chick survived > 100 days after hatching, and no wild juveniles have recruited into the population. Using demographic rates from the UK population and wild populations elsewhere, and stochastic population modelling, we investigate the viability of this reintroduced population by predicting population size over the next 10 years. Under current demographic rates the population was predicted to decline rapidly. Self-sufficiency was predicted only using the highest estimates from the UK population for first-year and adult survival, and recruitment rates from wild populations elsewhere. Although changes have been made in rearing, release strategies, habitat management and release sites used, these changes appear to have a modest effect on long-term viability. Substantial improvements in survival rates and productivity are necessary to establish a viable great bustard population in the UK, and we consider this unlikely. © Fauna & Flora International 2015.},

abstract={The effect of habitat management is commonly evaluated by measuring population growth, which does not distinguish changes in reproductive success from changes in survival or the effects of immigration or emigration. Management has rarely been evaluated considering complete life cycle of the target organisms, including also possible negative impacts from management. We evaluated the effectiveness of cattle grazing in the restoration of coastal meadows as a breeding habitat for small and medium-sized ground-nesting birds by examining the size and demography of a southern dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii) breeding population. Using a stochastic renesting model that includes within-season variation in breeding parameters, we evaluated the effect of grazing time and stocking rates on reproduction. The census data indicated that the population was stable when nest trampling was prevented, but detailed demographic models showed that the population on managed meadows was a sink that persisted by attracting immigrants. Even small reductions in reproductive success caused by trampling were detrimental to long-term viability. We suggest that the best management strategy is to postpone grazing to after the 19th of June, which is about three weeks later than what is optimal from the farmer's point of view. The differing results from the two evaluation approaches warn against planning and evaluating management only based on census population size and highlight the need to consider target-specific life history characteristics and demography. Even though grazing management is crucial for creating and maintaining suitable habitats, we found that it was insufficient in maintaining a viable population without additional measures that increase nest success. In the presently studied case and in populations with similar breeding cycles, impacts from nest trampling can be avoided by starting grazing when about 70% of the breeding season has past. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Forests have high biodiversity, but are under threat worldwide. Sustainable forest management such as close-to-nature silviculture is needed. In this context forest management practices should be tested in regard to biodiversity. Therefore, we investigated the influence of gap formation and logging intensity on different functional groups in a close-to-nature managed fir-beech forest. Plots were selected in three areas in the Dinaric Mountains in Slovenia. In every area, nine plots were selected per area, of which three were established as control plots, three were treated with 50% logging and three with 100% logging. In every plot, the species of different functional groups were observed: ectomycorrhizal fungi, ferns, graminoids, forbs, hoverflies, carabid beetles and birds. For each of these groups, the species richness, species assemblage dissimilarity and indicator species were calculated for the different treatments. Ectomycorrhizal fungi and birds both responded to high logging intensity with a sharp decrease in the number of species; however, the results for ectomycorrhizal fungi were highly nested, while some additional bird species appeared. Graminoids and forbs were positively affected by logging intensity and saw increases in the number of species. Forbs had an almost completely new species assemblage compared to the forest species assemblages. Hoverflies were most favored by 50% logging, as these plots contained species from open areas and forest. Ferns and carabid beetles did not exhibit a response to different logging intensities. The number of indicator species was highly affected by the total number of species of the groups. However, which treatment they indicated was independent of the species richness but varied strongly per species group. The variability in responses shows that functional groups react differently to logging intensities, and the use of more functional groups improved the detection of changes due to logging. Fifty percent removal of the growing stock retained the diversity of most of the studied groups. The association of the group to vegetation structure, host species specificity or abiotic factors made them more responsive to the change associated with retention logging. The results are discussed in the context of forest management implications in regard to biodiversity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Summary The biodiversity and naturalness of forests that cover stream valleys in submontane areas have not been investigated as intensively as riparian forests along large lowland rivers. In this study we compared data on total bird assemblages and on selected indicator species detected in forests along submontane stream valleys ('Vall') with those detected in forests covering submontane slopes and tops in the foothills ('Hill') of the Western Carpathians, considering also environmental characteristics of the studied locations. The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis that forests along submontane stream valleys harbour significantly richer and more diverse bird communities and that they are an important habitat for rare and threatened species. We found that the species richness, abundance of birds and bird diversity were almost twice as high in 'Vall' than in 'Hill' locations and that indicator species mostly or exclusively inhabit 'Vall' locations. Moreover, species diversity was highly and positively correlated with higher tree species diversity and a higher amount of large trees and dead wood, but negatively correlated with logging intensity. The results of our study confirmed that forested river valleys in submontane areas play an important role as refugia both for rare and endangered bird species as well as for the whole bird assemblage. This study is the first to present an assessment of this type of habitat for birds in the Western Carpathians. Forests along submontane stream valleys, if protected or unmanaged, could be treated as reference areas for nature and biodiversity conservation. © BirdLife International 2015.},

abstract={Fuel treatments in fire-suppressed mixed-conifer forests are designed to moderate potential wildfire behavior and effects. However, the objectives for modifying potential fire effects can vary widely, from improving fire suppression efforts and protecting infrastructure, to reintroducing low-severity fire, to restoring and maintaining variable forest structure and wildlife habitat. In designing a fuel treatment, managers can alter the treatment's prescription, placement, and extent (collectively the "treatment strategy") to optimally meet one objective. However, the potential for trade-offs among different objectives is rarely tested systematically in fire-prone landscapes. To evaluate trade-offs in mechanical fuel treatment objectives related to fire severity, smoke production, forest heterogeneity, and avian wildlife habitat, we used a cross-platform modeling approach based on spatially explicit modifications of forest structure data for a 7820-ha landscape in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California. We examine whether (1) a more uniform treatment strategy aimed at fire hazard reduction (FHR) had negative effects on wildlife diversity, (2) a strategy focused on protecting the wildland-urban interface (WUI) left other portions of the landscape vulnerable to high-severity fire, and (3) increasing the extent of fuel treatments across the landscape led to greater reductions in fire severity and smoke emissions. When approximately 13% of the landscape was treated, the proportion of the landscape vulnerable to high-severity fire decreased by 13-44%, with the more uniform FHR strategy leading to greater reductions. Slight increases in predicted avian species richness that followed all treatment strategies were not closely linked to increases in canopy variability. The WUI protection strategy led to considerable reductions in fire severity at the landscape scale. Increasing the extent of treatments to 30% of the landscape did little to further reduce the area vulnerable to high-severity fire, with additional reductions of 4-7% depending on the prescription. However, increasing the extent of treatments reduced the extent of harmful downwind smoke impacts, primarily by reducing rate of fire spread. Treatment strategies will depend on specific management objectives, but we illustrate that trade-offs are not necessarily inherent in general outcomes of fuel treatments. © 2016 Stevens et al.},

abstract={The present research focused on using spatial analysis to determine relationships among land ownership property sizes and landscape structure, with a focus on conservation management implications. Indices and metrics of ownership property sizes and landscape structure were calculated for 20 km buffer areas around 31 North American Breeding Bird Survey transects, 12 located within the Edwards Plateau ecoregion and 18 in contiguous ecoregions. The number of bird species observed at each transect provided a measure of avian species richness associated with land cover classes for each respective transect (González in Urban influence on diversity of avifauna in the Edwards Plateau of Texas: effect of property sizes on rural landscape structure, Texas A&M University, 2005). Spatial correlations were calculated between each pair of the landscape indices. Spatial analysis identified a “threshold of habitat fragmentation” for the 500 acre (ac) ownership property size. Significant spatial correlations among variables showed that property sizes lower than 500 ac produced habitat fragmentation represented by a decrease in mean patch size (MN) and proximity among habitat patches (Index PROX). Spatial analysis also made possible the prioritization of ecological sub-regions of the Edwards Plateau for conservation or restoration. The Live Oak-Mesquite Savannah showed the highest average ownership property size (7305 ac) and the highest values of patch richness. Based on the results, management in the Live Oak-Mesquite Savannah sub-region should focus on the conservation of land mosaic diversity to assure native avian species turnover (Whittaker 1972). In Balcones Canyon Lands, 64 % of land was covered by farms smaller than 500 ac and the overall average ownership property size was above the threshold of fragmentation (1440 ac), implying that management policies there should focus both on habitat conservation and on restoration. In contrast, 71 % of land in the Lampasas Cut Plains was covered by farms smaller than 500 ac, and average ownership property size was very close to the fragmentation threshold (625 ac). Consequently, the results indicate that management in the Lampasas Cut Plains sub-region should focus on habitat restoration (e.g., corridors that connect isolated habitat patches). In general, the threshold of ownership property size, 500 ac, is important for conservation planning because below that threshold of property size, habitat patch size begins to decrease and the distance between equivalent patches of habitat increases. Isolated patches act as islands within a sea of less suitable habitat which produce negative effects on biodiversity. Identifying the spatial characteristics indicative of habitat fragmentation, or the likelihood thereof, is an important issue for conservation planning in places with urban sprawl influence. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Most ecosystems are impacted by multiple local and long-distance stressors, many of which interact in complex ways. We present a framework for prioritizing ecological restoration efforts among sites in multi-stressor landscapes. Using a simple model, we show that both the economic and sociopolitical costs of restoration will typically be lower at sites with a relatively small number of severe problems than at sites with numerous lesser problems. Based on these results, we propose using cumulative stress and evenness of stressor impact as complementary indices that together refect key challenges of restoring a site to improved condition. To illustrate this approach, we analyze stressor evenness across the world's rivers and the Laurentian Great Lakes. This exploration reveals that evenness and cumulative stress are decoupled, enabling selection of sites where remediating a modest number of high-intensity stressors could substantially reduce cumulative stress. Just as species richness and species evenness are fundamental axes of biological diversity, we argue that cumulative stress and stressor evenness constitute fundamental axes for identifying restoration opportunities in multi-stressor landscapes. Our results highlight opportunities to boost restoration efficiency through strategic use of multi-stressor datasets to identify sites that maximize ecological response per stressor remediated. This prioritization framework can also be expanded to account for the feasibility of remediation and the expected societal benefits of restoration projects. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={In forest ecosystems, uniformity in fire spread may be moderated by topography such that sheltered areas (e.g. gullies) escape fire. However, gullies are not immune to fire and, under extreme fire weather conditions, can burn. This may compromise their habitat value, and diminish differences in faunal communities across topographical gradients. We investigated the extent to which differences in avian communities persist when subjected to uniform fire severity and fire history across the gully and slope components of a forest site. We predicted that there would be less difference with increasing fire severity or long absence of fire. Birds were surveyed at 91 paired gully/slope sites in foothill eucalypt forests, two to three years after a large, severe wildfire in south-eastern Australia. Sites were stratified in relation to four levels of fire severity (unburnt through to crown burnt) and two levels of fire history prior to the wildfire (burnt <. 3 years, or >. 20 years). Under similar conditions of fire severity and fire history, gullies maintained greater species richness and abundance than did slopes; averaging 13% greater species richness and 32% greater abundance, along with a distinct bird assemblage. However, contrary to predictions, topographical differences for most avian responses did not diminish with increasing fire severity or in the long absence of fire prior to the wildfire. This study highlights the value of forest gullies in maintaining or facilitating the recovery of distinct avian communities after wildfire, even when the gullies themselves have been burnt. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={As biodiversity hotspots are often characterized by high human population densities, implementation of conservation management practices that focus only on the protection and enlargement of pristine habitats is potentially unrealistic. An alternative approach to curb species extinction risk involves improving connectivity among existing habitat patches. However, evaluation of spatially explicit management strategies is challenging, as predictive models must account for the process of dispersal, which is difficult in terms of both empirical data collection and modelling. Here, we use a novel, individual-based modelling platform that couples demographic and mechanistic dispersal models to evaluate the effectiveness of realistic management scenarios tailored to conserve forest birds in a highly fragmented biodiversity hotspot. Scenario performance is evaluated based on the spatial population dynamics of a well-studied forest bird species. The largest population increase was predicted to occur under scenarios increasing habitat area. However, the effectiveness was sensitive to spatial planning. Compared to adding one large patch to the habitat network, adding several small patches yielded mixed benefits: although overall population sizes increased, specific newly created patches acted as dispersal sinks, which compromised population persistence in some existing patches. Increasing matrix connectivity by the creation of stepping stones is likely to result in enhanced dispersal success and occupancy of smaller patches. Synthesis and applications. We show that the effectiveness of spatial management is strongly driven by patterns of individual dispersal across landscapes. For species conservation planning, we advocate the use of models that incorporate adequate realism in demography and, particularly, in dispersal behaviours. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={In many parts of the world forest disturbance regimes have intensified recently, and future climatic changes are expected to amplify this development further in the coming decades. These changes are increasingly challenging the main objectives of forest ecosystem management, which are to provide ecosystem services sustainably to society and maintain the biological diversity of forests. Yet a comprehensive understanding of how disturbances affect these primary goals of ecosystem management is still lacking. We conducted a global literature review on the impact of three of the most important disturbance agents (fire, wind, and bark beetles) on 13 different ecosystem services and three indicators of biodiversity in forests of the boreal, cool- and warm-temperate biomes. Our objectives were to (i) synthesize the effect of natural disturbances on a wide range of possible objectives of forest management, and (ii) investigate standardized effect sizes of disturbance for selected indicators via a quantitative meta-analysis. We screened a total of 1958 disturbance studies published between 1981 and 2013, and reviewed 478 in detail. We first investigated the overall effect of disturbances on individual ecosystem services and indicators of biodiversity by means of independence tests, and subsequently examined the effect size of disturbances on indicators of carbon storage and biodiversity by means of regression analysis. Additionally, we investigated the effect of commonly used approaches of disturbance management, i.e. salvage logging and prescribed burning. We found that disturbance impacts on ecosystem services are generally negative, an effect that was supported for all categories of ecosystem services, i.e. supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services (P < 0.001). Indicators of biodiversity, i.e. species richness, habitat quality and diversity indices, on the other hand were found to be influenced positively by disturbance (P < 0.001). Our analyses thus reveal a 'disturbance paradox', documenting that disturbances can put ecosystem services at risk while simultaneously facilitating biodiversity. A detailed investigation of disturbance effect sizes on carbon storage and biodiversity further underlined these divergent effects of disturbance. While a disturbance event on average causes a decrease in total ecosystem carbon by 38.5% (standardized coefficient for stand-replacing disturbance), it on average increases overall species richness by 35.6%. Disturbance-management approaches such as salvage logging and prescribed burning were neither found significantly to mitigate negative effects on ecosystem services nor to enhance positive effects on biodiversity, and thus were not found to alleviate the disturbance paradox. Considering that climate change is expected to intensify natural disturbance regimes, our results indicate that biodiversity will generally benefit from such changes while a sustainable provisioning of ecosystem services might come increasingly under pressure. This underlines that disturbance risk and resilience require increased attention in ecosystem management in the future, and that new approaches to addressing the disturbance paradox in management are needed. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={This study explored the hole-nesting bird community for two years, in three beech forest stands of central Italy. Our experimental design involved 12 replicated sampling points in each study area for a total of 36 sampling points. Stand characteristics were measured through selected environmental variables (tree diameter, tree density, volume of dead wood, diversity of dead wood and canopy closure), to develop habitat models for describing the factors affecting the abundance of hole-nesting birds. We performed generalized linear models to determine which environmental variables better explained the presence and abundance of hole-nesting birds in the three study areas. The species that showed the highest values of abundance are the Nuthatch, the Blue Tit and the Great Tit. Within the guild of hole-nesting birds there are differences in the selection of suitable trees for nesting, roosting or foraging. Primary cavity nesters (woodpeckers) are mostly related to the presence of large trees, the volume of dead wood and tree height. The presence and abundance of secondary cavity nesters (tits, nuthatches and treecreepers) seem to be mostly influenced by diversity of dead wood. The diversity of dead wood is an important variable that influences the presence and abundance of hole-nesting birds. Maintenance of both living and standing dead wood in forest ecosystems is recommended to increase the effectiveness of conservation actions affecting the hole-nesting birds. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden 2017},

abstract={As a consequence of extensive habitat loss and fragmentation, grassland bird populations have declined substantially across much of North America. To assess management strategies for restoring and maintaining suitable habitat for grassland birds, we conducted a four-year survey of grassland-breeding passerines in the restored tallgrass prairies of the Carleton College Cowling Arboretum in Northfield, Minnesota. Between 2010 and 2013, we sampled bird populations weekly during the breeding season in ten adjacent management units that differed in size and spatial configuration. We used principal components analysis (PCA) to compare avian community composition among the units and to examine the association between habitat properties and makeup of the community. The size of a management unit had no effect on the bird community, but there was a strong impact of forest edge on community composition. Management units with less exposure to forest edge had greater abundance of grassland-obligate but not grassland-facultative birds. Management units that were less exposed to forest edge also had greater overall grassland bird diversity. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining grassland patches far from forest edges to increase habitat suitability for a diverse assemblage of grassland avifauna.},

abstract={In North America, the loss of habitat heterogeneity resulting from homogeneous livestock grazing is one factor contributing to steep population declines of many grassland bird species. Patch-burn grazing is a management technique that uses historic grassland disturbance as a model to create heterogeneous grassland composition and structure, providing for the diverse habitat requirements of grassland birds. Though this management technique has been used successfully in relatively extensive grasslands, its utility on smaller grassland patches is less clear. We examined the efficacy of patch-burn grazing to restore habitat heterogeneity and increase grassland bird diversity in relatively small pastures (15-32 ha) in a grassland landscape fragmented by cultivation and tree encroachment. In 2006, we established 12 experimental pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of southern Iowa and northern Missouri, with 4 pastures in each of three treatments: 1) patch-burn graze, with spatially discrete fires and free access by cattle (the fire-grazing interaction), 2) graze-and-burn, with free access by cattle and a single burn of the entire pasture every third year, and 3) burn-only, with a single burn of the entire pasture every third year and no grazing. Patch-burn grazing in the first phase of the project (2007-2009) did not generate habitat heterogeneity or significant differences in bird diversity. From 2010 to 2013, stocking rates were reduced to increase residual vegetation in unburned patches at the end of the grazing season to increase heterogeneity. Habitat heterogeneity in patch-burn graze pastures subsequently increased relative to other treatments. Concomitantly, diversity of obligate grassland birds also increased in patch-burn graze pastures and was greatest in 2012 and 2013. We conclude that the fire-grazing interaction can be used to restore habitat heterogeneity and increase grassland bird diversity, even in relatively small grassland patches embedded in a highly fragmented landscape. © 2016 The Society for Range Management.

abstract={Desertification and climate change are degrading large areas of arid and semiarid habitat in many regions. In response, many countries have implemented revegetation programs, commonly using Atriplex nummularia, native to Australia. Although not intrinsically targeted at habitat restoration, these programs aim to restore (stabilize) erosional processes and provide livestock forage (usually goats, sheep). Few investigators have assessed the utility of these novel habitats for native fauna. In a recent, extensive survey of small mammal communities in lands revegetated with A. nummularia in north-central Chile, we captured a single animal, the marsupial (Thylamys elegans). We also captured no birds in our live traps and saw numerous darkling beetles in traps. These striking results contrasted with data from a nearby ungrazed park with natural vegetation where 10 small mammal species are known with total abundances ranging from 15 to 80 animals in similar sampling efforts. These revegetated lands provide poor habitat for native mammals, and we argue that revegetation efforts should include proactive risk assessment and cost-benefit analyses in a structured decision-making framework. In addition, managers should target increased plant species diversity to support broader biological diversity in addition to the need to control erosion. Although our work has focused on revegetation with Atriplex, numerous other plant species have been intentionally introduced to arid lands, usually for economic reasons; many of these, like Atriplex, have unintended consequences for native biota. © 2016 Society for Ecological Restoration},

abstract={Natural disturbances, such as fire, windstorms and insect outbreaks, are important drivers of biodiversity in forest ecosystems, but at the same time cause large economic losses. Among the natural disturbances in Europe, windstorms cause the highest economic loss. After such storms, damaged forest stands are commonly salvage logged to restore economic value. However, such interventions could affect species assemblages of various taxonomic groups, including breeding birds. Despite these potential effects, investigations of the impacts of post-storm logging are largely lacking. We thus investigated assemblages of breeding birds in 21 logged and 21 unlogged windstorm-disturbed forest plots and 18 undisturbed, control forest plots using fixed-radius point-stop counts three, five and seven years after a windstorm within the Bavarian Forest National Park as part of the European Long-Term Ecosystem Research Network. We recorded 2100 bird individuals of 55 bird species. Bird assemblages were predominantly altered by the consequences of the windstorm and affected only to a minor degree by subsequent logging of storm-felled trees. Nevertheless, bird species richness was significantly reduced by post-storm logging within the first season. In general, the windstorm led to a shift in bird assemblage composition from typical forest species towards open- and shrub-land species. Assemblages of logged and unlogged disturbed plots consisted mainly of long-distance migrants and ground-foraging bird species, whereas assemblages of undisturbed control plots consisted of resident species that forage within vegetation. Both unlogged and logged storm-felled coniferous forest stands were inhabited by endangered or declining bird species, such as Water Pipit (Anthus spinoletta) on logged plots and Eurasian Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) on unlogged plots. Indicator species analyses suggested that species of unlogged storm disturbed plots depended on storm-created legacies, such as pits and snags, for foraging and nesting. Hence, we recommend reducing post-storm logging of these legacies to support species restricted to unlogged disturbed forest. To increase the diversity of breeding birds on the landscape scale, diverse logged and unlogged post-disturbance stands should be provided, which could be gained by a partial benign neglect strategy of storm disturbed forest stands. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Many migratory grassland passerines complete their annual life cycle within the United States and investigations into wintering ecology of these species are scarce, particularly in ecoregions where habitat quality is considered to be compromised, such as the coastal prairie of Texas. During 2008-2010, we investigated wintering grassland bird ecology as related to coastal prairie composition and management practices on the mid-upper Texas coast. To quantify grassland bird composition and density among management regimes, we performed 260 transect surveys on 40 different study site pastures deployed among 7 different management regimes, varying in plant community composition as well as frequency (or occurrence) of burning, grazing, and mowing from 29 October 2008-7 April 2009 and 17 November 2009-17 March 2010. A total of 79 bird species (48 species in 2008-2009 and 66 species in 2009-2010) were recorded during this study. Sites that were recently (<2 years prior) grazed, burned, or mowed tended to have the greatest species richness of obligate grassland bird species. Management regime and the resulting habitat characteristics also appeared to influence densities of Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis), and Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), with the former two species selecting areas that had not been recently burned, grazed, or mowed and were characterized by greater vertical vegetation density and litter depth, respectively. Conversely, Sprague's Pipit selected recently burned, grazed, or mowed prairies, characterized by less litter depth and percentage of shrubs nearby. More cosmopolitan species, such as Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) occurred equally among management regimes. Despite similar species richness in floristically disturbed sites, nonnative vegetation appeared to negatively influence species with specific habitat requirements such as Sprague's Pipit, Sedge Wren, and Le Conte's Sparrow. In order to increase wintering avian diversity, coastal prairie habitat conservation and management in Texas should focus on restoring management regimes (i.e., burning, mowing, and grazing) that create heterogeneous environments, while maintaining native vegetation communities. © 2016 The Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Fire is a natural process and the dominant disturbance shaping plant and animal communities in many coniferous forests of the western US. Given that fire size and severity are predicted to increase in the future, it has become increasingly important to understand how wildlife responds to fire and post-fire management. The Angora Fire burned 1243 hectares of mixed conifer forest in South Lake Tahoe, California. We conducted avian point counts for the first 3 years following the fire in burned and unburned areas to investigate which habitat characteristics are most important for re-establishing or maintaining the native avian community in post-fire landscapes. We used a multi-species occurrence model to estimate how avian species are influenced by the density of live and dead trees and shrub cover. While accounting for variations in the detectability of species, our approach estimated the occurrence probabilities of all species detected including those that were rare or observed infrequently. Although all species encountered in this study were detected in burned areas, species-specific modeling results predicted that some species were strongly associated with specific post-fire conditions, such as a high density of dead trees, open-canopy conditions or high levels of shrub cover that occur at particular burn severities or at a particular time following fire. These results indicate that prescribed fire or managed wildfire which burns at low to moderate severity without at least some high-severity effects is both unlikely to result in the species assemblages that are unique to post-fire areas or to provide habitat for burn specialists. Additionally, the probability of occurrence for many species was associated with high levels of standing dead trees indicating that intensive post-fire harvest of these structures could negatively impact habitat of a considerable proportion of the avian community. © 2015 The Zoological Society of London},

These spectra would fit in the widely accepted frameworks of the Ecosystem Approach enshrined in the CBD and adopted by FAO for Fisheries.

abstract={Sustainable forest management aims to produce wood while preserving habitats for biodiversity, which is particularly challenging for vertebrates with local and landscape scale requirements, such as birds or bats. Managers need additional scientific evidence to help them balance conservative and integrative management methods. In this study, the relative influence of management abandonment, stand structure and landscape features on bird and bat communities in 14 managed and unmanaged forests in France is evaluated. Total birds and bats richness, richness for forest and threatened birds and edge-specialized bats significantly increased with total deadwood quantities. Richness of generalist, omnivorous and cavity-nesting birds was higher in unmanaged stands and richness of gleaner bats was positively influenced by the density of standing deadwood. By contrast, landscape variables had little influence on the different ecological groups but did have effects on individual species. Though the effects showed relatively limited magnitude, this study supports the value of deadwood and the importance of management abandonment for forest vertebrates. This study confirms that for integrated conservation strategies to be fully efficient they must be complemented by designating strict forest reserves because some target species groups depend on structural features found only at sufficient levels in those areas.

abstract={The results of avifauna study in Cartma lake, as the part of the restored ornithocomplex of Aral Sea region. Cartma lake makes the part of the left bank lake system of Syrdarya river delta, which was the bay of the Aral Sea until 1967. Due to the catastrophic fall of the water level in Syr Darya River and the subsequent separation of Aral Sea into small pieces, Cartma lake ceased to perform the function of direct communication between the Aral Sea and the river Syrdarya. The positive process which takes place during the past decade and associated with the water-bearing role of Syrdarya for the maintaining of coastal ecosystems contributes to the restoration of the Aral Sea region unique objects. In 2012 the lake systems of Syrdarya delta are included in the list of wetlands of global significance lands protected by the international Ramsar Convention. The studies were conducted to examine the avifauna of Cartma lake. The task was to determine the status of bird species existence in the area of coastal strip recovery. The classification of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats of the lake Cartma is proposed. The lake is characterized by a relatively small set of birds and low population density of waterbirds. Wetland birds are the dominants according to habitat density. Three species listed in the Red Book of the Republic of Kazakhstan were noted. The delta of Syr Darya and Northern Aral Sea is used as a stopping point for migrating birds, taking into account the geographical location of a region combining the wintering periods in South Asia and Africa with Siberia. The details are new ones for an object under study. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Summary Currently, renovation and thermal insulation of buildings is happening at a high rate in many European countries, driven in part by the political aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, building renovations often lead to a loss of structures, such as accessible cavities, on which synanthropic species, for example house-nesting birds, depend. In Germany, due to legislative regulations, it is a common practice to install nest-boxes as compensation for destroyed nest sites of birds. However, studies on the efficacy of such measures remain sparse. We monitored the occupancy of 477 compensatory nest-boxes for Common Swifts Apus apus, predominantly placed on renovated prefabricated buildings in a city in Germany. We found 24.3% of the boxes occupied by Swifts. On most buildings, the number of occupied boxes was as high as or even higher than the assumed number of breeding sites prior to renovation. Furthermore, in a district where nearly all buildings had been renovated in the past 10 years, we recorded a remarkably high density of Swifts breeding in nest-boxes. Using boosted regression trees, we analysed whether eight different nest-box properties influenced box occupation probability. The number of neighbouring boxes was the most important. Additionally, box age, facade orientation, city district, relative and absolute height, and manner of installation (external/internal) also played a role. Between different nest-box types, we found only negligible differences in occupation probability. Our findings suggest that installing nest-boxes is likely to be an appropriate measure to compensate for nesting sites of Swifts lost during building renovations. Based on our results, we recommend mounting the boxes a few metres apart from each other and close to the roof edge to maximise success. Further studies should be carried out to assess whether our results and conclusions can be confirmed in other situations. © BirdLife International 2015.},

abstract={Wildfire is a key factor influencing bird community composition in western North American forests. We need to understand species and community responses to wildfire and how responses vary regionally to effectively manage dry conifer forests for maintaining biodiversity. We compared avian relationships with wildfire burn severity between two dry forest locations of Arizona and Idaho. We predicted different responses to wildfire between locations due to regional differences in historical fire regime. We conducted point count surveys for 3 yr following wildfire (Arizona: 1997-1999; Idaho: 2008-2010) and used multispecies hierarchical models to analyze relationships of bird occupancy with burn severity. Consistent with our prediction for mixed-severity fire regimes characterizing the Idaho location, we observed proportionately more positive species occupancy relationships and, consequently, a positive species richness relationship with burn severity in Idaho. We also observed the opposite pattern in Arizona, which was congruent with our prediction for the low-severity fire regime characterizing that location. Cavity nesters and aerial insectivores occupied more severely burned sites following wildfire, corresponding with predicted increases in nesting substrate and foraging opportunities for these species. In contrast, canopy-nesting foliage gleaners and pine seed consumers exhibited negative relationships with burn severity. Our results were consistent with predictions based on species life histories and with patterns from the literature, suggesting generality of observed relationships and locational difference in relationships with wildfire. We therefore suggest that optimal management strategies for maintaining avian diversity could differ regionally. Specifically, intensive fuels management may be ecologically less appropriate for promoting biodiversity in areas such as the Idaho location where mixed-severity wildfires and dense forest stands were historically more common. © 2016 Latif et al.},

abstract={It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Spreading of viticulture may pose serious threats to biodiversity and adequate policies targeted at decreasing its impact are urgently required. Current knowledge of viticulture effects on biodiversity is scarce and studies on bird communities in vineyards are even scarcer.We surveyed avian assemblages in Trentino vineyards (North-East Italy) in both breeding and wintering seasons to evaluate the effect of: i) landscape, ii) management and iii) topographic-climatic characteristics on birds and to derive implications for conservation. We calculated four community indexes (species richness, abundance, evenness and conservation index) and modelled their relative variation according to 18 environmental variables belonging to the three above-mentioned groups.Landscape models performed better than the others, except for winter evenness, for which management models were the most supported ones. Generally, models considering the three groups together explained more variation than models from an individual group.Landscape (and agricultural) heterogeneity, extent of marginal habitats, density of traditional elements (hedgerows, tree rows, isolated trees and rural buildings) all had positive effects, whereas vineyard cover had negative impact on the value of the four community indexes.Organic management had no apparent effect on avian communities. We detected a seasonal difference in the effects of environmental characteristics on bird communities, which suggested that local conservation efforts could be tuned according to the seasonal importance of vineyards in different regions.Key measures to promote biodiversity in vineyards include maintaining patches of residual habitats in the vineyard matrix and enhancing heterogeneity. Marginal features appeared particularly important in the homogeneous landscape of intensive vineyards to favour bird communities. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The most prominent factors inducing landscape change in the rural regions of south west Europe are depopulation and the associated socio-ecological modifications. The aim of this work was to assess the future implications of these processes on land use/land cover and biodiversity in northwest Iberia. To achieve our goal, we developed a virtual spatially explicit dynamic model to simulate regional socio-ecological dynamics. For the period between 1960 and 2040, we tested four different environmental scenarios ranging from small decreases in conifer forest and a stabilization of agricultural areas and shrublands to more radical shifts, substantial decreases in agricultural areas and massive expansion of eucalyptus stands. The model considers also fire, whose role increased significantly in the scenarios of expanded forests. Bird assemblages, which we used as a surrogate for biodiversity, showed complex patterns although with overall decreases in richness and abundance. Species with narrow niche and from Mediterranean open habitats were particularly sensitive to the ongoing changes simulated. Our results suggest that landscape management actions and planning assessments designed for conserving biodiversity should focus on the maintenance of the traditional agricultural mosaic combined with a regulatory legislation limiting the expansion of fast growing tree forests (e.g Eucalyptus stands). This strategy can contribute to maintaining a diversity of land use/land cover in a heterogeneous landscape and the prevention of the occurrence of large wildfires, fundamental for the implementation of national biodiversity strategies and action plans. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Nearly 60% of European wetlands have been lost to drainage or to the cessation of grassland management. Large amounts of resources are put into wetland restoration with the aim to recover biodiversity. However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated effects of management, wetness and flooding dynamics on biodiversity of restored wetlands such as seasonally flooded wet grasslands. We inventoried bird communities over 4 years at 137 sites (each 3·1 ha) within five restored wet grassland areas in Sweden to investigate whether species richness and occurrence of 12 common wet grassland species were related to (i) local conditions such as management (grazing, mowing and unmanaged areas), basic wetness and spring flooding dynamics. Further, we investigated whether (ii) the composition of the adjacent landscape (20 ha) related to local bird diversity and (iii) species turnover (i.e. beta diversity) differed between sites characterized by their basic wetness, degree of flooding and predominant management regime. Local species richness was positively linked to degree of flooding and basic wetness of grasslands but not to type of grassland management. Species richness tended also to be negatively linked to proportion of forest at the landscape scale. Although variable, the same results were also true concerning the probability of the occurrence of a single species at the local scale. Species turnover between sites, and thus total species richness, was distinctly higher in (i) grazed as compared to mowed grasslands except in dry non-flooded grasslands and (ii) flooded as compared to non-flooded sites. Similar patterns held for the subset of 12 red-listed species. We suggest that the high beta diversity in grazed and flooded grasslands is driven by the heterogeneous vegetation structure, resulting in good conditions for foraging and nesting for several wet grassland bird species. Synthesis and applications. The selection of wetlands for conserving wet grassland birds should prioritize temporary flooded grasslands of moderate wetness, preferably far from forest edges. Restoration and management of wet grasslands should include water level management, removal of shrubs and trees, and low-intensity grazing, whereas mowing could be used in non-flooded grasslands of low basic wetness.

abstract={Aim: In managed forest landscapes, the tolerance of species to contemporary alteration of forest cover is often assumed to reflect their resilience to natural disturbances. We tested this central tenet of ecosystem-based management by comparing the structure of forest bird assemblages among four regions with contrasting historical natural disturbance regimes. Location: Canada's boreal and northern hardwood forests. Methods: Using point count data from four study regions across Canada, we first determined the relative sensitivity of individual bird species to the contemporary reduction of old forest cover at stand and 'landscape-context' (1-km radius) scales with log-linear models. The richness of species most sensitive to loss of old forest (hereafter 'sensitive species') was then modelled as a function of landscape-scale changes in old forest cover. Differences in the rate of decline in the richness of sensitive species with contemporary cover of old forest were compared among regions using ANCOVA. We then compared broken-stick regression models with linear models to detect thresholds, if present, in this relationship in each region. Results: Bird assemblages from regions with relatively infrequent natural disturbances hosted more species sensitive to contemporary reduction in old forest cover. Those species were also more abundant than in regions with frequent natural disturbances, and the rate of decline in their richness with the loss of old forest was steeper in regions with infrequent natural disturbances than in those where they were frequent. However, we did not detect thresholds in this rate of decline in any study region. Main conclusions: Our findings are consistent with the contention that historical natural disturbance regimes shape the response of biota to contemporary landscape alterations through evolutionary adaptation. We argue that forest management conducted within the natural range of variability in stand and landscape structure specific to a region is likely to be ecologically sustainable. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Conservation practitioners frequently have limited information on the structure and function of the ecosystems they wish to preserve, and as a result, they may use shortcuts to guide conservation actions. One such shortcut is the umbrella species approach, whereby conservation actions are geared toward one or a few key species, with the assumption that the entire community will benefit. However, fitness-habitat associations and resource use may vary across space and across management regimes, and so too may the utility of umbrella species as ecosystem surrogates. The federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) has been used as an umbrella species in the restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern US. Restoration efforts were based on early habitat selection information in largely degraded landscapes. We examined patterns of resource selection of 97 social groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers in a restored landscape in northwest Florida. Similar to previous studies in degraded landscapes, woodpecker groups selected forest stands containing higher densities of large pines and lower densities of small pines for foraging. However, we found no evidence for another aspect of habitat selection widely documented in degraded habitat, the avoidance of areas with substantial components of hardwoods. These results align with new woodpecker fitness-habitat associations within restored landscapes and lend support to previous findings that current ecosystem restoration efforts in the study area, namely prescribed burning, may have reduced hardwood densities to below those at which they have negative impacts. The red-cockaded woodpecker has served as an effective umbrella species in degraded longleaf ecosystems by promoting management, especially prescribed burning, that benefits many other species. Whether it will continue to do so in restored habitat is not yet clear, but its tolerance of a range of hardwood conditions provides reason for optimism. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={Abundance, size, and spatial distribution of standing dead trees (snags), are key indicators of forest biodiversity and ecosystem health. These metrics represent critical habitat components for various wildlife species of conservation concern, including the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), which is strongly associated with recently burned conifer forest. We assessed the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) to detect and characterize conifer snags and identify Black-backed Woodpecker habitat using previously derived empirical thresholds of conifer snag basal area. Over the footprint of the Rim Fire, a megafire that extended (~104,000 ha) through a heterogeneous mosaic of conifer forests, oak woodlands, and meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, we identified conifer snags and estimated their basal area from single-tree ALS-derived metrics using Gaussian processes in four major steps. First, individual trees were mapped using the Watershed Segmentation algorithm, resulting in 87% detection of trees with stem diameter larger than 30cm. Second, the snag/live classification model identified snags with an overall accuracy of 91.8%, using the coefficient of variation of height and intensity together with maximum intensity and fractional cover as the most relevant metrics. Third, the conifer/hardwood snag classification model utilizing the maximum height, median height, minimum intensity, and area metrics separated snag forest types with an overall accuracy of 84.8%. Finally, a Gaussian process regression model reliably estimated conifer snag stem diameter (R2 = 0.81) using height and crown area, thus significantly outperforming regionally calibrated conifer-specific allometric equations. As a result, ~80% of the snag basal area have been mapped. Optimal and potential habitat for Black-backed Woodpecker comprise 53.7 km2 and 58.4 km2, respectively, representing 5.1 and 5.6% of the footprint of the Rim Fire. Our study illustrates the utility of high-density ALS data for characterizing recently burned forests, which, in conjunction with information about the habitat needs of particular snag-dependent wildlife species, can be used to assess habitat characteristics, and thus contribute greatly to forest management and biodiversity conservation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Context: An increasing number of studies have investigated the impact of environmental heterogeneity on faunal assemblages when measured at multiple spatial scales. Few studies, however, have considered how the effects of heterogeneity on fauna vary with the spatial scale at which the response variable is characterised. Objectives: We investigated the relationship between landscape properties in a region characterised by diverse fire mosaics, and the structure and composition of avian assemblages measured at both the site- (1 ha) and landscape-scale (100 ha). Methods: We surveyed birds and calculated spatial landscape properties in sub-tropical woodlands of central Queensland, Australia. Results: Environmental heterogeneity, as measured by topographic complexity, was consistently important for bird species richness and composition. However, the explanatory power of topographic complexity varied depending on the spatial scale and the component of diversity under investigation. We found different correlates of richness within particular foraging guilds depending on the scale at which richness was measured. Extent of long-unburnt habitat (>10 years since fire) was the most important variable for the landscape-scale richness of frugivores, insectivores and canopy feeders, whereas environmental heterogeneity in the surrounding landscape was more important for site-scale richness of these foraging guilds. Conclusions: The response of species richness to landscape characteristics varies among scales, and among components of diversity. Thus, depending on the scale at which a biodiversity conservation goal is conceptualised—maximising richness at a site, or across a landscape—different landscape management approaches may be preferred. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The South African Fynbos biome, a global biodiversity hotspot with high endemism and species richness, has six endemic bird species. These are important not only intrinsically, but also for ecological functioning and as flagships for South Africa's economically valuable avitourism sector. Little is known about population sizes or realised distribution ranges of these six species, but projected range modelling based on occurrence from the South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP) has suggested these species are vulnerable to climate change. We estimate global population sizes for these six endemics based on densities calculated from two intensive biome-wide point count surveys in 2012. We modelled regions of suitable climatic space, from which we established that mean annual temperature and the temperature of the warmest quarter of the year appear to limit Cape Rock-jumper Chaetops frenatus and Protea Canary Serinus leucopterus ranges. Both species have seen an apparent > 30% decrease in range and reporting rates (a proxy for abundance) in the twenty years between SABAP atlas periods (1987-1991 and 2007-ongoing). The Cape Rock-jumper result is unexpected: encounter rates are higher in shorter vegetation, dry slopes and habitats with more recent occurrence of fire-all proxies for proximate causes of climate change on the Fynbos. Although coastal plains are highly transformed, mountain Fynbos is the best protected of all the world's Mediterranean-climate habitats, with relatively little anthropogenic land transformation. Long term weather datasets from the Fynbos demonstrate significant warming since 1960. We conclude from these lines of evidence that these decreases are consistent with the loss of suitable climate space and inability of these species to adjust physiologically to increasing temperatures. © 2015 BirdLife International.},

abstract={Effective ecological restoration actions should be able to recover ecosystem processes that influence community development in the long term. However, there is scarce information on how landscape factors promote or accelerate fauna recovery. We used a landscape framework to evaluate how functional groups respond to natural regeneration in a highly fragmented region of Atlantic Forest. Using bird functional groups sampled in 15 regenerating forest fragments, we built and ranked models using a model selection approach to test the relative effect of landscape variables on each group. Our results showed that bird community recovery is not determined by the duration of the regeneration process (i.e. forest age), but by how the species responds to the landscape context. Functional diversity and the abundance of the functional groups were mainly related to composition metrics, whereas the functional metric affected only specific groups. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the landscape level to ensure both the colonization of fauna and the restoration of ecological functions. © 2016 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={Fire suppression in southern Appalachian pine-oak forests during the past century dramatically altered the bird community. Fire return intervals decreased, resulting in local extirpation or population declines of many bird species adapted to post-fire plant communities. Within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, declines have been strongest for birds inhabiting xeric pine-oak forests that depend on frequent fire. The buildup of fuels after decades of fire suppression led to changes in the 1996 Great Smoky Mountains Fire Management Plan. Although fire return intervals remain well below historic levels, management changes have helped increase the amount of fire within the park over the past 20 years, providing an opportunity to study patterns of fire severity, time since burn, and bird occurrence. We combined avian point counts in burned and unburned areas with remote sensing indices of fire severity to infer temporal changes in bird occurrence for up to 28 years following fire. Using hierarchical linear models that account for the possibility of a species presence at a site when no individuals are detected, we developed occurrence models for 24 species: 13 occurred more frequently in burned areas, 2 occurred less frequently, and 9 showed no significant difference between burned and unburned areas. Within burned areas, the top models for each species included fire severity, time since burn, or both, suggesting that fire influenced patterns of species occurrence for all 24 species. Our findings suggest that no single fire management strategy will suit all species. To capture peak occupancy for the entire bird community within xeric pine-oak forests, at least 3 fire regimes may be necessary; one applying frequent low severity fire, another using infrequent low severity fire, and a third using infrequently applied high severity fire. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Unpaved, low traffic roads are often assumed to have minimal effects on biodiversity. To explore this assertion, we sampled the bird communities in fifteen randomly selected sites in Pafos Forest, Cyprus and used multiple regression to quantify the effects of such roads on the total species richness. Moreover, we classified birds according to their migratory status and their global population trends, and tested each category separately. Besides the total length of unpaved roads, we also tested: a. the site's habitat diversity, b. the coefficient of variation in habitat (patch) size, c. the distance to the nearest agricultural field, and d. the human population size of the nearest village. We measured our variables at six different distances from the bird point-count locations. We found a strong negative relationship between the total bird richness and the total length of unpaved roads. The human population size of the nearest village also had a negative effect. Habitat diversity was positively related to species richness. When the categories were tested, we found that the passage migrants were influenced more by the road network while resident breeders were influenced by habitat diversity. Species with increasing and stable populations were only marginally affected by the variables tested, but the effect of road networks on species with decreasing populations was large. We conclude that unpaved and sporadically used roads can have detrimental effects on the bird communities, especially on vulnerable species. We propose that actions are taken to limit the extent of road networks within protected areas, especially in sites designated for their rich avifauna, such as Pafos Forest, where several of the affected species are species of European and global importance. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

We identified twenty-six bird species as potential regular predators of twenty major pests by reviewing the diet of breeding, wintering and resident species in this ecosystem. Foraging guilds are strongly associated with predation at distinct stages of the pests’ life-cycle: ground-foragers prey on overwintering pupae and larvae of seed-borers, tree-foragers prey on eggs, larvae and pupae of defoliating and wood-boring pests, and aerial-sweepers prey on airborne imagines. Bird predation can cover the complete life-cycle of pest species because different species may be complementary due to a dissimilar exploitation of foraging niches and periods. Small generalist tree-foraging passerines are important pest predators given their high densities and widespread distribution in Mediterranean oak woodlands, but management practices can have a significant negative effect in their populations. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Assessments of species vulnerability to climate change should increase the effectiveness of interventions in the current decline in biodiversity. Species vulnerability to climate change is a consequence of their sensitivity and adaptive capacity, in combination with their exposure to climate change. We apply a vulnerability assessment framework to 243 bird species inhabiting the tropical savannas of northern Australia. We build on previous vulnerability studies by including detailed data for variables relating to species sensitivity to change (relative abundance, clutch size, sensitivity to fire and distribution area), species adaptive capacity (movement behaviour and dietary breadth) and proportional changes predicted for their geographic range (i.e. exposure to climate change). These are integrated to provide a ranking of vulnerability. Our analysis found that birds of Australian tropical savannas cluster together with high sensitivity, with a few wide-ranging increasing species with very low sensitivity. Australian tropical savanna birds have a range of adaptive capacities, and the impact of climate change on these species is predicted to be substantial. Two already endangered species are among the most vulnerable. Species largely restricted to Cape York Peninsula (a geographically distinct region) had the greatest overall vulnerability; these species were, in general, sensitive due to small distributions, sensitivity to fire frequency and had a lower capacity for dispersal. It will be important for the future of Australian tropical savanna birds to mitigate ecological threats and maintain extensive areas of suitable habitat to facilitate species dispersal. © 2016 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract={Capsule At two demonstration farms, Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust's Loddington Farm in Leicestershire and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds's Hope Farm in Cambridgeshire, targeted management led to much faster increases in avian abundance than in the surrounding regions.Aims To compare changes in avian abundance at Loddington Farm since 1992 and Hope Farm since 2000, and relate these to regional trends in bird abundance and to the habitat and predator management conducted at the two sites.Methods Loddington Farm is a mixed arable 292-ha farm in a partially wooded landscape in Leicestershire. It was managed as a shoot from 1993 to 2002, combining habitat management with predator control (stopped in 2002) and winter grain provision (ceased in 2006). Hope Farm comprises a 181-ha mainly arable farm in an open landscape in Cambridgeshire, where habitat management for farmland birds has taken place since 2002. At both sites, breeding bird abundance has been monitored annually. Information on farm management was translated into three variables measuring annual provision of nesting cover, summer food and winter food. The number of Carrion Crow and Magpie territories was used as an index of predator abundance.Results Avian abundance increased at both farms much faster than within their respective regions. Recovery of priority species was positively correlated with the provision of summer foraging habitats and negatively correlated with the provision of supplementary grain during winter. The latter finding was counterintuitive and may reflect an increase in hedgerow provision that coincided with the cessation of grain provision at both farms. The increase in bird abundance was not sustained at Loddington Farm in the absence of predator control, although it was at Hope Farm where predator densities were markedly lower.Conclusion The data from Hope Farm suggest that where predator densities are relatively low (&lt;3 Crow + Magpie pairs/km2 locally, &lt;0.2 Foxes/km2 in spring regionally), recovery of farmland birds can be achieved through habitat management alone. Where predator densities are high (&gt;5 corvid pairs/km2 and &gt;1.1 foxes/km2), as at Loddington Farm, species recovery, particularly of open-cup nesting species, may require predator control as well as habitat management. Further study is needed to confirm this tentative conclusion from only two sites. © 2015 British Trust for Ornithology.},

The more common forest bird species appeared well adapted to fire regime variation in the 1980s. Tree canopy height was a far greater influence, with more species and more birds in taller forests (interpreted as a result of higher soil fertility leading to higher productivity of bird foods and greater structural complexity in taller forests). Other trends were fewer birds where there was a rainforest understorey under the eucalypts (reflecting the general scarcity of rainforest birds in the Blue Mountains), and more birds where nectar-rich flowers were more abundant (reflecting the abundance of nectarivorous birds in the Blue Mountains, especially over winter). The climate has changed since the 1980s and fires threaten to become much more severe, extensive and frequent.

abstract={Degradation of ecosystems and introductions of invasive species pose a threat to global biodiversity. Ecosystem restoration and revegetation actions are important for amending habitat loss and for the protection of species of plants and animals. Iceland has the highest rate of soil erosion and desertification in Northern Europe and counteractions to erosion and revegetation measures have taken place for over a century. We studied the effect of revegetation on the density and composition of birds and invertebrate abundance in 26 survey areas comparing: a) unvegetated eroded areas, b) native heathlands restored on eroded land, and c) revegetation by the introduced and exotic Nootka lupin (Lupinus nootkatensis) on eroded land. Birds were counted on transects and invertebrates sampled with a sweep net. Both revegetation methods greatly increased the abundance of birds. The highest total numbers of invertebrates and birds were recorded on land revegetated with Nootka lupin. On average 31 birds km-2 were recorded on barren land, 337 on heathland and 627 in Nootka lupin. Bird species composition differed between the two revegetation methods. Restored heathland provided habitat for waders of internationally decreasing populations, whereas Nootka lupin stands harboured more common bird species. Golden Plover (Pluvialis apricaria) and Dunlin (Calidris alpina) were most common on restored heathland, while Snipe (Gallinago gallinago) and Meadow Pipit (Anthus pratensis) were most common in Nootka lupine. The abundance of birds was positively correlated with that of invertebrates. The abundance of different bird species differed by successional stage in each habitat. The study showed the generally positive effects of revegetation on animal biodiversity and also how different revegetation methods produce different trajectories of ecosystem development.},

abstract={Applied nucleation is a restoration technique that seeks to facilitate woody-plant establishment by attracting birds or other animals that may introduce seeds of dispersal-limited species. In 1991, an experimental test of applied nucleation was initiated in an abandoned landfi ll in New Jersey, USA. Trees and shrubs were planted into 16 10 × 10 m plots, covering <3% of the 6-ha site. In 2010-2011, we sampled the plant community to test the impact of the treatments on forest cover and plant biodiversity. Site-wide forest cover increased substantially in the 19 years since planting from none to 59%. The original planted plots had signifi cantly higher stem density, particularly of bird-dispersed species, than unplanted areas. Species composition outside the planted plots was dominated by the wind-dispersed Fraxinus americana and several small-seeded birddispersed species, but there were few species indicative of later successional stages. The expected model of successional development via the nucleation model that rates of colonization would be highest near plantings and that forest cover would spread outward from established clusters was not supported after this time span. Given the site ' s isolation from potential sources of woody propagules, the experimental treatments may not have been enough to overcome many species' dispersal limitation. Regardless of the mechanism, however, the treatments transformed the once essentially treeless site into a densely wooded habitat, and did so at a rate faster than other descriptions of reforestation following disturbances or land-use changes in the region. Despite the relatively low species richness of the community, this experiment demonstrated that reforestation of even severely degraded habitat can be achieved with minimal management after site preparation and cluster plantings. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={The spatial extent of plantation forests continued to increase after the Grain for Green Project (GGP) started in January 2002 in China, with more than 20 thousand km 2 forests developed from 1999 to 2008 throughout the entire country. From 2012 to 2014, the purpose of Beijing’s plain reforestation project was to increase the spatial extent of the forest area in the administrative sub-units that make up the city of Beijing with a plains habitat. In the GGP, one third of the farmland in this region has been replanted with trees to increase the extent of the green area and improve the environment. However, considerable controversy remains related to whether afforestation can effectively result in the conservation of biological diversity. The objective of this study is to explore the effects of afforestation on the ground-dwelling spider community and evaluate the effects of the GGP on the ecosystem and biodiversity during afforestation. From March to September 2014 and 2015, pitfall traps were used to collect ground-dwelling spiders every 10 days in habitats that had been returned to forests from farmland for 2 and 3 years, respectively, in Shunyi District, Beijing. Ground-dwelling spider communities were compared between two adjacent habitats, a former non-crop habitat and an afforested habitat. A total of 18 pitfall traps were placed in the same randomly selected pattern in both habitats. During the investigations, we collected a total of 1465 individuals from eight families, 18 genera and 32 species in 2014, and a total of 2186 individuals from 10 families, 25 genera and 45 species in 2015. Afforestation within the study sites had a positive effect on ground-dwelling spider diversity over the first 3 years. The species of ground-dwelling spiders present changed with afforestation; total species richness increased and some of the farmland spiders were not found in afforested habitats. In 2014, species richness and a diversity index of ground-dwelling spiders in former non-crop habitats were significantly higher than in afforested habitats (P &lt; 0.01). In 2015, the diversity index in former non-crop habitats was still significantly higher than in afforested habitats (P &lt; 0.01), while species richness in former non-crop habitats was significantly higher than in afforested habitats (P &lt; 0.05). An evenness index in the two habitats was not significantly different in both 2014 and 2015. In the second year after afforestation, the peak of the ground-dwelling spider activity density in former non-crop habitats occurred in mid-June, which was 1 month earlier than that in the afforested habitat. In the third year after afforestation, the ground-dwelling spider activity density exhibited similar trends in both habitats; that is, in both habitats the peak of activity density occurred at the same time in early July. The results show that in the first years of habitat alteration, the ground-dwelling spider community in the afforested habitat was still in a stage of community reconstruction, and the community’s stability increased year by year. Returning farmland to forests influenced the original farmland ecosystem through changes in the vegetation type, structure and management practices. As the forests mature, additional effects on spider species at the site are expected because of changes in light conditions, microclimate, vegetation and so on. Therefore, the effects of returning farmland to forests on the ground-dwelling spider community will need further study over time. The aim of this study is to determine whether afforestation contributed to enhancing biodiversity and conservation. Studying the process of change in biological communities after habitat alteration is of great theoretical significance. © 2016, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Forest degradation, forest fires, and wildlife poaching have devastated biodiversity in Indonesia. To assess the impact of forest degradation and the potential for recovery, we used birds as a proxy for biodiversity and assessed density estimates (hereafter density) in the degraded lowland forest of Harapan Rainforest Ecosystem Restoration Concession (HRF) in Sumatra. In this study, a total of 149 bird species (from 5,317 individuals) were recorded. Of the 103 species for which densities could be calculated, 45% were lowland bird specialists (i.e. species occurring below 200 m above sea level in Sumatra), including three globally threatened and 41 Near-Threatened species. Comparison with bird densities in degraded forest of Borneo revealed that there was broad similarity across taxa but three species had significantly higher density, and four had significantly lower density, in HRF. The mosaic of degraded forest habitats in different stages of regeneration in HRF appears to support more individuals of some species, especially woodpeckers, than the Bornean sites, but fewer individuals of other species. Determining bird densities is essential to establish population baselines, allowing comparisons between sites and over time. The present study fills one gap, but we urge others to conduct similar studies to provide a better understanding of the temporal and spatial variation in bird density in Southeast Asia's degraded forests.},

abstract={More than 40 % of the world’s 4 billion hectares forests are located in tropical regions and cover 1.73 billion hectares which corresponds to nearly half of the tropical land area. Deforestation - mainly the conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land - shows signs of decreasing in several countries but continues at a high rate in others. Around 8 million hectares of tropical forest were converted to other uses or lost through natural causes each year in the last decade compared to more than 10 million hectares per year in the 1990s. Fifteen tropical countries loose more than 1 % of their forests per year, in five countries forest area is stable, and in nine countries forest area is slightly increasing by a total of 0.3 million hectares per year. Half of the world’s growing stock is located in tropical forests. In terms of carbon content, they have a share of about 60 %. On average, tropical forests in Africa and Latin America/Caribbean store 100 t carbon per ha, in Asia/Pacific 75 t carbon per ha. Primary forest, i.e., forest of native species where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes have not been significantly disturbed, includes the most species-rich, diverse terrestrial ecosystems. In Africa and Asia/Pacific, the share of primary forests on total tropical forest area is 42 %, while in Latin America/Caribbean still 74 % are primary. Overall, the area of primary forests is decreasing in all tropical regions with about 3.7 million hectares per year, but the situation seems to be improving especially in Asia/Pacific, while the rates of conversion show an increasing trend in Latin America/Caribbean. About 15 % of tropical forests are designated as primary function for the conservation of biodiversity. National parks, game reserves, wilderness areas, and other legally established protected areas also cover about 15 % of the total tropical forest area. The primary function of these forests may be the conservation of biological diversity, the protection of soil and water resources, or the conservation of cultural heritage. Half of all tropical countries declare forest fires as severe problem. Severe storms, flooding, and earthquakes have also damaged areas of forests. Nearly all countries in the tropics face at least forest degradation as result of the impact of human interventions in production forests, protected areas and parks. In many tropical countries, the climate appears to be changing. Recent data provide evidence of, for example, increasing temperatures and prolonged dry periods in some regions and increased rainfall and more frequent tropical storms in others. Half of the tropical forest is designated as permanent forest estate (PFE). Again half of these, about 400 million hectares, serve production purposes. Due to accessibility problems, only parts of the production forests are available for harvest. About 3 % of the permanent forest estate is planted forest. Reported wood removals amount to 1.3 billion cubic meters annually and equivalent to 0.5 % of the total growing stock. By far the most important product is fuelwood, although the statistics on this product are neither complete nor precise. Only few tropical countries are able to report on amount and value of non-timber forest products. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.},

abstract={The effects of stand structure, tree species composition, proportion of habitat types and land use history on breeding bird assemblages in temperate mixed forests in Western Hungary were studied. The species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole breeding bird assemblage and of some groups formed on the basis of nesting site and rarity were examined. Stand structural variables had the highest impact on the breeding bird assemblage, while tree species composition, the varying proportion of vegetation types and land use history had no significant effect. In the case of the species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole assemblage, the most important variables were the mean diameter of trees, the vegetation cover of the forest floor and the dead wood volume. The explained variance in the linear models of different groups varied between 20% and 60%, and the relative importance of these three variables also differed considerably. These results indicate that forest management may considerably influence the diversity and the composition of birds, as all the structural elements affecting birds deeply depend on it. Within the shelterwood management system, the elongation of the rotation and regeneration periods, and the relatively high proportion of retention tree groups after harvest could contribute to the conservation of forest birds. Our results also showed that for the forest bird communities, both the prevalence of big trees and the presence of a dense understory layer are important. Management regimes which apply continuous forest cover might be more appropriate for providing these structural elements simultaneously on small spatial scales, and for the maintenance of a more diverse bird community, thus healthier forest ecosystems. © 2015 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.},

abstract={The Atlantic Forest is one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world due to habitat fragmentation. Restoration and connectivity of forest fragments are crucial to maintain viable populations of forest-dependent species. During winter and summer, we studied the bird diversity, its components and composition (including specialist and generalist species) in three different vegetation types: mature forest (MF), secondary forest (SF) and grassland (G) of an ecological corridor in Misiones, Argentina. We determined the influence of alpha diversity (of each habitat) and beta diversity (species turnover between habitats) on gamma diversity (regional diversity in the corridor), to provide conservation management recommendations. MF showed the highest values of bird diversity, richness, evenness and abundance, followed by SF and G, in both seasons. Only MF showed a possible seasonal variation in diversity and richness. The species composition of SF was similar to MF. However, G, where pasture specialist and edge species were the most common species recorded (70% of its avifauna), had very low similarity to MF, where the most forest specialist species were found (53%). As alpha diversities were higher than beta values, the bird diversity in the studied corridor mainly resulted from the diversity in each vegetation type, in both studied seasons. We therefore recommend preservation of both MF and recovering SF due to their high bird diversity and the presence of forest-dependent, threatened and endemic bird species. We also urge the creation of ecological corridors between protected forest remnants of the Atlantic Forest. © Flavia Romina Barzan.},

abstract={Woodlands comprised of planted, nonnative trees are increasing in extent globally, while native woodlands continue to decline due to human activities. The ecological impacts of planted woodlands may include changes to the communities of understory plants and animals found among these nonnative trees relative to native woodlands, as well as invasion of adjacent habitat areas through spread beyond the originally planted areas. Eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp.) are among the most widely planted trees worldwide, and are very common in California, USA. The goals of our investigation were to compare the biological communities of nonnative eucalypt woodlands to native oak woodlands in coastal central California, and to examine whether planted eucalypt groves have increased in size over the past decades. We assessed site and habitat attributes and characterized biological communities using understory plant, ground-dwelling arthropod, amphibian, and bird communities as indicators. Degree of difference between native and nonnative woodlands depended on the indicator used. Eucalypts had significantly greater canopy height and cover, and significantly lower cover by perennial plants and species richness of arthropods than oaks. Community composition of arthropods also differed significantly between eucalypts and oaks. Eucalypts had marginally significantly deeper litter depth, lower abundance of native plants with ranges limited to western North America, and lower abundance of amphibians. In contrast to these differences, eucalypt and oak groves had very similar bird community composition, species richness, and abundance. We found no evidence of "invasional meltdown," documenting similar abundance and richness of nonnatives in eucalypt vs. oak woodlands. Our time-series analysis revealed that planted eucalypt groves increased 271% in size, on average, over six decades, invading adjacent areas. Our results inform science-based management of California woodlands, revealing that while bird communities would probably not be affected by restoration of eucalypt to oak woodlands, such a restoration project would not only stop the spread of eucalypts into adjacent habitats but would also enhance cover by western North American native plants and perennials, enhance amphibian abundance, and increase arthropod richness. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Monocultures of even-aged trees in short rotation are a forest system of low ecological complexity that has been described as unsuitable for the establishment of stable populations of forest birds. However, key habitat quality cues could make them attractive to forest specialists. This paper assesses the suitability of poplar plantations in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula for a forest specialist, the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor. Poplar stands occupy a small area of an agroforestry mosaic landscape where semi-natural Mediterranean woodland is predominant. Population size, nesting success, home ranges and habitat selection were studied by radio-tracking and monitoring during the breeding season and the winter. Poplar plantations were preferentially selected for breeding and foraging in the spring and the winter. Home ranges in the breeding season and the winter (32.4 and 438.5 ha, respectively) were similar to those observed in semi-natural woodlands that have been studied in Europe. However, population density (0.25 territories/100 ha) was lower than that described in most European semi-natural woodlands. Nesting success was low (0.54), due to strong competition with other cavity nesters, predation of nests by the Greater Spotted Woodpecker, and loss of one of the adults. Fifty per cent of the foraging activity during the breeding season took place in an area of 180 metres around the nest. The amount of standing dead wood in poplar stands was much higher than in the surrounding habitats and source areas. The moderate breeding success and the high rate of adult predation may suggest that poplar plantations act as an ecological trap, in which standing dead wood may be a habitat quality cue that attracts birds to this non-ideal habitat. Poplar plantations become even less suitable when most of the available habitat is felled at the same time. Suitable planning of poplar plantation rotations and recovery of riparian forest is the best way to ensure the survival of Lesser Spotted Woodpecker populations in the long term. © 2015, BioOne.

abstract={Umbrella species are often spatially demanding and have limited ability to adapt to environmental changes induced by human land-use. This makes them vulnerable to human encroachment. In Sweden, broadleaved trees are disadvantaged by forestry, and commercially managed forests are often deprived of dead wood. This has led to a situation where previously widespread top predators in saproxylic food webs, such as the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos), have become species of conservation concern. The white-backed woodpecker is generally considered an umbrella species, and it has been linked to forests with large volumes of dead wood from broadleaved trees. In recent years, forest stands have been restored for the white-backed woodpecker, but post-treatment evaluations have rarely included other species that also occur in broad-leaved forests (co-occurring species). Many co-occurring species are saproxylic beetles. In this study, we collected saproxylic beetles and environmental data in restored and commercially managed forests to evaluate if habitat restoration for the white-backed woodpecker also benefited other species with similar habitat associations. We found that volumes of coarse woody debris were higher in restored than in commercially managed forests, and that a majority of man-made snags and downed logs were created from birch trees (Betula spp.). Most spruce trees (Picea abies) were extracted during forest restoration, and this opened up the forest canopy, and created stands dominated by broadleaved trees.Many saproxylic beetles were more common in restored forests, and there were significant differences in species composition between treatments. These differences were largely explained by species traits. Effects of sunexposure were particularly important, but many beneficiary species were also linked to dead wood from broadleaved trees. Red-listed saproxylic beetles showed a similar pattern with more species and individuals in restored sites. The white-backed woodpecker is still critically endangered in Sweden, but important prey species are already responding to forest restoration at the stand level. We recognize that landscape-level improvements will be required to bring the white-backed woodpecker back, but also that the umbrella species concept can provide a useful framework for successful forest restoration as many co-occurring saproxylic beetle species seemingly benefitted from restoration for the white-backed woodpecker. © 2015 Bell et al.},

abstract={Large areas of montane forests are commercially harvested, while some other parts remain unmanaged. These conditions provide an opportunity to study the response of bird communities to forest management. Here we focused on the effects of tree species composition and tree age on bird species richness. We counted birds in two types of montane forest (beech and mixed) replicated in three age classes (managed 55-65 years, managed 85-95 years, unmanaged over 200 years) in the Vtáčnik Mountains, Slovakia. Number of bird species at individual study sites (local richness) was predicted solely by the tree age and not by the forest type. Specifically, the number of species was highest in the oldest stands, while the stands of 55-65 and 85-95 years did not differ from each other. By contrast, forest type seems important for total bird species richness (number of species recorded in all study sites of a given type) with more species recorded in mixed forests than in beech forests. The local richness seems thus limited by the amount resources available at a given site, which is highest in the oldest stands irrespective to forest type, probably due to largest amount of food, dead wood or tree cavities, being particularly suitable for habitat specialists. However, larger species pool in mixed forest, enriched by birds adapted to coniferous trees, increases the total number of species observed in this type. We thus recommend to shift the harvest to the highest possible age and to include some other tree species into parts of beech monocultures. © Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences 2015.},

abstract={Tropical forests are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities often resulting in habitat and biodiversity loss. To effectively manage and protect these areas, it is important to have an understanding of the factors affecting their biodiversity. Previous research has shown that birds in tropical regions are severely affected by human-induced habitat conversion and disturbance. The effects, however, are often area and guild-specific and the underlying mechanisms are frequently unclear. In this study, we disentangle and quantify the direct and indirect effects of human population density, distance to forest edge, habitat disturbance, and vegetation structure and composition on the total abundance and species richness of birds in Kakamega Forest, Kenya. Specifically, we use structural equation modeling to develop and test path models, which reflect the potential causal relationships between the bird assemblages and the chosen explanatory factors. Relationships were tested on the overall bird community and on five different guilds, classified according to birds’ forest specialization and feeding preferences (i.e. forest specialists, generalists and visitors, and frugivores and insectivores). Results showed that habitat disturbance, caused by logging, had a weak positive direct effect on the bird communities, but also had a strong detrimental indirect effect, particularly on the total abundance and species richness of forests specialists and insectivores. The negative effect was mediated through changes in the forest’s vegetation structure and composition. Shorter distances to the forest edge also had a negative effect, on all bird categories except on forest visitors, which also benefited from higher levels of disturbance. Our study shows that although in some cases habitat disturbance may have no strong direct negative effects it can still negatively influence bird communities in an indirect way. In the case of Kakamega Forest, we suggest that to conserve bird communities it is important to maintain the forest’s compositional and structural diversity by reducing human-induced habitat disturbance, such as illegal logging activities. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Woodland, like many habitats throughout the world, has been severely affected by habitat loss and fragmentation. Woodland restoration programmes aimed at reversing habitat loss have been in place in many countries over the last 100 years. In particular, agri-environment schemes (AES) to increase the amount and quality of woodland on agricultural land have operated in Europe and Australia for decades (nearly 30 years in the United Kingdom). However, to date there has been very little assessment of their value to biodiversity. We assessed the potential benefits to biodiversity of woodlands planted during 1988–1991 under a woodland grant scheme (WGS in Scotland), according to local and landscape-level habitat characteristics. Specifically, we (1) performed a linear discriminant analysis to compare the characteristics of 24 WGS sites to those of more mature semi-natural woodlands (34 sites >60 years old), and (2) used existing information on the influence of woodland characteristics on a biologically diverse group (i.e. moths) to quantify the benefits of WGS sites to biodiversity. The creation of new WGS patches increased woodland extent and connectivity in the landscape; however, planting that took place adjacent to previously existing woodland did not usually increase connectivity. WGS sites were mainly composed by broadleaved native tree species, but non-native species were also present. In general, WGS sites had lower tree species richness, proportion of native trees, tree basal area and amount of understory, and higher tree densities and canopy cover than more mature semi-natural woodlands. Overall, WGS sites were predicted to have lower moth abundance and species richness than older semi-natural woodlands. However, the magnitude of these differences depended on the habitat specificity and dispersal abilities of different moth groups, suggesting that WGS sites are better at providing suitable resources for generalist species and for species less limited by dispersal. Our findings have important implications for the way in which current woodland creation and management schemes operate in many countries and suggest that: (1) the creation of new woodlands should focus on planting native species, (2) woodland creation schemes are likely to be more beneficial for biodiversity if certain management practices (e.g. thinning to enhance structural diversity and accelerate the transition to later successional stages) accompany the provision of these grants, and (3) spatially-targeted woodland creation would further increase the contribution of AES woodlands to enhance biodiversity. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Body size is known to correlate with many aspects of life history in birds, and this knowledge can be used to manage and conserve bird species. However, few studies have compared the wintering ecology of sympatric subspecies that vary significantly in body size. We used radiotelemetry to examine the relationship between body size and site fidelity, movements, and home range in 2 subspecies of Sandhill Crane (Grus canadensis) wintering in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, USA. Both subspecies showed high interannual return rates to the Delta study area, but Greater Sandhill Cranes (G. c. tabida) showed stronger within-winter fidelity to landscapes in our study region and to roost complexes within landscapes than did Lesser Sandhill Cranes (G. c. canadensis). Foraging flights from roost sites were shorter for G. c. tabida than for G. c. canadensis (1.9 ± 0.01 km vs. 4.5 ± 0.01 km, respectively) and, consequently, the mean size of 95% fixed-kernel winter home ranges was an order of magnitude smaller for G. c. tabida than for G. c. canadensis (1.9 ± 0.4 km2 vs. 21.9 ± 1.9 km2, respectively). Strong site fidelity indicates that conservation planning to manage for adequate food resources around traditional roost sites can be effective for meeting the habitat needs of these cranes, but the scale of conservation efforts should differ by subspecies. Analysis of movement patterns suggests that conservation planners and managers should consider all habitats within 5 km of a known G. c. tabida roost and within 10 km of a G. c. canadensis roost when planning for habitat management, mitigation, acquisition, and easements. © 2015 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Land management decisions frequently involve choices that reflect tradeoffs among ecosystem services. These tradeoffs are not always apparent, and land managers unknowingly may make decisions that diminish the value of some services while enhancing the value of others. Offset policies, such as wetland mitigation in the United States, rely on the assumption that ecosystems can be restored to provide a full suite of services. Wetlands provide many ecosystem services such as water quality maintenance, carbon storage, flood abatement, and biodiversity support. Our objectives were to describe tradeoffs among ecosystem services in mitigation wetlands and identify abiotic and biotic drivers underlying these tradeoffs. We measured denitrification potential, organic matter decomposition, herbaceous biomass, and soil organic content as indicators of nutrient storage and removal services in 30 mitigation wetlands in Illinois, USA. Additionally, we estimated surface-water storage potential, and, since wetlands provide valuable biodiversity support, we determined the species composition of plant, anuran, and avian communities. We found a positive relationship among biodiversity indicators for different taxa. Denitrification potential and surface-water storage potential were positively correlated. However, there was a tradeoff between biodiversity support and nutrient cycling processes; soil organic matter, biomass, decomposition rates, and potential denitrification were greater at less biodiverse sites. Our findings indicate that optimizing restored wetlands for nutrient storage and removal may come at the expense of biodiversity. It is unrealistic to expect all services to be maximized at a restoration site. Therefore, restoration practitioners should prioritize services based on needs and opportunities given local and watershed contexts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Sable antelope, Hippotragus niger, populations have declined substantially in Kruger National Park, South Africa despite large-area protection from land use and poaching. Since Africa's large mammal populations are restricted to protected areas, understanding how to manage parks for biological diversity is critically important to the sustainability of faunal populations into the future. To better understand the drivers of sable decline, we analyzed landscapes where herds persist in the Pretoriuskop region of Kruger - identified by GPS collar telemetry data from eight individuals in five herds remaining in this area, and compared them to landscapes where sable herds have recently disappeared. We mapped these landscapes with satellite-based spectral data on vegetation greenness and fire frequency and Carnegie Airborne Observatory LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data on 3-D vegetation structure. Within their home ranges, sable herds consistently selected areas with high fire frequency, high tree cover and low shrub cover. However, there were no consistent differences in habitat features between the home ranges of current sable herds and areas formerly supporting herds. Locally deteriorating habitat conditions were therefore not responsible for the decline in sables in this region of the park. Our study also illustrates how multi-sensor, 3-D mapping of ecosystems provides a means to assess causes and consequences of changing animal habitats over time. © 2015 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={Most remaining grasslands are used for livestock grazing; stocking rates could be managed to help stop declining songbird populations. We examined the effects of stocking rates on grassland songbirds in northern mixed-grass prairies using a beyond-Before-After-Control-Impact manipulative experiment in Canada's Grasslands National Park and adjacent community pastures. The study area consisted of nine 300-ha pastures grazed at a range of stocking rates starting in 2008. We conducted songbird surveys at six upland plots in each pasture from 2006-2010 and measured vegetation structure within each plot from 2008-2010 (n = 54). We evaluated the effects of stocking rates on habitat structure and songbird abundance using linear and generalized linear mixed models. Baird's sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) relative abundance declined with increasing stocking rates. Chestnut-collared longspur (Calcarius ornatus) relative abundance increased only at higher stocking rates, indicating a possible threshold effect. Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) relative abundance decreased with stocking rates above 0.4 AUM after a year of grazing. Sprague's pipit (Anthus spragueii) relative abundance declined with grazing, but the effect was weak and only significant in 1 year. Western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) abundance was unaffected by grazing. Stocking rates may be used to benefit grassland songbirds and may alter avian communities after as little as 1 month of livestock grazing. Applying a range of stocking rates regionally may provide habitat for many species. © 2015 Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Land management intrinsically influences the distribution of animals and can consequently alter the potential for density-dependent processes to act within populations. For declining species, high densities of breeding territories are typically considered to represent productive populations. However, as density-dependent effects of food limitation or predator pressure may occur (especially when species are dependent upon separate nesting and foraging habitats), high territory density may limit per-capita productivity. Here, we use a declining but widespread European farmland bird, the yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella L., as a model system to test whether higher territory densities result in lower fledging success, parental provisioning rates or nestling growth rates compared to lower densities. Organic landscapes held higher territory densities, but nests on organic farms fledged fewer nestlings, translating to a 5 times higher rate of population shrinkage on organic farms compared to conventional. In addition, when parental provisioning behaviour was not restricted by predation risk (i.e., at times of low corvid activity), nestling provisioning rates were higher at lower territory densities, resulting in a much greater increase in nestling mass in low density areas, suggesting that food limitation occurred at high densities. These findings in turn suggest an ecological trap, whereby preferred nesting habitat does not provide sufficient food for rearing nestlings at high population density, creating a population sink. Habitat management for farmland birds should focus not simply on creating a high nesting density, but also on ensuring heterogeneous habitats to provide food resources in close proximity to nesting birds, even if this occurs through potentially restricting overall nest density but increasing population-level breeding success. © 2015 Dunn et al.

abstract={The Hyrcanian forests of northern Iran support a great diversity of bird species. Yet, the ecological relationships of cavity-nesting birds (CNBs), the main components of forest bird communities in this area, remain unknown. We examined the importance of ecological factors in 90 study plots during the breeding season to predict the probability distribution and habitat suitability of primary cavity nesters (PCNs), secondary cavity nesters (SCNs) and weak primary cavity nesters (WPCNs). Ecological factors included forest structure, habitat complexity, geographical attributes and dead tree features. The significant habitat parameters determining the presence-absence of each CNB species were also determined. PCN richness and abundance were most influenced by the density of larger trees, snags (standing dead trees) and logs (fallen dead trees). The densities of snags, logs and larger trees and the extent of the shrub layer influenced distributions of SCNs. The Eurasian nuthatch (Sitta europaea) was the only WPCN identified, and its distribution was strongly affected by altitude and by larger snags and trees in complex habitats. Our results showed that CNB species could be classified in three groups: (1) species dependent on mature forests, (2) species dependent on younger forests and (3) species adaptable to different forest stages. Overall, snags and logs played vital roles in the habitat preferences of CNB communities as well as in forest structure and complexity. © 2015, The Ecological Society of Japan.},

abstract={As urbanization accelerates, urban biodiversity conservation is becoming a great concern for the maintenance of urban ecosystem functions. In particular, forest bird communities in urban areas have been recognized as a conservation target because of their functions in food webs and ecosystem services. But our understanding of which local- and landscape-scale factors influence native bird communities within urban green spaces is still insufficient to provide managers with information for effectively planning biodiversity management programs. Here we examine how local habitat characteristics, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity influence the diversity of forest bird communities in 44 small forest patches (0.5–20.0 ha) embedded in an urbanized landscape. Patch size exerted a positive influence on the diversity of most bird functional groups, and it had the greatest effects on total abundance and species richness. The second most important factor was human disturbance. Remnant patches with lower levels of human disturbance had higher diversity than newly established patches where intense human activities occurred more frequently. In addition, vegetation complexity and habitat connectivity were positively related to total species richness and abundance, respectively, but they were less important. Management strategies for the conservation of urban forest birds, therefore, should consider not only local improvements in habitat structure – through increased patch size, reduced human disturbance, and increased vegetation complexity – but also the maintenance of habitat connectivity. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={In order to understand the avian community and provide data for airport managers to avoid bird strike accidents, a bird survey was conducted using three transects and seven sampling points within a radius of 7 km at Shenyang Taoxian International Airport during September 2012 and August 2013. In total, 35 species of birds, belonging to 10 orders and 21 families, were recorded in five habitats including residential area, farming land, mountain, forest, and river. The Shannon diversity index, distribution coefficient and importance value of different avian species in the five habitats were calculated. Furthermore, the bird strike risk index for each bird species was calculated by multiplying the importance value and risk index. Accordingly, four risk levels were clarified as severe, heavy, moderate and low. Severe risk species included Passer montanus, Ardea cinerea, Pica pica, Falco tinnunculus. Heavy risk species included Hirundo rustica, Nyc-ticorax nycticorax, Parus major, Columba livia. 16 species (such as Circus cyaneus, Anas platy-rhynchos, Dendrocopos major, Cyanopica cyana) were included in the moderate risk group, and 10 species (such as Turdus chrysolaus, Gallinago megala, Coturnix coturnix, Coccothraustes coc-cothraustes) in the low risk group. This study provided strategies and suggestions for bird strike avoidance in the airport area. © 2015, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Two fundamental questions for wetland restoration science are: how do early management practices affect long term plant species diversity, and how does diversity affect ecological function? Here, we report on a nine year study conducted in six replicate experimental wetland ecosystems designed to shed light on the impact of different planting treatments and nutrient enrichment on plant species diversity and on a variety of indicators of structure and function. Pairs of high- and low-intensity planting treatments were initiated with native seeds and vegetative propagules. In the high-intensity treatment, vegetative propagules that did not establish were replanted in years three and four. An unplanted treatment was seeded through natural recruitment alone. Annual inventories of the presence and percent cover of plant species were used to derive measures of native Shannon-Weaver diversity and the floristic quality assessment index (FQAI). We found that higher plant species diversity was achieved early and was sustained in planted versus unplanted wetlands. However, no differences were evident between high- and low-intensity planting treatments. Although the prevalence of dominant species shifted over time, overall measures of plant diversity did not change between early and later succession in either planted or unplanted treatments. We found no relationships between plant diversity and a variety of direct and indirect measures of ecosystem structure and function, including aquatic community metabolism, aboveground productivity, soil organic matter accumulation and nutrient concentration. Fertilizer was applied in years eight and nine to simulate nutrient loading from agricultural runoff. Plant species diversity had no detectable effects on nutrient uptake rates in response to fertilization. Conversely, fertilization did not measurably alter species diversity in the two years following addition. We conclude that early management efforts were important in achieving a sustained and resilient enhancement in plant species diversity, but that elevated biodiversity resulting from planting did not measurably alter function. We speculate that control of invasive species in all treatment groups during early years of management resulted in high species diversity levels in unplanted as well as planted groups and that species diversity levels in all wetlands were therefore well above levels at which effects of plant species diversity on ecosystem function saturate. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={We combined data from the Atlantic Flyway Breeding Waterfowl Survey (AFBWS) and the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to estimate the number of wood ducks (Aix sponsa) in the United States portion of the Atlantic Flyway from 1993 to 2013. The AFBWS is a plot-based survey that covers most of the northern and central portions of the Flyway; when analyzed with adjustments for survey time of day effects, these data can be used to estimate population size. The BBS provides an index of wood duck abundance along roadside routes. Although factors influencing change in BBS counts over time can be controlled in BBS analysis, BBS indices alone cannot be used to derive population size estimates. We used AFBWS data to scale BBS indices for Bird Conservation Regions (BCR), basing the scaling factors on the ratio of estimated AFBWS population sizes to regional BBS indices for portions of BCRs that were common to both surveys. We summed scaled BBS results for portions of the Flyway not covered by the AFBWS with AFBWS population estimates to estimate a mean yearly total of 1,295,875 (mean 95% CI: 1,013,940-1,727,922) wood ducks. Scaling factors varied among BCRs from 16.7 to 148.0; the mean scaling factor was 68.9 (mean 95% CI: 53.5-90.9). Flyway-wide, population estimates from the combined analysis were consistent with alternative estimates derived from harvest data, and also provide population estimates within states and BCRs. We recommend their use in harvest and habitat management within the Atlantic Flyway. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. © Published 2015.

abstract={Islands are often acknowledged as a refuge for species with declining mainland distributions. However, as the finite size of islands coupled with isolation can lead to genetic deterioration within insular populations, the study of these systems is of great interest to the conservation of biological diversity and persistence. The remote Kimberley region in Western Australia is facing increased impacts from invasive species, habitat fragmentation, grazing, mining and altered fire regimes, and many of the 2633 islands in the Kimberley have come into focus as a significant conservation resource. The Bar-shouldered skink (Ctenotus inornatus) is a habitat generalist that is highly abundant throughout the Kimberley and its diverse islands. This study encompasses 41 islands and seven mainland populations in the vast Kimberley environment, and genetically characterises them using 18 nuclear (microsatellite) markers. The island populations lost heterozygosity at a rate of 1 % per kilometre from the mainland. Diversity was significantly lower on islands of small size (<500 ha) and greater than 2 km from the coastline. The scope of this study is unparalleled and addresses an important gap in our understanding of the genetic diversity throughout ecosystems. The findings illustrate how populations, operating within these pristine island systems, conform to the general rule of decreased genetic diversity with decreasing island area and increased distance from the mainland and identifies islands that may hold the most potential for conserving biodiversity. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={High severity forest fires are increasing in large areas of the southern and western United States as the climate becomes warmer and drier. Given their strong roles in ecosystem dynamics, documenting the response of bird communities to wildfires is important for improving our understanding and management of post-wildfire ecosystems. However, because wildfires are unplanned events, relatively few studies have been conducted to assess local-scale impacts on forest bird communities. In this study, we had the opportunity to use a before-after, control-impact (BACI) approach to assess the response of resident birds to high severity wildfires that occurred in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas in September and October 2011. We replicated a previous study using point count surveys to assess summer and winter bird community changes ca. 1. year after the wildfires. We found that total number of detected individuals did not change following the wildfires, but winter bird species richness increased in burned habitat. Changes were apparent at the foraging guild-level for the winter bird community, with an increase in aerial insectivores and decrease in bark insectivores. Summer and winter bird community composition changes were apparent at the species-level and generally agreed with species-specific habitat preferences. For example, species such as eastern bluebirds and chipping sparrows that prefer open woodlands were positively associated with burned habitat. Our results provide quantitative evidence that high severity forest fires increased habitat suitability for many resident bird species. At the landscape-scale, fire-induced increases in habitat heterogeneity could result in higher bird diversity in the Lost Pines ecoregion. We expect bird community composition will be dynamic in the Lost Pines ecoregion over the next few decades as the burned habitat continues to change through successional processes and post-fire management actions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Although a growing number of studies address how Neotropical birds respond to anthropogenic disturbance and deforestation, we continue to poorly understand responses of groups of interacting species, such as mixed-species flocks in the Andes. In this study, we examined how attributes at landscape (i.e., percentage of forest cover within 1-km2) and local (i.e. structural complexity of microhabitat) scales shaped mixed-species flocks within five broadly-defined habitat types in the Northern and Central Andes. From 2007 to 2010, we systematically surveyed flocks along line transects in 97 1-km2 plots distributed from Venezuela to Peru based on a stratified-random design. We recorded 220 avian species in 186 mixed-species flocks, with the greatest species richness and largest flocks detected in forested habitats. Understory insectivores were most closely associated with mature and secondary forests. Increasing forest cover promoted species richness and size of flocks, with particularly strong associations in successional habitats and shade coffee. Structural complexity was positively associated with flock size in early successional and silvopastoral habitats, where 20% increases in complexity doubled flock size. However, the opposite pattern was true in shade coffee and secondary forests. Encounter rates of flocks were poorly explained by simple metrics of forest cover and structural complexity. Unlike flocks reported in many lowland forests, Andean flocks tended to span all vertical strata, with fewer understory-specializing flocks (e.g. flocks led by Basileuterus warblers and Chlorospingus tanagers). Nonetheless, in such flocks, understory insectivores were most closely associated with mature and secondary forests. Our research supports the idea that managed habitats with overstory trees can contribute to flock conservation. Overall, our results further suggested that understory birds require the more forested of habitats (e.g., mature forest held almost twice as many understory specialists as other habitats), and may be less amenable to conservation with agroecosystems or working landscapes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Wildfire is an important disturbance regime that can structure wildlife communities and their habitats for many years. Using a before-after-control-impact framework, we evaluated the effect of the Quartz Fire on a mixed broadleaf- conifer forest and associated bird community in southwestern Oregon, USA, over 10 yr. To assess whether fire severity explained changes better than simply whether an area was burned, we used a tiered sampling approach by comparing unburned control points with either all burned points combined (burned) or those same points partitioned by severity level (low, moderate, high). As expected, overall tree cover decreased while cover of shrubs increased in response to greater fire severity. This pattern was most pronounced in high-severity areas, where tree cover declined by 40% and remained depressed, but shrub cover recovered from 10% the year following fire to 75% by year 6. Ordinations of bird species density showed turnover in community composition in all burned areas combined, as well as in moderate-severity areas, shifting to a shrub-associated community 9 yr postfire. For individual species, annual density variations were best explained by fire for 14 of 37 species, with fire severity providing the best-fitting model for 7 species. Of those 7 species, 3 declined and 4 increased with greater severity. When grouped into guilds, flycatching foragers and shrub nesters increased with greater fire severity. Our results illustrate the importance of mixed-severity wildfire in creating diverse vegetation structure and composition that supports distinct bird communities for at least a decade following fire. © 2015 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Conservation actions often focus on restoration or creation of natural areas designed to facilitate the movements of organisms among populations. To be efficient, these actions need to be based on reliable estimates or predictions of landscape connectivity. While circuit theory and least-cost paths (LCPs) are increasingly being used to estimate connectivity, these methods also have proven limitations. We compared their performance in predicting genetic connectivity with that of an alternative approach based on a simple, individual-based "stochastic movement simulator" (SMS). SMS predicts dispersal of organisms using the same landscape representation as LCPs and circuit theory-based estimates (i.e., a cost surface), while relaxing key LCP assumptions, namely individual omniscience of the landscape (by incorporating perceptual range) and the optimality of individual movements (by including stochasticity in simulated movements). The performance of the three estimators was assessed by the degree to which they correlated with genetic estimates of connectivity in two species with contrasting movement abilities (Cabanis's Greenbul, an Afrotropical forest bird species, and natterjack toad, an amphibian restricted to European sandy and heathland areas). For both species, the correlation between dispersal model and genetic data was substantially higher when SMS was used. Importantly, the results also demonstrate that the improvement gained by using SMS is robust both to variation in spatial resolution of the landscape and to uncertainty in the perceptual range model parameter. Integration of this individual-based approach with other developing methods in the field of connectivity research, such as graph theory, can yield rapid progress towards more robust connectivity indices and more effective recommendations for land management. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Outbreaks by geometrid moths periodically cause mass mortality of trees and state changes in understorey vegetation in sub-arctic mountain birch forest in northern Scandinavia. In order to assess the short-term impacts of such disturbance on forest bird communities, we took bird censuses in forest where almost all birch trees had been killed by moth outbreaks 2–4 years before the study and in undamaged forest. The study was repeated in two locations (Kirkenes and Tana) with contrasting forest structure and fragmentation. Using a hierarchical community model, we show that the total abundance of birds in Kirkenes was only about 25 % lower in damaged than undamaged forest and that species richness differed even less between the two forest types. Meanwhile, neither bird abundance nor species richness differed between damaged and undamaged forest in Tana. The observed patterns in abundance were mainly driven by a few very common species. Only a single species showed indication of being more abundant in damaged forest. Thus, our findings indicate that bird communities in sub-arctic mountain birch forest have a high degree of resistance to forest damage caused by moth outbreaks. We suggest that bird populations in outbreak-affected forest may be maintained by surviving trees and by standing dead tree trunks, which help maintain the vertical structure of the forest habitat. The fact that many of the studied bird species are habitat generalists may also explain their apparently weak responses to the damage caused by the outbreak. Our results do not point towards forest damage caused by moth outbreaks as a major driver of change in bird communities in the study system, although more long-term research is needed to substantiate this conclusion. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={Traditional water supply systems in semi-arid agrarian ecosystems, mainly irrigation canals, contribute to the diversity of the landscape and influence the composition of species. To evaluate their effect on bird communities in the breeding season, we selected a rural area in southeastern Spain, where an intricate and extensive network of irrigation canals and cultivated areas is located between two wetlands declared as Natural Parks. Birds were counted at representative points distributed throughout the canal network at which we recorded several variables related to the physical features, the vertical and horizontal structure of associated vegetation, reed development (. Phragmites australis) and land use in the neighboring areas. We detected 37 bird species, most of which were also breeding in the wetlands nearby. We used Hierarchical Partitioning analyses to identify the variables most strongly related to the probability of the presence of selected species and species richness. Vegetation cover and height close to the canals, together with reed development, were the most important types of variables explaining species presence and richness. We found that current management practices for reeds in canals are not well-suited for biodiversity conservation. We therefore propose alternatives that could be implemented in the area in cooperation with stakeholders. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Effective conservation of endangered species requires a solid understanding of the demographic causes of population change. Bird populations breeding on agricultural grasslands have declined because their preferred habitat of herb-rich meadows has been replaced by grassland monocultures. The timing of agricultural activities in these monocultural grasslands is critical, as they often coincide with the nesting phase of breeding birds. Here, we aim to identify the effect of habitat management and targeted nest protection on nest survival of Black-tailed Godwits Limosa limosa in the Netherlands, a population that has shown a 70% reduction in breeding population size since the 1970s. To protect nests in monocultures from destruction, farmers are paid to either delay mowing or leave a patch of unmown grass around the nest, a patch which in practice varied in size. In herb-rich meadows, which are typically managed for bird conservation purposes, mowing occurs after hatching. Nest survival declined as the season advanced, more steeply on monocultures than on meadows. Targeted nest protection was only partially successful, as nest predation was considerably higher on mown grassland monocultures with small unmown patches around the nest than in mown monocultures with large unmown patches and in unmown fields. Increased predator densities over the years have been suggested as an important cause of the trend towards lower nest survival, but here we show that nest survival was higher on herb-rich meadows than on monocultures, and similar to the 1980s. It thus seems that increased predator densities are an increased threat during the egg stage only if habitat quality is low. High-quality habitat in the form of herb-rich meadows therefore provides a degree of protection against predators. © 2015 British Ornithologists' Union.},

abstract={The South African grassland system is home to over 3,300 plant species, 15 of the country’s 34 endemic mammal species, 12 of the 40 endemic bird species (four of which are globally threatened) and five RAMSAR wetland sites. To assess and address the ecological integrity of farmed grasslands we used process-oriented techniques, including nesting success and field metabolic rates (FMR) of birds, and an adaptation of the multi-taxon biodiversity intactness index (BII) using plant, arthropod and bird diversity data which is a comprehensive tool for assessing ecological integrity using multiple taxonomic groups. Current pastoral management practices have a significant detrimental effect on avian abundance, species richness, nest density and fledgling output. Overall energy turnover and BII values confirm the importance of conserved areas for birds in moist highland grassland systems and support the need for further conservation efforts in grassland systems by both private landowners and reserve managers. Findings based on both avian FMRs and the BII in this study were found to be comparable, lending support to the use of FMR as a rapid assessment technique for assessing ecosystem integrity for future studies of this nature. Scenarios of potential biodiversity improvement with changes in fire management regimes are also presented. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Changes in land use and land cover throughout the eastern half of North America have caused substantial declines in populations of birds that rely on grassland and shrubland vegetation types, including socially and economically important game birds such as the Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhites). As much attention is focused on habitat management and restoration for bobwhites, they may act as an umbrella species for other bird species with similar habitat requirements. We quantified the relationship of bobwhites to the overall bird community and evaluated the potential for bobwhites to act as an umbrella species for grassland and shrubland birds. We monitored bobwhite presence and bird community composition within 31 sample units on selected private lands in the south-central United States from 2009 to 2011. Bobwhites were strongly associated with other grassland and shrubland birds and were a significant positive predictor for 9 species. Seven of these, including Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii), Dicksissel (Spiza americana), and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), are listed as species of conservation concern. Species richness and occupancy probability of grassland and shrubland birds were higher relative to the overall bird community in sample units occupied by bobwhites. Our results show that bobwhites can act as an umbrella species for grassland and shrubland birds, although the specific species in any given situation will depend on region and management objectives. These results suggest that efficiency in conservation funding can be increased by using public interest in popular game species to leverage resources to meet multiple conservation objectives. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Understanding how indigenous peoples' management practices relate to biological diversity requires addressing contemporary changes in indigenous peoples' way of life. This study explores the association between cultural change among a Bolivian Amazonian indigenous group, the Tsimane', and tree diversity in forests surrounding their villages. We interviewed 86 informants in six villages about their level of attachment to traditional Tsimane' values, our proxy for cultural change. We estimated tree diversity (Fisher's Alpha index) by inventorying trees in 48 0.1-ha plots in old-growth forests distributed in the territory of the same villages. We used multivariate models to assess the relation between cultural change and alpha tree diversity. Cultural change was associated with alpha tree diversity and the relation showed an inverted U-shape, thus suggesting that tree alpha diversity peaked in villages undergoing intermediate cultural change. Although the results do not allow for testing the direction of the relation, we propose that cultural change relates to tree diversity through the changes in practices and behaviors that affect the traditional ecological knowledge of Tsimane' communities; further research is needed to determine the causality. Our results also find support in the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and suggest that indigenous management can be seen as an intermediate form of anthropogenic disturbance affecting forest communities in a subtle, non-destructive way. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A key aim of many European agri-environment schemes (AES) is to improve biodiversity on farmland. In recent years, several countries have been looking at long term trends in the spring adult population size of a target group of farmland birds as an indicator of this. The overall trend in these indicators is however not upwards. While this might suggest we need to look at the design and deployment of habitat management options within schemes, there is an increasing view that we also need to refine and improve our indicators, or the way we monitor them. Relating spring adult bird population size to AES options is problematic not least because of the time lag between the deployment of those designed to enhance bird breeding success in summer, and the spring surveys the following year. At the other end of the scale detailed studies of breeding success in farmland birds have practical/cost restraints. We argue that to understand the impact on farmland birds of particular summer options within AESs we need to be able to estimate the breeding success of local bird populations quickly and cheaply. This would enable us to relate particular AES options to the breeding performance of the birds actually using them. Complementing a previous study of woodland birds, we assess the likelihood of encountering fledged broods of hedgerow nesting bird species during transect surveys without finding nests, and then apply a simple mark-recapture analysis technique to provide an index of breeding success for those species. Following spring adult assessments, counts of fledged broods were undertaken four times a week during April, May, June and July, in four 2.5 km hedgerow transects, at four sites in southern England in 2010. Mean daily detection probabilities of fledged broods of 16 common hedgerow birds were calculated from these counts using the software Presence. For 15 out of these 16 species these detection probabilities were sufficiently high for a programme of fledged brood surveys, involving just two or three visits per week from mid-May to mid-July, to provide a useful estimate of breeding success. The survey technique and associated analyses make certain assumptions when providing estimates of breeding success and these are discussed. Little is known about initial dispersal in passerine fledglings and a study in hedgerows may be useful here. However our pilot study suggests that the method could have application as a relatively easily derived productivity index for hedgerow birds, and hence an additional method available to study the impact of certain AES options on indicator species, or for research studies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Agri-environment schemes (AES) are the main policy mechanism available to reverse the widespread losses of farmland biodiversity across Europe. Previous examples of AES enhancing the abundance of farmland birds have been restricted to targeted species recovery programmes, often with bespoke habitat management and high levels of advisory support for landowners. Here, we tested whether standard higher-tier AES agreements targeted at multiple species and with lower levels of advisory support than targeted species recovery programmes can enhance the breeding densities of farmland birds. Surveys of breeding birds were undertaken during 2008 and 2011 on 65 farms under higher level stewardship (HLS) and 21 farms lacking AES interventions, in three regions of England. After allowing for any impacts of predator control, changes in density were more positive on HLS farms in at least one region for six priority species. Five of the six species had mixed diets and were predominantly associated with field edges; the other (lapwing) probably responded to the provision of field-centre fallow plots. Changes in bird numbers were not consistently related to the extent of AES habitat provision. This is the first study to demonstrate that standard AES management without substantial ongoing advisory support can increase or maintain the densities of widespread declining species. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Abstract: Currently, land abandonment constitutes a serious threat for many species tied to semi-natural grasslands. In southern Europe, the conservation of many grassland bird communities largely depends on low-intensity mountain farming. In this study, we analysed the effects of the main farming practices promoting grassland maintenance, i.e. grazing and mowing, on species richness of a Prealpine grassland bird community and on the breeding densities of the two commonest grassland species, the skylark (Alauda arvensis Linnaeus, 1758) and the tree pipit (Anthus trivialis Linnaeus, 1758). The two study sites were located between 1100 and 2000 m above sea level in the Italian central Prealps. Grassland species richness was positively affected by grazing, and increased with increasing distance from the nearest woodland. Skylark density was positively influenced by mowing, grassland cover extent and distance from woodland, with the latter effect occurring only at a single study site. Finally, tree pipit density was positively affected by grazing. Our findings suggest that, in order to maintain open grasslands below the natural treeline and enhance the biodiversity of grassland bird communities, grazing should be preferred over mowing. Moreover, woodland edge effects may have a negative impact on mountain grassland bird communities. Advancing woodlands and abandonment of low-intensity farming and grazing practices may therefore constitute a serious threat for open-habitat specialist bird species of the Alpine region. © 2014, © 2014 Unione Zoologica Italiana.},

abstract={Fire is used as a management tool for biodiversity conservation worldwide. A common objective is to avoid population extinctions due to inappropriate fire regimes. However, in many ecosystems, it is unclear what mix of fire histories will achieve this goal. We determined the optimal fire history of a given area for biological conservation with a method that links tools from 3 fields of research: species distribution modeling, composite indices of biodiversity, and decision science. We based our case study on extensive field surveys of birds, reptiles, and mammals in fire-prone semi-arid Australia. First, we developed statistical models of species' responses to fire history. Second, we determined the optimal allocation of successional states in a given area, based on the geometric mean of species relative abundance. Finally, we showed how conservation targets based on this index can be incorporated into a decision-making framework for fire management. Pyrodiversity per se did not necessarily promote vertebrate biodiversity. Maximizing pyrodiversity by having an even allocation of successional states did not maximize the geometric mean abundance of bird species. Older vegetation was disproportionately important for the conservation of birds, reptiles, and small mammals. Because our method defines fire management objectives based on the habitat requirements of multiple species in the community, it could be used widely to maximize biodiversity in fire-prone ecosystems. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Grasslands are inherently dynamic in space and time, evolving with frequent disturbance from fire and herbivores. As a consequence of human actions, many remaining grasslands have become homogenous, which has led to reduced ecosystem function, biodiversity loss, and decreased ecological services. Previous research has shown that restoring inherent heterogeneity to grasslands can increase avian diversity, but the amount of heterogeneity (i.e., number of patches or fire return interval) and the impact on avian community stability have yet to be investigated. We used a unique landscape-level design to examine avian response to interacting fire and grazing across multiple experimental landscapes that represented a gradient of fire- and grazing-dependent heterogeneity. We used seven landscapes (430-980 ha; x¯ = 627 ha) with varying levels of patchiness ranging from annually burned (one single patch) with spring-only fires to a four-year fire return interval with spring and summer fires (eight patches). This design created a range of heterogeneity as a result of pyric herbivory, an ecological process in which fire and grazing are allowed to interact in space and time. We found that greater heterogeneity across experimental landscapes resulted in increased avian diversity and stability over time. An index of bird community change, quantified as the sum of the range of detrended correspondence analysis axis site scores, was nearly four times greater in the most homogenous experimental landscape when compared to the most heterogeneous experimental landscape. Species responses were consistently positively associated with increased heterogeneity at the landscape scale, and within-experimentallandscape responses were most often related to litter cover, litter accumulation, and vegetation height. We conclude that increased fire- and grazing-dependent heterogeneity can result in high variability in the bird community at finer, transect scales, but increased diversity and stability at broad landscape scales. We recommend that future management efforts in rangelands focus on restored disturbance processes to increase heterogeneity and improve grassland bird conservation. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.},

The avian species richness, evenness, and heterogeneity were found to be the highest at undisturbed habitats. Further, these diversity measures were negatively correlated with the intensity of anthropogenic land-use activities. Total abundance of birds increased at highly disturbed habitats due to the presence of the house crow, as it is the most abundant of all birds observed at these habitats.

abstract={The Variable Retention Harvest System (VRHS) is a silvicultural system designed to reduce logging impacts and enhance biodiversity conservation. VRHS has been widely applied worldwide but several important questions remain about its effectiveness for biodiversity conservation. A key issue is whether dispersed or aggregated retention is more effective for conservation, and hence what size of retained patches of forest should be maintained within logged areas. Many studies have indicated that increasing the amount of the original stand retained during harvesting increases the amount of biodiversity conserved. But in a form of the SLOSS (single large or several small areas for conservation) debate, a critical question is: does one large retained island better conserve forest biota than several small islands of the same aggregated area? We addressed this question in an experiment in the Mountain Ash ( Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The experiment comprised seven blocks, each with four treatments - an unlogged control, a conventional 15-40. ha clearfelled area, a 15-40. ha harvest unit with a single 1.5. ha retained "island", and a 15-40. ha harvest unit with three 0.5. ha islands. A subset of the treatment plots and harvest units in our experiment were burned in a major wildfire in 2009. Given this, a subsequent further question we posed was: are there additional effects on birds resulting from logging operations that were followed by wildfires.We identified a significant gradient in species richness across treatments with lowest values in conventional clearfelled areas and highest values in unlogged controls. Unexpectedly, we identified no significant island size effects on bird species richness. We found no individual species that were significantly more likely to occur in a single large island than several small islands. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed significant differences in the composition of the bird community between treatments, consistent with our findings for some of the more common species of birds. Several species were significantly less likely to be recorded in clearfelled areas, although the Flame Robin was more likely to be recorded in them. When we removed clearfelled areas from our analyses, some species were significantly less likely to occur in retained islands than unlogged controls. The application of VRHS did not appear to mediate bird responses to wildfire relative to effects for birds observed in clearfelled harvest units that were subsequently burned in 2009.Our results suggest that VRHS has positive effects on bird biota in Mountain Ash forests. However, this study found no advantage of setting aside a single large island versus several small islands within a given harvest unit for bird species richness nor the occurrence of individual bird species. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In temperate and tropical regions agricultural conversion of natural habitat typically has negative impacts upon the diversity and functional complexity of bird communities. In arid environments however, the irrigation associated with agricultural can lead to an increase in local abundances of plant and insect resources, so has the potential to benefit bird communities. South Sinai is a key migratory corridor for many birds making the annual journey from wintering sites in Africa to breeding sites in Europe. We assess the importance of traditional Bedouin agricultural gardens for both resident and migratory species by comparing the density and functional composition of birds within the irrigated gardens to those in the unmanaged desert habitat. Estimated bird densities were significantly higher within the gardens than the unmanaged habitat, with a higher estimated species richness within the gardens. Functional composition of bird communities differed between the two habitats, with gardens supporting a higher proportion of insectivorous and migratory birds in addition to the resident desert species that were associated with the unmanaged habitat. Migratory species were almost entirely absent from the unmanaged habitat, suggesting that this region may not be used as a migratory stop-off if not for the presence of traditional agricultural gardens. © 2014.},

abstract={We used publically available data on duck breeding distribution and recently compiled geospatial data on upland habitat and environmental conditions to develop a spatially explicit model of breeding duck populations across the entire Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). Our spatial population models were able to identify key areas for duck conservation across the PPR and predict between 62.1 - 79.1% (68.4% avg.) of the variation in duck counts by year from 2002 - 2010. The median difference in observed vs. predicted duck counts at a transect segment level was 4.6 ducks. Our models are the first seamless spatially explicit models of waterfowl abundance across the entire PPR and represent an initial step toward joint conservation planning between Prairie Pothole and Prairie Habitat Joint Ventures. Our work demonstrates that when spatial and temporal variation for highly mobile birds is incorporated into conservation planning it will likely increase the habitat area required to support defined population goals. A major goal of the current North American Waterfowl Management Plan and subsequent action plan is the linking of harvest and habitat management. We contend incorporation of spatial aspects will increase the likelihood of coherent joint harvest and habitat management decisions. Our results show at a minimum, it is possible to produce spatially explicit waterfowl abundance models that when summed across survey strata will produce similar strata level population estimates as the design-based Waterfowl Breeding Pair and Habitat Survey (r2 = 0.977). This is important because these design-based population estimates are currently used to set duck harvest regulations and to set duck population and habitat goals for the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. We hope this effort generates discussion on the important linkages between spatial and temporal variation in population size, and distribution relative to habitat quantity and quality when linking habitat and population goals across this important region.},

abstract={The Mediterranean basin exhibits a multitude of forest habitats affected by former and current exploitation and management. Recent afforestation programs have resulted in an increase in the proportion of coniferous trees, while oak stands, formerly utilized for coppicing and grazing, are abandoned or converted into coniferous plantations. The loss of oak stands might negatively affect birds dependent upon broadleaved forests. Studies confirming or rejecting that statement are scarce, particularly in the eastern part of the region. Using a study area in southwestern Turkey we applied a guild-based approach to investigate how pine and oak stands across a chronosequence differ in their capacity to support forest bird assemblages. Variables describing the vegetation were sampled to characterize the stands and relate bird assemblages to stand structure. Bird abundance and species richness was positively associated with age for both stand types. Richness and diversity was highest in oak stands, while there were no differences in bird abundance between the two forest types. Pine stands supported a different bird species composition compared to oak stands of the same age. Stand age and structure, rather than forest type, held the highest explanatory powers for bird assembly structure. Primary cavity-nesters and ground-nesters were more abundant in oak stands, possibly reflecting differences in stand structure and resource distribution. To support these birds with suitable habitats, oaks stands need conservation. Management practices in pine stands should strive for increasing the amount of old trees and retain vegetation in the understory to benefit breeding birds. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The role of breeding birds as indicators of sustainable management in olive groves was investigated. The data revealed significantly higher alpha diversity in organic and abandoned olive groves and maquis than in conventional ones. The highest beta diversity was found between the following pairs: organic olive groves–maquis, and abandoned olive groves–maquis. Breeding bird diversity, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera and Coleoptera densities positively influenced bird species richness in organic olive groves and maquis, and additionally, manure application positively influenced bird species richness in organic ones. Bird species richness was negatively influenced by pesticide and inorganic fertilizer application in conventional ones. Moreover, isopod density was unimportant in explaining breeding bird richness in organic olive groves. Finally, our study suggests a difference in bird communities of various olive groves as a result of different management and practices, and concludes that birds might serve as indicators of overall olive grove health. Furthermore, these findings could be used as a tool for prediction of breeding bird species richness probability in different olive grove management systems and maquis. Finally, the results of the present study may contribute to highlighting some aspects of the effect of different farming practices on the dynamics of Mediterranean bird communities. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={We compared the vegetation structure between old (>70 year) stands of planted diversified native forests and stands of Eucalyptus tereticornis embedded in a mosaic of Eucalyptus stands. We then tested for differences in the abundance, species richness, species composition, and ecological traits (forest dependence, sensitivity to forest fragmentation, and diet) of the understory bird assemblages inhabiting both kinds of stands. We expected differences in the structure of the bird assemblages because of the different origins and management strategies (contrary to native stands, Eucalyptus stands were selectively logged in the past). Three stands of each habitat (native and Eucalyptus) were sampled with mist nets during 11 months. Eucalyptus stands had a denser understory, whereas native plantations had a more developed vertical structure and a greater density of native trees. The abundance distribution of bird species was more homogeneous in Eucalyptus than in native stands. Eucalyptus had slightly higher species richness (36 species) than native stands (32 species). The composition of species and the occurrence of the diet, forest dependence, and sensitivity to forest fragmentation categories were similar between habitats. Some bird species (e.g. Turdus leucomelas), however, were more abundant in one habitat over the other. Old stands of Eucalyptus and planted native forest can harbor a diverse bird community similar in structure but not exactly equivalent for individual bird species. Planting native diversified forests and keeping set-aside stands of the exotic tree should be viewed as complementary rather than alternative strategies for maintaining bird diversity within plantations. © 2015 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={The effects of logging and recovery process on avian richness and diversity was compared in recently logged and thirty year post-harvested hill dipterocarp tropical rainforest, using mist-netting method. A total of 803 bird individuals representing 86 bird species and 29 families (i.e. 37.90% from recently logged forest and 62.10% from thirty year post-harvested forest) were captured from October 2010 to September, 2012. Twenty one bird species were commonly captured from both types of forests, 37 bird species were caught only in thirty year post-harvested forest and 28 bird species were caught only from recently logged forest. Arachnothera longirostra - Little Spiderhunter, Malacopteron magnum - Rufous-crowned Babbler, Alophoixus phaeocephalus - Yellow-bellied Bulbul and Meiglyptes tukki-Buff-necked Woodpecker were the most abundant four bird species in the thirty year post-harvested forest. On the contrary, seven bird species i.e., Trichastoma rostratum - White-chested Babbler, Lacedo pulchella - Banded Kingfisher, Picus miniaceus - Banded Woodpecker, Enicurus ruficapillus - Chestnut-naped Forktail, Anthreptes simplex - Plain Sunbird, Muscicapella hodgsoni-Pygmy Blue Flycatcher and Otus rufescens - Reddish Scope Owl were considered as the rarest (i.e. each represented only 0.12%). Likewise, A. longirostra, Pycnonotuserythropthalmos-Spectacled Bulbul, P. simplex-Cream-vented Bulbul and Meropsviridis- Blue-throated Bee-eater were the most dominant and Copsychus malabaricus - White-rumped Shama Eurylaimus javanicus - Banded Broadbill Ixos malaccensis - Streaked Bulbul and Harpactes diardii - Diard's Trogon (each 0.12%) were the rarest bird species in recently logged forest. CAP analysis indicated that avian species in thirty year post-harvested forest were more diverse and evenly distributed than recently logged forest. However, recently logged forest was rich in bird species than thirty year post- harvested forest. The results revealed that logging and retrieval process affect bird species richness and diversity. However, bird species may respond differently from habitat to habitat i.e., forest logging causes disturbance of some avian species while recovery process may replace the loss of vegetation and harbour a wide array of avian species richness and diversity.},

abstract={The present study evaluated the characteristics of the understory bird fauna of four fragments of terra firme forest in eastern Acre, Brazil, that were impacted by wildfires in 2005. The study investigated the species richness and the composition of trophic guilds using mist-netting on eight transects (four in burned plots and four in control plots in the same forest fragments). Eight plots (0.12 ha) were also established parallel to each transect to record the number of live trees (DBH ≥ 10 cm), palms, and dead trees. Bamboo stems were quantified in 0.024 ha subplots. No significant difference was found between burned and control plots in the species richness or abundance of birds, nor was any significant pattern found in the NMDS ordination of the composition of the communities or guilds. The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) found that the burned plots were physiognomically distinct, due principally to the number of bamboo stems and dead trees. Multiple regressions based on the PCA scores and bird species richness and abundance found no significant trends. The findings of the present study indicate that the understory bird assemblage of the areas affected by a single wildfire in 2005 had almost totally recuperated eight years after this event. © 2015 Tatiana Lemos da Silva et al.},

A fire that originated on surrounding farmland burned approximately half of Kimboza Forest Reserve between 13 and 15 October 2010. To better understand how birds respond to fire, a short-term study of understorey bird diversity and abundance in this forest reserve was conducted by comparing burned and unburned sites twenty months post-fire. Capture rates were significantly higher at the unburned site compared to the burned site. Bird species diversity was also higher at the unburned site than at the burned site. Despite the brevity of the study, the results suggest that fire has negative effects on forest avifauna and forest fires need to be prevented at Kimboza Forest Reserve as they affect the distribution and diversity of understorey birds. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

However, in October 2010 a non-intentional fire burned the entire forest and this event provided a good opportunity to assess the extent to which birds were affected. Assessment, using mist netting, was carried out one week, three months and eight months after the fire, and comparisons made with data obtained before the forest was burned. In total, 28 species were recorded. Of these, the number recorded before the fire, one week post-fire, three months post-fire and eight months post-fire was 22, 3, 3 and 11 species respectively. The understorey bird species diversity before the forest was burned was substantially higher than diversities found afterwards. The results confirm that forest burning can have a severe negative impact on bird abundance and species richness and should be halted. Because fires start from the surrounding farmland, there is a need to construct and maintain fire breaks around entire forests. ©.},

abstract={Saltmarshes of Spartina densiflora in south-eastern South America have been modified by anthropogenic activities, mainly production of livestock. We examined the effect of the intensity of cattle production on the structure of saltmarsh vegetation and the effect of these changes to vegetation on the richness, composition and size of the avian populations and the abundance of nests. The levels of cattle production were based on the combined intensity of prescribed burning and cattle grazing, classed as: (1) High grazing - High burning (HH), (2) Low grazing - Low burning (LL) and (3) No grazing - No burning (NN). Cattle production altered the vegetation structure of saltmarshes and indirectly modified the richness, composition and size of their avian populations and the abundance of nests. Saltmarshes with either LL or NN production levels were inhabited by tall grassland specialists and generalists and by species specialised to live in a mosaic of short and tall grassland patches. Conversely, saltmarshes with HH production levels were inhabited by short-grassland specialists. That avian species diversity does not differ between S. densiflora saltmarsh subject to low or no human impacts has several potential interpretations, which are discussed. These findings have implications for management of grasslands to maintain avian diversity. Journal compilation © BirdLife Australia 2015},

abstract={The effectiveness of revegetation in providing habitat for fauna is expected to be determined both by within-site factors and attributes of the landscape in which a revegetation site occurs. Most studies of fauna in revegetation have been conducted in landscapes that have been extensively cleared, modified or fragmented, and in Australia, predominantly in the southern temperate zone. We investigated how within-site vegetation attributes and landscape context attributes were related to bird species richness and composition in a chronosequence of post-mining rehabilitation sites within an otherwise intact landscape in tropical northern Australia. Our working hypothesis was that bird species richness in rehabilitating sites would be positively related to site vegetation structure and landscape context including (1) proximity to woodland and (2) the proportion of woodland within a 500-m buffer of rehabilitation sites. Within each of 67 sites, we sampled vegetation once and surveyed for birds eight times over 16 months. Landscape context variables were calculated using GIS. There were large differences between bird assemblages of woodland and rehabilitation sites and between age classes of rehabilitation. Bird assemblages were strongly related to site vegetation attributes across all rehabilitation sites. Proximity to woodland was only related to bird assemblages in rehabilitation sites older than 4 years old. We conclude that the relative importance of landscape context and site variables at any point in time will be a function of how closely vegetation within the revegetation site matches the habitat resource requirements of individual species. © 2015 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={Oak forests around the world have been widely used to obtain firewood and produce charcoal and like other habitats have been affected by the increasing development of livestock activities. Oak forests from western Mexico are one of the five priority habitats for the conservation of birds at a continental level and are the repository of the highest number of endemic bird species in this megadiverse country. We studied how charcoal extraction and the use of oak forest for cattle grazing affect bird communities. We focused our work on oak forest patches with four different management units that include three successional stages that occur after most of the trees have been removed for charcoal production and cattle-grazing is conducted, and mature oak forest patches with little wood extraction and no cattle-grazing. We used unlimited radius point counts to survey avian communities, and compared their richness, composition, density, structure and similarity among the different management units. We found that resident bird species, summer migrants and Neotropical migrant bird species used the four management units differently. Resident bird species used all habitat units similarly. Winter migrants as a group were present in the different management units, however while some species used habitats with cattle, other species used habitats with no cattle-grazing. Finally, summer migrants used habitat units with tall trees and high values of tree and shrub richness, and tended to avoid the early successional unit. Both charcoal extraction and cattle grazing worked in synergy decreasing the species richness and the equity of the bird communities. Management strategies should include active conservation of undisturbed oak forest areas because they play an essential role to maintain resident bird species in the landscape. © 2014.},

abstract={The Flooding Pampas is the most important livestock region of Argentina, but is a region where replacement of originally natural, perennial tussock grasses by pasture species is changing the heterogeneity of the grassland system. We evaluated the response of grassland bird assemblages of the Flooding Pampas to planting of Lotus tenuis (Lotus) pasture, which mainly modifies vegetation structure by reducing vertical heterogeneity. Species richness and abundance of birds were compared between fields of Lotus pasture and semi-natural grasslands. Avian species richness and abundance were both greater in semi-natural grassland than in Lotus pasture. When grouped by nesting habits (grassland specialists, generalists), species richness and abundance of grassland specialists was greater in semi-natural grassland, whereas richness and abundance of generalist species was greater in Lotus pasture. An indicator-species analysis showed that five grassland birds were closely linked to semi-natural grassland vegetation, with two of those species-Hudson's Canastero (Asthenes hudsoni) and Bay-capped Wren-Spinetail (Spartonoica maluroides)-of conservation concern.1 In contrast, generalist species, such as Southern Lapwings (Vanellus chilensis) and Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia), were associated with Lotus pasture. Planting of Lotus pasture has negative effects on species that naturally occur in tussock grassland. Grassland management methods, such as intercropping and rotational grazing, could help reconcile the effects of livestock production and the conservation grassland bird conservation in the Flooding Pampas. © 2015 BirdLife Australia.},

abstract={A primary concern for human-wildlife interactions is the potential impacts resulting from wildlife (primarily birds) collisions with aircraft. The identification of species responsible for collisions with aircraft is necessary so that airport management can develop effective strategies to reduce strikes with those species. Of particular importance in developing such strategies is the identification of regional, seasonal, and temporal patterns in collisions with unidentified bird species that may limit the effectiveness of regional habitat management to reduce bird strikes. The authors analyzed 105,529 U.S. civil aviation strike records from 1990 to 2012 in the FAA's National Wildlife Strike Database to examine patterns of collisions involving unidentified birds. Factors that affected identification were airport certification class, FAA region, mass of struck species, state species richness (if damage was reported), and interactive effects between the last four factors. Identification varied by region and declined with increasing species richness; this identification was greater for general aviation (GA) airports and the mass of struck species, especially when damage was reported. Species identification might be improved by increasing reporting efforts relative to species richness, especially by GA airport managers and operations staff, who may have a higher propensity of reporting bird strikes, and by collecting more fieldbased data on avian populations. The results can provide guidance for the development of airport management and personnel training.},

abstract={Declines of early-successional forest across the northeast United States during the past 60 years has caused declines in populations of associated birds and active forest management is necessary to reverse these trends. Land managers often focus on a few target species with hopes that non-target species are also conserved, but the effectiveness of management for so-called umbrella species is seldom verified. We compared bird assemblages at American woodcock (Scolopax minor) singing grounds and nearby, random forest sites to determine whether habitat management for woodcock benefits non-target bird species. Early-successional forest species were a key component of bird assemblages at singing grounds, but were largely absent from random forest sites. On average, the total number and diversity of birds were ≥1.5 times greater at singing grounds. We also found evidence for broader landscape differences in the number of bird species expected at singing grounds (n = 48; 95% CI = 41-56) and random forest sites (n = 34; 95% CI = 28-41). Our results indicate that forest management to support woodcock populations extends some conservation benefits to diverse non-target bird species. Thus, the woodcock may serve as an effective umbrella species, especially for early-successional forest birds, but complementary umbrella species should be considered to aid in the conservation of birds that breed in more mature forest. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Fine-scale vegetation cover is a common variable used to explain animal occurrence, but we know less about the effects of fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity. Theoretically, fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity is an important driver of biodiversity because it captures the range of resources available in a given area. In this study we investigated how bird species richness and birds grouped by various ecological traits responded to vegetation cover and heterogeneity. We found that both fine-scale vegetation cover (of tall trees, medium-sized trees and shrubs) and heterogeneity (of tall trees, and shrubs) were important predictors of bird richness, but the direction of the response of bird richness to shrub heterogeneity differed between sites with different proportions of tall tree cover. For example, bird richness increased with shrub heterogeneity in sites with high levels of tall tree cover, but declined in sites with low levels of tall tree cover. Our findings indicated that an increase in vegetation heterogeneity will not always result in an increase in resources and niches, and associated higher species richness. We also found birds grouped by traits responded in a predictable way to vegetation heterogeneity. For example, we found small birds benefited from increased shrub heterogeneity supporting the textual discontinuity hypothesis and non-arboreal (ground or shrub) nesting species were associated with high vegetation cover (low heterogeneity). Our results indicated that focusing solely on increasing vegetation cover (e.g. through restoration) may be detrimental to particular animal groups. Findings from this investigation can help guide habitat management for different functional groups of birds. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We examined the effects of different intensities of forest management practices on bird communities in the Bialowieza Forest, eastern Poland. Stands managed for more than 100 years (cutting, planting, removal of dead wood) and stands that were partially protected in nature reserves (sporadic sanitary cutting, removal of dead wood until 2008) were compared with unmanaged stands in the Bialowieza National Park by surveying the bird community during three breeding seasons (2010-2012). Surveys were conducted within three forest habitats: spruce-pine (Pino-Quercetum), lime-hornbeam (Tilio-Carpinetum) and ash-alder (Fraxino-Alnetum). Results showed that habitat structure significantly affected the avian community. The basal area of live trees had a positive effect on abundance of birds, while the density of live trees had negative significant effect on bird abundance and species diversity. We also found significantly lower abundance of insectivorous birds and cavity-nesters in managed compared with unmanaged stands. Birds’ assembly in the spruce-pine and ash-alder stands were most sensitive to management. These results show that management can be used to sustain bird communities, including species of conservation concern. © SISEF.},

abstract={An overabundance of plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) populations along with increased numbers of livestock was suspected to have caused degradation of the alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. In April 2007, we conducted fertility control of plateau pika populations in Guoluo District, south of Qinghai Province, China. We investigated abundances of pika and bird species observed at the study sites during August and September 2007 and 2008 in order to evaluate the effects of quinestrol, levonorgestrel and EP-1 on plateau pikas, avian diversity and abundance. The results demonstrated that quinestrol reduced pika abundances significantly compared with control in the second year after delivering the baits, while bird diversity and species richness did not decline significantly. Abundances of white-rumped snowfinch were significantly lower in quinestrol group compared with control, while abundances of rufous-necked snowfinch were significantly higher in quinestrol groups compared with EP-1 group. Quinestrol reduced pika population abundances, but had limited effects on avian diversity. Therefore, it was a potential approach that could be applied in the management of plateau pika on the Tibetan Plateau. ©, 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={Estimates of bird numbers through quantification of density and range sizes are necessary for decisions regarding conservation status, yet counts of birds are often confounded by uncertainty of detection. The status of the endemic birds of the Fynbos biome is of interest due to their conservation value in a global biodiversity hotspot, the ecological services they provide, and their importance for the avitourism industry. We conducted an extensive repeated point-count survey across the Fynbos biome, South Africa, to determine probability of detection and covariates of site occupancy for 27 bird species. Detection of most species was influenced by time of day, temperature or vegetation height. Important covariates influencing site occupancy were vegetation height, altitude, time since fire and habitat type. Site occupancy for four fynbos-endemic species was positively associated with increasing altitude. We further conducted point counts and mist-netting in eastern regions of the Fynbos biome to calculate local density and standardised capture rates. A linear regression analysis showed that capture rates were a function of bird densities, but that several species were captured at higher rates than expected, notably nectarivorous species. During mist-netting a relative abundance count was conducted. We expected deviation of the fit of the regression of capture rates on relative abundance to correlate with detection probability, because we expect this index to underestimate skulking and cryptic species, but there was no correlation. Estimated species richness indices were highest for the biome-wide survey, and lowest for mist-netting due to the body size limit imposed by the capture technique. Overall, we showed that point counts are an effective method for surveying birds in the fynbos and that mist-netting can be used to create an index of relative abundance for smaller species, but can be significantly affected by net placement. © 2015, Copyright © NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract={To be successful, prescriptions for tropical forest restoration should facilitate natural recovery while also being easy to implement and inexpensive. In the Lake Ngardok Nature Reserve, Palau, we monitored native forest patches (4-275 m2) over 3 years to assess the influence of several low-cost restoration methods on patch expansion, growth of naturally established tree saplings, density of naturally establishing tree seedlings, growth of planted tree seedlings, flower and fruit production, and bird and flying fox visitations. Treatments included fertilization, trimming of surrounding herbaceous vegetation, mulching of patch perimeters, and planting native tree seedlings. Fertilized patches expanded faster and were associated with higher growth rates of perimeter saplings, higher fruit and flower production and growth of adjacent planted Acacia auriculiformis trees. Trimming perimeter vegetation led to higher tree seedling densities and species diversity, but both trimming and fertilizer effects on patch perimeter measures decreased over time. Pterocarpus indicus, a high value native legume, was the fastest growing planted tree species. The most common visitors were small, omnivorous, predominately endemic bird species. Visitations to fertilized patches were more frequent than to non-fertilized patches. The strongest predictors of visitation frequency were patch area, mean number of total fruits, and mean height of nearest neighboring trees. We conclude that forest succession can be accelerated by applying small amounts of fertilizer (approximately 22.5 g/m2 per application) to enhance tree growth and increase visitation rates of native pollinators and dispersers. © 2015 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={Tropical Asian Galliformes are secretive and difficult to survey. Many of these species are considered "at risk" due to habitat degradation although reliable density estimates are lacking. Using camera trapping and distance sampling data collected on the Siamese Fireback (Lophura diardi) in northeastern Thailand, we compared density estimates for pristine and degraded lowland forest. Density was poorly estimated using distance sampling, likely due to small sample size arising from poor visibility in dense vegetation and bird's sensitivity to observers. We analysed camera trap data using both count-based and presence/absence-based methods. Those density estimates had narrower confidence intervals than those obtained using distance sampling. Estimated density was higher in dry evergreen forest (5.6birdskm-2), than in old forest plantations (0.2birdskm-2), perhaps because dense forest habitats provide Firebacks with more resources and refuge from predation. Our results suggest that camera trap data can be used for estimating density of cryptic terrestrial bird species inhabiting tropical forest that lack unique identification markings. However, this technique requires that the effective sampling area is known and thus requires knowledge of the animal home range size. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Long-term landscape-scale experiments allow for the detection of effects of silviculture on bird abundance. Manipulative studies allow for strong inference on effects and confirmation of patterns from observational studies. We estimated bird-territory density within forest stands (2.89-62 ha) for 19 years of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP), a 100-year experiment designed to study the effects of even-age and uneven-age management on wildlife. We spot-mapped territories of 15 species in 228 stands for 5 years before treatment and 14 years after treatment to assess the effects of stand-level silvicultural treatments (clearcut, select cut, thin, and no-harvest) applied within even-age, uneven-age, or no-harvest (control) management sites and year on avian territory density. We used 2 a priori contrasts to compare pre-treatment bird densities with densities during early (3-5 yr) and late (12-14 yr) post-treatment periods. The interaction of silvicultural treatment and year had significant effects on the densities of all 15 species. Densities of hooded warbler (Setophaga citrina), indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea), prairie warbler (Setophaga discolor), and yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) increased significantly 3-5 years post-treatment with the greatest changes in clearcuts, but densities 12-14 years post-treatment did not differ from pre-treatment densities. Densities of Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and especially ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) had significant decreases in clearcut stands after treatment and lesser decreases in select cut or thin stands post-treatment. Densities of black-and-white warbler (Mniotilta varia), eastern wood-pewee (Contopus virens), and Kentucky warbler (Geothlypis formosa) increased in clearcut, thin, and select cut stands, but these increases were short-lived and sporadic by year after treatment. Densities of Acadian flycatcher and ovenbird remained lower in clearcut stands than no-harvest stands 13 years post-treatment. The results of this manipulative experiment were mostly consistent with our predictions of bird response to common silvicultural treatments in these forests. Managers can use these species-specific responses to silvicultural treatment to guide management decisions for target species or to balance management practices in a landscape to meet the needs of multiple species. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={White-headed woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) are important cavity excavators that recently have become the focus of much research because of concerns over population declines. Past studies have focused on nest site selection and survival but information is needed on factors influencing their space use when away from the nest. We examined space use by white-headed woodpeckers during the nesting (May-Jul) and post-nesting (Jul-Oct) periods and compared the role of environmental factors (e.g., landcover) and socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, breeding success) in home range size and selection of location. Average size of 99% kernel home ranges was 125 ha (SD ± 59 ha; n = 19) in the nesting period and 137 ha (SD ± 70 ha; n = 30) in the post-nesting period. Minimum convex polygons were generally comparable to or smaller than ranges reported from previous radio-telemetry studies with this species. Although bird weight and age best explained variation in home range size compared to other factors, neither parameter estimate was significant in our models. Thus, even though weight and age were the most-supported factors in our analysis, home range size was largely influenced by factors that we did not measure. We found that most woodpeckers selected home ranges within forest patches that had undergone a recent disturbance; these areas included forests that had recently been burned with prescribed fire by the United States Forest Service (82%) or subject to disease (16%). Most burned patches in our study were small (approx. 4.8 ha) and occurred within otherwise live forest but had nearly complete mortality of adult trees. We suggest that recent forest disturbances, especially mixed-severity prescribed burns, may have been selected by white-headed woodpeckers because they created snags for nesting and future studies should explore this hypothesis. Because home range size was variable and not linked with productivity, it should not be used as an indication of habitat quality without more detailed studies on causal factors that affect space use in this species. © Published 2015.

abstract={Time and financial constraints often force conservationists to make ad hoc management decisions without sufficient knowledge to predict their effects. In particular, the effects of management on reproduction and survival are rarely evaluated and habitat dynamics are rarely taken into account. We evaluated the effects of three different forms of habitat alteration on the endangered Pale-headed Brushfinch (Atlapetes pallidiceps) in Ecuador during the phases of population increase and stabilization. More specifically, we monitored the effect of a natural experiment with three approaches (clearing, grazing and burning) to preserve the semi-open habitat of this species on the reproductive success of 220 breeding events over seven years and on the survival of 73 adults over three consecutive years. Habitat alteration had contrasting effects on reproduction and survival. All approaches increased the number of fledged chicks per breeding event while the population stabilized, but not while it increased. However, vegetation burning reduced survival probability of adult individuals. In addition, survival was strongly correlated to the presence of water in the territories. Overall, we revealed that the negative effects of vegetation burning on survival overrode the positive effects on reproduction, and could-if implemented at a larger scale-destroy the conservation aim of increasing the population size. Importantly, we show that the effectiveness of management differs depending on the actual population trend. Our study therefore shows that the a posteriori evaluation of ad hoc vegetation control can constitute an integral part of adaptive management and thereby also of long-term conservation planning of endangered species. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We examined correlates of amphibian and waterbird diversity related to management practices, with a focus on timing of flooding, at shallow ponds used for common carp Cyprinus carpio culture in Eastern Poland. The age of the stocked fish was a strong predictor of amphibian diversity, with higher scores obtained in ponds with young-of-the-year carp compared to ponds containing older (and larger) fish. Pond cover by emergent vegetation was positively related to diversity of both taxonomic groups. The timing of filling affected the taxonomic richness of the ponds; in contrast to ponds filled in early spring (March-early April), early breeding amphibian species were not recorded in ponds filled later (early May). However, amphibian diversity did not differ between early-and late-flooded ponds. Early availability of filled ponds favored waterbird species richness and diversity, and the hydroperiod effect overcame the effect of fish age/size. Dissimilar responses to hydroperiod onset may reflect differences between amphibian and bird communities in the nature and strength of interactions with fish. Timing of flooding, which appears to be a neglected determinant of biodiversity in anthropogenic wetlands, should consider the breeding and migration phenology of wildlife species and the presence and population structure of fish. © 2015 J.

abstract={22 plots at the Xiaoheijiang base, located in the lower-middle reaches of the Lancang-Meikong River in China, were investigated to analyze the understory biodiversity of Jatropha curcas plantations. Two kinds of mixed modes of J. curcas (mixed plantation with Macadamia integrifolia and mixed plantation with shrub species) and a pure plantation of J. curcas were planted, while the native vegetation served as a control. The plots were distributed along the gradients of forest management, succession and elevation by CCA analysis. Species richness was not significantly different for the different types of plantation, but the evenness of species could be affected, especially for the total community and the understory by planting J. curcas. The diversity and evenness indices of species were affected for the mixed plantation with different proportions of M. integrifolia, especially for the shrub layer, the Shannon diversity index and Pilou evenness index showed significant differences. And for the different mixed shrub species, only the Shannon diversity index and Pilou evenness index were significantly different. Finally, from the perspective of biological diversity, J. curcas plantation with shrub species would be a recommended planting model for ecological restoration in a dry-hot valley area, while J. curcas plantation with M. integrifolia would be an effective planting model to balance crop yield and food security. © 2015, Pakistan Botanical Society.

abstract={Anthropogenic changes to disturbance regimes in grasslands, and associated homogenization of vegetation structure, have been implicated as factors contributing to declines in populations of grassland birds in North America. We examined the influence of patch-burn grazing management, which employs spatiotemporal interactions between fire and livestock grazing guided by historical disturbance patterns, on vegetation structure and bird abundance in shortgrass steppe in northeastern Colorado, USA. All study pastures were grazed by cattle at moderate stocking rates from May to October each year. In the patch-burn treatment, we burned 25% of each pasture in autumn (Oct or Nov) each year during 2007-2010; control pastures were not burned. Patch-burn grazing management increased vegetation heterogeneity by generating short (<4cm), sparse vegetation on recent burns. Although cattle selectively grazed recent burns, this did not alter vegetation structure in unburned portions of patch-burned pastures relative to controls. Of the 6 grassland bird species we examined, mountain plovers (Charadrius montanus) occurred exclusively on recent burns, whereas grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) occurred exclusively in grassland not burned for ≥3 years. Two species (lark bunting [Calamospiza melanocorys] and western meadowlark [Sturnella neglecta]) were 2-3 times less abundant on recent burns compared to controls, whereas densities of horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) and McCown's longspur (Rhynchophanes mccownii) were unaffected by burning. Lark bunting, western meadowlark, and grasshopper sparrow densities varied substantially among years. In the years when they were abundant, all 3 species increased in density across the time-since-burning gradient. Consistent with this pattern, patch-burn grazing management reduced the abundance of all 3 species at the whole-pasture scale. We found no evidence that unburned patches within the patch-burned pastures differed from unburned pastures in terms of the abundance of any bird species. Patch-burn grazing management was an effective strategy to create breeding habitat for mountain plovers. However, our findings suggest that in the shortgrass steppe, additional strategies that generate taller, more dense vegetation than occurs under moderate cattle grazing need to be considered in combination with patch-burn grazing management to sustain breeding habitat for the full suite of native grassland birds.

abstract={The present study evaluated the combined effects of four typical predatory zooplankton and allelopathic aquatic macrophytes on algal control in a microcosm system. It would determine the effects of diverse species and biological restoration on the growth of harmful water-bloom microalgae in great lakes polluted by excess nutrients. It was found that the mixtures of each zooplankton and the floating plant Nymphoides peltatum had stronger inhibitory effects on harmful water-bloom microalgae than the individual species in clean or eutrophic water bodies. In addition, a community of four zooplankton types had a synergistic effect on algal inhibition. Algal suppression by the zooplankton community was enhanced significantly when the macrophyte was co-cultured in the microcosm. Furthermore, Chlorella pyrenoidosa was more susceptible than Microcystis aeruginosa when exposed to grazing by zooplankton and the allelopathic potential of the macrophyte. Algal inhibition was also weaker in eutrophic conditions compared with the control. These findings indicate that diverse species may enhance algal inhibition. Therefore, it is necessary to restore biological diversity and rebuild an ecologically balanced food chain or web to facilitate the control of harmful algal blooms in eutrophic lakes. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Mangrove ecosystems are one of the habitats that host high environmental diversity at the level of physical, geomorphological and biological features in arid regions. In Saudi Arabia, mangrove ecosystems are heavily threatened by both natural hazards and human pressure. The total estimated area of mangroves in Safwa Al Khurais, Saudi Arabia, is approximately 20 000 ha in extent and comprises two species: Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata. They supply detritus to the marine food web and play a significant role in the conservation of biological diversity. The main objective of this study was to analyse the demographic population sensitivity of A. marina in two representative sites on the Red Sea and the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia. A sensitivity analysis was used to assess the contributions of the inputs to the total uncertainty in the analysis outcomes. Demographic features affecting mangroves in Saudi Arabia are complex and include various aspects. The phenological phase, tree size, density, cover, number of dead trees and pneumatophore characteristics were considered in this study. A comparative analysis of Gaussian process emulators for performing a global sensitivity analysis was used to conduct a variance-based sensitivity analysis to identify which uncertain inputs drive the output uncertainty. The results showed that the interconnections between different demographic features were predictable, but that the extent of the sensitivity was uncertain. Findings from the current study are anticipated to contribute significantly towards an inclusive mangrove demographic features assessment, and towards the subsequent conservation of mangroves in Saudi Arabia. Conservation implications: The findings of the current research are discussed in light of the application of sensitivity analyses outputs in the conservation and management of mangrove ecosystems at a national level. © 2015.

abstract={Dramatic fluctuations in food resources are a key feature of many habitats, and many species have evolved a movement strategy to exploit food resources that are unpredictable in space and time. The availability of food resources may be a particularly strong determinant of habitat quality for irruptive bird species. We studied the apparent foraging success of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), an irruptive species that responds opportunistically to pulsed food resources in burned forests and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations. Prior investigations revealed that the highest population growth rates of Black-backed Woodpeckers occurred in habitat created by summer wildfire, with intermediate population growth rates in MPB infestations, and the lowest population growth rates in habitats created by prescribed fire in fall. We tested whether apparent foraging success was associated with known habitat quality in order to assess the potential for food availability to regulate population growth. We counted the number of successfully captured wood-boring beetle larvae and "small" prey on each tree that a Blackbacked Woodpecker used for foraging and modeled these counts as a function of habitat, tree diameter, number of years postfire, and tree disturbance category. Total apparent foraging success (the sum of observed captures of woodboring beetle larvae and small prey per tree) did not vary across habitats, but woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by summer wildfire were expected to capture 2.2 and 2.0 times more wood-boring beetles than woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations, respectively. These results suggest that the availability of food resources may contribute to population regulation in this irruptive species. Furthermore, population growth in irruptive species may be highly sensitive to the availability of preferred food resources. Forests recently burned by summer wildfires provide relatively abundant food resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers and represent high-quality habitat for this species of conservation concern. © 2015 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={The concentration of birds around airports has significantly increased the occurrence of aeronautical accidents worldwide. One of the main techniques to modify the avian habitat in airports, and therefore exert controls over bird population density, is to regulate the height of surrounding grasslands. The objective of this work was to record the seasonal use of habitat by birds in an airfield in Argentina, and to evaluate the effect of grassland height in the abundance of different components of the avian community. A total of 44 sampling events were carried out between October 2005 and July 2011, comprising all seasons. Short grassland areas (≤ 30 cm), registered 53 % of the total bird abundance, and were consistently for all seasons the most utilized habitat by those species that registered the highest abundances (e.g. Milvago chimango and Vanellus chilensis) and that pose a highest risk to aerial operations. In general, the species Patagioenas picazuro, Zenaida auriculata, Myiopsitta monachus and Sturnus vulgaris also made preferential use of short grassland areas rather than tall grasslands. Maintaining grassland areas at heights > 30 cm, might be a successful habitat manipulation strategy and represent a tool to control birds in South American airports. In turn, this would be a relatively simple and economic management strategy. © 2015, ALÖKI Kft.},

abstract={Knowledge of factors influencing animal abundance is important to wildlife biologists developing management plans. This is especially true for economically important species such as blackbirds (Icteridae), which cause more than $100 million in crop damages annually in the United States. Using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, the National Land Cover Dataset, and the National Climatic Data Center, we modeled effects of regional environmental variables on relative abundance of 3 blackbird species (red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus; yellow-headed blackbird, Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus; common grackle, Quiscalus quiscula) in the Prairie Pothole Region of the central United States. We evaluated landscape covariates at 3 logarithmically related spatial scales (1,000ha, 10,000ha, and 100,000ha) and modeled weather variables at the 100,000-ha scale. We constructed models a priori using information from published habitat associations. We fit models with WinBUGS using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Both landscape and weather variables contributed strongly to predicting blackbird relative abundance (95% credibility interval did not overlap 0). Variables with the strongest associations with blackbird relative abundance were the percentage of wetland area and precipitation amount from the year before bird surveys were conducted. The influence of spatial scale appeared small - models with the same variables expressed at different scales were often in the best model subset. This large-scale study elucidated regional effects of weather and landscape variables, suggesting that management strategies aimed at reducing damages caused by these species should consider the broader landscape, including weather effects, because such factors may outweigh the influence of localized conditions or site-specific management actions. The regional species distributional models we developed for blackbirds provide a tool for understanding these broader landscape effects and guiding wildlife management practices to areas that are optimally beneficial.

We compared the effects of 3 management responses to livestock depredation by wolf packs in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming: no removal, partial pack removal, and full pack removal. We examined the effectiveness of each management response in reducing further depredations using a conditional recurrent event model. From 1989 to 2008, we documented 967 depredations by 156 packs: 228 on sheep and 739 on cattle and other stock. Median time between recurrent depredations was 19 days following no removal (n = 593), 64 days following partial pack removal (n = 326), and 730 days following full pack removal (n = 48; recurring depredations were made by the next pack to occupy the territory). Compared to no removal, full pack removal reduced the occurrence of subsequent depredations by 79% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.21, P < 0.001) over a span of 1,850 days (5 years), whereas partial pack removal reduced the occurrence of subsequent depredations by 29% (HR = 0.71, P < 0.001) over the same period. Partial pack removal was most effective if conducted within the first 7 days following depredation, after which there was only a marginally significant difference between partial pack removal and no action (HR = 0.86, P = 0.07), and no difference after 14 days (HR = 0.99, P = 0.93). Within partial pack removal, we found no difference in depredation recurrence when a breeding female (HR = 0.64, P = 0.2) or ≥1-year-old male was removed (HR = 1.0, P = 0.99). The relative effect of all treatments was generally consistent across seasons (spring, summer grazing, and winter) and type of livestock. Ultimately, pack size was the best predictor of a recurrent depredation event; the probability of a depredation event recurring within 5 years increased by 7% for each animal left in the pack after the management response. However, the greater the number of wolves left in a pack, the higher the likelihood the pack met federal criteria to count as a breeding pair the following year toward population recovery goals. © Published 2015.

abstract={Adult mortality can be a major driver of population decline in species whose productivity is relatively low. Yet, little is known about the factors influencing adult survival rates in migratory bird species, nor do we know much about the longer-term effects of habitat disturbance on the fitness of individuals. The Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) is one of the vertebrate species most sensitive to forest management, yet it is still common and widespread. We monitored the fate of 330 colour-banded Ovenbird males in four pairs of 25-ha plots during 9 successive breeding seasons. One plot of each pair was treated through selection harvesting (30-40% basal area removed) during the first winter. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) higher physiological costs in harvested plots as a result of lower food abundance will reduce apparent survival rate (ASR) relative to controls; (2) lower ASR following years with low nest survival and higher probability of renesting; (3) fluctuations in ASR reflecting El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO); and (4) higher ASR in returning males than in recruits (unbanded immigrants) owing to greater site familiarity in the former. We tested the relative importance of these hypotheses, or combinations thereof, by generating 23 models explaining variation in ASR. The year-dependent model received the most support, showing a 41% decrease in ASR from 2007 to 2014. The important year-to-year variation we observed in ASR (Σwi=0.99) was not explained by variation in nest predation risk nor by ENSO. There was also little evidence for an effect of selection harvesting on ASR of Ovenbird males, despite a slight reduction in lifespan relative to males from control plots (2.7 vs 2.9 years). An avenue worth exploring to explain this intriguing pattern would be to determine whether conditions at migratory stopover sites or in the wintering area of our focal population have gradually worsened over the past decade. © 2014 Vernouillet et al.},

abstract={Stand-replacing fires are part of the natural disturbance regime that maintain jack pine ( Pinus banksiana Lamb.) forests of northern Lower Michigan. Currently, the occurrence and extent of wildfire is much reduced relative to the past and young jack pine plantations specifically managed for Kirtland's warbler ( Setophaga kirtlandii Baird) are a prominent feature on the landscape. Stringers, or patches of residual pre-fire forest, are a unique feature left behind after wildfires which are not often accounted for in plantation management. In this study, we examined the ecological value of stringers from an avian biodiversity perspective by comparing bird assemblages found within stringers to those in the surrounding forest (non-stringers). Our objective was to answer two research questions: (1) do stringers have unique bird communities relative to the surrounding vegetation (forest or plantation)?; and (2) how much of the variation in bird communities can be explained by differences in vegetation structure and composition between stringers and non-stringers? We conducted breeding and non-breeding season point counts and used abundance data to compare bird species found within stringers and non-stringers at seven sites grouped by time since disturbance. Species richness was significantly higher ( P = 0.01) in the stringers when the non-stringers were 30-40. years old, with 32 species discovered in the stringers and 29 species in the non-stringers. During the breeding season, bird assemblages differed between stringers and non-stringers when the non-stringers were <12 years old (multi-response permutation procedures; T = -10.11, A = 0.07, P = <0.00), but no differences were observed when non-stringers were 30-40 years old or >40. years old. Non-breeding bird communities differed between stringers and non-stringers only when the non-stringer was a recently planted (<5 years old) plantation ( T = -2.15, A = 0.09, P = 0.02). Differences in bird assemblages appear to be driven by the vegetation structure of stringers and non-stringers where fires were recent, but increasing similarity in vegetation structure occurs with time since fire; over time the importance of stringers for avian biodiversity is reduced. Our results suggest that stringers are important for bird communities, especially in recently disturbed areas, and that these biological legacies should be considered where jack pine management attempts to emulate natural patterns and processes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Complexity is increasingly the hallmark in environmental management practices of sandy shorelines. This arises primarily from meeting growing public demands (e.g., real estate, recreation) whilst reconciling economic demands with expectations of coastal users who have modern conservation ethics. Ideally, shoreline management is underpinned by empirical data, but selecting ecologically-meaningful metrics to accurately measure the condition of systems, and the ecological effects of human activities, is a complex task. Here we construct a framework for metric selection, considering six categories of issues that authorities commonly address: erosion; habitat loss; recreation; fishing; pollution (litter and chemical contaminants); and wildlife conservation. Possible metrics were scored in terms of their ability to reflect environmental change, and against criteria that are widely used for judging the performance of ecological indicators (i.e., sensitivity, practicability, costs, and public appeal). From this analysis, four types of broadly applicable metrics that also performed very well against the indicator criteria emerged: 1.) traits of bird populations and assemblages (e.g., abundance, diversity, distributions, habitat use); 2.) breeding/reproductive performance sensu lato (especially relevant for birds and turtles nesting on beaches and in dunes, but equally applicable to invertebrates and plants); 3.) population parameters and distributions of vertebrates associated primarily with dunes and the supralittoral beach zone (traditionally focused on birds and turtles, but expandable to mammals); 4.) compound measurements of the abundance/cover/biomass of biota (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates) at both the population and assemblage level. Local constraints (i.e., the absence of birds in highly degraded urban settings or lack of dunes on bluff-backed beaches) and particular issues may require alternatives. Metrics - if selected and applied correctly - provide empirical evidence of environmental condition and change, but often do not reflect deeper environmental values per se. Yet, values remain poorly articulated for many beach systems; this calls for a comprehensive identification of environmental values and the development of targeted programs to conserve these values on sandy shorelines globally. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Farmlands represent one of the most important habitats for several bird species in Europe, but during the last few decades, agricultural landscapes have been subject to a rapid and large-scale change, caused by the intensification and mechanization of agricultural activities, that is one of the main drivers of worldwide biodiversity decline. The high nature value farmlands (HNV) are characterized through three criteria: low-intensity farming, presence of residual semi-natural vegetation (hedgerows, uncultivated, shrubs, scattered trees, marginal uncultivated) and diversity of land cover mosaic; values that are often correlated with highest farmland bird diversity. In this work, we used Generalized Linear Models to evaluate the presence of different bunting species, typical of farmlands in Central Italy, as potential indicators of HNV of farmland and surrogates of landscape heterogeneity. Our results showed how the presence of bunting species is associated with markedly different environmental parameters. A species which could potentially be more useful for identifying HNV farmlands (more heterogeneous landscape, supporting also greater bird species richness) is the Cirl Bunting. The Corn Bunting and Ortolan Bunting were less predictive as indicators of farmland heterogeneity. Ortolan Bunting was unrelated to the complexity of farmlands and bird richness. This information is important for the planning of large-scale conservation policies and to increase our understanding of farmland bird indicators. © 2013 © 2013 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.},

abstract={Road building can lead to significant deleterious impacts on biodiversity, varying from direct road-kill mortality and direct habitat loss associated with road construction, to more subtle indirect impacts from edge effects and fragmentation. However, little work has been done to evaluate the specific effects of road networks and biodiversity loss beyond the more generalized effects of habitat loss. Here, we compared forest bird species richness and composition in the municipalities of Santarém and Belterra in Pará state, eastern Brazilian Amazon, with a road network metric called ‘roadless volume (RV)’ at the scale of small hydrological catchments (averaging 3721 ha). We found a significant positive relationship between RV and both forest bird richness and the average number of unique species (species represented by a single record) recorded at each site. Forest bird community composition was also significantly affected by RV. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between RV and forest cover, suggesting that road networks may impact biodiversity independently of changes in forest cover. However, variance partitioning analysis indicated that RV has partially independent and therefore additive effects, suggesting that RV and forest cover are best used in a complementary manner to investigate changes in biodiversity. Road impacts on avian species richness and composition independent of habitat loss may result from road-dependent habitat disturbance and fragmentation effects that are not captured by total percentage habitat cover, such as selective logging, fire, hunting, traffic disturbance, edge effects and road-induced fragmentation. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={To understand the ecological effects of forest restoration treatments on several old-growth forest stands in the Flathead National Forest of western Montana, USA, we surveyed birds at 72 points in treatment and control stands, and at more than 50 points in each of five potential reference stand conditions. We used a Before-After/Control-Impact design to assess treatment effects based on data collected 3. years before and 2. years after treatment. We also examined the similarity in bird community composition among all stand types by using a nonmetric multidimensional scaling approach. Relative abundances of only a few bird species changed significantly as a result of restoration treatments, and these changes were characterized largely by declines in the abundances of a few species associated with more mesic, dense-forest conditions, and not by increases in the abundances of species associated with more xeric, old-growth reference stand conditions. Thus, bird communities in treated stands were more similar to those in untreated stands of the same forest type than to those found in any of the potential old-growth reference stands. Although more time may be required for some bird species to respond to treatments, our results suggest that treatment plot sizes were either too small to affect bird communities or that the forest type selected for treatment was not within the range of forest types that are well suited for this type of forest restoration. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Census-based studies document changes in population size of animal species in response to wildfires, but mechanisms involving behavior of individuals and the effects on reproductive success are usually unknown. I developed a conceptual model explaining the persistence of cavity-nesting birds on the landscape after fires depending on carrying capacity (food supply) of the habitat and the philopatry and territoriality of the species. The breeding density, nest site characteristics, and reproductive success of Northern Flickers Colaptes auratus was studied before and after low- to moderate-severity fires on replicated plots. The density and spatial distribution of nests did not change in a consistent way after fires, but the rates of cavity excavation increased and characteristics of nest sites changed as such decay class of the tree. Laying dates were delayed and clutches were smaller in freshly excavated vs. reused cavities on the burned sites. Breeding philopatry caused a shift to older age classes in the population. Depredation of nests by small mammals increased during the first three years after fires, reducing the number of young produced per nest attempt on burned plots. The study shows that, even when fire does not reduce the density of breeding pairs, there may be detrimental effects detected only by monitoring the behavior and reproduction of individuals. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a species of conservation concern that is strongly associated with recently burned forests. Black-backed Woodpeckers are known to have variable home-range sizes, yet the ecological factors related to this variation have not been adequately explored and may hold insights into the natural history of the species and the management of its habitat. During 2011 and 2012, we radio-tracked Black-backed Woodpeckers nesting in 3 forested areas of California that burned between 2 and 5 years before the initiation of tracking. Among 15 individuals with robust tracking data, we found that home-range size varied by an order of magnitude, from 24.1 to 304.1 ha, as measured by movement-based kernel estimation. Using an information-theoretic approach, we evaluated the functional relationship between snag basal area-an a priori key resource-and home-range size, additionally controlling for sex, age, and years since fire as covariates. We found that snag basal area alone best predicted home-range size, explaining 54-62% of observed variation. As snag basal area increased, home-range sizes exponentially decreased. This relationship held true both with and without the inclusion of 3 individuals that nested in burned forest yet foraged predominantly outside the fire perimeter in unburned forest. Snag basal area, unlike other potential influences on home-range size, is an attribute that forest managers can directly influence. We describe a quantitative relationship between home-range size and snag basal area that forest managers can use to predict Black-backed Woodpecker pair density in burned forests and assess the likely population consequences of specific harvest treatments. Given that the birds in our study, foraging primarily in burned forest, all had home ranges with an average snag basal area ≥17 m2 ha-1, this may represent a benchmark for minimum habitat needs in postfire stands. © 2014 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={The density of shrubs is increasing in many dry grassland ecosystems worldwide. In the dry interior of the South Island, New Zealand, secondary succession generates novel woody communities, as shrubs colonise anthropogenic grasslands where fire frequency has decreased. The avifauna of this dry region is also novel, with many indigenous birds extinct, extirpated or uncommon, and exotic species predominant. We studied how succession from grassland to shrubland habitats affects the abundance of dryland birds, by estimating population densities of nine common exotic and indigenous passerine bird species in dryland habitats in grassland, mixed grassland-shrubland and shrubland, at three sites in Central Otago, South Island. We used distance sampling along line transects to estimate densities. Generally, succession from grassland to forest leads to decreased numbers of granivorous birds and feeding generalists, and increased numbers of insectivores. We therefore predicted that density of birds in five guilds would change as follows during succession to woodier habitats: (1) granivores: decrease, (2) a primarily ground-nesting, ground-feeding granivore-insectivore: decrease; (3) a tree- and shrub-nesting granivore-insectivore: increase; (4) ground-feeding insectivores: increase; (5) indigenous insectivores: increase. Our predictions were supported for only one guild. Yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella) (exotic primarily ground-nesting, ground-feeding granivore-insectivore that prefers open country) declined in density as woody-species frequency increased. Exotic European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) and common redpoll (C. flammea) (granivores) were most abundant at intermediate woodiness. Densities of other guilds did not vary consistently with woodiness. We conclude that continued succession to shrubland in Central Otago will have little effect on densities of many common exotic passerine birds, but may lead to local declines in yellowhammer, and ultimately goldfinch and redpoll. Our density estimates for silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) and grey warbler (Gerygone igata) were lower than densities reported in forests; therefore later stages of succession may benefit these widespread indigenous insectivores. © New Zealand Ecological Society.},

abstract={Large-scale plantations established for timber production or for carbon sequestration can dramatically transform landscapes, however little is known about the response of biodiversity. We report on trends in bird diversity during a 12. year longitudinal study on three large-scale plantations of locally indigenous eucalypts in northern New South Wales, Australia. The study began in a farmland mosaic and has continued to follow bird occupancy rates after the establishment of eucalypt plantations within the paddock areas. Bird surveys were undertaken at focal trees located in different classes of remnant vegetation, which became embedded within the plantations as well as in the plantation matrix itself. Reference sites were also located in adjacent blocks of forest. We found that species richness increased over time in the plantation matrix, as well as remnant vegetation embedded within the plantation (isolated trees, tree patches and remnants, but not riparian locations). When birds were classified as forest-dependent, forest-associated or mosaic generalist, the species richness of forest-associated birds increased and mosaic generalists decreased over time at selected remnant categories. Richness of forest-dependent birds did not change over time. After plantation establishment, bird composition at remnant locations gradually shifted towards that of forest, although all locations remained distinct from forest even after 11. years of plantation growth. The response of 36 individual species was assessed with 47% percent of species increasing over the 11. years and 31% of species declining. Notably the noisy miner, a hyper-aggressive species, decreased over time. We suggest a reduction in the occurrence of this species could be an important contributor to the increase in the diversity of smaller bird species. These include species of regional concern, such as the eastern yellow robin and the rufous whistler, which increased over the study period. Our results suggest that large-scale plantations of locally indigenous species contribute to ecological restoration of cleared landscapes. However, the plantation matrix after 11. years provided less suitable habitat than nearby forest as it supported fewer species, especially for birds that are characteristic of forest. Retention of remnant vegetation at the time of plantation establishment, including large isolated paddock trees, contributed considerably to the biodiversity present in the plantations and is likely to provide key refuge areas during any subsequent harvesting. Continued collection of longitudinal data are needed to describe changes through the full plantation rotation and harvest, while the extent to which other taxa respond to eucalypt plantation establishment also requires documentation. © 2014.},

abstract={Timber harvesting has been proposed as a management tool to enhance breeding habitat for the Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea), a declining Neotropical-Nearctic migratory songbird that nests in the canopy of mature eastern deciduous forests. To evaluate how this single-species management focus might fit within an ecologically based management approach for multiple forest birds, we performed a manipulative experiment using four treatments (three intensities of timber harvests and an unharvested control) at each of seven study areas within the core Cerulean Warbler breeding range. We collected pre-harvest (one year) and post-harvest (four years) data on the territory density of Cerulean Warblers and six additional focal species, avian community relative abundance, and several key habitat variables. We evaluated the avian and habitat responses across the 3-32m2ha-1 residual basal area (RBA) range of the treatments. Cerulean Warbler territory density peaked with medium RBA (~16m2ha-1). In contrast, territory densities of the other focal species were negatively related to RBA (e.g., Hooded Warbler [Setophaga citrina]), were positively related to RBA (e.g., Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapilla]), or were not sensitive to this measure (Scarlet Tanager [Piranga olivacea]). Some species (e.g., Hooded Warbler) increased with time post-treatment and were likely tied to a developing understory, whereas declines (e.g., Ovenbird) were immediate. Relative abundance responses of additional species were consistent with the territory density responses of the focal species. Across the RBA gradient, greatest separation in the avian community was between early successional forest species (e.g., Yellow-breasted Chat [Icteria virens]) and closed-canopy mature forest species (e.g., Ovenbird), with the Cerulean Warbler and other species located intermediate to these two extremes. Overall, our results suggest that harvests within 10-20m2ha-1 RBA yield the largest increases in Cerulean Warblers, benefit additional disturbance-dependent species, and may retain closed-canopy species but at reduced levels. Harvests outside the optimum RBA range for Cerulean Warblers can support bird assemblages specifically associated with early or late (closed-canopy) successional stages. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Grassland birds have experienced greater population declines than any other guild of birds in North America, and yet we know little about habitat use and the affects of management during their nonbreeding period on wintering grounds. The paucity of information on wintering grassland birds limits our ability to develop effective conservation strategies. We investigated habitat use by the winter bird community in grasslands with restored heterogeneity resulting from the interactive effects of fire and grazing. We used 500 m line transects distributed across patches (i.e., ,13, 13-24, and .24 months post disturbance) resulting from spring burning with growing season grazing (April-Sept) and quantified avian relative abundance, community structure, and probability of patch occupancy while accounting for imperfect detection. Grassland structure that resulted from the fire-grazing interaction created heterogeneity among patches that influenced avian habitat use during winter. Generalist birds such as the Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) were relatively common in all patch types while more specialized species such as the Smith's Longspur (Calcarius pictus) and Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii ) reached greatest abundance and probability of occupancy in the patches with the least and greatest time post disturbance, respectively. This research provides novel information on the response of wintering birds to restored ecological processes in grasslands and can improve efforts to create effective conservation strategies. Our findings add to a growing body of literature supporting the use of fire and grazing to create a shifting grassland mosaic that increases vegetation structural and compositional heterogeneity and maximizes native biodiversity within rangeland ecosystems through the conservation of natural patterns and processes.

abstract={Applications of remote sensing for biodiversity conservation typically rely on image classifications that do not capture variability within coarse land cover classes. Here, we compare two measures derived from unclassified remotely sensed data, a measure of habitat heterogeneity and a measure of habitat composition, for explaining bird species richness and the spatial distribution of 10 species in a semi-arid landscape of New Mexico.We surveyed bird abundance from 1996 to 1998 at 42 plots located in the McGregor Range of Fort Bliss Army Reserve. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values of two May 1997 Landsat scenes were the basis for among-pixel habitat heterogeneity (image texture), and we used the raw imagery to decompose each pixel into different habitat components (spectral mixture analysis). We used model averaging to relate measures of avian biodiversity to measures of image texture and spectral mixture analysis fractions. Measures of habitat heterogeneity, particularly angular second moment and standard deviation, provide higher explanatory power for bird species richness and the abundance of most species than measures of habitat composition. Using image texture, alone or in combination with other classified imagery-based approaches, for monitoring statuses and trends in biological diversity can greatly improve conservation efforts and habitat management. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Species adapted to cold-climatic mountain environments are expected to face a high risk of range contractions, if not local extinctions under climate change. Yet, the populations of many endothermic species may not be primarily affected by physiological constraints, but indirectly by climate-induced changes of habitat characteristics. In mountain forests, where vertebrate species largely depend on vegetation composition and structure, deteriorating habitat suitability may thus be mitigated or even compensated by habitat management aiming at compositional and structural enhancement. We tested this possibility using four cold-adapted bird species with complementary habitat requirements as model organisms. Based on species data and environmental information collected in 300 1-km2 grid cells distributed across four mountain ranges in central Europe, we investigated (1) how species' occurrence is explained by climate, landscape, and vegetation, (2) to what extent climate change and climate-induced vegetation changes will affect habitat suitability, and (3) whether these changes could be compensated by adaptive habitat management. Species presence was modelled as a function of climate, landscape and vegetation variables under current climate; moreover, vegetation-climate relationships were assessed. The models were extrapolated to the climatic conditions of 2050, assuming the moderate IPCC-scenario A1B, and changes in species' occurrence probability were quantified. Finally, we assessed the maximum increase in occurrence probability that could be achieved by modifying one or multiple vegetation variables under altered climate conditions. Climate variables contributed significantly to explaining species occurrence, and expected climatic changes, as well as climate-induced vegetation trends, decreased the occurrence probability of all four species, particularly at the low-altitudinal margins of their distribution. These effects could be partly compensated by modifying single vegetation factors, but full compensation would only be achieved if several factors were changed in concert. The results illustrate the possibilities and limitations of adaptive species conservation management under climate change. © 2014 Braunisch et al.},

abstract={In many regions, planned burns are implemented to reduce fuel loads and mitigate wildfire risk; increasingly, they are also used to achieve conservation outcomes. However, there is uncertainty regarding how best to apply fire to landscapes in order to enhance biodiversity. The assumption that variable fire regimes are conducive to biodiversity conservation is appealing given its basis in landscape ecological theory, which predicts that spatially complex landscapes sustain greater biodiversity. This supposition is often used as a basis for fire management but has rarely been tested in the context of fire. We sought to test predicted positive relationships between bird diversity and both landscape diversity and configuration in the fire-prone Otway Ranges, southeast Australia, where vegetation transitions from treeless heath to tall open eucalypt forest across a rainfall gradient. We used a whole-of-landscape sampling approach, and mapped fire age classes and vegetation types separately within thirty-six 300. ha landscape sampling units. Bird surveys were undertaken at sub-sampling locations during two successive years, and presence-absence data were used to generate landscape-level estimates of species richness and turnover. Generalized linear mixed models, model selection and model averaging were used to investigate how birds responded to landscape diversity and configuration across the rainfall gradient. Species richness was positively associated with age class diversity, age class configuration and vegetation type diversity. Species turnover was positively associated with age class diversity in areas of lower rainfall but exhibited a negative response in areas of higher rainfall. Neither response variable was associated with vegetation type configuration. This study is one of few landscape scale analyses to provide empirical support for the widely held assumption that spatially variable fire regimes can increase the diversity of faunal assemblages. Further, our results demonstrated consistency in responses of species richness to fire-mediated landscape complexity across a rainfall gradient. Managers can potentially increase bird species richness by increasing both the diversity of fire age classes, and the complexity of age class configuration, within relatively small (300. ha) areas. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Unburnt patches within a fire boundary may act as refuges for fauna, facilitating their survival and persistence within fire-prone landscapes. Unburnt patches can arise due to various processes, including topographic variation, fire behaviour, and fuel reduction from recent burning. However, the value of unburnt patches of differing characteristics to the post-fire persistence of faunal communities has rarely been examined. In this study, we examined the relative importance of fire history and severity in predicting the occurrence of birds in a burnt forest landscape. We conducted surveys in mixed eucalypt forest of south-east Australia, 2-3. years after a high intensity, landscape-scale wildfire (>200,000. ha). Sites (n= 91) were selected to encompass fire severity ranging from unburnt patches to stands of crown-burnt forest. Fire history prior to the wildfire was defined as short (<3. years) or long (>20. years) time-since-fire. Unburnt patches of long time-since-fire were important avian refuges, harbouring 20-40% more species, up to 56% more individuals and an assemblage that was distinct from that at all sites burnt by the wildfire, including low severity ground fire. No difference in species richness or composition was detected between sites in unburnt patches of short or long time-since-fire; but bird abundance was ~20% lower in patches of short time-since-fire. Unburnt and ground-burnt patches of short time-since-fire provided habitat for more species and had distinct assemblages from that of severely burnt sites. For sites severely burnt in the wildfire, there was no difference in avifaunal richness, abundance or composition between those burnt twice in rapid succession and those not burnt for >20. years. Together, these results highlight: (1) the particular importance of unburnt vegetation remaining within fire-affected areas as faunal refuges, and (2) the potential for recent planned burns to contribute to refuge habitat if it avoids severe burning in a subsequent wildfire. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Wildfire and mountain pine beetle infestations are naturally occurring disturbances in western North American forests. Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are emblematic of the role these disturbances play in creating wildlife habitat, since they are strongly associated with recently-killed forests. However, management practices aimed at reducing the economic impact of natural disturbances can result in habitat loss for this species. Although black-backed woodpeckers occupy habitats created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and mountain pine beetle infestations. Our finding that population growth rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the landscape. The lower growth rates in fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations may be attributed to differences in predator communities and food resources relative to summer wildfire.},

abstract={Monitoring programs designed to assess changes in population size over time need to account for imperfect detection and provide estimates of precision around annual abundance estimates. Especially for species dependent on conservation management, robust monitoring is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of management. Many bird species of temperate grasslands depend on specific conservation management to maintain suitable breeding habitat. One such species is the Aquatic Warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola), which breeds in open fen mires in Central Europe. Aquatic Warbler populations have so far been assessed using a complete survey that aims to enumerate all singing males over a large area. Because this approach provides no estimate of precision and does not account for observation error, detecting moderate population changes is challenging. From 2011 to 2013 we trialled a new line transect sampling monitoring design in the Biebrza valley, Poland, to estimate abundance of singing male Aquatic Warblers. We surveyed Aquatic Warblers repeatedly along 50 randomly placed 1-km transects, and used binomial mixture models to estimate abundances per transect. The repeated line transect sampling required 150 observer days, and thus less effort than the traditional 'full count' approach (175 observer days). Aquatic Warbler abundance was highest at intermediate water levels, and detection probability varied between years and was influenced by vegetation height. A power analysis indicated that our line transect sampling design had a power of 68% to detect a 20% population change over 10 years, whereas raw count data had a 9% power to detect the same trend. Thus, by accounting for imperfect detection we increased the power to detect population changes. We recommend to adopt the repeated line transect sampling approach for monitoring Aquatic Warblers in Poland and in other important breeding areas to monitor changes in population size and the effects of habitat management. © 2014 Oppel et al.},

abstract={Aim: To quantify bird responses to a large unplanned fire, taking into consideration landscape-level fire severity and extent, pre-fire site detection frequency and environmental gradients. Location: South-eastern Australia. Methods: A major wildfire in 2009 coincided with a long-term study of birds and provided a rare opportunity to quantify bird responses to wildfire. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we modelled bird species richness and the detection frequency of individual species in response to a suite of explanatory variables, including (1) landscape-level fire severity and extent (2) pre-fire detection frequency, (3) site-level vegetation density and (4) environmental variables (e.g. elevation and topography). Results: Landscape-level fire severity had strong effects on bird species richness and the detection frequency of the majority of bird species. These effects varied markedly between species; most responded negatively to amount of severely burned forest in the landscape, one negatively to the amount of moderately burned forest and one responded negatively to the total area of burned forest. Only one species - the Flame Robin - responded positively to the amount of burned forest. Relationships with landscape-scale fire extent changed over time for one species - the Brown Thornbill - with initially depressed rates of detection recovering after just 2 years. The majority of species were significantly more likely to be detected in burned areas if they have been recorded there prior to the fire. Main conclusions: Birds responded strongly to the severity and spatial extent of fire. They also exhibited strong site fidelity even after severe wildfire which causes profound changes in vegetation cover - a response likely influenced by environmental features such as elevation and topography. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={It has been suggested that provision of greenery can ameliorate the hostility of the urban environment for wildlife, but greenery can either be in the form of regenerating or remnant patches of natural vegetation, or as cultivated tree, shrub, and ground cover. We test if natural and cultivated greenery differed in their effects on bird and butterfly diversity in the tropical city-state of Singapore, while accounting for the effects of traffic density. Natural vegetation cover was positively correlated to both bird and butterfly species richness. Cultivated tree cover was positively correlated to bird species richness. Meanwhile, ground cover was weakly negatively correlated to bird species richness and overall cultivated greenery cover was weakly positively correlated to butterfly species richness. Increasing road lane density also negatively impacted both bird and butterfly species richness, while there was substantial evidence for an interaction effect between road lane density and cultivated tree cover on bird species richness. Cultivated and natural forms of greenery favoured different assemblages of bird and butterfly species. After controlling for the confounding effects of alpha diversity on community dissimilarity, cultivated greenery was found to produce homogeneous bird and butterfly communities in the urban landscape. Therefore, not all forms of greenery benefit urban biodiversity to the same extent. Management of urban areas to support bird and butterfly wildlife would need to maximise natural or semi-natural cover and only resort to highly-manicured, artificial greenery as a second option, while planning road networks carefully to optimize road lane density. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Birds both promote and prosper from forest restoration. The ecosystem functions birds perform can increase the pace of forest regeneration and, correspondingly, increase the available habitat for birds and other forest-dependent species. The aim of this study was to learn how tropical forest restoration treatments interact with landscape tree cover to affect the structure and composition of a diverse bird assemblage. We sampled bird communities over two years in 13 restoration sites and two old-growth forests in southern Costa Rica. Restoration sites were established on degraded farmlands in a variety of landscape contexts, and each included a 0.25-ha plantation, island treatment (trees planted in patches), and unplanted control. We analyzed four attributes of bird communities including frugivore abundance, nectarivore abundance, migrant insectivore richness, and compositional similarity of bird communities in restoration plots to bird communities in old-growth forests. All four bird community variables were greater in plantations and/or islands than in control treatments. Frugivore and nectarivore abundance decreased with increasing tree cover in the landscape surrounding restoration plots, whereas compositional similarity to old-growth forests was greatest in plantations embedded in landscapes with high tree cover. Migrant insectivore richness was unaffected by landscape tree cover. Our results agree with previous studies showing that increasing levels of investment in active restoration are positively related to bird richness and abundance, but differences in the effects of landscape tree cover on foraging guilds and community composition suggest that trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and bird-mediated ecosystem functioning may be important for prioritizing restoration sites. © 2014 Reid et al.},

abstract={The impact of different cutting dates on two dominant groups of ground-dwelling arthropods (carabids and spiders) was assessed. Short-term impacts were assessed by comparing them before and after cutting. Arthropods were collected by pitfall traps located in three plots with different cutting dates between June and August and one uncut control plot. Trapping was performed during a 4-month period in the spring and summer 2011. In total, 26,392 spiders and 12,278 carabids, representing 56 and 82 species respectively, were collected. Overall, the effects of cutting were negative and mostly visible in the long term for carabids, with reduced abundances and species richness in cut plots, and in the short-term for spiders; several parameters (proportion of predators and polyphagous species, and body length) decreased after cutting while remaining stable in the control. Long-term cutting effects revealed almost no differences between plots cut at different dates whereas the short-term effects decreased slightly over time, with respect to the overall phenology of both groups. In conclusion, this study underlines the fact that cutting has drastic effects on ground-dwelling arthropods, and even late dates, which are supposedly positive for other animals like breeding birds, are deleterious for highly diverse and species-rich grassland groups. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Thresholds in response by cavity-nesting bird populations to variations in the snag resource are poorly understood. In addition, limited information exists on the value of artificially created snags for cavity-nesting birds. Therefore, uncertainty exists in whether artificially created snags can yield a positive population response among snag-dependent birds. We used an experimental approach to assess the abundance and territory dynamics of a primary cavity nester, the red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), in response to three snag density treatments over an 8-year period following treatment installation in 2001. Treatments included snag removal, an unmanipulated control, and a snag pulse (snags experimentally created at 14 times control density). During the first two years post-treatment, abundance of red-headed woodpeckers did not differ among treatments. In 2004, woodpecker abundance in snag pulse plots surpassed that of other treatments and continued to increase until it peaked in 2007 (at nearly 6 times than on control plots), after which it declined but remained greater than on control plots through 2009. Increased woodpecker abundance in high snag density areas was facilitated primarily by a decrease in home range size. Because the red-headed woodpecker is negatively affected by very low snag densities, yet is capable of exploiting pulses in the snag resource by dramatically increasing its abundance, we conclude that snag density regulates populations of this primary cavity nesting species and that snag creation can be an important tool in its conservation. © 2014.},

abstract={Cocoa and coffee are among the most valuable tropical crops, with much of their production in areas of high biodiversity. Although this could suggest a conflict between agricultural expansion and biodiversity conservation, these crops are normally grown in shade plantations-a more biodiversity-friendly agroforestry system. Using São Tomé Island as a case study, we examined if shade plantation can benefit biodiversity by protecting extinction-prone island endemic species. We found that shade plantations held rich assemblages, even in comparison with forest: we estimated 30 bird and 74 tree species occurring in plantations compared to 24 bird and 108 tree species in forests. However, the structure of the assemblages was significantly different between ecosystems, with an average dissimilarity of 33.8 percent and 87.9 percent for birds and trees, respectively. Shade plantations had consistently less endemic species than the forest; we estimated a drop from 17 to 13 in birds and from 17 to 3 in trees. We also found that despite marked differences in the response of bird species to the vegetation characteristics of shade plantations, there was a strong positive link between aboveground tree biomass and endemic species richness and abundance. These results show that shade plantations hold assemblages impoverished in endemic species, but that management can improve their value for the conservation of these species. Finally, we suggest that biodiversity-friendly certification and carbon markets are used to implement and guarantee the long-term economical sustainability of practices that favor the endemic species in São Tomé's shade plantations. © 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract={Anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation affect populations worldwide. For example, many bird populations of boreal forests have declined due to intensive forestry. To target conservation actions for such species, determining the key factors that affect their habitat selection is essential. Remote sensing methods provide highly potential means to measure habitat variables over large areas. We aim at identifying the key-features of habitats by utilizing remote sensing data. As a case example, we study the nest site selection of a primary hole-nesting passerine, the willow tit Poecile montanus, in a managed forest landscape. Using presence-absence data, we determine the most important habitat characteristics of the nest sites for three spatial scales by generalized linear mixed effect models. Our results highlight the importance of the availability of nesting sites - standing decaying deciduous trees - in the nest site selection of P. montanus. It seems to prefer moist habitats with high densities of deciduous trees and to avoid open areas, but does not require mature or intact habitats. Most of the nest site selection seems to occur within small scales. In this case, remote sensing data alone was insufficient for producing reliable models, but adding information of an ecologically important feature from direct field surveys greatly improved model performances. For the conservation and maintenance of dead wood dependent species, changes in forestry practices are necessary to keep the key characteristics of the habitat. Most importantly, continuous availability of standing decaying wood should be secured. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Commercial trade of wild birds may devastate wild bird populations. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) controls the trade of wild species listed in its appendices to avoid these species being threatened by international trade. China used to be one of the major trading countries with significant bird trade with foreign countries; on the other hand, China is a country with unique avian fauna, many Important Bird Areas and critically endangered bird species. What is the role of the country in world wild bird trade? What kind of insights can we extract from trade records for improving future management of wild bird trade in the country? We retrieved and analyzed international trade records of the CITES listed bird species of China from 1981 to 2010 from the CITES Trade Database maintained by United Nations Environment Program and World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC). We found that: (1) International trade of live birds in China peaked during the late 1990s, then decreased to the level before the surge of trade in a few years, the trade dynamics of wild birds may be affected by governmental policy and the outbreak of avian influenza during the period. (2) Most frequently traded CITES Appendix listed birds in China were parrots, most of which were exotic species to the country. (3) Birds were mainly traded for commercial purpose. Exotic birds in trade were mainly captive-bred while the most Chinese birds traded internationally were captured from the wild. Since many bird species in international trade are threatened to extinction, China should take stricter measures on importing of wild-captured birds and should collaborate with the countries of original in the international bird trade to avoid unsustainable harvesting of wild birds. It is urgent for China to carry out population surveys on those domestic bird species once in significant international trade and to make better conservation decisions based on population status of those birds. In addition, more scientific researchers should be encouraged to participate in the wildlife trade management to avoid misreporting trade data or biased analyses of the trade records. © 2014 Li, Jiang.},

abstract={We investigated the effects of local habitat structure and surrounding landscape characteristics (proportion of land use types and connectedness) on species density and composition of bird communities inhabiting the interior of young tree plantations on former cropland in central Spain, which were motivated by the Common Agrarian Policy. Variation of species density (number of species/0.78 ha) among tree plantations showed different environmental associations across seasons: local habitat was more important than landscape characteristics during winter, whereas they were similarly important during spring. Species density increased with the development of the tree layer in winter and with the presence of urban areas around tree plantations and cover of the herbaceous layer within them in the breeding season. We identified 15 species that exhibit high relative abundance in woodland habitats within the Mesomediterranean region of Central Spain that were absent in both seasons in the studied tree plantations, which were an attractive habitat for urban exploiter species but an unfavorable habitat for the regional forest species pool except for forest generalist species. Composition of bird assemblages was more related to local habitat structure than to landscape characteristics around tree plantations and was rather similar in winter and spring seasons. The very different effects of local habitat and landscape characteristics on bird communities make difficult suggesting management practices with positive effects for all avifauna species during the entire year. We conclude that the small size and low maturity of the studied tree plantations do not contribute to enhancing the bird diversity value of current CAP aids to afforest former cropland with pines in the Mediterranean region. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Conifer plantations are thought to provide lower-quality habitat for many old forest specialists because of their simplified stand structure and relative paucity of habitat elements such as dead wood. However, at the landscape scale, plantations may have a positive influence on biodiversity, e.g. through landscape supplementation. Here, we test the quality of older spruce plantations as breeding habitat for forest birds at local and landscape levels. We compared bird species assemblages of 40-50. year-old native spruce plantations with those of mature, naturally-regenerated conifer forests using a Bayesian hierarchical model, which accounts for imperfect detection of species. Median species richness was higher in naturally-regenerated conifer stands than in spruce plantations (29.2 vs. 24.4; 95% probability interval. = 3.9-5.7), which probably reflects the absence of primary cavity nesters from many stations within plantations. In contrast, more species of canopy nesters were detected in plantations. The proportion of naturally-regenerated conifer forest in the landscape was a predictor of species occurrence for five ground nesters, four primary cavity nesters, and two weak excavators. Older spruce plantations did not provide suitable habitat for some species, mainly cavity nesters. Snag densities in plantations were lower than the estimated threshold requirements for several cavity-nesting birds. Hence, mature, naturally-regenerated forest patches are essential components of intensively-managed forest landscapes to maintain rich forest bird assemblages. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n=28 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n=19 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n=27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian framework (n=5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n=16 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n=8 in habitat created by MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat (mean home range size=79ha) and 2-year post fall prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size=143ha). Home range size was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size=307ha) and was greatest in 3-4year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home range size=430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size=460ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200ha by exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in summer wildfires &lt;200ha and retaining at least 50% of summer wildfires &gt;400ha. Ideally, recently burned forest patches should be composed of ≥27m2 basal area/ha of trees that burned at moderate or high severity, with at least 40% of the basal area composed of trees ≥27cm DBH. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Habitat modification and invasive species are significant drivers of biodiversity decline. However, distinguishing between the impacts of these two drivers on native species can be difficult. For example, habitat modification may reduce native species abundance, while an invasive species may take advantage of the new environment. This scenario has been described as the driver-passenger model, with 'passengers' taking advantage of habitat modification and 'drivers' causing native species decline. Therefore, research must incorporate both habitat modification and invasive species impact to successfully investigate native species decline. In this paper, we used the common myna (Acridotheres tristis) as a case study to investigate the driver-passenger model. We investigated changes in bird abundance, over 2 years, in relation to different habitat types and common myna abundance. We hypothesized that the common myna is both a passenger of habitat change and a driver of some bird species decline. Our results indicated that the abundance of many native species is greater in high tree density nature reserves, while the common myna was uncommon in these areas. Common myna abundance was almost three times higher in urban areas than nature reserves and declined rapidly as tree density in nature reserves increased. Our findings indicated that the common myna is primarily a passenger of habitat change. However, we also observed negative associations between common myna abundance and some bird species. We stress the importance of simultaneously investigating both invasive species impact and habitat modification. We suggest habitat restoration could be a useful tool for both native species recovery and invasive species control. Understanding the drivers of native species decline will help inform impact mitigation and direct further research. © 2013 The Authors. Austral Ecology © 2013 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract={Savanna and woodland were once common in the Midwest, but land use changes have led to increasing scarcity of these communities. These transitional habitats are being restored across the Midwest, but few studies have evaluated the response of wildlife to restoration or the vegetative gradient created by management. We conducted point counts for 25 songbirds at sites undergoing savanna or woodland restoration and nearby non-managed forest sites across the Ozark Highlands of Missouri during the 2009-2011 breeding seasons; these sites represented a gradient of canopy cover and tree density from savanna to woodland to forest. We estimated density of 17 species with ≥50 detections using distance-based models, which adjust estimates by the detection probability. Bird densities were more strongly related to habitat structure, fire history, and landscape composition than simply whether a site was managed or non-managed. Mature forest species such as Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), Northen Parula (Setophaga americana), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceous), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum) were generally more abundant at points with more trees, higher canopy cover, lower shrub density, and less frequent or no fire in the 20. years prior to surveys. Woodland generalists such as Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens), Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus), Summer Tanager (Piranga rubra), and Yellow-billed Cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus) were generally more abundant at points with less landscape forest cover (10-km scale), more large and fewer small trees, intermediate to high canopy cover, lower shrub density, and recent or frequent fire. Early-successional species such as Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa), Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor), White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus) and Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) were generally more abundant at points with lower canopy cover, recent or frequent fire, and higher shrub density. Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were more abundant at points with intermediate landscape forest cover and lower canopy cover. Restored sites provided breeding habitat for woodland generalists and early-successional species of conservation concern; however, managed landscapes with more open canopy and herbaceous ground cover may be required for species more indicative of open savannas. © 2013.},

abstract={This study examined the effects of burrow digging and habitation by the European badger (Meles meles) and the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) on soil properties and the plant community. The vegetation of control plots located in a similar but undisturbed habitat was compared with that of 18 burrow plots established at badger setts (N = 9) and fox dens (N = 9) in a lowland forest area in Poland. Soil physicochemical properties at different disturbance levels (mounds, intermounds and reference areas) were also investigated. The animals altered nutrient availability in the burrow plots considerably by excavating material from deep soil horizons that were less acidic and higher in K, Ca, Mg and available P but poorer in C and N. The effect was stronger for the badger, probably because it displaced larger amounts of material and disturbed wider areas. The activity of the two carnivores induced similar changes in plant communities. They increased herbaceous species richness and caused a shift in the herbaceous species composition: versus the control plots, the burrow plots contained more fugitive species (short-living plants typical for disturbed environments), among which ruderal forbs, including nutrient-demanding species, dominated. The carnivores also increased the species richness of fleshy-fruited shrubs and trees. The primary reason for this was probably not burrowing but endozoochorous seed dispersal. Overall, the results indicate that the badger setts and fox dens differ significantly from the forest matrix in terms of soil and vegetation parameters, and that they contribute to habitat heterogeneity and biological diversity. © 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract={Capsule A specific suite of moorland management prescriptions had no clear positive impact on breeding birds over ten years.Aims To test the expectation that a combination of grazing, and burning/cutting manipulations, the blocking of drains (affecting habitat quality and foraging resources) and the control of some predators (affecting survival and breeding success) will lead to an increase in numbers of breeding birds on 9.5km2 of moorland in Scotland.Methods General Additive Modelling was used to compare bird population trends at the managed site against a control of moorland-specific background trends (spatially and temporally smoothed) derived from an extensive UK-wide bird monitoring programme. Changes in vegetation, the effectiveness of predation control and influences of disturbance were also examined to attempt to identify potential mechanisms for population size changes.Results Breeding populations for most species showed either a more negative trend at the managed site (Red Grouse, Skylark and Meadow Pipit) or no significant difference was detected (European Golden Plover, Eurasian Curlew, Common Snipe and Winter Wren) when compared to moorland-specific background trends. Stonechats and Carrion Crows increased, despite the latter being actively removed as part of predation control measures. No general change in the vegetation was detected and no reasonable habitat-based cause for the observed declines in some species was apparent. There was also no convincing evidence for a negative effect on moorland birds of disturbance from a nearby mine. As crow control failed to stem their increase and with supportive evidence for a decline in the breeding success of Red Grouse, it is suggested that the control of predation was ineffective and may have contributed to some species declines.Conclusion There has been wide advocacy of, and considerable resources (e.g. through agri-environment schemes) devoted to, moorland habitat management for birds and yet declines continue. However, there are practical difficulties of establishing management that is effective in increasing moorland bird abundance. It appears likely that in areas where those birds are vulnerable to predation and its control is not effective, expectations of increasing bird populations in response to habitat management alone may be unrealistic. © 2014 British Trust for Ornithology.},

abstract={Over the last 30 years, ecological networks have been deployed to reduce global biodiversity loss by enhancing landscape connectivity. Bird species dwelling in woodland habitats that are embedded in agriculture-dominated landscapes are expected to be particularly sensitive to the loss of connectivity. This study aimed to determine the role of landscape connectivity in woodland bird species richness, abundance, and community similarity in north-east Brittany (north-west France). An exhaustive woodland selection protocol was carried out to minimize the effects of woodland size on the response variables. Connectivity of the woodland and forest network in the study area was evaluated using graph-theory, accounting for matrix permeability, and a characteristic median natal dispersal distance at the community level based on the bird species pool recorded in the sampled woodlands. Information-theoretic model selection, controlling for woodland size in all the cases, depicted the response of woodland birds at the community level to the connectivity of agriculture-dominated landscapes. On average, the sampled woodlands (n = 25) contained 15.5 ± 2.4 bird species, with an abundance of 25.1 ± 3.9, and had highly similar bird communities (species composition and proportion); eight species represented 57% of total abundance and were present in at least 22 woodlands. The performance of models improved when using effective, rather than Euclidean, interpatch distances in the connectivity assessment. Landscape connectivity was only significantly related to similarity of proportional species composition. Large woodlands contained communities with more similar species proportions in an inhospitable agricultural landscape matrix than in a more permeable one. Woodland size was the most relevant factor determining species abundance, indicating that the bird population sizes are primarily proportional to the local habitat availability. Connectivity in relation to landscape matrix permeability did not seem to induce the flow of woodland-dependent bird species that are dominant in the community but rather of matrix-dwelling bird species that are less dependent on woodland patch area. In conclusion, both habitat conservation and restoration (i.e., amount and quality), in combination with permeable landscape structures (such as heterogeneous land cover mosaics), are advocated for community level conservation strategies. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.},

abstract={Rangeland birds in the Southern High Plains, USA evolved within a context of fire and grazing (i.e., pyric herbivory), a disturbance regime that played a dominant role in shaping rangelands in this region but has been absent since the 1880s. A management technique known as patch-burn grazing was used to mimic the heterogeneity in vegetation created by the historical disturbance regime of fire and grazing in sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia) rangelands. We compared nest survival of Cassin's sparrows (Peucaea cassinii), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), and lark sparrows (Chondestes grammacus); species richness; and densities of 11 bird species between rangelands managed with patch-burn grazing and rangelands managed with traditional management (i.e., seasonal grazing) in Oklahoma from 2006 to 2008. Estimates of nest survival were similar between patch-burn and traditional pastures (Cassin's sparrows: 51% and 57%; field sparrows: 18% and 22%; and lark sparrows: 14% and 12%, patch-burn and traditional, respectively). Species richness was higher in patch-burn pastures compared to traditionally managed pastures. Densities of the majority of avian species (73%) were similar between treatments; however, lark sparrow densities were 5 times more abundant in patch-burn pastures and grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were >3 times more abundant on traditional pastures. Our results suggest that introducing patch-burn grazing management to sand sagebrush rangelands is not detrimental to nesting shrubland birds, and the creation of heterogeneity through patch-burn grazing can increase avian species diversity. Furthermore, some species such as lark sparrows may benefit from patch-burn grazing. Patch-burn management may be an important tool to assist in the recovery of biodiversity in this ecosystem. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Encroachment of woody plants is widespread in semiarid grasslands of the southwestern United States. Wildlife responses to shrub removal techniques in the region are relatively unknown. In 2008 and 2009, we examined avian responses to prescribed burning of ungrazed shortgrass prairie within a study area (4811 ha) near Amarillo, Texas, that is heavily encroached by honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and cholla (Opuntia spp.). Specifically, we compared relative abundance, species richness, and species diversity of breeding birds across large, spatially replicated experimental plots burned every 2 or 4 years since 2002 and unburned controls. We found no significant differences in the mean relative abundance of most species across the treatments. However, Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), Cassin's Sparrow (Peucaea cassinii), and Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) were more abundant in less frequently burned plots and unburned controls. We found no differences in species richness or diversity across the treatments. Limited variation in avian responses across the treatments likely reflects the uniform pattern of vegetation structure we found across the plots, despite repeated application of prescribed fire at 2- and 4-year intervals over a 7-year period. Differences in bird species assemblages among the burn treatments might be more prominent in future years as prescribed burning continues. © 2014.},

abstract={Farmland biodiversity dramatically declined in Europe during the 20th century. Agri-environment schemes (AES) were introduced in the late 1980s in European Union countries as a solution to combat biodiversity decline. We examined the effectiveness of AES in enhancing biodiversity in a new EU member country (Estonia) over the period of 2010-2012. We compared species numbers and abundance of bumblebees and birds, plus cover of flowers, between three farming systems in two regions of Estonia. Farm types included conventional and two under AES (organic and a less strict environmentally friendly management agreement). Environmentally friendly management practices in Estonia include diversified crop rotations, at least 15% of arable land (including rotational grasslands) under legumes, permanent grassland strips, protection of landscape elements, reduced applications of agrochemicals, etc. The two selected regions (North and South) differed in landscape structure, soil types and crop yields. Flower cover and bird species richness and abundance without the dominant species (skylark) were higher on organic farms. Bumblebee species richness was significantly higher under both types of AES than under conventional farming. Flower cover, abundance and species richness of bumblebees and birds were significantly higher in the more heterogeneous landscapes of Southern Estonia. Environmentally friendly management may be a viable alternative to organic farming for a widely accepted, simple but large-scale greening of agricultural landscapes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Wooded habitats represent hotspots of urban biodiversity, however, urban development imposes pressure on biota in these refuges. Identification of the most influential habitat attributes and the role of local urban characteristics is crucial for proper decisions on management practices supporting biodiversity. We aimed to identify well manageable fine-scale habitat attributes to suggest specific, feasible and affordable management recommendations for green space in cities. We analysed species richness of woodland-associated bird communities and incidence of individual species at 290 sites in a wide variety of green areas scattered across the city of Prague, Czech Republic. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and regression tree analyses were used to identify site-scale (100 m radius sampling sites) and local-scale (200 m and 500 m radius plots) habitat attributes shaping the bird communities at individual sites. Logistic regression was used to assess the responses of individual species to habitat characteristics. Our results imply that at the site scale, management practices should focus on maintenance and promoting species-diverse and older tree stands, with a mixture of coniferous and deciduous trees. Water-bodies and accompanying riparian habitats should be maintained and carefully managed to preserve high-quality remnants of natural vegetation. Presence of a few old trees (about 12 % of tree cover with DBH > 50 cm) or small urban standing water and watercourses enrich the bird community by at least two species. Species richness of woodland avifauna at particular sites is further supported by the total amount of tree cover in the surroundings, including scattered greenery of public spaces and private gardens. We conclude that proper management at site scale has the potential to increase biodiversity of the urban environment. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Woody plant encroachment into grasslands is a global concern. Efforts to restore grasslands often assume that removal of woody plants benefits biodiversity but assumptions are rarely tested. In the Chihuahuan Desert of the Southwestern United States, we tested whether abundances of grassland specialist bird species would be greater in plant communities resulting from treatment with herbicides to remove encroaching shrubs compared with untreated shrub-dominated areas that represented pre-treatment conditions. In 2010, we surveyed breeding birds and vegetation at 16 treated-untreated pairs. In 2011, we expanded the survey effort to 21 treated-untreated pairs, seven unpaired treatment areas, and five reference grassland areas. Vegetation in treatment areas had higher perennial grass foliar and basal cover and lower shrub foliar cover compared with untreated areas. Several regionally declining grassland specialists exhibited higher occurrence and relative abundance in treated areas. A shrubland specialist, however, was associated with untreated areas and may be negatively impacted by shrub removal. Bird community composition differed between treated and untreated areas in both years. Our results indicate that shrub removal can have positive effects on grassland specialist bird species, but that a mosaic of treated and untreated areas might be most beneficial for regional biodiversity. © 2014 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={River restoration projects are increasingly common, but assessments of ecological responses and overall success of the vast majority of efforts are lacking. Information on potential positive ecological effects of restoration efforts can be used to justify further projects and refine methods. We examined responses of multiple trophic levels, aquatic insects and riparian birds, to a series of rock weirs installed in an Illinois river to stabilize the channel. We quantified adult insect emergence and performed weekly point counts of birds in spring at four weir and four non-weir (control) sites. Emerging insect abundance was higher at control sites, but species richness and diversity were higher at weir sites. Total insect emergence production did not differ between site types, but emergence production of larger-bodied taxa was higher at weir sites. Ordinations and analysis of similarity indicated differences in insect and bird assemblages between site types. Birds showed a positive numerical response to large-bodied emerging insects, and total bird abundance was higher at weir sites. Clutch size and feeding rates of a focal bird species, Prothonotaria citrea (Prothonotary Warbler), did not differ between sites, but the number of hatchlings and fledglings was higher at control sites. Molothrus ater (cowbird) parasitism was higher at weir sites, likely because of increased edge habitat associated with weir construction activities. Results show positive ecological impacts of in-stream restoration and provide justification for further efforts. However, forest disturbance associated with construction could offset some benefits to some species, and thus refinements to procedures may be necessary. © 2013 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={Ecological impacts of habitat change on woodpeckers remain largely unstudied in regions other than Europe and North America. The sub-Himalayan sal Shorea robusta forests of northwest India have 17 woodpecker species, and a history of management-induced habitat modification. We studied how habitat parameters affect woodpeckers at a community level (viz. total abundance and species richness) as well as at individual species level. We assessed woodpecker abundance, species richness and described habitat features at 8 sites representing a gradient of structure and composition in a sal-dominated landscape. We surveyed each site in 2-km-long transects 20 times over breeding and non-breeding seasons and evaluated habitat characteristics in 10 circular and belt plots. We analysed woodpecker abundance, species richness, and abundance of individual species as functions of habitat variables and season. Woodpecker encounter rates and mean species richness, respectively, ranged from 1.5 to 10.0 birds/km and 1.7 to 6.9 species per survey at individual sites. Distance-based estimates of densities for the most frequently-observed species were also obtained. Basal area (large trees) and density of snags positively influenced total woodpecker abundance and species richness, with snags being more important during breeding season. Basal area was important for Greater Flameback Chrysocolaptes lucidus, Grey-faced Woodpecker Picus canus, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker Dendrocopos macei and Lesser Yellownape Picus chlorolophus. Snags, tree density, tree diameter and termitarium density appeared to affect Greycapped Pygmy Woodpecker Dendrocopos canicapillus, Black-rumped Flameback Dinopium benghalense, Himalayan Flameback Dinopium shorii and Streak-throated Woodpecker Picus xanthopygaeus. Hence, for the conservation of native woodpecker communities in sal forests, it is necessary to retain large trees and standing dead wood.},

abstract={Ecological theory predicting the impact of fire on ecological communities is typically focused on post-disturbance recovery processes or on disturbance-diversity dynamics. Yet the established relationship between vegetation structure and animal diversity could provide a foundation to predict the short-term effects of fire on biodiversity, but has rarely been explored. We tested the hypothesis that fire effects on bird assemblages would be moderated by increasing vegetation structure. We examined bird assemblages in burnt and unburnt sites at 1 and 6 years after a wildfire, and compared richness and composition responses among and within three structurally distinct vegetation types in the same landscape: heath, woodland and forest. We found that short-term changes in bird assemblage composition were largest in simple heath vegetation and smallest in complex forest vegetation. The short-term change in species richness was larger in forest than in heath. We also found that among-site assemblage variability was greater shortly after fire in heath and woodland vegetation compared with forest vegetation. Our results indicate that complexity in vegetation structure, particularly overstorey cover, can act as an important moderator of fire effects on bird assemblages. Mechanisms for this response include a greater loss of structure in vegetation characterised by a single low stratum, and a proportionally greater change in bird species composition despite a smaller absolute change in species richness. We discuss our results in the context of a new conceptual model that predicts contrasting richness and composition responses of bird assemblages following disturbance along a gradient of increasing vegetation structure. This model brings a different perspective to current theories of disturbance, and has implications for understanding and managing the effects of fire on biodiversity in heterogeneous landscapes. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Agroforestry for production and ecosystem health is a centuries-old form of ecosystem management used in many cultures indigenous to Mesoamerica, yet implications of such practices for biodiversity conservation are not well understood. Agroforestry systems were studied using interviews of farmers and field surveys of tree and bird diversity in three communities surrounding the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Campeche, Mexico to examine how differences in forest management practices affect forest biodiversity. Tree diversity and bird species richness were higher in areas surrounding communities that generated a greater variety of forest products and that cultivated "restoration trees," species planted to aid in regeneration of mature forest. We conclude that traditional ecosystem management methods in areas surrounding natural reserves as practiced by inhabitants who depend on resources in the reserve for survival are compatible with maintaining and perhaps enhancing diversity of bird and tree communities at the site level. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Forest fragmentation results in a loss of forest interior and an increase in edge habitat. As a result, these changes may affect the bird species distribution and composition. We studied how understorey bird community composition and habitat variables changed along an edge-to-interior gradient in a fragmented lowland rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia. Birds and environmental variables were recorded at each of the 93 sampling points distributed along the 14 parallel transects that were systematically placed across the gradient of distance from the forest edge to the forest interior. Species composition was different along the edge-interior gradient, although only a few species were strictly confined to either edge or interior habitat. Based on bird-habitat associations along the edge-interior gradient, some of these edge-preferred species occurred in high numbers at the matrix surrounding the patch. In contrast, the interior-specialist group, mainly terrestrial insectivores, avoided the forest edge and was positively associated with humidity, canopy cover, the number of dead trees, percentage of litter cover, and depth of the litter layer. Species endemic to the Sunda subregion were more abundant in the interior of the forest. From a conservation perspective, forest remnants in the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia that have a deep leaf litter layer, dense canopy cover, high number of dead trees, and high relative humidity are able to support understorey bird species that are sensitive to edge effects. The forest has important conservation value even though it is fragmented and isolated. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Ecosystem functionality is an increasingly important objective of ecological restoration. Despite this, a few studies have rigorously assessed reproductive functionality within restored plant populations, and it is largely assumed that pollinators follow restoration of plant communities-"build it and they will come." Here, we applied an ecological genetic approach to determine the impact of spatial separation on mating in Banksia menziesii (Proteaceae), a dominant bird-pollinated species of Banksia woodlands of Western Australia. All plants at three post-mining restored sites (n = 72 [13 years old], n = 21 [8 years old], and n = 20 [9 years old]), as well as a sample from an adjacent natural reference site (n = 42), were genotyped at nine microsatellite loci. Seed set, mating system parameters, realized pollen dispersal through the assignment of paternity to seed, and avian pollinator species composition, abundance and behavior, were assessed. All patches displayed equivalent heterozygosity (He = 0.53-0.59) and very weak genetic divergence (FST ≤ 0.01). Seed of plants within restored sites showed complete outcrossing and relatively high seed set, 26% of which were sired by pollen donors located beyond the local patch. Similar abundance and movement of nectar-feeding birds was observed in restored and natural sites, despite lower bird species diversity in the restored site, where a smaller, less aggressive species was dominant. Our results demonstrate the restitution of wide outcrossing in these restored Banksia patches within an active mine-site, and suggest that restored bird-pollinated Banksia populations are resilient to human impacts, due largely to their generalist pollinator requirements and highly-mobile avian pollinators. © 2014 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={Context: The remaining riparian stretches are often the unique suitable habitats for forest breeding birds in Mediterranean landscapes undergoing long-term changes. Understanding the interactions between riparian zones and their surroundings is critical to establish successful management actions. Aims: We assessed the influence of surrounding matrix on riparian bird communities and the use of riparian galleries as surrogate habitats for the forest passerine communities of southwestern Iberia. Methods: We used point counts in three simultaneous sampling stations, one in the riparian gallery and two in the adjacent matrix. Three matrix types were selected with a decreasing tree density gradient: dense montado, sparse montado, and open agricultural areas. Data were analysed with redundancy analysis and differences in species' occurrences were tested with one-way ANOVA. Results: In riparian galleries, we found bird species belong to three ecological guilds: riparian, woodland, and edge guilds. The richness of bird guilds and the occurrence of some species depended on the surrounding matrix type. Riparian bird richness was constant in all surrounding matrices, woodland bird guild was richer in galleries embedded in dense montados, and edge guild in riparian galleries surrounded by sparse montados. Five among 19 assessed species were influenced by matrix type, within particular a few strictly riparian species. Species richness increased close to riparian galleries, due to the increase in habitat heterogeneity and resource availability for birds in densely vegetated riversides. However, the occurrence of some bird species differed according to the type of surrounding matrix. Conclusion: The matrix type explained most of the variance in riparian bird assemblages. Some woodland birds have used riparian galleries as surrogate habitat. Our study suggests that land use in the surrounding matrices must be taking into account for the management and rehabilitation of watercourses and bird conservation actions. © 2012 INRA / Springer-Verlag France.},

abstract={Wetland restoration is increasingly important to reverse habitat degradation, recover ecosystem services, and maintain biodiversity. To aid project design, more information is required on the influence of wetland size, depth of water, and isolation on the waterbird communities that become established. During a restoration project in Doñana, one of the Europe's most important wetland complexes, an experimental network of 96 temporary ponds with standard shape but variable size, water depth, and isolation was created. We surveyed the waterbird community in spring from 2006 to 2008 and related species abundance and richness to abiotic pond characteristics. We also performed analyses pooling species by foraging guilds or body size. Waterbird abundance and species richness were highest in 2007, the wettest year when the ponds had longer hydroperiods. Larger ponds had consistently higher abundance and species richness for the entire community and for different guilds and body sizes. Moreover, the density of birds per hectare was higher in large ponds than in the smaller ones. Pond isolation and excavated depth did not affect overall abundance and richness, although opposing effects of depth were observed on some size classes, and ducks and large birds preferred isolated ponds. Some bird groups preferred ponds at a particular location. This is the first waterbird study to address the importance of pond size, depth, and isolation independently of confounding variables such as pond shape. It illustrates the varied responses from different bird groups and demonstrates the importance of varying depth, location, and isolation to enhance community abundance and diversity. © 2014 Society for Ecological Restoration 22 3 May 2014 Published 2014.},

abstract={In central Argentina, Serrano forest has a long history of fire disturbance; however, the impact of fire on avifauna remains unknown. We compared the avian-habitat relationships in forest patches with low, moderate, and high fire regimes using a community-level (species richness, abundance, ordination and guilds) and species-level (indicator species analysis) approach. In patches under each fire condition, we recorded bird community composition, richness and abundance, and different vegetation structure variables. The site under high-severity fire regime was structurally poor and had been converted from original forest to dense grassland. There, diversity of bird community was low, retaining approximately 30 % of the species present in the least impacted site. Avian assemblage was dominated by generalist and open area birds. Guilds were underrepresented, showing an important reduction of foliage granivorous, nectarivorous, omnivores, and foliage and bark insectivorous, and absence of fly-catchers. Moreover, low abundance of forest understory, midstory, and canopy species and of birds belonging to open and closed nesting guilds was detected. By contrast, under low and moderate-severity fire regimes highest bird diversity as well as highest representativeness of most guilds was observed. Forest bird species were strongly associated with low fire disturbance, whereas moderate fire disturbance was characterized by the presence of forest and generalist species. Given the critical conservation status of Serrano forest in Córdoba, Argentina, habitat restoration and protection of forest relicts could be suitable measures to promote avifauna preservation. © 2013 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer Japan.},

abstract={Dikes were built on Great Lakes coastal wetlands to enable water level management for wetland wildlife, particularly waterfowl, but few studies have compared bird use of these areas to undiked sites. During 2005-2007, we evaluated 9 diked and 7 undiked coastal wetlands at the St. Clair Flats (Lake St. Clair) and Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron) of Michigan, USA. We compared bird use of diked and undiked wetlands via 605 10-minute point counts at randomly selected locations of emergent marsh and 287 45-minute surveys of randomly selected open water areas. We also measured wetland characteristics in 1,521 randomly selected 0.25-m2 quadrats to compare vegetation and physical conditions between diked and undiked wetlands. Diked wetlands had greater coverage and density of cattail (Typha spp.), coverage of floating-leaved plants, water depth, and organic sediment depth compared to nearby undiked sites, whereas undiked wetlands had greater coverage and density of common reed (Phragmites australis) and bulrush (Schoenoplectus spp.) than diked wetlands. Bird species richness and similarity indices indicated comparable breeding bird communities. We observed greater abundances of Canada goose (Branta canadensis), wood duck (Aix sponsa), American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), and common gallinule (Gallinula galeata) in diked wetlands. These species likely responded to the deep-water cattail marsh and aquatic bed dominating most diked sites. American coot (Fulica americana), Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri), ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis), and herring gull (Larus argentatus) abundance indices were greater in undiked wetlands, likely related to nesting and foraging habitat provided by the shallower, more open wetlands and connecting lakes. Diked wetlands did not benefit the bird community to the degree expected and conditions in diked areas were indicative of deep marshes with stabilized water levels. Periodic late-summer drawdowns could encourage growth of plants we found associated with greater abundance of some priority bird species and reduction of floating vegetation negatively associated with abundance of several species. However, effective control of invasive common reed is needed to reduce risk of expansion during impoundment dewatering. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={A study was carried out to find the local status and population count of selected passerine birds species in Lahore during 2008. Comparison was made by relating the population density of passerine birds with reference to flora of 3 old and 3 new sites in and around Lahore. The results of the study revealed that the changing habitat of Lahore due to human disturbance and non-availability of breeding sites for birds was the main reason behind the loss of passerine avian diversity. Secondly, the trend of planting decorative or ornamental plants such as Eucalyptus in Lahore was the key factor forcing birds to migrate. Relative abundance of native trees and density of observed passerine bird species was higher in old reference sites rather than in newly established parks of Lahore city because new parks in the city have highly disturbed habitat and more exotic tree varieties. Results of the present study revealed that one of the new parks, woodland wildlife park outside the city is still providing the natural habitat to birds due to less human disturbance. So there is dire need to build such parks which have more natural environment. Conservation of passerine avian diversity within city area can be progressed by managing the urban green space and plantation of native flora. After completion of study, it was recommended that only ecological restoration of damaged habitat at Lahore can turn back the tide of biodiversity loss.},

abstract={Human activity can dramatically affect biodiversity, often by introducing non-native species, or by increasing the abundance of a small number of native species. Management strategies aimed at conserving biodiversity need to be informed by the actual impacts of highly abundant species, whether native or introduced. In this study we examined characteristics of two bird species, introduced common mynas and native noisy miners, both of which are highly abundant in urbanised areas along the East coast of Australia. Current managerial practices have a strong focus on eradication of common mynas, while noisy miners are largely ignored. However, in this study noisy miners were found in a broader range of habitats, and in greater abundance, than common mynas; displayed more aggressive behaviour; and were linked to a decline in the diversity and abundance of other species where common mynas were not. We suggest that the adaptability of a species and the variety of habitats it can colonise may be a better predictor of its potential impact, than whether it is native or introduced. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The awareness of the importance of deadwood in forest ecosystems has increased in recent decades. Today, dead wood is recognized as a key factor affecting diversity of forest communities. Hole-nesting birds and saproxylic organisms represent an active part of the animal community through the recycle of decaying wood into the forest soils. Three relict beech forests of central Italy were surveyed for both saproxylic beetles and hole-nesting birds, using two different types of interception traps for the former group and point count method for the latter. The variables of dead wood quality were recorded from ten plots, particularly the decaying class and typology of all the wood debris with a diameter ≥ 5 cm. In order to correlate richness and abundance of beetles and birds in a symmetric way, we used co-inertia analysis (CoIA). To correlate in a predictive way the dead wood attributes (dead wood typology and class decay) with birds and beetles assemblages we used partial redundancy analysis (RDA). Our results showed a significant relationship between saproxylic beetle and hole-nesting bird communities. Three dead wood variables (the volume of standing dead trees, stumps and large branches on the ground) appeared to be good predictors of saproxylic beetle richness while the volume of standing dead tree and of dead trees on the ground were the same for hole-nesting birds. These results suggest specific recommendations useful for forest management and planning. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.},

abstract={Convergence of species composition in regenerating harvested areas and naturally disturbed forest is a critical component of forest management modeled after natural disturbances. We assessed convergence of birds, plants, and habitat structures in aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands harvested with structural retention by Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc. (Al-Pac) 15 years ago with similar aged fire area, and examined a chronosequence of younger and older burned aspen stands from Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) sites. Most habitat structures and many bird and plant species in the 15 year harvest areas were at levels similar to 20-40 year or >40 year fire areas. Snags, moss, and lichen cover, and a few groups of species were at lower levels in the harvest areas than comparable aged fire areas or older stands. Agglomerative clustering showed the plant community to be most similar to >40 year burned stands, with the bird community intermediate between >20 year and <20 year fire areas. A novel likelihood-based analysis of species estimated the 15 year harvest areas to have a community similar to forest sites with 36.8% human footprint, indicating substantial recovery of the harvest areas. Harvesting aspen stands with structural retention appears to be effective at allowing most biodiversity components to recover rapidly.},

abstract={Bio-indicators are often proposed to set conservation priorities in forest habitat owing to the difficulties of determining forest intrinsic ecological value. Here, we tested the efficacy of a number of potential bird indicator groups in monitoring beech Fagus sylvatica forest status by analyzing their associations with the spatial and structural variables of forest vegetation that indicate key ecological patterns and processes. The density of cavity nesting birds, indicating the presence of limited forest resources (resource-limited indicators), was influenced by tree species diversity, vertical species mingling and diameter, parameters reflecting maturity, gap-dynamic processes, as well as resource and shelter availability. Heterogeneity in shrub species composition, another parameter depending on forest dynamics, was positively associated with the occurrence of Capercaillie, a “flagship” species for forest conservation. The presence of woodpeckers, a “keystone” group that provides shelter and foraging substrate to other organisms, was positively affected by the basal area of standing dead trees that is indirectly associated with natural nutrient availability. These findings suggest that single indicators fail to provide a complete assessment of forest status, and their use in monitoring or managing forest ecosystem need to be contextualized to specific ecological patterns. The combined use of several indicators, representing various taxa, functions and life histories, appears to be preferable, and is logistically feasible if these can be surveyed together. Several indicators would likely display a wider range of sensitivities to the modification of natural processes and permit more comprehensive tracking of forest dynamics than single flagship, keystone or resource-limited indicators. © 2014, The Ecological Society of Japan.},

abstract={Genetic diversity is the fundamental level of biological diversity. In the discussion of biological diversity in agricultural ecosystems, this level is of major importance, but often neglected. Tools for the direct measurement of genetic diversity, especially in highly diverse systems such as permanent grassland, are demanding and the relationship between genetic diversity and management practices or environmental factors is poorly understood. Genetic diversity of the common grassland species Dactylis glomerata was assessed using genetic diversity indices based on 29 SSR markers. Phenotypic diversity within and among selected populations was evaluated in a replicated field experiment based on ten phenotypic plant characters of agronomic relevance. Twenty populations of D. glomerata from permanent grassland from the Swiss Alps were included in the analysis. We investigated correlations between genetic diversity (genotypic/phenotypic) and farming system (conventional/organic), management intensity (intensive/extensive), three plant species diversity indices, five ecological and five habitat parameters at collection sites. Genetic and phenotypic variability within and among populations of D. glomerata was large. The intensive management of permanent grassland reduced genotype diversity and genetic variation of the plant character 'flowering time', while conventional farming systems increased the average expected heterozygosity within populations of D. glomerata. Populations from extensively managed sampling sites accommodated significantly smaller D. glomerata individuals. SSR markers and phenotypic characters proved to be valuable tools for the assessment of genetic and phenotypic diversity considering different perspectives. Management parameters were the main factors influencing genotypic diversity and phenotypic characteristics in natural populations of D. glomerata in permanent grassland. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Over the last century, logging, land conversion, and fire suppression have reduced longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystems to a small fraction of their original range. Fire suppression, in particular, has facilitated encroachment by non-fire-tolerant trees and heavy litter buildup, leading to shifts in the native plant and animal community. In 2001, efforts were initiated to re-establish parts of Berry College's (Floyd County, GA) fire-suppressed mountain longleaf pine forest using combinations of prescribed fire, clear-cutting, planting, and herbicide application. We designed this study to determine the effects of management practices thus far on vegetation structure and the bird community. In 2009, vegetation structure data were collected in longleaf pine stands comprising three management classes ranging from low- to high-intensity management. Bird surveys were conducted from summer 2009 to spring 2010, and avifaunal community structure was related to vegetative characteristics within each stand. Unmanaged stands were strongly associated with common omnivorous, ground-foraging, and canopy-nesting birds of mixed woodlands. Intermediately managed stands contained mostly birds of mixed diet and aerial- and bark-feeding cavity nesters. Heavily managed stands were strongly associated with insect-, vertebrate-, seed-, and fruit-eating ground and shrub nesters, with several sightings of the near-threatened Bachman's sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis Lichtenstein). Intensity of management was positively correlated with canopy openness, understory development, and low litter levels. These vegetative differences helped explain the bird community makeup. We provide baseline data for assessing the impacts of management of mountain longleaf pine and similarly fire-suppressed forests on avian abundance and species richness.},

abstract={The Samcheok forest fire of April 2000 was the biggest stand-replacing fire recorded in Korea, and led to the largest-scale salvage logging operation (performed until 2005) ever implemented. We investigated the effects of the treatments performed after the fire on the breeding bird community in 2002-2005 (the management period) and 2006-2008 (the post-management period). A total of 75 line transect surveys resulted in 660 detections of 54 species in undisturbed stands (CO), in burned and naturally restored stands (NI), and in burned and logged stands (IT). Four species (Parus major, Aegithalos caudatus, Dendrocopos kizuki, and Parus ater) were identified as indicator species in CO which showed no temporal changes in bird communities and habitat structure. Among the various stand treatments, the standardized species richness was highest in CO (11.6 ± 4.6 species/transect in 2002-2005, 12.1 ± 3.5 in 2006-2008), and this richness did not change over time. On the other hand, low richness was observed in NI (6.8 ± 2.6 in 2002-2005, 9.6 ± 2.3 in 2006-2008), and the lowest richness was seen in IT (5.0 ± 2.4 in 2002-2005, 6.1 ± 1.8 in 2006-2008), but both of these increased over time. Although the bird abundances in NI and IT were lower than those in CO (38.0 ± 27.7 birds/transect in 2002-2005, 31.3 ± 10.9 in 2006-2008), the abundances in NI (15.1 ± 8.6 in 2002-2005, 17.6 ± 11.4 in 2006-2008) and IT (11.7 ± 8.3 in 2002-2005, 10.0 ± 4.6 in 2006-2008) were not significantly different. There was no significant difference in abundance between time periods for any of the stand treatments. These results imply that NI (i.e., no salvage logging) allows greater bird richness but not abundance to be recovered compared to IT. No indicator species was consistently present in NI throughout the two time periods covered due to the rapid regrowth of vegetation, but four open-habitat dwellers (Falco tinnunculus, Phoenicurus auroreus, Emberiza cioides, and Sturnus cineraceus) colonized IT during the post-management period. The bird assemblage in IT, as assessed by canonical correspondence analysis, shifted to open habitats, while the avifauna in NI became similar to that in CO over time. While post-fire treatment can provide new colonization opportunities for open-habitat dwellers, the slow colonization process, the low species richness, and the low bird abundance observed in large areas of IT indicate that post-fire treatment using salvage logging inhibits the restoration of forest bird communities by producing a poorer breeding bird community that is very different from the original one. Based on these lessons from the response to the Samcheok forest fire, we suggest that preserving as much of the disturbed forest as possible is essential, and that the current approach to post-fire treatment-intensive salvage logging-needs to be revised to ensure the effective restoration of breeding bird communities in disturbed temperate pine forests. © 2012 International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering and Springer Japan.},

abstract={Population declines of several successional-scrub bird species are partly associated with decreased habitat availability as abandoned farmlands return to forest and recently harvested forests regrow. Restoration of mixed-oak (Quercus spp.) forest is also a concern because of widespread oak regeneration failure, especially on moist, productive sites where competition from faster-growing tree species is fierce following stand-replacing disturbances. Several silvicultural methods are proposed to promote oak regeneration but many are not experimentally tested, especially on productive sites. We surveyed birds in 19 stands to assess response to initial application of three proposed oak regeneration treatments on productive sites: prescribed burning (B); oak shelterwood by midstory herbicide (OSW); shelterwood harvests (SW); and controls (C), for one breeding season before, and two breeding seasons after, implementation. Relative density of successional-scrub species Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), Eastern Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), and Chestnut-sided Warblers (Setophaga pensylvanica) increased, while Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) decreased within 11 to 18 months after SW harvests; understory disturbance treatments B or OSW had no effect. Our results indicated that partial harvests created habitat for breeding birds associated with both young and mature forests, whereas understory treatments had little effect. Additionally, we show that even small patches of young forest habitat are used by more individuals and more species of breeding birds than surrounding closed-canopy forest, and may benefit successional-scrub species by enabling their occurrence in an otherwise forested landscape. Absence of several lower-elevation successional-scrub bird species in our mid-elevation SW harvests suggests that comprehensive conservation in the southern Appalachians necessitates creating and maintaining young forest habitats across elevation gradients.},

abstract={Industrial timber plantations severely impact biodiversity in Southeast Asia. Forest fragments survive within plantations, but their conservation value in highly deforested landscapes in Southeast Asia is poorly understood. In this study, we compared bird assemblages in acacia plantations and fragmented forests in South Sumatra to evaluate each habitat's potential conservation value. To clarify the impact of habitat change, we also analyzed the response of feeding guild composition. Five habitat types were studied: large logged forest (LLF), burnt logged forest (BLF), remnant logged forest (RLF), 4-year-old acacia plantation (AP4), and 1-year-old acacia plantation (AP1). Estimated species richness (Chao 2) was highest in LLF then AP4 and BLF, while AP1 and RLF had lower estimated species richness. Community composition was roughly divided into two groups by non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination: acacia plantation and logged forest. Sallying substrate-gleaning insectivores, such as drongos, broadbills, and some flycatchers, were restricted to LLF, whereas acacia plantation hosted many terrestrial frugivores, such as doves. Although fragmented forests in our study site lacked several common tropical forest species, these fragments provide an important habitat for some sallying and terrestrial insectivores. A network of small riparian remnant forests could be a complementary habitat for some species, while the conservation value of burnt forest might be low. In conclusion, the highly fragmented forests in plantations are suboptimal habitats for birds but are still very important, because large primary forest blocks have been nearly lost in the surrounding landscape. © 2014 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

abstract={Energy extraction within forest habitat is increasing at a rapid rate throughout eastern North America from the combined presence of conventional oil and gas, shale gas, and wind energy. We examined the effects of conventional oil and gas development on forest habitat including amounts of core and edge forest, the abundance of songbird species and guilds, species diversity, and community similarity within and between mixed hardwood and oak forest types at both individual wells (local scale) and at the 25-ha scale at differing levels of well density: reference (0 wells/site, 0 wells/km2), low (1-5 wells/site, 4-20 wells/km2), and high (10-15 wells/site, 40-60 wells/km2). Amount of cleared area, length of roads, and amount of edge increased with increasing well density, whereas amount of core forest declined. At high well densities, 85% of the study site remained forested, but the mean amount of core forest declined from 68% to 2%. Specific changes to forest structure associated with oil and gas development included decreases in basal area and canopy cover within 20 m of individual wells and with increasing well density. Of 19 species analyzed, 5 species, including ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Blackburnian warbler (Setophaga fusca), and black-throated green warbler (Setophaga virens), had lower abundance at well sites than reference sites at either the local or 25-ha scale. Six species including American robin (Turdus migratorius), chestnut-sided warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were more abundant at well than reference sites. Eight species did not differ in abundance between well and reference sites. All 3 songbird guilds showed distinct patterns of abundance in relation to habitat differences resulting from oil and gas development that were consistent with known fragmentation effects. Forest interior species were less abundant at well sites than reference sites and showed a declining trend with increasing well density. In contrast, the guilds of early successional species and synanthropic species were more abundant at well sites than reference sites as was species richness (alpha diversity). Avian communities differed between northern hardwood and oak forest types at reference sites but became more similar when wells were present at both scales, suggesting biotic homogenization or a loss of beta diversity occurred as similar species were attracted to well sites in both forest types. The bird communities associated with northern hardwoods and oaks still retained their unique characteristics at low well densities but became similar at high well densities suggesting a threshold somewhere between the low and high well density sites. Consequently, we recommend that if well development is to occur in extensively forested landscapes, conventional oil and gas well development be limited to a maximum of 20 wells/km2 to minimize impacts to forest birds. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={The New Guinea alpine-subalpine zone is the highest, largest, and wettest such region on any tropical island and it preserves great variations in biodiversity between the individual mountain areas. Relatively few plant species are confined to the alpine zone and this may reflect a limited time for adaptation by herbaceous species arriving in the formerly extensive alpine-subalpine biome. In the Pleistocene a zone above 3400 m was affected by glaciation while open subalpine habitat was greatly expanded by cooler climates and low levels of CO2 which hindered the formation of subalpine forest. With post-glacial warming, the subalpine contracted and open areas were invaded by shrublands and forest. Early to late Holocene opening out of the subalpine forest and shrublands is associated with fire that was a result of hunting by humans. This process starts early in some areas but is late or absent on more remote areas. The alpine is threatened by increased warming and potential invasion by emergent shrubs but is likely to prove resilient to extinction provided that wet conditions continue to prevail. Changing cultural use of high altitudes suggests that the subalpine shrublands are recovering in some areas. However, some mammals and bird species seem to have been lost or become restricted on mountains that are accessible from population centers at lower altitude. With few exceptions, management consists of benign neglect although widespread fires in 1997-1998 point to continuing human impacts linked to drought events. The large mine on Mount Jaya influences subalpine usage over a large area. Tourism is very minor and unlikely to expand while political problems affect both Papua New Guinea and Papua province and logistics remain a severe difficulty. However, locally managed tourism on Mount Wilhelm provides a good model for future development. © 2014 Regents of the University of Colorado.},

abstract={Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a rare habitat specialist typically found in moderate and high severity burned forest throughout its range. It also inhabits green forest but little is known about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas, especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011 - 2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since 1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects, number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest, and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05 and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in efforts to conserve this rare species. © 2014 by the author(s).

abstract={Compositional indicators (i.e. indices that focus on the identity of species, genes or phylogeny) have been widely used to estimate and monitor biodiversity, however, their use in combination with species and/or community functional characteristics remains limited. Using large-scale, spatio-temporal data, we use both compositional and functional indices to investigate land-use change impacts on the vegetation of a semi-natural grassland ecosystem (Machair) for fourteen regions in Scotland, UK. Our study aimed to identify national- and regional-scale temporal vegetation patterns, and through use of simple compositional and functional indices (e.g. Competitor, Stress, Ruderal and Ellenberg scores) link observed changes to agricultural intensification and/or land-use abandonment. Using linear-mixed modelling and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling, we showed significant national and regional-scale changes in species composition over time. Increases in diversity, particularly gains in Machair grassland, identified several regions that may have benefited from past government incentivised schemes to protect the Machair, but which may also be suffering from an extinction lag. Shifts in plant functional signatures (CSR & Ellenberg values) identified varying degrees of internal (competition) and external (land-use) factors, highlighting several regions where biodiversity change could be linked to reduced disturbance (i.e. lower grazing intensity) or greater disturbance (i.e. land-use intensification). Our results demonstrate the utility of simple compositional and functional indices for monitoring biodiversity of semi-natural grasslands and identifying land-use drivers of change across different spatial scales. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Occupying less than 7 % of Earth's land surface, tropical rain forests harbor perhaps half of the species on Earth and are ecologically, economically, and culturally crucial for issues in global food security, climate change, biodiversity, and human health. Geographically located between the latitudes 10°N and 10°S of the equator, lowland tropical rain forest ecosystems share similar physical structure but vary in geology, species composition, and anthropogenic threats across the forests of Southeast Asia, Australia, Africa, and Central and South America. Mature tropical rain forests are stratified by multiple canopy and understory layers, and physiognomic properties include evergreen broadleaf tree species, a preponderance of species with large leaves to aid with sunlight capture in the light-limited understory, and leaf properties such as entire margins and drip tips that channel water efficiently from the leaf surface. Lianas are increasing in abundance and biomass in a number of tropical rain forests. The additive effects of an increase in liana biomass are correlated with a reduction in tropical forest carbon (C) storage, a value that is currently not considered in global vegetation models. Most rain forest tree species do not grow, flower, or fruit year-round. Peaks in leaf flushing, flowering, and fruiting coincide with the high irradiance and low water stress associated with the onset of the wet season. This synchrony is common and largely driven by resource availability, though biotic explanations for synchrony include selection to attract pollinators or seed dispersers and to avoid herbivory and seed predation. With few exceptions, species richness across the tree of life is highest in equatorial tropical regions and decreases towards the poles. Tropical rain forests harbor approximately two thirds of the estimated 350,000-500,000 extant flowering plant species on Earth, with high rates of endemism and large numbers of rare species. Numerous evolutionary and ecological hypotheses to explain the origin and maintenance of high biological diversity in tropical forests have garnered support and include biogeographic history, evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation and speciation, range size and distribution constraints, and ecological mechanisms promoting species coexistence. Continental drift, climate constraints, and long-distance dispersal are responsible for some of the similarities and differences in species across tropical regions. Familial similarity among forests in Amazonia and Southeast Asia can be as high as 50 %, while independent diversification and species radiation mean that much fewer genera (around 10 %) are shared. Gradients in climate, parent material and soil age, topography and landscape stability, and atmospheric deposition result in strong heterogeneity in soil nutrient availability from local to regional scales. Soil order, which is generally correlated with soil fertility as a strong predictor of aboveground net primary productivity in tropical forests. Tropical forests account for approximately 40 % of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP), store half of Earth's vegetative C stocks but less than 10 % of its soil C stocks. The relationships between rainfall, temperature, soil fertility, and NPP are complex and require more experimental manipulations to tease apart the interactions. Intact tropical forests are net C sinks, but the uptake of C (1.1 ± 0.3 Pg C year-1) in intact tropical forests is counteracted by the emissions from tropical biome conversion - a net C source to the atmosphere of 1.3 ± 0.2 Pg C year-1 that results in a tropical biome net C balance of approximately zero. Stronger El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effects are increasing the frequency and severity of droughts, fires, hurricanes and cyclones, and flooding events. Recovery of aboveground biomass, species composition, and forest structure all depend on the type and severity of disturbance and its effect on soil fertility. Greater use of remote sensing imagery from satellites, airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, and unmanned drones will allow accurate tracking of disturbance and C stocks as well as monitoring of phenology, foliar canopy chemistry, individual species identification, and biodiversity estimates from local to regional scales. The tropical biome is undergoing significant change. Understanding the drivers and impacts of these changes will require sustained advances across multiple disciplines. Ultimately as a society, we are left asking what is the capacity of our remaining and regrowing tropical rain forests to adapt to long-term anthropogenic and climate change and what can we do to moderate these effects while nourishing a healthy human population. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.},

abstract={Population declines of birds that breed in early-successional shrubland habitat are of great concern to conservationists throughout the northeastern United States. To help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of efforts to conserve these species and their habitats, we studied birds in temporary forest openings created through even-aged timber harvest, and permanent wildlife openings maintained through mechanical treatment and prescribed burning in the Northern Appalachians, USA in 2010 and 2011. We assessed the effects of treatment method, time since last treatment, and retained tree cover on shrubland bird abundance and habitat conditions. Burned and mechanically treated wildlife openings differed only in grass and fern cover. Both types of wildlife openings had more grasses and forbs, and less bare ground than silvicultural openings. Six out of 8 focal bird species were less abundant in silvicultural openings than in wildlife openings. In contrast, abundance of only 1 species differed between burned and mechanically treated wildlife openings. Silvicultural openings supported the same species as wildlife openings, indicating that this management option could be used in place of more costly wildlife opening management. However, because birds were more abundant in wildlife openings, maintaining the current population size of shrubland birds under a management strategy based entirely on silviculture would require a 50-300% increase in the area of silvicultural openings, depending on the species. Individual species peaked in abundance at different times post treatment, indicating that managers must maintain a range of early-successional conditions across the landscape to provide habitat for the entire suite of shrubland birds. Six species exhibited a negative relationship with the basal area of retained conifer cover, and 7 species with deciduous tree cover, indicating that the retention of overstory trees in openings reduced their utility to early-successional birds. © 2014 The Wildlife Society, 2014. © The Wildlife Society, 2014.},

abstract={In this paper we present the abundance, distribution, nest-site characteristics and habitat analysis of woodpecker species in managed forests. The studied territory is part of a Special Protection Area for bird species. We found breeding evidence of six of the eight sedentary woodpecker species from Romania: Greyheaded- (Picus canus), Green- (Picus viridis), Great Spotted- (Dendrocopos major), Middle Spotted- (Dendrocopos medius), White-backed- (Dendrocopos leucotos) and Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius). The most abundant was the Middle Spotted Woodpecker. Middle Spotted-, Green- and Great Spotted Woodpeckers excavated nest-holes most commonly in oak (Quercus petraea), Black Woodpeckers in beech (Fagus sylvatica), Greyheaded Woodpeckers in aspen (Populus tremula). White-backed Woodpeckers used only oaks as nest-trees. Weak excavators selected large trees, dead trees or soft woods for nesting, but most of the species used primarily live trees for excavation. The average diameter of nesting tree, tree height, nest height and relative nest height did not increase with the body size of the woodpecker species. Nearest neighbor analysis indicated that the local distribution of woodpecker species in most forest fragments differs from randomness. Great Spotted Woodpeckers and Black Woodpeckers presented uniform distributions, while Middle Spotted Woodpeckers aggregated distribution. Tree diameter and diversity, relative abundance of oak and aspen but also altitude affected woodpecker abundance. Black Woodpecker and Middle Spotted Woodpecker presence depends on large trees and diversity of trees. The results will contribute to forest restoration operations. © NwjZ, Oradea, Romania, 2014.},

abstract={Species intolerant to fire, defined as lacking adaptations needed to establish dominance in a frequently burned landscape, are found within fire-prone ecosystems globally. Such species are frequently targeted for reduction or eradication to further conservation or restoration of biological diversity because the dominant paradigm in restoration of fire-dependent communities is to reduce the dominance or eliminate fire-intolerant invaders. To explore this paradigm, we examined the role of oaks (Quercus spp.) within fire-dependent upland and sandhill longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems of the southeastern United States. These pine-oak ecosystems have among the highest levels of biodiversity in the temperate zone. This diversity is inextricably linked to a frequent fire regime and includes many species readily top-killed by fire, particularly oaks, which were common in the early settlement landscape. In examining the diversity of oak species found within longleaf pine ecosystems, we identify a group of pyrophytic oaks and show that these oaks are critical components of sandhill and other longleaf pine ecosystems, and their occurrence should be considered as part of conservation and restoration goals. Providing a better understanding of the ecological role of such species will benefit conservation management and strategic planning in fire-prone southeastern ecosystems and more broadly where fire is used as a management tool. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={After circa 35 years of drainage and intensive arable tillage, the lower Skjern River, Denmark was re-engineered to its original meanders and flooding regime, creating 22 km 2 of lakes, shallow wetlands and seasonally flooded grazed wet grassland costing €38million. The primary motivation was to restore the sediment/nutrient retention capacity of the river valley to reduce eutrophication of Ringkøbing Fjord at its efflux. Secondary objectives were to (i) restore breeding and staging bird habitat, (ii) enhance the self-sustaining Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar population and (iii) improve recreational and tourist activities. Despite lack of specific success criteria, breeding waterbird numbers increased from 134 ± 22.9 SE (n = 3) pairs before to 1,744 ± 153 SE (n = 5) after restoration (although on average 1,004 of these were Black-headed Gulls Chroicocephalus ridibundus), species richness and diversity also increased. Twenty-nine waterbird species returned to breed, 10 of national or international significance (Danish Red List/European Union Birds DirectiveAnnex 1 species) now ranking Skjern River amongst the top 10 most important breeding waterbird sites in Denmark. Currently, agriculture supports cost-neutral management of the restoration area, but whilst most expected wet meadow and marsh species had returned, lack of goal-orientated management targets resulted in some additional rare and threatened species remaining absent. Breeding pair density and diversity of other species could have been greatly improved by prior planning and management intervention but at additional cost.},

abstract={Background: Little is hitherto known about the breeding ecology of the Tibetan Partridge (Perdix hodgsoniae) which is endemic to the Tibetan plateau. Here we describe nest densities, inter-nest distances and general nest site characteristics in this gallinaceous bird species and explore the possibilities that certain shrub and plant types are preferred as nest surroundings. Method: A total of 56 nests were found over three breeding seasons near Lhasa, Tibet. Nest site characteristics were compared with random control plots and the proportions of specific plant species covering nests were compared with their estimated general occurrence in the study area. Results: Nest density in the two years with highest search effort was estimated at 1.43/km2 and 1.04/km2 but was clearly higher in the part of the study area facing north (1.86-2.35/km2) than that facing south (0.11-0.34/ km2). The average nearest neighbour distance of nests was about 300 m. Nests were situated in relatively lush vegetation and covered by a total of eight shrub species and three herbs. In contrast to previous reports, Caragana shrub did not constitute an important part of the nest habitat. The flowering, non-thorny bush Potentilla fruticosa was significantly over-represented as nest cover, while Rhododendron nivale was similarly under-represented. Nest bush foliage covered a larger area of ground, and the shrub surrounding nests was generally denser, than in control samples. Also, nests were placed closer to paths and in areas with lower densities of Yak (Bos grunniens) dung than in control samples. Except that soil temperatures were lower on nest sites than on control sites, micro-climate variables measured in this study did not differ between nest sites and control plots. Conclusions: Opportunity for nest concealment is probably an important quality of the nest habitat in Tibetan Partridges, yet it is unclear why the species should prefer P. fruticosa as nest cover. It is possible that nest sites are chosen to secure escape exits in the case of approaching predators and to reduce the risk of nest trampling. Tibetan Partridges may also select nest sites according to micro-climate, either directly or indirectly through climate-related differences in shrub vegetation. © 2014 Dorge et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Studies evaluating agri-environmental schemes (AES) usually focus on responses of single species or functional groups. Analyses are generally based on simple habitat measurements but ignore food availability and other important factors. This can limit our understanding of the ultimate causes determining the reactions of birds to AES. We investigated these issues in detail and throughout the main seasons of a bird's annual cycle (mating, postfledging and wintering) in a dry cereal farmland in a Special Protection Area for farmland birds in central Spain. First, we modeled four bird response parameters (abundance, species richness, diversity and "Species of European Conservation Concern" [SPEC]-score), using detailed food availability and vegetation structure measurements (food models). Second, we fitted new models, built using only substrate composition variables (habitat models). Whereas habitat models revealed that both, fields included and not included in the AES benefited birds, food models went a step further and included seed and arthropod biomass as important predictors, respectively, in winter and during the postfledging season. The validation process showed that food models were on average 13% better (up to 20% in some variables) in predicting bird responses. However, the cost of obtaining data for food models was five times higher than for habitat models. This novel approach highlighted the importance of food availability-related causal processes involved in bird responses to AES, which remained undetected when using conventional substrate composition assessment models. Despite their higher costs, measurements of food availability add important details to interpret the reactions of the bird community to AES interventions and thus facilitate evaluating the real efficiency of AES programs. We investigated the effects of three measures included in an AES on a steppe bird community in central Spain in different seasons. We also compared the predictive capacity and costs of models based on simple habitat measurements (habitat models) with that of models, which incorporate detailed food availability and vegetation structure measurements (food models). The two main conclusions of our study were the following: (i) AES benefited birds but some non-AES field types did it too and the effects of each agri-environmental measure varied seasonally. (ii) The so-called food models increased the explanatory power with respect to habitat models and enabled to identify the ultimate causes underlying birds' responses. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Proliferation of invasive plants in forest understories throughout North America has prompted restoration efforts focused on removal of invasive vegetation. Although the negative impacts of invasives on native plant communities are well documented, effects on forest bird communities remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we examined the response of avian communities to invasive plants in forest fragments across 4 counties in northeastern Illinois, a region characterized by extensive urbanization. We surveyed breeding bird communities in 46 forest plots representing a gradient in abundance of invasive woody plants. We quantified vegetation structure and composition within plots, as well as landscape context. Exotic trees and shrubs were present on all but 3 plots. Although native trees were common, native species represented <7% of total stem density of shrubs. Measures of invasion were weakly correlated with those representing urbanization, yet broad-scale measures of urbanization such as building density and urban cover were strongly associated with avian community structure. At finer scales, measures of invasion were important predictors of the relative abundance of birds in several nesting and foraging guilds. Shrub nesters showed a positive response to invasive vegetation, whereas the relative abundance of aerial salliers and ground nesters decreased with increased proportions of invasive trees. Because restoration strategies aimed at the complete removal of invasive shrubs could diminish habitat quality for some species, thinning of understory vegetation or the removal of invasive trees may confer the greatest benefits to avian communities when few native understory plants are present. © 2014 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Landscape homogenization resulting from high browsing pressure or forest management practices can impact plant and animal diversity. Large herbivores and logging may therefore influence small mammal populations, which are known to strongly respond to forest disturbances. We assessed the influence of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) density and forest harvesting on deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in the boreal forest of Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada). We expected mice to be favoured by logging and thus that their abundance and body mass would increase in cutblocks, due to a greater availability of grasses providing food, shelter from predators, and improved thermoregulation. Mice may also benefit from an increase in deer density, especially at intermediate densities, where food (insects and seeds) availability is the highest. In 2 consecutive summers, we live-captured mice within a large, controlled deer browsing experiment where deer were maintained at 4 different densities (0, 7.5, and 15 deer km-2 and ambient density, 27 to 56 deer km-2) in forest and in cutblocks. We found higher mice abundance in logged habitat regardless of deer density, but body mass was unaffected by deer density and forest harvesting. While plant, insect, and bird communities have all been shown to respond to deer density reduction, the interspecific relationships between deer and mice appear neutral in this system.},

abstract={The post-fledging dependency period of birds is often characterized by high juvenile mortality, but fledglings in specific habitats may have increased survivorship. We describe habitat use by fledgling northern flickers (Colaptes auratus) in relation to the availability of patchy forest and prairie habitat in central British Columbia, Canada. We used radiotelemetry to monitor survival of fledglings according to their use of habitats during the dependency period. The fledglings occupied habitats with a higher density of trees than either random locations or nest sites and they switched from forested areas to more open grasslands after 7-10 days post-fledging. Some moved >1 km from the nest within 4 days post-fledging. Fledglings from nests in small tree clusters with little forest cover within 250 m moved farther from their nest within the first 4 days post-fledging than fledglings from nests in larger forest patches. Fledgling survival was positively correlated with the amount of canopy cover and negatively correlated with the amount of forest cover at the larger landscape scale. Young flickers moved among habitat types, which may occur as a result of trade-offs between predation risk and food abundance between habitats. We conclude that fledgling flickers at younger ages used dense forested areas and grassland habitat and forest at older ages to maximize survival and to access food sources. Maintaining patches of dense cover and the amount of forest cover on less than 35% of the landscape may improve fledgling survival of flickers. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Reservoir management on the Missouri River has changed the flow regime that once created dynamic emergent sandbar habitat (ESH) for the interior least tern (Sternula antillarum) and piping plover (Charadrius melodus). High flows that create large amounts of ESH are now rare, but the remaining interannual variability in river stage has strong effects on the amount of ESH available for nesting shorebirds. The scarcity of habitat has led the United States Army Corps of Engineers to develop an adaptive management plan for the restoration of ESH to support nesting terns and plovers. We describe the stochastic simulation models of ESH, plover populations and tern populations used in the adaptive management process, and examine the effects of river flow on projected outcomes of habitat restoration. The population models are most sensitive to uncertainty in adult survival rates. Model validation against historical amounts of ESH and population sizes suggests the model is a reasonable predictor of future dynamics. Flow variability contributes as much uncertainty as parameter estimation error to plover model projections but negligible uncertainty to the tern model. Autocorrelation in flow between years has stronger effects on population outcomes than the intensity of habitat restoration effort does. We compared population outcomes after a habitat-creating flow with population outcomes following habitat restoration and found that large pulses of habitat creation produced similar or better outcomes in the short term than low but consistent habitat restoration. However, bird populations fared better in the long term with low levels of restoration when habitat-forming flows were rare. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The objectives of our exploratory study were to estimate growth rate constants of weight and three morphometric measures (culmen length, tarsal length and wing length) in nestling Black-backed Woodpeckers and to determine how the amount of old coniferous habitat in home ranges may affect these rates. The amount of old coniferous habitat positively influenced weight gain in Black-backed Woodpecker nestlings but did not influence the three morphometric measures of growth rate. Our results suggest that Black-backed Woodpecker fitness may be affected by the reduction of old coniferous habitat in managed forest landscapes.

abstract={Double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) populations have increased greatly across North America. The interior North America subpopulation is the largest with many birds nesting on the Laurentian Great Lakes. Lake Erie supports a large number of breeding pairs that nests primarily on islands in the western basin of the lake. These islands also harbor many rare plant species constituting some of the last vestiges of Carolinian plant communities in Canada. Nesting cormorants can adversely affect the plant communities on the islands on which they nest. Annual ground censuses were conducted from 1979 to 2011 to assess temporal changes in the density of nesting cormorants on 3 islands in western Lake Erie. We used aerial photographs taken over a maximum 16-year span to assess changes in forest cover on these island ecosystems. We observed declines in forest cover on all 3 islands ranging from 47% to 85%. Trends among islands differed reflecting differences in cormorant colonization histories and the degree to which cormorants were managed, thereby influencing nest densities. Islands without cormorant management had cormorant nest densities ranging from approximately 300-500 nests/ha and forests declined continuously through time. On the island where cormorants were culled, nest densities were lower (approx. 200 nests/ha) and forest decline stabilized. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={If differences in ecological requirements result in juvenile birds using different habitats from breeding birds, then habitat management to protect those birds must protect both breeding and post-breeding habitats. We examined habitat selection by juvenile black-capped vireos (Vireo atricapilla) following their independence from parental care, in 2010-2013 on Fort Hood Military Reservation in central Texas, USA. The black-capped vireo is a federally endangered species that nests almost exclusively in shrub vegetation, but previous anecdotal observations indicate that juveniles may prefer riparian vegetation. We used mist-net capture rates and radio-telemetry to determine relative abundance of juvenile vireos across habitats, to quantify movement patterns and habitat selection, and to investigate how vegetation density and arthropod abundance influenced habitat selection. We captured juveniles at similar rates in shrub and riparian vegetation. Radio telemetry data indicated that juveniles selected riparian vegetation over most other available vegetation types, and tended to stay in riparian vegetation upon arrival. Juveniles selected areas characterized by more canopy cover, denser foliage, and more arthropods. Riparian vegetation provides this combination of features more than other vegetation types, indicating that cover and food are the basis for habitat selection by juveniles. Our results indicate that habitat conservation strategies for black-capped vireos should include protection of riparian vegetation near breeding areas, and more generally, that avian conservation strategies that focus only on breeding areas may potentially overlook other key habitats. © 2014 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2014.},

abstract={To halt biodiversity loss in the humid tropics of developing countries, it is crucial to understand the roles and effects of human-modified landscapes with fragmented forest remnants in maintaining biodiversity while fulfilling the demands of local communities and reducing poverty. To implement appropriate landscape planning for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, appropriate information is required about parameters of habitat suitability among various anthropogenic habitats with a range of distances to forests and vegetation characteristics, but such information is limited. We examined differences in avian communities between a remnant forest and four types of man-made forest (two mature plantations and two agroforests) in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, and we analyzed the effects of both local and landscape factors on various types of species richness in this landscape. The results from non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed avifauna in the two types of agroforest was clustered separately from that in the remnant forest, mainly because drastic declines in the abundance of forest specialists (including IUCN red-listed species) and their replacement with open-habitat generalists. The mixed-tree agroforests were colonized by 30 % of forest specialists and forest-edge species found in the remnant forest, and maintained the highest richness of species endemic to Indonesia among man-made forests, implying that some forest specialists and endemics might have adapted to ancient landscape heterogeneity. High proportion of insectivorous birds was found in the remnant forest (more than 50 %) and drastically decline in man-made forests, although the species richness of insectivores did not decline significantly in broad-leaved plantations. We concluded that protection of remnant forests should be prioritized to conserve forest bird diversity. However, as different environmental factors affected the richness values of different ecological groups, appropriate landscape design and habitat management could improve functional diversity in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Globally, modification of landscapes for agriculture has had a strong influence on the distribution and abundance of biota. In particular, woodland-dependent birds are under threat across agricultural landscapes in Britain, North America and Australia, with their decline and extirpation attributed to the loss and fragmentation of habitat. Other native species have become over-abundant in response to anthropogenic landscape change and have strong interactive effects on avian assemblage structure. In eastern Australia, the hyper-aggressive noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) often dominates woodlands in agricultural landscapes through interspecific competition, resulting in declines of species richness of woodland-dependent birds. We aimed to determine the relative influence and importance of interspecific competition, in situ habitat structure and landscape structure for woodland-dependent bird species at the landscape level. We recorded species-specific landscape incidence of woodland-dependent birds in 24 agricultural-woodland mosaics (25 km2) in southern Queensland, Australia. We selected extensively cleared landscapes (10-23 % woodland cover) where fragmentation effects are expected to be greatest. We applied generalised linear models and hierarchical partitioning to quantify the relative importance of the landscape-level incidence of the noisy miner, mistletoe abundance, shrub cover, woodland extent, woodland subdivision and land-use intensity for the incidence of 46 species of woodland birds at the landscape-scale. The landscape-level incidence of the noisy miner was the most important explanatory variable across the assemblage. Both in situ habitat structure and landscape structure were of secondary importance to interspecific aggression, although previous research suggests that the increasing incidence of the noisy miner in fragmented agricultural landscapes is itself a consequence of anthropogenic changes to landscape structure. Species' responses to fragmentation varied from positive to negative, but complex habitat structure had a consistently positive effect, suggesting in situ restoration of degraded habitats could be a conservation priority. Landscape wide conservation of woodland-dependent bird populations in agricultural landscapes may be more effective if direct management of noisy miner populations is employed, given the strong negative influence of this species on the incidence of woodland-dependent birds among landscapes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Many studies have suggested that early successional habitats are important for fall migrant and resident birds. In light of this, we studied habitat relationships, preferred fruiting shrub species, and fruit consumption by birds in early successional habitats during the fall at Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge, Alabama, New York, USA. We used transects to count birds in 12 shrub and 6 early successional forest sites during 2008-2009, and collected data to construct habitat models. We examined frugivory using a paired open/enclosed fruit branch experiment and by analyzing fecal samples of birds captured in mist nets. More fall songbirds were detected in shrublands than in forests across the 2 years, although forests with well-developed understories also had high detection levels. Total bird abundance was positively related to fruiting species richness and negatively related to small woody stem (0.0-2.5 cm) abundance. Abundance of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) was positively related to total shrub cover and fruit abundance on common buckthorns (Rhamnus cathartica), and negatively related to small and large (2.5-8.0 cm) stem abundance. Abundance of Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) was positively related to fruiting shrub species richness. Abundance of Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) was positively related to gray dogwood (Cornus racemosa) fruit abundance, and negatively related to small stem abundance and bella honeysuckle (Lonicera × bella) fruit abundance. Fecal analysis suggested that birds as a whole disproportionately consumed fruit species relative to availability, and consumed more bella honeysuckle and common buckthorn than gray dogwood. Fewer fruits remained on open branches than enclosed branches, suggesting birds actively consumed fruits at our sites. Our results suggest that fall migrant and resident songbirds as a whole benefit more from mature shrublands that contain a diversity of fruiting shrub species than from early successional forests. While these characteristics may benefit the suite of fall migrants and residents at our location, appropriate habitat management may differ for other locations or migratory species. © 2013 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Many woodpecker species are known to be sensitive to the removal of dead wood. In 1999-2001 and 2007-2009 woodpeckers and dead wood abundance were studied in coniferous stands of the Białowieża Forest, Poland. Transects (3.9-6 km long) were established in three zones of different types of management: 1) primeval, unmanaged stands (BNP); 2) partially managed nature reserve (RES); 3) heavily managed stands (MAN). Woodpeckers were counted along transects three times per season, and tree stand measurements (number of standing and fallen trees, diameter at breast height, volume of fallen logs) were made once every three years. Woodpecker indices were highest in BNP and lowest in RES in both three-year study periods. The highest number of species (seven) was recorded in RES. Indices of four woodpeckers including two focal species (Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus and White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos) were dependent on the basal area of dead standing trees. The same relation was found for the whole woodpecker assemblage. The highest indices were recorded in BNP, where the highest density of dead standing trees was recorded, and the lowest in the MAN transect with the lowest density of dead trees. However in the RES plot the amount of dead wood was much lower than in the national park. We recommend that the management regulations in Polish nature reserves be changed. In coniferous reserves, it would be best to leave at least 2 m2 ha-1 (basal area) of freshly killed spruce Picea sp. after each bark beetle outbreak. © BirdLife International 2013.},

abstract={This sketch is based on more than 600 Russian publications and several handbooks. The ornithological knowledge of this vast area, extending from the Artic southwards to steppes and deserts has markedly increased in the last 40 years. Only a few parts especially in the Far North remained unexplored because of remoteness and access difficulty. For several species, it was not easy to identify whether a changing trend was an extension or a contraction of breeding area or if a real change in breeding numbers occurred. Tables I and II show the species (or subspecies) with a clear decreasing or increasing trend over the whole of West Siberia. Among at least 162 species, 105 (65%) decreased and 57 (35%) increased. The Anseriformes, Falconiformes and Galliformes constitute 37% of all decreasing taxa. Local exceptions to the announced trend are mentioned under "remarks" on the Tables. This paper discusses supplementary data from Russian literature on the current status of 16 species (or subspecies): 15 decreased and only one increased. Special attention is focused on the dramatic concern by electrocution in raptors (especially the genus Aquila). The Marbled Duck Marmaronetta angustirostris, the White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala, the western population of Siberian Crane Grus leucogeranus, the Slender-billed Curlew Numenius tenuirostris and the southern subspecies of Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus alboaxillaris are on the verge of extinction. About half of the decreasing or increasing bird taxa in West Siberia showed a similar trend in Europe. According to Siberian sources, the avifauna is fairly influenced by three recent factors: oil and gas extraction, climate wanning and dramatic changes in forest habitats owing to fire and fragmentation. Compared to their initial virgin status, taigas in which oil extraction resulted in a new vegetation cover attracted many species. However, oil industry has an overall negative influence on the environment by reducing the richness in species, diversity and biomass. Especially, the gas exploitation on the Yamal Peninsula has negatively impacted several waterfowl species. Further development of oil industry must be regarded as a threat to the survival of several populations. Therefore a doubling of the existing taiga nature sanctuaries is strongly recommended. Most of Russian climatologists are convinced that climate change did not play a major role in the shift towards the north of some avian breeding distributions. In that respect, landscape changes mostly induced by human activities have a much more severe impact. A northward expansion of the breeding area of several species occurs less commonly than it is observed in West Europe. Expansions to other geographical directions than to the north are suggested (Table III). Compared to Scandinavia, there are only a few investigations on the role of fire and fragmentation in the West Siberian taiga. In the present paper, the significance of the remaining undisturbed taiga areas and the importance of secondary forest development in the new increasing of some species are underlined. However, fire and fragmentation have most often an adverse influence on bird communities.},

abstract={The formation of tree-cavities is an important ecological factor since many animals in woody habitats are cavity users. Recent research focuses on tree-cavity formation and the associated cavity networks in forest ecosystems. However, although traditional European orchards are important habitats for secondary cavity users, ecological research on the factors associated with the occurrence of cavities in fruit trees is widely missing. In particular, fruit tree pruning management may affect decay-cavity formation due to the pruning wounds allowing heart rot and decay to enter the tree. Here, we present a cross-sectional study investigating 608 fruit trees in 30 study plots of three European fruit-growing regions to identify factors associated with decay-cavity occurrence in fruit trees. Presence of decay-cavities was positively related to trunk diameter. Moreover, fruit trees of low vitality and with woodpecker-cavities featured more often decay-cavities than trees of high vitality or without woodpecker-cavities. Apple trees featured higher numbers of cavities at younger age than other fruit trees. Occurrence of decay-cavities was also related to the past removal of large main branches. Accordingly, traditional orchards are cavity-rich habitats if they comprise high proportion of old fruit trees, in particular apple trees, and if pruning management produces large pruning wounds. Thus, differential tree pruning and fruit-growing traditions across Europe result in different cavity densities in traditional orchards. Preservation of existing and potential cavity trees and selective removal of large branches from apple trees are recommended as conservation measures establishing high cavity densities and increasing the associated biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Ecosystem-based forest management strives to develop silvicultural practices that best emulate natural disturbances such as wildfire to conserve biodiversity representative of natural forest ecosystems. Yet, current logging practices alter forest structure and reduce the proportion of old-growth forest and, consequently, can exert long-term effects on the dynamics of forest biota. The stand- and landscape-scale factors driving bird community dynamics in post-disturbance environment remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined bird community dynamics along successional gradients in boreal ecosystems originating from fire and logging in landscapes dominated by old-growth forest. We tested if bird species richness and community compositions in clear-cutting stands became comparable to those in natural stands after 70 years, and identified the relative contributions of stand- and landscape-scale forest attributes in bird community dynamics. Based on records of bird occurrences at 185 field sites in natural and clearcutting stands, we demonstrate that (1) both forest structures and bird communities underwent evident changes along successional gradients in post-clearcutting environment; (2) bird species richness and community composition in 60- to 70-years-old clearcutting stands still differed from those in 50- to 79-years-old natural stands, in spite of the fact that most forest attributes of clearcutting stands became comparable to those of natural stands after 40 years; and (3) landscape disturbances contributed more than stand characteristics in explaining the lack of convergence of mature forest species, residents, and short-distance migrants in post-clearcutting environment. Our study points out that more regards should be paid to improve the landscape configuration of the managed forests, and implies that old-growth forest retention within logged areas, combined with selection cutting and prolonged logging rotations, can better emulate fire and alleviate forest harvesting effects on bird community assemblages typical of natural boreal ecosystem. © 2013 Zhao et al.},

abstract={Forty years since the cessation of grazing on Tiritiri Matangi, the island has been transformed by a restoration programme. However, a big question remained: What the island would have looked like if restoration had not occurred? This study addresses that question. Some sections of the island were deliberately not restored and allowed to regenerate naturally to provide a reference point for the changes brought about by direct intervention. In one area a transect of plots was available in which species composition and frequency information had been measured in a pre-restoration state. A comparison, almost 30 years later, showed that many previously dominant pasture grasses had been lost, and replaced by native grassland dominated by Microlena stipoides. Also, native shrubs and small trees absent from the pasture grassland in 1979 were now present, although in low abundance. Overall this study shows that in this environment, even 40 years after the cessation of grazing, the succession to woody vegetation is slow. It may be another 40 years before woody vegetation dominates the area. This demonstrates that active restoration of the island greatly accelerated the development of forest over natural regeneration, and this has undoubtedly allowed the rapid expansion of many otherwise very restricted bird species. © New Zealand Ecological Society.},

abstract={Although increasing efforts are being made to restore tropical forests, little information is available regarding the time scales required for carbon and plant biodiversity to recover to the values associated with undisturbed forests. To address this knowledge gap, we carried out a meta-analysis comparing data from more than 600 secondary tropical forest sites with nearby undisturbed reference forests. Above-ground biomass approached equivalence to reference values within 80 years since last disturbance, whereas below-ground biomass took longer to recover. Soil carbon content showed little relationship with time since disturbance. Tree species richness recovered after about 50 years. By contrast, epiphyte richness did not reach equivalence to undisturbed forests. The proportion of undisturbed forest trees and epiphyte species found in secondary forests was low and changed little over time. Our results indicate that carbon pools and biodiversity show different recovery rates under passive, secondary succession and that colonization by undisturbed forest plant species is slow. Initiatives such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and REDD{thorn} should therefore encourage active management to help to achieve their aims of restoring both carbon and biodiversity in tropical forests. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

abstract={Along with plant species composition forest structural complexity is an important determinant of forest biodiversity, but difficult to predict in space from field data. We analyzed forest structural complexity based on a comprehensive set of variables derived from nationally available, area-wide remote sensing, particularly LiDAR data. We generated variables related to vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity, as well as site factors potentially indicating the abundance of weakened trees or snags. We used them to predict the occurrence of four bird species with narrow and complementary structural habitat requirements, together being indicative of structurally diverse forests. Presence/absence data of Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) from three biogeographic mountain regions in Switzerland were used to calibrate species distribution models (boosted regression trees BRT) for each species individually, as well as for the sympatric occurrence of at least three of the four target species. The predictive deviances explained and the AUC values obtained from cross-validation ranged from 15.5% to 63.1% and 0.77% to 0.97% respectively. Sympatric species occurrence reflecting overall forest structural complexity was predicted best, with an outstanding accuracy. To support management and monitoring schemes we identified variable threshold effects based on partial dependence plots. Variables related to vertical foliage distributions were most important, followed by horizontal structural attributes such as canopy height variations, forest edges and gaps. Site factors such as topographic position improved all models and were most important for the species depending on weakened trees and dead wood. We conclude that recent advances in remote sensing allow for large-scale determination of forest structural characteristics suitable for developing species and habitat distribution models of considerable generality, while keeping an unprecedented level of detail. Our approach allows forest managers to amend regional and countrywide management plans with reliable maps depicting areas of high forest structural complexity and habitat quality, which will facilitate the integration of conservation-relevant information into multifunctional forestry. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Colonization and extinction are primary drivers of local population dynamics, community structure, and spatial patterns of biological diversity. Existing paradigms of island biogeography, metapopulation biology, and metacommunity ecology, as well as habitat management and conservation biology based on those paradigms, emphasize patch size, number, and isolation as primary characteristics influencing colonization and extinction. Habitat selection theory suggests that patch quality could rival size, number, and isolation in determining rates of colonization and resulting community structure. We used naturally colonized experimental landscapes to address four issues: (a) how do colonizing aquatic beetles respond to variation in patch number, (b) how do they respond to variation in patch quality, (c) does patch context affect colonization dynamics, and (d) at what spatial scales do beetles respond to habitat variation? Increasing patch number had no effect on per patch colonization rates, while patch quality and context were critical in determining colonization rates and resulting patterns of abundance and species richness at multiple spatial scales. We graphically illustrate how variation in immigration rates driven by perceived predation risk (habitat quality) can further modify dynamics of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography beyond predator-driven effects on extinction rates. Our data support the importance of patch quality and context as primary determinants of colonization rate, occupancy, abundance, and resulting patterns of species richness, and reinforce the idea that management of metapopulations for species preservation, and metacommunities for local and regional diversity, should incorporate habitat quality into the predictive equation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Hole-nesting birds include species highly dependent on old trees or dead wood for nesting, roosting, breeding and feeding. In this study we characterize the assemblages of these species occurring in five different habitat types located in a heterogeneous Mediterranean landscape. We used the point count method. In all habitat types, tits (Parus major and Cyanisles caeruleus) were the most abundant species, except in beech forests, where Sitta europaea showed the highest mean abundance. Hole nesting bird assemblages increase in abundance, richness and diversity, with significant changes from tcrmophilic and sclerophyllous forests (Holm-oak and Cork-oak) to temperate and mesophilic forests (chestnut, Turkey oak and Beech). This pattern reflects the progressive change in vegetation type both due to structure and species composition, ultimately due to progressive change in altitude and local climate. In particular, data at singles species level corroborate that the presence of mature and dead trees (i.e., with high mean diameter) may explain the abundance of Sitla europaea, Picus viridis and Certhia brachydactyla Our dataset highlights that, for the hole-nesting birds, mcsophilous beech and oak Mediterranean forests of biogeographic and conservation concern, represent suitable habitat types for these specialized species.},

abstract={The present study analyses long-term annual fishery landings time series (1980-2007) for species derived from six lagoons (covering about 70km2) around an important European wetland, the fjord-like Amvrakikos gulf. Landing trends for most abundant species revealed that typical lagoon fish species-groups, such as Mugilidae (Mugil cephalus, Chelon labrosus, Liza saliens, Liza aurata and Liza ramada), eels (Anguilla anguilla) and Gobies (mainly Zosteriosessor ophiocephalus) had largely decreased, while the landings of Sparus aurata increased during the entire study period. These trends led to a significant change in species composition during recent years that might be attributed to large-scale climatic changes as well as serious anthropogenic impacts that degraded the water quality and altered the hydrology within the gulf and lagoons, the increase of fishing exploitation in Amvrakikos gulf, the expansion of aquaculture activities within the gulf, the application of new fishing management practices in lagoons, and the increase of fish-eating sea-bird populations. The findings are needed for the implementation of an efficient and integrated management tool for the study of coastal systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Introduced species pose a major threat to biodiversity across the globe. Understanding the impact of introduced species is critical for effective management. Many species around the world are reliant on tree cavities, and competition for these resources can be intense: threatening the survival of native species. Through the establishment of 225 nest boxes, we examined the relationship between tree density and the abundance and nesting success of three bird species in Canberra, Australia. The common myna (Acridotheres tristis) is an introduced species in Australia, and the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) and eastern rosella (Platycercus eximius) are native species. We then investigated the impact of common myna nest box occupation on crimson rosella and eastern rosella abundance. Tree density significantly influenced the abundance and cavity-nesting of all three species. Common myna abundance (birds per square kilometer) was greatest at low tree density sites (101.9 ± 22.4) and declined at medium (45.4 ± 10.1) and high (9.7 ± 3.6) tree density sites. The opposite pattern was observed for the crimson rosella, with greater abundance (birds per square kilometer) at high tree density sites (83.9 ± 9.3), declining over medium (61.6 ± 6.4) and low (31.4 ± 3.9) tree density sites. The eastern rosella was more abundant at medium tree density sites (48.6 ± 8.0 birds per square kilometer). Despite the strong influence of tree density, we found a significant negative relationship between common myna nest box occupancy and the abundance of the crimson rosella (F 1,13 = 7.548, P = 0.017) and eastern rosella (F 1,13 = 9.672, P &lt; 0.001) at some sites. We also observed a slight increase in rosella nesting interruptions by the common myna at lower tree densities (high: 1.3 % ± 1.3, medium: 6.6 % ± 2.2, low: 12.7 % ± 6.2), although this increase was not statistically significant (F 2,40 = 2.435, P = 0.100). Our study provides the strongest evidence to date for the negative impact of the common myna on native bird abundance through cavity-nesting competition. However, due to the strong influence of habitat on species abundance and nesting, it is essential to investigate the impacts of introduced species in conjunction with habitat variation. We also suggest one component of introduced species management could include habitat restoration to reduce habitat suitability for introduced species. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={We used data from Pinus pinaster Ait. and Pinus sylvestris L. trees growing in single-species even-aged stands in northwestern Spain to develop crown profile models. Such models are key components of growth and yield models, and they are also important for assessing competitive level, microclimate, tree vigour, mechanical stability, biological diversity, fire susceptibility and behaviour under wind stress, amongst other features. The equations used in crown profile estimation (i.e. those including crown radius, largest crown radius, height to the largest crown radius and height to the base of the live foliage) were fitted simultaneously to take into account correlations between the different variables. The fitting technique also enabled us to consider an autocorrelated, heteroscedastic error structure and to use a different number of observations for the different variables involved in the fitting process. The fitted models explained between 66 and 94 per cent of the variability in crown radius, with a mean error between 0.15 and 0.64 m. The crown profile models developed can be used to estimate the crown profile when only diameter at breast height, total tree height and height to the base of the live foliage are measured. Inclusion of more variables (such as largest crown radius) provides more accurate results. © Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2013. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The United States and Mexico share the Southern California Bight (SCB) ecosystem in the Northeast Pacific Ocean where marine wildlife and habitats historically have been disturbed by human activities. Within this ecosystem, forests of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera are critical habitats that sustain diverse biological assemblages and important fishery species. We studied patterns of temporal and spatial variability within the benthic communities of five transboundary kelp forests in California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) over a fouryear period that included a moderate El Niño event. While the benthic marine communities shared some species, they varied significantly in community structure from each other, and the degree of dissimilarity was not related to the geographic distances among the studied habitats. Rather, species richness was significantly related to local substratum rugosity, suggesting it could be used as a proxy of relative benthic biological diversity. Temporal changes in the benthic assemblages were not consistent across all forests, and contrary to observations made during previous El Niño events in the SCB, the benthic communities did not change significantly following the 2009-2010 El Niño. Such an unexpected community response may be explained by the fact that the 2009-2010 El Niño was linked to the Modoki phenomenon, where warm sea surface temperature is focused in the central equatorial Pacific and not in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We propose that long-term conservation efforts should incorporate this ecological knowledge to support science-based decisions, binational coordination of policies, and coherent management practices including the design of transboundary conservation networks as spatial management tools for the protection, conservation, and/or restoration of the SCB ecosystem.},

abstract={Over a century of fire suppression activities have altered the structure and composition of mixed conifer forests throughout the western United States. In the absence of fire, fuels have accumulated in these forests causing concerns over the potential for catastrophic wildfires. Fuel reduction treatments are being used on federal and state lands to reduce the threat of wildfire by mechanically removing biomass. Although these treatments result in a reduction in fire hazard, their impact on wildlife is less clear. We use a multi-species occupancy modeling approach to build habitat-suitability models for 46 upland forest birds found in the Lake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra Nevada based on forest structure and abiotic variables. Using a Bayesian hierarchical framework, we predict species-specific and community-level responses to changes in forest structure and make inferences about responses of important avian foraging guilds. Disparities within and among foraging group responses to canopy cover, tree size and shrub cover emphasized the complexities in managing forests to meet biodiversity goals. Based on our species-specific model results, we predicted changes in species richness and community similarity under forest prescriptions representing three management practices: no active management, a typical fuel reduction treatment that emphasizes spacing between trees, and a thinning prescription that creates structural heterogeneity. Simulated changes to structural components of the forest analogous to management practices to reduce fuel loads clearly affected foraging groups differentially despite variability in responses within guilds. Although species richness was predicted to decrease slightly under both simulated fuels reduction treatments, the prescription that incorporated structural heterogeneity retained marginally higher species richness. The composition of communities supported by different management alternatives was influenced by urbanization and management practice, emphasizing the importance of creating heterogeneity at the landscape scale. © 2013 .},

abstract={Prescribed burning is a common management tool for upland hardwood forests, with wildlife habitat improvement an often cited goal. Fire management for wildlife conservation requires understanding how species respond to burning at different frequencies, severities, and over time. In an earlier study, we experimentally assessed how breeding bird communities and species responded to fuel reduction treatments by mechanical understory reduction, low-severity prescribed fires, or mechanical understory reduction followed a year later by high-severity prescribed fires in upland hardwood forest. Here, we assess longer-term response to the initial mechanical treatment (M), and a second low-intensity burn in twice burned (B2) and mechanical. +. twice burned (MB2) treatments and controls (C). Initial (2003) higher dead fuel loadings and consequently high-severity fires in MB2 created open-canopy structure with abundant snags, resulting in much higher species richness and density of breeding birds compared to other treatments. Relative bird density and richness remained much higher in MB2 after a second burn, but few changes were evident that were not already apparent after one burn. The initial (2003) burn in B2 had cooler, low-severity fires that killed few trees. Delayed tree mortality occurred in both burn treatments after one burn, and continued in both after a second low-intensity burn. In B2, this resulted in gradual development of a "perforated," patchy canopy structure with more snags. Abundance of total birds and most species in B2 was similar to C, but several additional species associated with open-forest conditions occurred at low levels, increasing richness in B2. In both burn treatments, burning temporarily reduced habitat suitability for ground-nesting birds. Bird communities in M were similar to C, as shrubs recovered rapidly. Results indicate that one or two relatively low-intensity burns with patches of hotter fire may result in gradual, subtle changes to canopy cover and structure that may slightly increase bird species richness over time. In contrast, a single high-intensity, high severity fire can create young forest conditions and a heterogeneous canopy structure that can be maintained by repeated burning and increase breeding bird relative abundance and richness by attracting disturbance-adapted species while retaining most other forest species. © 2013.},

abstract={Intensifying forest management practices via use of tree plantations represents a common response to rising global demand for wood and paper products. However, a large proportion of tree plantations, globally, exist in closed-canopy mid-seral stages, which are frequently associated with reduced biodiversity. In some regions, silvicultural techniques such as thinning have been used to accelerate the development of complex vertical structure and composition (e.g., shrubs, understory, midstory, large trees) in these plantations; these attributes are expected to constitute suitable habitat for species associated with particular forest structures. We report on the results of a 15-year randomized-block manipulative study based in Oregon, USA, designed to test the hypothesis that 'if you build it they will come' (i.e., the "Field of Dreams" hypothesis; the 'creation' of complex vertical structure in forests via thinning will result in colonization by bird species associated with these structures). We conducted point counts of forest birds 7 times each year in stands thinned at two different intensities and in unharvested controls. Responses to thinning by some bird species [e.g., hermit warbler (Setophaga occidentalis), Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus) and Wilson's warbler (Cardellina pusilla)] changed from being negative in the short term (<6. years), to being positive over the longer term. However, some species were sensitive to thinning disturbance even after 15. years of recovery [e.g., Hutton's vireo (Vireo huttoni)]. Disturbance-associated species initially increased following thinning; but over the longer-term, detections of several of these species [American robin (Turdus migratorius) and Townsend's solitaire (Myadestes townsendi)] notably declined or ceased. Our findings indicate that results from short-term studies (≤6. years) cannot be used to predict the longer-term response of birds to forest management treatments, particularly for species of birds whose response to thinning over time was non-linear. Further, none of the management prescriptions tested were alone sufficient to maintain long-term occupancy for all of the species in the study. Implementing thinning at intervals across landscape scales to develop different seral stages and stand-structures, while also maintaining unthinned areas for species negatively impacted by thinning, will likely have the greatest positive impact on beta diversity of birds in managed plantation landscapes. © 2013.},

The OWB fields supported 1.70 ± 0.27 (mean ± SE) Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) per ha compared to 0.95 ± 0.25 in native grass fields, but total species richness was greater in native grass fields (40 versus 28 species). Density of some bird species was correlated with vegetation structure regardless of field type, suggesting that management practices may be more influential than plant species composition. Mean arthropod biomass was 3.39× greater in native grass fields than in OWB monocultures. Native grass fields provided habitat for a larger complement of birds than did OWB monocultures, and reduced food availability in OWB fields suggests a mechanism for that difference. © 2013 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Capsule Diversity and abundance of birds breeding in river channels increased significantly after a severe flood in southern Poland. Flooding increased the diversity of river channels, especially on previously regulated sections, and this resulted in more breeding habitat for birds. Aims To investigate how a severe flood can alter river assemblages of bird species breeding in natural pre-flood or regulated sections. Methods Data of breeding birds within submontane river channels in southern Poland from before (2007-2009) and after (2011) a flood were collected. Bird diversity and abundance in natural and pre-flood regulated sections were compared before and after the flood. Results The presence of natural features within channels increased significantly in all the studied sections. The number of bird species and breeding pairs increased both in the regulated and natural channel sections, but was much larger in the previously regulated sections. Conclusion The underlying cause of the observed short-term increase in species and their population size was thought to be a combination of increased breeding site availability and food abundance.

abstract={Salmon farming is a widespread activity around the world, also known to promote diverse environmental effects on aquatic ecosystems. However, information regarding the impact of salmon farming on bird assemblages is notably scarce. We hypothesize that salmon farming, by providing food subsidies and physical structures to birds, will change their local community structure. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a seasonal monitoring of bird richness, abundance, and composition at paired salmon pen and control plots in two marine and two lake sites in southern Chile, from fall 2002 to summer 2004. Overall, salmon farming had no significant effects on species richness, but bird abundance was significantly and noticeably higher in salmon pens than in controls. Such aggregation was mainly accounted for by the trophic guilds of omnivores, diving piscivores, carrion eaters, and perching piscivores, but not by invertebrate feeders, herbivores, and surface feeders. Species composition was also significantly and persistently different between salmon pens and controls within each lake or marine locality. The patterns described above remained consistent across environment types and seasons indicating that salmon farming is changing the community structure of birds in both lake and marine habitats by promoting functional and aggregation responses, particularly by favoring species with broader niches. Such local patterns may thus anticipate potential threats from the ongoing expansion of the salmon industry to neighboring areas in Chile, resulting in regional changes of bird communities, toward a less diverse one and dominated by opportunistic, common, and generalist species such as gulls, vultures, and cormorants. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Fire-adapted forests in the western United States have dramatically departed from the natural or evolutionary environment over the past century because of fire suppression, logging, grazing, and other management practices. In particular, most southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests are characterized by dense stands of small-diameter trees that are susceptible to stand-replacing crown fires and ensuing damage to watersheds, wildlife habitat, and communities at the wildland-urban interface. Restoration treatments using mechanical thinning and prescribed fire have become the dominant management paradigm in this forest type, with landscape-scale projects being implemented over the next 20 years. Although many studies have examined wildlife responses to restoration treatments, single-species information is difficult for managers to synthesize and incorporate into management decisions made at large scales. Our goal was to investigate responses of breeding birds in ponderosa pine forests to forest stand characteristics modified by restoration treatments. We sampled birds in 23 stands for 3 years in northern Arizona, and used multi-season and multi-species occupancy models to determine relationships between avian occupancy and stand attributes affected by treatment. Increasing occupancy rates and species richness were associated with decreasing canopy cover, increasing density of mature trees, and increasing density of snags. Occupancy rates and species richness were negatively associated with quadratic mean diameter, medium-sized trees, and downed woody material. Associations of the avian community and individual species with herbaceous cover and tree clumping were less consistent. Our results support the implementation of forest restoration treatments for restoring avian community occupancy in ponderosa pine forests, and emulating the evolutionary environment is likely the best approach. We recommend reducing canopy cover via thinning, and retaining trees >45.7 cm diameter at breast height and snags. A commonly-proposed diameter cap for retaining large trees after thinning (40.6 cm dbh) seems unlikely to benefit nesting passerines, as resulting tree densities would remain too large. We recommend occupancy modeling as an efficient method for assessing wildlife-habitat relationships at large scales. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={We studied the effects of periodic disturbance (prescribed burning and light disking) and landscape composition on nest density and success for grassland birds in agricultural conservation buffers in southeastern United States agroecosystems. During the 2007-2009 breeding seasons, we located 387 nests in buffers of a northeast Mississippi agroecosystem. Dickcissel (Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) were the most common nesting species. Time since disturbance influenced nest densities of dickcissels and red-winged blackbirds; densities were lesser during the first growing season post-disturbance but increased during the second growing season post-burn. Nest densities for both species were least in buffers adjacent to woodland. Inclusion of disturbance did not improve models of dickcissel and red-winged blackbird nest survival, suggesting that disturbance influenced nesting density, but not nesting outcomes. Amount of grassland surrounding dickcissel nests was positively associated with nest survival, but confidence intervals included zero indicating effects were not strong. Although distance to nearest crop or developed edge were included in competing models of red-winged blackbird nest survival, their effects were negligible. Agricultural conservation buffers will best serve breeding grassland bird populations if they are established in areas with minimal woodland cover, maximize total grassland in the landscape, and are maintained with prescribed burning. These results will help characterize the contribution of agricultural conservation buffers in agroecosystems of the southeastern United States. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={The loss of species diversity due to habitat fragmentation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the impacts of habitat fragmentation on functional diversity remains relatively poorly understood. We conducted bird functional diversity studies on a set of 41 recently isolated land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We analysed differences in bird species richness and a recently developed suite of complementary functional diversity indices (FRic, volume of functional space occupied; FEve, evenness of abundance distribution in the functional trait space; FDiv, divergence in the distribution of abundance in the trait volume) across different gradients (island area and isolation). We found no correlations between FRic and FEve or FEve and FDiv, but negative correlations between FRic and FDiv. As predicted, island area accounted for most of the variation in bird species richness, whereas isolation explained most of the variation in species evenness (decreasing species evenness with increasing isolation). Functional diversity appears to be more strongly influenced by habitat filtering as opposed to limiting similarity. More specifically, across all islands, both FRic and FEve were significantly lower than expected for randomly assembled communities, but FDiv showed no clear patterns. FRic increased with island area, FEve decreased with island area and FDiv showed no clear patterns. Our finding that FEve decreases with island area at TIL may indicate low functional stability on such islands, and as such large islands and habitat patches may deserve extra attention and/or protection. These results help to demonstrate the importance of considering the effects of fragmentation on functional diversity in habitat management and reserve design plans. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={The Illinois State Wildlife Action Plan targeted the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) as important improvable acres for grassland and grassland-successional bird species of greatest need for conservation. A large portion of CRP grasslands in Illinois and elsewhere lack floristic and structural diversity because of the absence of management and the extensive planting of monotypic grasses such as tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix). The 2006 Farm Bill included the mid-contract management (MCM) provision requiring landowners with new CRP enrollments to provide habitat improvement midway through the 10-15-year contract duration. We compared the effects of 3 approved MCM regimes (i.e., fall strip disking, fall glyphosate spraying, fall glyphosate spraying followed by spring legume drill-seeding) on grassland bird communities in 60 tall fescue-dominated CRP fields in south-central Illinois during 2006-2008. We modeled relative density of dickcissels (Spiza americana), Henslow's sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii), and eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) as a function of microhabitat, patch-level patterns, and landscape composition using a multi-scale assessment approach. We detected 10 grassland-associated bird species (e.g., Henslow's sparrow, northern bobwhite [Colinus virginianus], sedge wren [Cistothrus platensis], Savannah sparrow [Passerculus sandwichensis], grasshopper sparrow [Ammodramus savannarum]) that are recognized as species of greatest need for conservation under the Illinois State Wildlife Action Plan. Mean total bird densities and species richness were greater in glyphosate-sprayed fields (5.0 birds/ha; 11.5 species) and glyphosate drill-seeded fields (4.4 bird/ha; 12.4 species) than in disked (3.4 birds/ha; 8.7 species) and reference (3.1 birds/ha; 7.5 species) fields. The avian conservation value of glyphosate sprayed and glyphosate drill-seeded fields increased 34.2% and 32.6% post-management, respectively, but we did not detect change in disked and reference fields. Our models indicate that density of each of the focal species is likely associated with changes in plant species diversity and habitat structure resulting from management actions but is also influenced by landscape composition. Despite an overall positive response of the grassland bird communities to glyphosate-based treatment regimes in tall fescue CRP fields in south-central Illinois, the response of Henslow's sparrow density to glyphosate was not consistently positive. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={We examined long-term responses of an Amazonian bird assemblage to wildfire disturbance, investigating how understory birds reacted to forest regeneration 1, 3, and 10 years after a widespread fire event. The bird community was sampled along the Arapiuns and Maró river catchments in central Brazilian Amazonia. Sampling took place in 1998, 2000, and 2008 using mist-nets in eight plots (four burned, four unburned sites). Species richness did not change significantly in unburned sites. In burned sites, however, we found significantly lower richness in 1998, higher richness in 2000, and similar richness in 2008. Multi-dimensional scaling ordination showed consistent differences in bird communities both within burned sites sampled in different sampling years, and between burned and unburned sites in all years. Of the 30 most abundant species, 12 had not recovered 10 years after the fires, including habitat specialists such as mixed flocks specialists and ant-followers. Fire-disturbance favored three species (two hummingbirds and a manakin) in the short term only. All other species were either favored throughout the study (seven species of omnivores and small insectivores) or did not show a clear response (eight species). In burned sites, we also found significantly lower abundance of species sensitive to disturbances and habitat specialists over the entire study period. Although the bird community seems to be recovering in terms of richness, the overall community composition and abundance of some species in post-burned and unburned sites remain very different, and have not recovered after 10 years of forest regeneration. © 2013 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract={Meyer's Parrot Poicephalus meyeri has the widest distributional range of any African parrot. There are six subspecies distributed throughout the African subtropics, all of which manage to breed successfully during the winter dry season when few other cavity-nesting birds are actively nesting. In 2004, we recorded Meyer's Parrots feeding on four cryptic arthropod larvae incubating inside fruits and pods in their seasonal diet. All of these were previously unknown in the diet of African parrots. Nesting females and chicks were fed regurgitate almost exclusively comprising these arthropod larvae for the first 10 weeks after nest occupation. In 2007, we demonstrated that Meyer's Parrots actively search for these protein-rich arthropod larvae and synchronized their breeding effort within our study area to coincide their hatching period with the period of highest relative abundance of these larvae, resulting in a breeding synchrony index value of 79.3 % between females in the population. In 2009, we recorded the consumption of similar arthropod larvae parasitizing similar tree species in northern Zambia and two locations in Tanzania, thus confirming this behaviour throughout their distributional range. Similar behaviour is expected in their closest congeners, the Brown-headed Parrot P. cryptoxanthus and Rüppell's Parrot P. rueppellii. Poor land management practices (e.g. deforestation and frequent fires) most likely influence the abundance of these cryptic arthropod larvae and thus the breeding success of Meyer's Parrot at population level. © 2013 Dt.

abstract={Tree microhabitats (e.g., canopy deadwood, cavities, and loose bark) may play an important role in forest biodiversity conservation. Indeed, many species depend on tree microhabitats during their life-cycles for food, shelter, and breeding habitat. Although recent studies have developed a set of definitions and descriptions for tree microhabitats, the relationships between tree microhabitat inventory data and biodiversity remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified relationships among tree microhabitat variables (i.e., the density and diversity of microhabitat) and bird and bat metrics using data from 59 plots in 3 Mediterranean forest ecosystems in France. In each plot, 9 types of tree microhabitats were inventoried: canopy deadwood; woodpecker cavities; non-woodpecker cavities (divided into lower, medium, and upper cavities); Cerambyx cavities; loose bark or cracks; conks of fungi; and ivy. We also assessed structural characteristics (e.g., basal area, stand height), the time since last cutting (i.e., the number of years since the stand was last cut), the number of forest habitats, and the distance to the nearest road. We performed bird and bat inventories in the same plots and we used abundances and a number of bird and bat community indices (e.g., species richness, mean forest specialization). We found that variations in tree microhabitat (more specifically, variations in microhabitat diversity) were a major factor in explaining the abundance and community response of birds and bats. Bird species, including cavity-nesting birds, were most strongly affected by tree microhabitat diversity, while bat species were positively affected by both the diversity of the tree microhabitat and the density of cavities created by Cerambyx spp. Tree microhabitats were better predictors of bird and bat responses than other stand characteristics. Tree microhabitat characteristics provide a reliable measure of ecological niches in forest ecosystems and we propose that these microhabitats be used as indicators for assessing biodiversity in forests. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Low-density residential development (i.e., exurban development) is often embedded within a matrix of protected areas and natural amenities, raising concern about its ecological consequences. Forest-dependent species are particularly susceptible to human settlement even at low housing densities typical of exurban areas. However, few studies have examined the response of forest birds to this increasingly common form of land conversion. The aim of this study was to assess whether, how, and at what scale forest birds respond to changes in habitat due to exurban growth. We evaluated changes in habitat composition (amount) and configuration (arrangement) for forest and forest-edge species around North America Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) stops between 1986 and 2009. We used Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis to detect change points in species occurrence at two spatial extents (400-m and 1-km radius buffer). Our results show that exurban development reduced forest cover and increased habitat fragmentation around BBS stops. Forest birds responded nonlinearly to most measures of habitat loss and fragmentation at both the local and landscape extents. However, the strength and even direction of the response changed with the extent for several of the metrics. The majority of forest birds' responses could be predicted by their habitat preferences indicating that management practices in exurban areas might target the maintenance of forested habitats, for example through easements or more focused management for birds within existing or new protected areas. © 2013 Suarez-Rubio et al.},

abstract={Land use change is a major threat to global biodiversity. Forest species face the dual threats of deforestation and intensification of forest management. In regions where forests are under threat, rural landscapes that retain structural components of mature forests potentially provide valuable additional habitat for some forest species. Here, we illustrate the habitat value of traditional wood pastures for a woodpecker assemblage of six species in southern Transylvania, Romania. Wood pastures are created by long-term stable silvo-pastoral management practices, and are composed of open grassland with scattered large, old trees. Because of their demanding habitat requirements, woodpeckers share habitat with many other bird species, and have been considered as possible indicator species for bird species diversity. We first compared woodpecker assemblages between forests and wood pastures. Second, we grouped features of wood pastures into three spatial contexts and addressed how these features related to the occurrence of three woodpecker species that are formally protected. Woodpecker species composition, but not the number of species, differed between forests and wood pastures, with the green woodpecker occurring more commonly in wood pastures, and the lesser spotted woodpecker more commonly in forests. Within wood pastures, the intermediate context (especially surrounding forest cover) best explained the presence of the grey-headed and middle spotted woodpecker. By contrast, variables describing local vegetation structure and characteristics of the surrounding landscape did not affect woodpecker occurrence in wood pastures. In contrast to many other parts of Europe, in which several species of woodpeckers have declined, the traditional rural landscape of Transylvania continues to provide habitat for several woodpecker species, both in forests and wood pastures. Given the apparent habitat value of wood pastures for woodpeckers we recommend wood pastures be explicitly considered in relevant policies of the European Union, namely the Habitats Directive and the EU Common Agricultural Policy. © 2013 Dorresteijn et al.},

abstract={The use of a bird community index that characterizes ecosystem integrity is very attractive to conservation planners and habitat managers, particularly in the absence of any single focal species. In riparian areas of the western USA, several attempts at arriving at a community index signifying a functioning riparian bird community have been made previously, mostly resorting to expert opinions or national conservation rankings for species weights. Because extensive local and regional bird monitoring data were available for Nevada, we were able to develop three different indices that were derived empirically, rather than from expert opinion. We formally examined the use of three species weighting schemes in comparison with simple species richness, using different definitions of riparian species assemblage size, for the purpose of predicting community response to changes in vegetation structure from riparian restoration. For the three indices, species were weighted according to the following criteria: (1) the degree of riparian habitat specialization based on regional data, (2) the relative conservation ranking of landbird species, and (3) the degree to which a species is under-represented compared to the regional species pool for riparian areas. To evaluate the usefulness of these indices for habitat restoration planning and monitoring, we modeled them using habitat variables that are expected to respond to riparian restoration efforts, using data from 64 sampling sites in the Walker River Basin in Nevada and California. We found that none of the species-weighting schemes performed any better as an index for evaluating overall habitat condition than using species richness alone as a community index. Based on our findings, the use of a fairly complete list of 30-35 riparian specialists appears to be the best indicator group for predicting the response of bird communities to the restoration of riparian vegetation. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The 280 000 km2 Xingu indigenous lands and protected areas (ILPAs) corridor, inhabited by 24 indigenous peoples and about 215 riverine (ribeirinho) families, lies across active agriculture frontiers in some of the historically highest-deforestation regions of the Amazon. Much of the Xingu is anthropogenic landscape, densely inhabited and managed by indigenous populations over the past millennium. Indigenous and riverine peoples' historical management and use of these landscapes have enabled their long-term occupation and ultimately their protection. The corridor vividly demonstrates how ILPAs halt deforestation and why they may account for a large part of the 70 per cent reduction in Amazon deforestation below the 1996-2005 average since 2005. However, ongoing and planned dams, road paving, logging and mining, together with increasing demand for agricultural commodities, continued degradation of upper headwaters outside ILPA borders and climate change impacts may render these gains ephemeral. Local peoples will need new, bottom-up, forms of governance to gain recognition for the high social and biological diversity of these territories in development policy and planning, and finance commensurate with the value of their ecosystem services. Indigenous groups' reports of changing fire and rainfall regimes may themselves evidence climate change impacts, a new and serious threat. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={In 2005, fire ignited by humans swept from Yuma Proving Grounds into Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona, burning ca. 9,255 ha of Wilderness Area. Fuels were predominantly the native forb Plantago ovata. Large fires at low elevations were rare in the 19th and 20th centuries, and fires fueled by native vegetation are undocumented in the southwestern deserts. We estimated the area damaged by fire using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, which are more accurate and reduce subjectivity of aerial surveys of perimeters of fires. Assemblages of upland and xeroriparian plants lost 91 and 81% of live cover, respectively, in fires. The trees Olneya tesota and Cercidium had high amounts of top-kill. King Valley was an important xeroriparian corridor for birds. Species richness of birds decreased significantly following the fire. Numbers of breeding birds were lower in burned areas of King Valley 3 years post-fire, compared to numbers in nearby but unburned Alamo Wash. Although birds function within a large geographic scale, the extent of this burn still influenced the relative abundance of local species of breeding birds. This suggests that breeding birds respond to conditions of localized burns and slow recovery of vegetation contributes to continued lower numbers of birds in the burned sites in King Valley.},

abstract={Despite a high degree of endemism (c. 30%) and the existence of some serious threats, the avifauna of the Comoro Islands remains poorly studied. This paper reports on a bird census conducted on Grand Comoro (Ngazidja) in the afromontane forest ecosystem of Mt Karthala. Point counts were conducted over a 3-month period (March-May 1999) in different habitat types, along an altitudinal gradient ranging from completely degraded forest plantations (400-800m elevation) to montane forest with modified understory (800-1200m elevation) and intact cloud forest (1200-1800m elevation) replaced by giant heathland at highest altitudes (>1800melevation). I tested whether or not species diversity, bird assemblages and level of endemism differed between habitat types. Furthermore, I investigated whether temporal changes had occurred since a previous census conducted in 1985-1989. Overall, 37 species were contacted during the census. No evidence of temporal changes in species diversity indices was detected during the short time interval separating both studies (10-15 years). However, the analysis could not account for the impact of increased areas of degraded forest on specific population sizes. Mean species richness and Shannon-Wiener index per point differed with respect to habitat type, being much lower in giant heathland. Mean species richness per point differed also with respect to factor "slope", being highest in south-western montane forest with modified understory and cloud forest. An altitudinal endemism gradient was apparent with only three endemic species characteristic of low- to mid-altitude degraded habitats, while the bulk of endemic species was restricted to intact patches of primary cloud forest (six species) and giant heathland above 1800m (one species). These findings, combined with the recent reports on ongoing levels of forest degradation and encroachment by local human populations, suggest that the survival of endemic forest species is dependent on the designation of a nationally-supported conservation area on Mt Karthala. © 2012 Istituto per lo Studio degli Ecosistemi of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Firenze.},

abstract={The ecological impacts of changing forest management practices in Europe are poorly understood despite European forests being highly managed. Furthermore, the effects of potential drivers of forest biodiversity decline are rarely considered in concert, thus limiting effective conservation or sustainable forest management. We present a trait-based framework that we use to assess the detrimental impact of multiple land-use and management changes in forests on bird populations across Europe. Major changes to forest habitats occurring in recent decades, and their impact on resource availability for birds were identified. Risk associated with these changes for 52 species of forest birds, defined as the proportion of each species' key resources detrimentally affected through changes in abundance and/or availability, was quantified and compared to their pan-European population growth rates between 1980 and 2009. Relationships between risk and population growth were found to be significantly negative, indicating that resource loss in European forests is an important driver of decline for both resident and migrant birds. Our results demonstrate that coarse quantification of resource use and ecological change can be valuable in understanding causes of biodiversity decline, and thus in informing conservation strategy and policy. Such an approach has good potential to be extended for predictive use in assessing the impact of possible future changes to forest management and to develop more precise indicators of forest health. © 2013 Wade et al.},

abstract={Background:As a result of past practices, many of the dry coniferous forests of the western United States contain dense, even-aged stands with uncharacteristically high levels of litter and downed woody debris. These changes to the forest have received considerable attention as they elevate concerns regarding the outcome of wildland fire. However, attempts to reduce biomass through fuel reduction (i.e., thinning of trees) are often opposed by public interest groups whose objectives include maintaining habitat for species of concern such as the spotted owl, Strix occidentalis, the northern goshawk, Accipiter gentilis, and the Pacific fisher, Martes pennanti. Whether protection of these upper-trophic level species confers adequate conservation of avian forest diversity is unknown.Methodology and Principal Findings:We use a multi-species occurrence model to estimate the habitat associations of 47 avian species detected at 742 sampling locations within an 880-km2 area in the Sierra Nevada. Our approach, which accounts for variations in detectability of species, estimates occurrence probabilities of all species in a community by linking species occurrence models into one hierarchical community model, thus improving inferences on all species, especially those that are rare or observed infrequently. We address how the avian community is influenced by covariates related to canopy cover, tree size and shrub cover while accounting for the impacts of abiotic variables known to affect species distributions.Conclusions and Significance:Environmental parameters estimated through our approach emphasize the importance of within and between stand-level heterogeneity in meeting biodiversity objectives and suggests that many avian species would increase under more open canopy habitat conditions than those favored by umbrella species of high conservation concern. Our results suggest that a more integrated approach that emphasizes maintaining a diversity of habitats across environmental gradients and minimizing urbanization may have a greater benefit to ecosystem functioning then a single-species management focus.},

abstract={Planting of woody perennial vegetation for carbon sequestration continues to gain momentum as markets for carbon develop in Australia. With the impetus of the Clean Energy Future package, these plantings have the potential to contribute to biodiversity gains if established and managed appropriately. In this study, we sought to link indicators of biodiversity to carbon storage in remnant vegetation, mixed-species native revegetation and single-species eucalypt plantations in the Mount Lofty Ranges (MLR) of South Australia. Native plant species richness was higher in remnant vegetation than in revegetation and plantation sites in the southern MLR, but only remnant and plantation sites were different in the northern MLR. Native bird species richness was higher in remnant than plantation sites, but revegetation sites were similar to both plantation and remnant sites in northern and southern sites. Mean total standing carbon varied across treatments in southern sites, and there were no statistically significant differences in mean carbon sequestration rate between planted treatments. Monoculture plantation sites lack the structural complexity required and offer limited resources for native fauna compared with mixed-species revegetation or remnant vegetation. This reinforces the importance of carefully constructed incentives to compensate landholders for potential carbon shortfalls if the opportunity for biodiversity gains from carbon plantings is to be realised in the longer term. The value of the standing carbon in remnant vegetation should also be recognised in emerging markets. © 2013 Ecological Society of Australia.},

We estimated population density for 12 species of birds within the perimeters of 4 fires that had undergone 8-20 years of vegetation recovery and on adjacent unburned areas in the northwestern Great Basin, USA. Six species showed negative responses to fire persisting up to 20 years. Two species showed positive responses with effects persisting for <20 years. Understory vegetation was similar between burned and unburned areas irrespective of recovery time, and shrub canopy cover was similar between burned and unburned sites after 20 years of recovery.

We studied stand-related environmental factors subject to forest management (stand structure, tree-species composition, accessibility by humans) in determining the distribution of these two species in mountainous forests of the Polish Carpathians. Data were collected during 2007-2009 at the Beskid Wyspowy Mountains. WbWs preferred multispecies deciduous over pure beech forests, whereas TtWs were most frequently found in spruce-dominated forests. The thresholds of dead and dying wood for WbW presence in managed forests were approximately 50 m3ha 1 and35m3ha respectively, and for TtW were approximately 30 m ha and 115 m ha , respectively. These were 5-8 times higher than in randomly-selected control plots with no woodpeckers. In both cases, lower logging intensity on difficult-to-access slopes and higher amount of dead and dying wood correlated with increasing occupancy probability of the woodpeckers. These results help develop classification criteria for the monitoring of woodpecker habitats over the Natura 2000 network and improve the ecological soundness of forest management guidelines.},

abstract={In many parts of the world, plantations make up a considerable proportion of the total forest area. In such regions, the identification of high biodiversity value stands and of management practices to enhance biodiversity is essential if the goals of Sustainable Forest Management are to be achieved. Since complete biodiversity assessments are rarely possible, efforts have been increasingly focussed on the use of indicators. Of particular interest are indicators applicable to individual stands that require no specialist taxonomic or technical knowledge to assess. Candidate biodiversity indicators had been identified in a previous study using data from Irish Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) plantationsbut had yet to be tested on independent data. In the present study, the provisional indicators for vascular plant, bryophyte, spider and bird diversity were tested on data from Irish Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), oak (Quercus petraea/Quercus robur), Sitka spruce and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) plantations. Conifer canopy cover was confirmed as an important biodiversity indicator, due to its influence on below-canopy microclimatic and structural conditions. Bryophyte species richness was higher in relatively high canopy cover plantations on poorly drained soils, while bird species richness was higher in more open plantations with high shrub cover. Coarse woody debris was an important substrate for forest-associated bryophytes, with higher species richness at higher volumes of deadwood. Both proximity to old woodland and stand age were confirmed as positive indicators for forest-associated vascular plants. This is related to dispersal limitation in these species, with nearby woodlands acting as important seed sources and colonisation increasing with time. Stand age was also confirmed as a positive indicator for forest-associated spiders and is related to the development of suitable habitat as the plantation matures. All of the confirmed indicators can be assessed without need for specialist knowledge, are ecologically meaningful and applicable to a range of forests managed under a clearfelling system. They can be used to assess the potential value of stands for the taxonomic groups to which they apply, as well as giving insights into management practices to enhance diversity in these groups. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In bocage dominated landscape, hedgerows are important nesting, feeding and shelter sites for birds. However, the modification and intensification of agro-pastoral practices occurring in bocage agrosystems strongly impact birdlife. The current study was aimed at measuring the impact of bocage management on birds depending on hedgerows. This study was conducted using two approaches: a descriptive analysis of bocage types (defined by hedgerow heights) and a statistic modelling of variables related to bocage management. Both approaches showed that birds responded to two variables, the maintenance of hedgerows and adjacent land use. A bocage with a low level of cutting will host a more diverse bird community than a bocage heavily cutted. This study provides recommendations for a bird friendly bocage management. Within the current context of the Common Agricultural Policy this study also highlights the necessity to rethink the Local Agri-Environmental Schemes in order to efficiently and sustainably respond to bocage ecological requirements.},

abstract={Field margin vegetation is among the last vestiges of semi-natural habitat for birds in many agricultural landscapes of tropical regions. However, field margins differ in size, structure, and flora, and their value to birds depends on all these factors and on species-specific habitat preferences. Therefore, we analyzed data on resident and neotropical migratory birds found in 40 field margins of the agricultural landscape of El Bajío, Guanajuato, Mexico. The structural and botanical characteristics of the field margin, and those of the adjacent landscape, were related to bird species richness and abundance. We recorded 61 species of birds of which 36 were migratory. Locally, the size of the field margin (width, height, volume), its vegetative vertical complexity, and the abundance of trees and tree species had a positive effect on bird species richness and abundance. Native trees, especially mesquites, were especially important for many birds observed foraging, nesting, and perching. The most important landscape-scale variables were the density of hedgerows around field margins and the distance to natural vegetation remnants (scrub forest). Bird species richness and abundance were positively affected by the length of the hedgerows within 100 and 200-m-radius circles centered on each field margin.

abstract={We studied responses of breeding birds to alternative regimes for managing tallgrass prairie at the Smoky Hill Air National Guard Range in central Kansas. Species richness, diversity, and evenness did not differ among treatments, but overall abundance was highest in unburned idle (i.e., not grazed or hayed) transects, and was lowest in idle transects burned that spring. However, no treatment was either superior or inferior to all others for attracting the highest numbers of every species. Dickcissels (Spiza americana) and Henlow's sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii) were most numerous in unburned idle units, grasshopper sparrows (A. savannarum) were most abundant in grazed units and hayed units, upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) were most often found in burned units, whereas eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) were less abundant in burned units than in all other treatments. We conclude that the recent switch to burning idle units every 3-4 years, rather than annually, has benefitted most grassland bird species. The variety of management regimes implemented at Smoky Hill Air National Guard Range fosters heterogeneity of vegetative structure across the landscape, and thereby allows the site to provide for differing needs of various species, thus enhancing its value for grassland bird conservation.},

abstract={As human demand for ecosystem products increases, management intervention may become more frequent after environmental disturbances. Evaluations of ecological responses to cumulative effects of management interventions and natural disturbances provide critical decision-support tools for managers who strive to balance environmental conservation and economic development. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the effects of salvage logging on avian community composition in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests affected by beetle outbreaks in Oregon, USA, 1996-1998. Treatments consisted of the removal of lodgepole pine snags only, and live trees were not harvested. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify occupancy dynamics for 27 breeding species, while accounting for variation in the detection process. We examined how magnitude and precision of treatment effects varied when incorporating prior information from a separate intervention study that occurred in a similar ecological system. Regardless of which prior we evaluated, we found no evidence that the harvest treatment had a negative impact on species richness, with an estimated average of 0.2-2.2 more species in harvested stands than unharvested stands. Estimated average similarity between control and treatment stands ranged from 0.82-0.87 (1 indicating complete similarity between a pair of stands) and suggested that treatment stands did not contain novel assemblies of species responding to the harvesting prescription. Estimated treatment effects were positive for twenty-four (90%) of the species, although the credible intervals contained 0 in all cases. These results suggest that, unlike most post-fire salvage logging prescriptions, selective harvesting after beetle outbreaks may meet multiple management objectives, including the maintenance of avian community richness comparable to what is found in unharvested stands. Our results provide managers with prescription alternatives to respond to severe beetle outbreaks that continue to occur across extensive portions of the dry forests of western North America. © 2013 Giovanini et al.},

abstract={In Mediterranean areas, river systems are key for maintaining regional biodiversity by providing a high diversity of habitats. We studied bird community recovery for 9 years (2001-2009) during landscape restoration and Guadiamar Green Corridor establishment in the area affected by the Aznalcóllar mine spill (SW Spain, 1998). One year following plant restoration (3 years after the spill), values for α- and β-bird species diversity were high, sooner than reported for similar restoration processes elsewhere. Species richness, ecological diversity, and abundance increased only slightly in the following 8 years. Overlap between communities in sequential years, measured by similarity indexes, increased throughout the study period to about 70% during final survey years, and most breeding bird species present before the accident again inhabit the area. Only 5 years after the mine accident, bird communities in the restored site were similar in species richness, abundance, and diversity to an unaffected reference site; redundancy analysis demonstrated that bird communities were also similar between the reference river and the Guadiamar. Despite the severity of the mine accident, our results suggest a swift recovery of the bird community. We attribute this success to the rapid restoration of habitat availability and the resilience of the birds. This long-term study contributes to our limited knowledge of bird species response to habitat restoration following toxic spills in Mediterranean habitats. © 2012 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={Open pine-grasslands are one of the most threatened ecological communities in the southeastern United States and provide essential habitat for many regionally declining bird species. While open pine-grassland forests have diminished, acreage of pine plantations has increased throughout the Southeast, in part because of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Bill conservation programs. To understand whether fire and herbicide treatments would be effective in creating pine-grassland structure in plantations suitable for a suite of declining early successional and pine-grassland adapted species, we evaluated combined effects of selective herbicide and prescribed fire on plant and bird communities in thinned, mid-rotation pine stands established under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in Mississippi, USA. Within each of the 12 replicate sites, we assigned 2 paired 8.1-ha plots to either treatment (herbicide + prescribed fire) or control in a randomized complete block design.We applied treatments during autumn and winter of 2002- 2003. During 2003-2006 breeding seasons, we characterized the bird community using repeated (4-6 repetitions/yr), standardized, 10-minute point counts from which we estimated species richness, total relative abundance, total avian conservation value, and density of select species. Managed plots exhibited reduced hardwood midstory and a greater abundance of grasses and forbs in the ground layer. Although avian species richness and total relative abundance were similar in treatment and control stands, we observed a shift in the bird community from closed-canopy forest species to early successional and pine-grassland adapted species, many of which are experiencing population declines. We recommend thinning, hardwood midstory control, and prescribed burning within CRP pine plantations to provide habitat for a suite of regionally declining bird species. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Aim: Management practices in the landscape matrix can have significant effects on the spatial distribution of animals within adjacent protected areas. This has been well established in agricultural and forested areas, but less is known about how management of the suburban matrix affects adjacent reserves. We argue that it is critically important to understand the impact of suburban management on reserves, as flawed planning decisions can have negative conservation outcomes and waste limited resources. Location: Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Methods: We examined bird distribution patterns in suburbs and adjacent reserves to the effects of two suburban management practices: (1) street tree planting and (2) boundary design. We focused on three groups of birds with known responses to urbanization: native urban-intolerant species (native avoiders), native urban-tolerant species (native adapters) and exotic urban-tolerant species (exotic adapters). Results: We found that suburbs with ≥30% native (Eucalyptus) street trees and reserves adjacent to these suburbs had significantly higher bird species richness, native adapter species richness and probability of reporting exotic adapters than those with exotic trees. The type of street trees, however, did not affect the probability of reporting native avoiders. These species were more likely to be reported when habitat complexity was high. Only native adapters responded to boundary design, with higher species richness when the boundary type was a local or unsealed road as opposed to an arterial road. Main conclusions: Native street trees provide foraging resources for birds that would be reduced or absent in exotic streetscapes, enabling native streetscapes to support a rich community of birds. Furthermore, native streetscapes increase bird richness and diversity in adjacent reserves. This result has important conservation implications for suburb and reserve management practices. Our study provides evidence that the establishment and retention of native suburban streetscapes is an important management strategy for improved bird conservation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Justification for investment in restored or constructed wetland projects are often based on presumed net increases in ecosystem services. However, quantitative assessment of performance metrics is often difficult and restricted to a single objective. More comprehensive performance assessments could help inform decision-makers about trade-offs in services provided by alternative restoration program design attributes. The primary goal of the Iowa Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program is to establish wetlands that efficiently remove nitrates from tile-drained agricultural landscapes. A secondary objective is provision of wildlife habitat. We used existing wildlife habitat models to compare relative net change in potential wildlife habitat value for four alternative landscape positions of wetlands within the watershed. Predicted species richness and habitat value for birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles generally increased as the wetland position moved lower in the watershed. However, predicted average net increase between pre- and post-project value was dependent on taxonomic group. The increased average wetland area and changes in surrounding upland habitat composition among landscape positions were responsible for these differences. Net change in predicted densities of several grassland bird species at the four landscape positions was variable and species-dependent. Predicted waterfowl breeding activity was greater for lower drainage position wetlands. Although our models are simplistic and provide only a predictive index of potential habitat value, we believe such assessment exercises can provide a tool for coarse-level comparisons of alternative proposed project attributes and a basis for constructing informed hypotheses in auxiliary empirical field studies. © 2013 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={Postfire salvage logging is currently a controversial issue because of the impact that the removal of snags has on ecosystem structure and function. Although it is a common practice worldwide, the absence of comparisons across regions hinders the development of broad generalizations. Here we compare bird response to postfire salvage logging in two regions with significant differences in landscape and bird communities, the Mediterranean Basin and the Rocky Mountains. The Mediterranean Basin features a landscape dominated by a mosaic of small-sized forests, farmland and shrublands, while the Rocky Mountains have large extensions of continuous forests. Bird conservation priorities are also different. In the Mediterranean Basin, priorities are oriented toward farmland birds, while they are oriented toward fire-specialists in the Rocky Mountains. We used databases describing bird species occurrence in burned forests from both regions and defined three groups of species based on their level of association with snags. We then compared the richness of each group among logged and unlogged sites, and also between regions. We found a higher proportion of species that showed some degree of association with snags in burned forests of the Rocky Mountains than in the Mediterranean Basin. Highly snag-associated birds from both regions showed a common negative response to salvage logging. Not snag-associated species increased in salvaged areas, but only in the Mediterranean Basin. The general negative effect of salvage logging on forest-dwelling species that are associated with trees or snags is a noteworthy pattern given the big differences between regions. Nevertheless, in the Mediterranean, some threatened farmland species benefit from logging, so the overall effect of the removal of snags appears to be relatively more detrimental to birds in the Rocky Mountains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={It is often assumed that a fine-scaled mosaic of different times-since-fire supports greater biodiversity than a coarsescaled mosaic - the fire mosaic hypothesis. A potential mechanism of the fire mosaic hypothesis is the effect of area on species diversity. We investigated the effect of patch area on bird communities in mulga (Acacia aneura) woodland in central Australia. The study was conducted at Uluru Kata-Tjuta National Park using 55 fixed-area sites classified to the time since last fire: burnt 2002; burnt 1976 and long unburnt. Birds were surveyed in the winter and spring of 2005 and 2006. Of 20 key species, two showed a positive density-area effect (i.e. higher density in larger patches). Patch area did not affect total bird density or species richness. However, species turnover (ß-diversity) was greater in large patches in the burnt 2002 treatment than it was in small patches. There was no effect of patch area on the composition of the bird communities in any of the time-since-fire classes. We concluded that patch area did affect the distribution of some birds in mulga woodland. However, patch area was not a mechanism of the fire mosaic hypothesis because the effects of patch size tended to increase avian diversity in larger patches rather than small.},

abstract={As the global demand for the reliable provision of virtually all ecosystem services increases, it is imperative to conduct experimental research that tests specific mechanisms or drivers of the ecological processes that link to services, and whether these management actions can affect biodiversity and processes synergistically. Agroforestry systems are ideal for such experiments due to their increased uniformity and the relative ease with which factors can be manipulated and isolated. Manipulating the availability of food resources, we carried out an experimental test of this potential driver on bird diversity measures and the predatory services provided by birds in coffee agroforests. We constructed exclosures over coffee plants to measure arthropod removal intensity by birds comparing coffee agroforests with and without food resource (fruit) enrichment (the driver). Fruit enrichment agroforests had significantly greater bird species density (50%), overall abundance (55%), and abundance of understory insectivore specialists (89%) compared with control agroforests. Although 48 percent more arthropods were aspirated from coffee plants inside exclosures compared to coffee plants outside exclosures, fruit resource enrichment did not influence predatory activity by birds in the agroforests. The results of this study highlight the difficulties associated with managing lands for ecosystem services in complex ecosystems- management actions aimed at increasing numbers of the organisms involved in the interactions of ecological processes is not always equivalent to managing for an increase in the process itself. © 2012 The Authors Journal compilation © 2012 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract={Extensive conversion of natural areas for agricultural production has had many consequences, including reduced habitat for nesting birds. Increasing focus on habitat re-establishment has led to the establishment of patches of perennial herbaceous vegetation in these agricultural landscapes, although these often consist ofmonotypic grass fields with little vegetation diversity. In 2001 and 2002, we assessed songbird responses to mowing followed by a soil disturbance (disking) meant to increase vegetation diversity and abundance of arthropod food resources in conservation easements in East-central Iowa, USA.We randomly assigned fields to disking and control treatments and collected data on breeding bird density and species richness in these habitats before and after treatments were applied. Disking increased density of all species combined, several individual species including dickcissel (Spiza americana; a declining species of concern), and overall conservation value of bird communities in treated fields. Total bird density increased with disking when the size of disked area was relatively small, and dickcissels and American goldfinches (Spinus tristis) responded positively and negatively to block-shaped treatments, respectively. Most species either showed no response or increased in density with disking. Changes associated with disking treatments were likely related to changes in both vegetation structure and increased abundance and biomass of arthropod food resources. Disking appears to be an effective management practice for maintaining herbaceous habitats, increasing vegetation diversity and food availability for insectivorous birds, and increasing habitat quality for priority bird species. Given the increasing availability of monotypic grasslands in agricultural landscapes, this practice may provide a relatively inexpensive way to improve re-established habitats. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Abstract.-Relating population density to spatially explicit habitat characteristics can inform management by directing efforts to areas with lower densities or focusing conservation and land protection on high-density areas. We conducted point-transect surveys for the endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla) in the live-fire region of Fort Hood, Texas. We used mark-recapture distance sampling and combined a Horvitz-Thompson estimator with a habitat-based, resourceselection gradient to estimate spatially explicit density for both species. We detected Golden-cheeked Warblers at 120 locations (202, 197, and 89 detected by primary, secondary, and both observers, respectively) and Black-capped Vireos at 173 locations (241, 255, and 107 detected by primary, secondary, and both observers, respectively). For Golden-cheeked Warblers, the average (± SE) composite detection probability estimate within a 100-m point-sample radius was 0.57 ± 0.14, and for vireos it was 0.24 ± 0.02. Estimated mean density (singing males ha-1) was 0.14 ± 0.03 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08-0.23) and 0.47 ± 0.05 (95% CI: 0.38-0.60) for Golden-cheeked Warblers and Black-capped Vireos, respectively. Our analysis suggested evidence of heterogeneity in the detection process for both species, as well as imperfect detection at distance g(0), both of which would bias estimated densities if ignored. Additionally, both species exhibited spatial variability in estimated densities, with those areas that had higher occurrence probabilities typically having higher estimated density. In the absence of spatially explicit density prediction, managers must treat all losses of potential habitat for endangered species uniformly, despite likely differences in conservation value. Our approach could be used to ascertain areas of changing density in relation to changing habitat conditions over time and space.© 2013 by The American Ornithologists' Union. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We undertook reconstructions of historical ponderosa pine forest structure and fire regimes across an entire landscape to expand understanding of spatial variability in forest structure and dynamics. The study area includes the ponderosa pine forests of the Coconino Plateau, Arizona, USA. Using General Land Office survey data and newly developed methods, we examined surveyor descriptions of overstory and understory composition and structure across 60,998 ha. For 41,214 ha of forests, we reconstructed density, basal area, diameter-class distributions, and fire severity and used GIS to analyse their relationships with topography. Ponderosa pine forests were continuous in only 34 % of the 60,998 ha landscape. In 40 %, they were mixed with piñon-juniper, 24 % was pure piñon-juniper and 2 % were grass or shrubs. In ponderosa pine forests, the focus of this study, mean tree density was 144. 2 trees ha-1; 18. 8 % of the landscape had low tree density (&amp;100 trees ha-1) and 17. 4 % had high tree density (&gt;200 trees ha-1). Small trees (&lt;30 cm d. b. h.) composed &gt;50 % of all trees on 47 % of the landscape and large trees (&gt;40 cm) composed &gt;50 % of all trees on 21 % of the landscape. Low-severity fire likely structured the forest on 59 % of the landscape while 39 % was structured by mixed-severity fire, likely including small, patchy crown fires. Forest parameters displayed wide variability across environmental gradients. Broader-scale reconstructions revealed a much more spatially complex forest that was structured by wide range of fire severities. Variability in ponderosa pine forests was often under-reported in past studies, but is important in perpetuating biological diversity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The humid tropical insular Southeast Asian region is one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world. It contains around 70 Gt of carbon stored in peat deposits susceptible to burning when drained and it has significantly higher population density than any other humid tropical region. This region experiences yearly fire activity of anthropogenic origin with widely varying extent and severity. At the same time, there are several geographic, climatic, and social aspects that complicate fire monitoring in the region. In this review article, we analyse the current knowledge and limitations of active fire detection and burnt area mapping in insular Southeast Asia, highlighting the special characteristics of the region that affect all types of remote-sensing-based regional-level fire monitoring. We conclude that the monitoring methods currently employed have serious limitations that directly affect the reliability of results for fire and burnt area monitoring in this region. With the materials and methods presently available, the regional and global effects of fire activity taking place in insular Southeast Asia are in danger of being underestimated. New approaches utilizing higher spatial and temporal resolution remote-sensing data are needed for more detailed quantification of fire activity and subsequently improved estimation of the effects of fires in this region. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Worldwide declines in shorebird populations, driven largely by habitat loss and degradation, motivate environmental managers to preserve and restore the critical coastal habitats on which these birds depend. Effective habitat management requires an understanding of the factors that determine habitat use and value to shorebirds, extending from individuals to the entire community. While investigating the factors that influenced shorebird foraging distributions among neighboring intertidal sand flats, we built upon species-level understandings of individual-based, small-scale foraging decisions to develop more comprehensive guild- and community-level insights. We found that densities and community composition of foraging shorebirds varied substantially among elevations within some tidal flats and among five flats despite their proximity (all located within a 400-m stretch of natural, unmodified inlet shoreline). Non-dimensional multivariate analyses revealed that the changing composition of the shorebird community among flats and tidal elevations correlated significantly (ρs = 0.56) with the spatial structure of the benthic invertebrate prey community. Sediment grain-sizes affected shorebird community spatial patterns indirectly by influencing benthic macroinvertebrate community compositions. Furthermore, combining sediment and macroinvertebrate information produced a 27% increase in correlation (ρs = 0.71) with shorebird assemblage patterns over the correlation of the bird community with the macroinvertebrate community alone. Beyond its indirect effects acting through prey distributions, granulometry of the flats influenced shorebird foraging directly by modifying prey availability. Our study highlights the importance of habitat heterogeneity, showing that no single patch type was ideal for the entire shorebird community. Generally, shorebird density and diversity were greatest at lower elevations on flats when they became exposed; these areas are at risk from human intervention by inlet sand mining, construction of groins and jetties that divert sediments from flats, and installation of seawalls on inlet shorelines that induce erosion of flats. © 2012 VanDusen et al.},

abstract={It is essential to choose suitable habitat when reintroducing a species into its former range. Habitat quality may influence an individual's dispersal decisions and also ultimately where they choose to settle. We examined whether variation in habitat quality (quantified by the level of ground vegetation cover and the installation of nest boxes) influenced the movement, habitat choice and survival of a reintroduced bird species. We experimentally reintroduced seven social groups (43 individuals) of the brown treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) into two nature reserves in south-eastern Australia. We radio-tracked 18 brown treecreepers from release in November 2009 until February 2010. We observed extensive movements by individuals irrespective of the release environment or an individual's gender. This indicated that individuals were capable of dispersing and actively selecting optimum habitat. This may alleviate pressure on wildlife planners to accurately select the most optimum release sites, so long as the species' requirements are met. There was significant variation in movement between social groups, suggesting that social factors may be a more important influence on movement than habitat characteristics. We found a significant effect of ground vegetation cover on the likelihood of settlement by social groups, with high rates of settlement and survival in dry forests, rather than woodland (where the species typically resides), which has implications for the success of woodland restoration. However, overall the effects of variation in habitat quality were not as strong as we had expected, and resulted in some unpredicted effects such as low survival and settlement in woodland areas with medium levels of ground vegetation cover. The extensive movement by individuals and unforeseen effects of habitat characteristics make it difficult to predict the outcome of reintroductions, the movement behaviour and habitat selection of reintroduced individuals, particularly when based on current knowledge of a species' ecology. © 2012 Bennett et al.},

A total of 127 fauna species were recorded, which included 19 of the possible 21 threatened fauna species.The 127 species comprised 37 reptile species, 15 bat species, three small mammal species and 72 bird species.The mean species richness recorded at each three hectare survey site for birds was 14.7, reptiles 7.1, small ground dwelling mammals 0.5 and bats 3.0. Mean abundance for birds was 42.7, reptiles 13.1, small ground dwelling mammals 1.0 and microbats 3.7.These surveys represent the most comprehensive inventory of fauna of the Dune Mallee Woodlands of the Lower Murray Darling catchment. Furthermore, these surveys are a platform upon which to detect changes in abundance and persistence of priority threatened fauna species, as a way of measuring outcomes of property management agreements and offset reserves where land management has been enhanced by actions such as exotic herbivore removal and predator control.},

abstract={Silvicultural practices lead to changes in forest composition and structure and may impact species diversity from the overall regional species pool to stand-level species occurrence. We explored to what extent fine-scale occupancy patterns in differently managed forest stands are driven by environment and ecological traits in three regions in Germany using a multi-species hierarchical model. We tested for the possible impact of environmental variables and ecological traits on occupancy dynamics in a joint modelling exercise while taking possible variation in coefficient estimates over years and plots into account. Bird species richness differed across regions and years, and trends in species richness across years were different in the three regions. On the species level, forest management affected occupancy of species in all regions, but only 3-5% of the total assemblage-level variation in occurrence probability was explained by either forest type and successional stage and <1% by forest edge. On the assemblage level, bird occurrence decreased with body mass in all regions. Species with smaller breeding ranges had lower occurrence probabilities in one region, while later spring arrival decreased occurrence probabilities in the two other regions. Spatial variation in the effect size of trait covariates such as species phylogeny and breeding strata showed that variation in patch occupancy due to fine-scale differences in forest management is, to some extent, predictable from ecological traits. Our results show that environmental factors and ecological traits jointly predict variation in bird occupancy patterns and their response to forest management. Observations at the fine scale of forest stands, at which conservation efforts can be arranged along with forest management practices in heterogeneous environments, have been shown to provide meaningful insights despite the difficulties involved in monitoring mobile organisms such as birds at the plot level.

abstract={Grass management has been used for many years at airports in an attempt to reduce numbers of birds and other wildlifeand the collisions with aircraft associated with them. We evaluated the impacts of grassland alteration by mowing and fire on the abundance, diversity, and frequency of birds using 1 control and 2 experimental grass plots from 2009 to 2010 on a U.S. Army airfield in Colorado located in short-grass prairie. Density of breeding birds was highest in the mowed plot. Numbers of birds observed in 34 surveys conducted during the non-breeding season in the burned (X̄ = 41) and mowed (X̄ = 24) plots were greater than in an unmanaged control (X̄ = 7) plot. Bird species diversity in the nonbreeding season was greatest in the control plot. Horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) was the most frequently observed bird species and occurred inhigh numbers on the burned and mowed plots, possibly because of its preference for short vegetation and bare ground. This species is recognized as hazardous to aircraft in part because of its habit of forming large flocks in the nonbreeding season. All 3 study plots were dominated by grasses and forbs, with minimal shrub and cactus cover. Littercover was greatest on the control plot, while the burned plot had the greatest coverage of bare ground. Results from this study are limitedbecause the small size of the airfield precluded placement of multiple treatment plots. Additional studyin larger airfields with multiple treatment plots would be required before management recommendations regarding the use of fire and mowing can be made for airfields in areas with short-grass prairie.},

In particular, management techniques that control water to provide fresh (<0.5 ppt) and intermediate (0.5- 5 ppt) marsh in a landscape dominated by brackish and saline marsh. However, research is needed to assess the effectiveness of these techniques in providing waterbird habitat. During 2007-09 along the central Texas Coast, we investigated the effects of marsh management on bird, plant, and aquatic invertebrate communities by comparing leveed areas within the coastal marsh that received water level and mechanical management, to adjacent nonmanaged marsh that received no hydrologic or mechanical manipulations. Managed marshes supported more bird species, greater waterbird densities, greater plant diversity, and greater aquatic invertebrate biomass than nonmanaged sites. However, nonmanaged wetlands supported greater densities and more species of secretive marsh birds (e.g., rails). Management of coastal marsh that reduces water salinities and suppresses plant succession appears to be a possible way to mitigate the effects of declines in fresh and intermediate marsh on nonbreeding waterbirds. © Society of Wetland Scientists 2012.},

abstract={Aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) comprises only a small fraction (1 %) of the Sierra Nevada landscape, yet contributes significant biological diversity to this range. In an effort to rejuvenate declining aspen stands, the Bureau of Land Management conducted conifer removal in three sites (2004 to 2006) and prescribed fire in two sites (2007). The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of these treatments. In each site, aspen densities in three regeneration size classes were measured in treated and untreated transects before and up to five years post-treatment. Five years after treatment, two of the three conifer removal sites showed significant improvement over controls in the density of total stems and two of three regeneration size classes. The third site did not show significant gains over controls in any size class and experienced significant aspen overstory mortality three years after treatment, which was attributed to sunscald and advanced age at the time of treatment. Three years after treatment, the two prescribed fire sites showed significant increases in total stem density and two regeneration size classes, but also exhibited significant stem mortality, which was likely due to a combination of herbivory and drought. Overall, both treatments can be effective, but future treatments should incorporate methods to reduce post-treatment mortality of residual aspen and new sprouts.},

abstract={Structure retention is a practice used in managed forests to assist the conservation of biological diversity, whereby green trees, dead trees (i.e. snags), and downed wood are retained during timber harvest. This activity is recognized as beneficial. However, there is little scientific support to guide the management prescriptions (e.g. patch sizes, distribution pattern). We quantified the short-term response of birds to structure retention in timber harvest areas located in the Pacific Northwest. We used a hierarchical community model to examine how attributes of retention sites (number of trees and snags, distance to forest edge) were associated with the species richness of birds using the sites. The modeling framework integrated multiple species-specific occupancy models that accounted for imperfect detection to produce estimates of species richness. We sampled a biogeoclimatic gradient by selecting harvest units within four separate regions (two in Washington, one each in Oregon and California) that support different forest types. Observations were conducted at a random selection of retention sites (e.g. patches, individual trees) within harvest units to record bird use during the breeding seasons of 2008 and 2009. Estimated occupancy and detection probabilities differed by species and region. Retained tree count was associated with an increased occupancy probability for all observed species. The community response to tree count was consistent across all study regions and years - species richness estimates increased with tree count and approximated a species-area curve. Snag count and edge distance did not significantly affect occupancy probability for any observed species, and therefore, had no relationship with species richness. These results suggest that the diversity of birds using structure retention in harvest units can be maximized at patches of >10-15 rotation-age trees. Forest managers are encouraged to group green-trees around high-quality snags and other unique wildlife trees where possible, and to vary prescriptions across stands to provide habitat heterogeneity at the landscape scale. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Agricultural intensification is a leading cause of global biodiversity loss, especially for threatened and near-threatened species. One widely implemented response is 'wildlife-friendly farming', involving the close integration of conservation and extensive farming practices within agricultural landscapes. However, the putative benefits from this controversial policy are currently either unknown or thought unlikely to extend to rare and declining species. Here, we show that new, evidence-based approaches to habitat creation on intensively managed farmland in England can achieve large increases in plant, bee and bird species. In particular, we found that habitat enhancement methods designed to provide the requirements of sensitive target biota consistently increased the richness and abundance of both rare and common species, with 10-fold to greater than 100-fold more rare species per sample area than generalized conventional conservation measures. Furthermore, targeting landscapes of high species richness amplified beneficial effects on the least mobile taxa: plants and bees. Our results provide the first unequivocal support for a national wildlifefriendly farming policy and suggest that this approach should be implemented much more extensively to address global biodiversity loss. However, to be effective, these conservation measures must be evidence-based, and developed using sound knowledge of the ecological requirements of key species. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

We have evaluated and compared bird species communities along two long-term chronosequences after fire (0 to >200 years post-fire) in the eastern Quebec boreal forest, which is known for its long fire-return intervals. By characterizing forest habitat in stands of different ages (time since fire), we were able to model species richness and bird community characteristics in three habitat types: mature forests, forest-edge, and open-forests. Although bird species richness did not vary greatly, our results show changes in species composition following successional stages and highlight the need to protect the forest at all stages, especially old-growth, which provides a heterogeneous environment suitable for several species. Keeping a mosaic composed of all-age, fire-disturbed forests should facilitate the conservation of bird diversity in the eastern boreal forest. © 2012 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.},

abstract={Emergent sandbars on the Missouri River are actively managed for two listed bird species, piping plovers and interior least terns. As a plunge-diving piscivore, endangered least terns rely on ready access to appropriately sized slender-bodied fish: <52mm total length for adults and <34mm total length for young chicks. As part of a multi-agency recovery programme, aimed at enhancing nesting habitat for plovers and terns, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers mechanically created several emergent sandbars on the Missouri River. However, it was unknown whether sandbar construction is a benefit or a detriment to forage abundance for least terns. Therefore, we studied the shallow-water (<1.5m) fish community near river and mechanically created emergent sandbars during three nesting seasons (2006-2008). We sampled every 2weeks each year from late May to July within 15-16 areas to document the relative abundance, species richness and size classes of fish. Fish relative abundance was negatively related to depth. Catches were dominated by schooling species, including emerald shiner, sand shiner, spotfin shiner and bigmouth buffalo. Significant inter-annual differences in relative abundance were observed, with generally increasing trends in intra-seasonal relative abundance of shiners and the smallest size classes of fish (<34mm). Significant differences in the fish communities between the sandbar types were not detected in this study. Results suggest that mechanical sandbar habitats host comparable fish communities at similar levels of relative abundance. Further analyses are required to evaluate if the levels of fish relative abundance are adequate to support least tern foraging and reproduction. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Predicting the response of faunal communities to fire presents a challenge for land managers worldwide because the post-fire responses of species may vary between locations and fire events. Post-fire recovery can occur via nucleated recovery from in situ surviving populations or by colonization from ex situ populations. Fine-scale spatial patterns in the patchiness of fires and the proximity of burnt sites to source populations may contribute to both the variability in post-fire responses and the processes by which populations recover. We examined the avifauna at recently burnt sites within extensive semi-arid shrublands of south-eastern Australia, including 72 sites &lt;5 years since fire and 26 sites 10 years since fire. Study sites represented a gradient of increasing distance from 'unburnt' vegetation (i.e. &gt;27 years since fire) and varied in the presence or absence of small (25-900m 2 ) unburnt patches of vegetation. For sites &lt;5 years since fire, species richness was higher at sites closer to unburnt vegetation and at sites containing unburnt patches. These patterns were no longer evident at sites of 10 years since fire. The probability of occurrence of three of seven bird species modelled decreased with increasing distance to unburnt vegetation, but this pattern was evident only at sites burnt uniformly. One species was found almost exclusively at patchily burnt sites. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that proximity to unburnt vegetation enhances post-fire occupancy, and that colonization from ex situ populations is an important process for post-fire recovery of avifauna. Additionally, small unburnt patches enhance the rapid recovery of assemblages post-fire. These patterns are important for understanding the dynamics of post-fire population recovery. We recommend that management of fire for ecological purposes should explicitly consider the role that the spatial attributes of fires play in determining the post-fire community. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.},

We determined if bird, aquatic macroinvertebrate, and plant communities differed among dredged ponds, natural ponds, and areas of monotypic cattail-reed to investigate effects of dredging, May-August 2011. Marsh-bird relative abundance was 40%greater at dredged and natural ponds than cattail-reed areas, and richness was at least 16 % greater at dredged ponds than natural ponds and cattail-reed areas. Relative abundance of macroinvertebrates was 77 % greater in dredged than natural ponds. Plant species richness was 57 and 54 % greater, respectively, and diversity 42% greater at dredged ponds than natural ponds and cattail-reed areas.

abstract={Increasing human populations have resulted in aggressive water development in arid regions. This development typically results in altered stream flow regimes, reduced annual flow volumes, changes in fluvial disturbance regimes, changes in groundwater levels, and subsequent shifts in ecological patterns and processes. Balancing human demands for water with environmental requirements to maintain functioning ecosystems requires quantitative linkages between water in streams and ecosystem attributes. Streams in the Sonoran Desert provide important habitat for vertebrate species, including resident and migratory birds. Habitat structure, food, and nest-building materials, which are concentrated in riparian areas, are provided directly or indirectly by vegetation. We measured riparian vegetation, groundwater and surface water, habitat structure, and bird occurrence along Cherry Creek, a perennial tributary of the Salt River in central Arizona, USA. The purpose of this work was to develop an integrated model of groundwater-vegetation-habitat structure and bird occurrence by: (1) characterizing structural and provisioning attributes of riparian vegetation through developing a bird habitat index (BHI), (2) validating the utility of our BHI through relating it to measured bird community composition, (3) determining the riparian plant species that best explain the variability in BHI, (4) developing predictive models that link important riparian species to fluvial disturbance and groundwater availability along an arid-land stream, and (5) simulating the effects of changes in flow regime and groundwater levels and determining their consequences for riparian bird communities. Riparian forest and shrubland vegetation cover types were correctly classified in 83% of observations as a function of fluvial disturbance and depth to water table. Groundwater decline and decreased magnitude of fluvial disturbance caused significant shifts in riparian cover types from riparian forest to shrublands. Variability in the BHI was best explained by the cover of deciduous riparian tree species, primarily Populus fremontii, Platanus wrightii, and Salix gooddingii. The distributions of these plant species were well explained by the depth to groundwater and magnitude of fluvial disturbance along the stream. Bird species diversity and richness were significantly higher in sites with higher habitat indices. This quantitative linkage between surface and groundwater, plant species composition, habitat complexity, and bird communities has implications for water management and in determining environmental flows. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Agricultural intensification in western Europe has caused a dramatic loss of grassland surfaces in farmlands, which have resulted in strong declines in grassland invertebrates, leading to cascade effects at higher trophic levels among consumers of invertebrates. Grasshoppers are important components of grassland invertebrate assemblages in European agricultural ecosystems, particularly as prey for bird species. Understanding how grasshopper populations are distributed in fragmented landscapes with low grassland availability is critical for both studies in biodiversity conservation and insect management. We assessed the range and strength of spatial autocorrelation for two grasshopper taxa (Gomphocerinae subfamily and Calliptamus italicus L.) across an intensive farmland in western France. Data from surveys carried out over 8 yr in 1,715 grassland fields were analyzed using geostatistics. Weak spatial patterns were observed at small spatial scales, suggesting important local effects of management practices on grasshopper densities. Spatial autocorrelation patterns for both grasshopper taxa were only detected at intermediate scales. For Gomphocerinae, the range of spatial autocorrelation varied from 802 to 2,613 m according to the year, depending both on grasshopper density and on grassland surfaces in the study site, whereas spatial patterns for the Italian locust were more variable and not related to grasshopper density or grassland surfaces. Spatial patterns in the distribution of Gomphocerinae supported our hypothesis that habitat availability was a major driver of grasshopper distribution in the landscape, and suggested it was related to density-dependent processes such as dispersal. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={Riparian and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) woodlands are centers of avian abundance and diversity in the western United States, but they have been affected adversely by land use practices, particularly livestock grazing. In 1990, cattle were removed from a 112,500-ha national wildlife refuge in southeastern Oregon. Thereafter, we monitored changes in vegetation and bird abundance in years 1-3 (phase 1) and 10-12 (phase 2) in 17 riparian and 9 snow-pocket aspen plots. On each 1.5-ha plot, we sampled vegetation in 6 transects. Three times during each breeding season, observers recorded all birds 50 m to each side of the plot's 150-m centerline for 25 minutes. We analyzed data with multivariate analysis of variance and paired t tests with p values adjusted for multiple comparisons. In both periods, riparian and snow-pocket aspen produced extensive regeneration of new shoots (stems/ha and 7079 stems/ha, respectively). By phase 2, a 64% increase in medium-diameter trees in riparian stands indicated successful recruitment into the overstory, but this pattern was not seen in snow-pocket stands, where the density of trees was over 2 times greater. By phase 2 in riparian and snow-pocket stands, native forb cover had increased by 68% and 57%, respectively, mesic shrub cover had increased by 29% and 58%, and sagebrush cover had decreased by 24% and 31%. Total avian abundance increased by 33% and 39% in riparian and snow-pocket aspen, respectively, ground or understory nesters increased by 133% and 67% and overstory nesters increased by 34% and 33%. Similarly, ground or understory foragers increased by 25% and 32%, aerial foragers by 55% and 57%, and overstory foragers by 66% and 43%. We interpreted the substantial regeneration of aspen shoots, increased densities of riparian forbs and shrubs, and increased avian abundances as a multitrophic-level response to the total removal of livestock and as substantial movement toward recovery of biological integrity. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of fires on bird diversity in Australia's tropical savannas. Bird surveys were conducted at 69 sites between 2005 and 2007 to estimate bird species richness and abundance within the Mornington Sanctuary, the Kimberley, north-west Australia. We used MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and Landsat satellite imagery to map fire scars and to quantify vegetation cover parameters, and QuickBird imagery to map the percentage tree cover. Bird species richness and abundance were higher in areas exhibiting minimum seasonal and interannual changes, e.g. in riparian areas, near water and where tree cover was high. We found a significant negative effect of fire on bird diversity following the extensive late dry-season fires of 2006. These findings support the view that intense and large fires are threatening biodiversity and reinforce the importance of reducing the occurrence of late dry-season fires, which are the most severe and extensive. MODIS satellite imagery was found to provide a cost-effective approach to monitoring savanna landscapes, assessing the state of vegetation and monitoring fire dynamics. © 2012 IAWF.},

abstract={Public lands are often tasked with ecosystem restoration that may include fire as a management tool in order to foster the return of ecosystem composition, structure, or function to a previous state. In some ecosystems, such as woodlands, the role of fire is poorly understood because mixed-fire regimes complicate assessment of landscape level fire return intervals and successional pathways. Management of these public woodlands may be difficult due to the need to accomplish multiple objectives such as carbon (C) sequestration and wildlife conservation on properties with marginal productivity. To assess the role of fire in affecting various ecological processes and offer information for future wildland management decision-making, we measured C storage, vegetation composition, and habitat suitability for an endangered bird species (golden-cheeked warbler, Dendroica chrysoparia) in juniper-oak woodlands with documented past surface fires within Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge. We found significantly different total aboveground biomass C with average values of 5.25, 6.86, and 9.18kgm -2 of C for 60 plots grouped into recent (&lt;40year), old (≥40year), and no fire treatments, respectively. Interpretation of fire for each plot was based on fire scar data derived from a previous tree-ring study for the refuge. We found fire significantly reduced site C primarily due to reduced tree density. We also found increased oak recruitment associated with fires that occurred in low summer precipitation years. Calculated habitat suitability index values for the golden-cheeked warbler did not significantly differ between groups. However, fire may have a dual effect on habitat suitability. While catastrophic wildfire can damage potential habitat and significantly reduce regional carbon storage, our study showed that moderate intensity fires in dense young juniper stands promotes tree species diversity, favorable for future habitat formation. We conclude that fire as a management focus, including use of prescribed burning and fuel treatments to reduce wildfire risk, may be implemented on a single conservation property to achieve multiple expected outcomes. However, this requires detailed ecological information regarding woody species composition and population structure to help assess legacy conditions that influence the interpretation of present woodland conditions and future projections given restoration efforts. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Ecological restoration is increasingly used to reverse degradation of rare ecosystems and maintain biological diversity. Pollinator communities are critical to maintenance of plant diversity and, in light of recent pollinator loss, we tested whether removal of invasive glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus L.) from portions of a prairie fen wetland altered plant and pollinator communities. We compared herbaceous plant, bee, and butterfly abundance, diversity, and species composition in buckthorn invaded, buckthorn removal, and uninvaded reference plots. Following restoration, we found striking differences in plant and pollinator abundance and species composition between restored, unrestored, and reference plots. Within 2 years of F. alnus removal, plant species diversity and composition in restored plots were significantly different than invaded plots, but also remained significantly lower than reference plots. In contrast, in the first growing season following restoration, bee and butterfly abundance, diversity, and composition were similar in restored and reference plots and distinct from invaded plots. Our findings indicate that a diverse community of mobile generalist pollinators rapidly re-colonizes restored areas of prairie fen, while the plant community may take longer to fully recover. This work implies that, in areas with intact pollinator metapopulations, restoration efforts will likely prevent further loss of mobile generalist pollinators and maintain pollination services. On the other hand, targeted restoration efforts will likely be required to restore populations of rare plants and specialist pollinators for which local and regional species pools may be lacking. © 2011 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract={Human-induced increases in nitrogen (N) deposition are common across many terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. Greater N availability not only reduces biological diversity, but also affects the biogeochemical coupling of carbon (C) and N cycles in soil ecosystems. Soils are the largest active terrestrial C pool and N deposition effects on soil C sequestration or release could have global importance. Here, we show that 27 years of chronic N additions to prairie grasslands increased C sequestration in mineral soils and that a potential mechanism responsible for this C accrual was an N-induced increase in root mass. Greater soil C sequestration followed a dramatic shift in plant community composition from native-speciesrich C4 grasslands to naturalized-species-rich C3 grasslands, which, despite lower soil C gains per unit of N added, still acted as soil C sinks. Since both high plant diversity and elevated N deposition may increase soil C sequestration, but N deposition also decreases plant diversity, more research is needed to address the long-term implications for soil C storage of these two factors. Finally, because exotic C3 grasses often come to dominate N-enriched grasslands, it is important to determine if such N-dependent soil C sequestration occurs across C3 grasslands in other regions worldwide. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Background: Managers of landscapes dedicated to forest commodity production require information about how practices influence biological diversity. Individual species and communities may be threatened if management practices truncate or simplify forest age classes that are essential for reproduction and survival. For instance, the degradation and loss of complex diverse forest in young age classes have been associated with declines in forest-associated Neotropical migrant bird populations in the Pacific Northwest, USA. These declines may be exacerbated by intensive forest management practices that reduce hardwood and broadleaf shrub cover in order to promote growth of economically valuable tree species in plantations. Methodology and Principal Findings: We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to evaluate relationships between avian species richness and vegetation variables that reflect stand management intensity (primarily via herbicide application) on 212 tree plantations in the Coast Range, Oregon, USA. Specifically, we estimated the influence of broadleaf hardwood vegetation cover, which is reduced through herbicide applications, on bird species richness and individual species occupancy. Our model accounted for imperfect detection. We used average predictive comparisons to quantify the degree of association between vegetation variables and species richness. Both conifer and hardwood cover were positively associated with total species richness, suggesting that these components of forest stand composition may be important predictors of alpha diversity. Estimates of species richness were 35-80% lower when imperfect detection was ignored (depending on covariate values), a result that has critical implications for previous efforts that have examined relationships between forest composition and species richness. Conclusion and Significance: Our results revealed that individual and community responses were positively associated with both conifer and hardwood cover. In our system, patterns of bird community assembly appear to be associated with stand management strategies that retain or increase hardwood vegetation while simultaneously regenerating the conifer cover in commercial tree plantations. © 2012 Jones et al.},

abstract={Robust monitoring systems are required to improve the ecological outcomes of management actions aimed at preventing biodiversity loss. We present a pilot study that measured assemblages of widespread and common bird species at the national scale in New Zealand. Bird surveys were undertaken at 18 sampling locations (six per land cover class: forest, shrubland and non-woody) randomly selected from a national grid. The full sampling protocol (five count stations surveyed on each of two consecutive days) was implemented at 80% of sampling locations. Each survey consisted of a ten-minute bird count, with distance sampling carried out in the initial 5-min period and any new species recorded in the second 5-min period. Most observations were based on aural cues (particularly in forest and shrubland). On average, one additional species was recorded per sampling location in ten- versus five-minute counts. Analyses highlighted spatial heterogeneity as a major factor influencing detection probabilities both for species present and for individuals of those species at sampling locations. This issue is often overlooked when estimating bird population trends through time. Most endemic species were detected in forest, while native and introduced species were most frequently detected in shrub. Potential uses of the information collected, along with recommendations for improving the sampling protocols, are highlighted. © New Zealand Ecological Society.},

abstract={To make sense of how nature is responding to an increasingly rapidly changing world, a lot of species distribution and abundance data are needed. To infer population trends, these data ideally need to be collected in a standardised, repeatable manner that includes 'absence' data on species sought for but not found. If many people, even just professional ecologists and postgraduate students, are to record biodiversity frequently in their daily lives, a convenient method that meets these requirements is needed. A method is presented here that has been employed by the author since 2003 to frequently record a predefined subset of bird species along standard routes and locations. The approach is a hybrid of the five-minute bird count and slow-walk transect methods, designed for high frequency use while the observer is stationary and moving respectively. Predetermined subsets of bird species are recorded in 20-min intervals, often consecutively, each with one nested 5-min interval. N-mixture models now allow for abundance and detection probability to be statistically separated from such simple high frequency, pseudo-replicated count data. Nearly 100 000 bird counts have been collected using this method, plus many more 'sought but not found' records. The value of this simple, high frequency monitoring approach is demonstrated by summarising data from one location, one weekly route, and one daily route for three widespread native forest birds. These show striking patterns of seasonality and biotope use in urban and rural Christchurch. Hence this approach, if widely adopted, could provide a valuable resource for bird monitoring. © New Zealand Ecological Society.},

abstract={Do sites managed under an agri-environment scheme support significantly more biodiversity than sites managed in accordance with traditional agricultural practices? This is a key question underpinning agri-environment schemes worldwide, including one that we report on here that has been established in south-eastern Australia. To address this question, we established a large-scale, blocked and replicated cross-sectional study comprising 104 sites in four key " management" classes: (1) Agricultural production sites characterized by traditional set-stocking grazing. (2) Short-term conversion sites in which investments to improve conservation had recently (<2. years ago) been made. (3) Long-term conversion sites where investments to improve conservation values were made >7. years ago. And (4) Traveling stock reserves (TSRs) which have traditionally been subject to limited vegetation clearing and grazing pressure over the past 150. years. Such TSRs are often considered 'benchmarks' of vegetation condition and biodiversity prior to European settlement.We identified significant (P<0.001) differences between management classes and bird species richness (including the richness of bird species of conservation concern), with a gradient of increasing richness from production sites, short-term conversion sites, long-term conversion sites to TSRs. We also found significant (P<0.001) differences in the composition of bird assemblages between management classes which followed a broadly similar gradient pattern to that identified for bird species richness. We also identified functional groups of birds associated with different management practices. In particular, small-bodied, non-seed eating and open-nesting bird species were significantly more likely to occur in TSRs than in production sites. We found that differences in bird species richness and assemblage composition could be explained by readily quantifiable relationships with vegetation structure and condition (i.e. native shrub cover, native ground ground cover, native plant species richness, percentage overstory regeneration, and the amount of bare ground).Our findings suggest that management intervention may shift some key characteristics of woodland vegetation typical of agricultural production sites toward those of " benchmark" TSRs and that these alterations in characteristics are, in turn, important for bird biota. Characteristics of particular importance include retention or improvement in the native shrub and sub-shrub layer and overstory regeneration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Playa wetlands (shallow, circular, depressional wetlands) in the Southern Great Plains are essential to the maintenance of regional biodiversity. However, the relative importance of habitat characteristics for maintaining avian species richness and density in playas is unknown.We examined influences of local- and landscape-scale characteristics on avian communities in wet playas. We conducted biweekly avian surveys on 80 playas (40 playas/year) from summer 2003 through spring 2005. Avian species richness was positively related to playa area and hydroperiod. More avian species and greater densities of birds were found at wetlands when water depths were intermediate (30-80 cm) during fall, winter and spring. Increased cultivation in playa watersheds increased total-, native-, and exotic-avian species richness. However, unsustainable sediment accumulation caused by cultivation can fill the playa basin and result in the loss of playa function, which will not benefit future bird populations. Landscape variables generally were less consistent with avian communities among seasons compared to local variables. Playas with greater numbers of other playas within 1 and 10 km had lower bird densities than those with fewer surrounding playas, likely due to the increase of habitat availability. Larger playas within predominantly uncultivated watersheds, that have an intermediate water depth, longer hydroperiod (within a season), and 26-50% vegetation cover are likely to maximize seasonal native avian richness. However, manipulating static water depths and maintaining long hydroperiods over extended periods will not meet avian objectives over the long term because playas must go through natural wet/dry fluctuations between years to maintain the desired plant community and productivity that supports diverse avian populations. © Society of Wetland Scientists 2012.},

We detected 38 species with point counts and compared bird metrics among establishment practices using mixed general linear models. Species richness, total relative abundance, and relative abundance of many species were greater by at least a factor of 1.5-4 in the chemical-only establishment practice than mechanically prepared establishment practices, and values declined by about 5-60% within mechanically prepared establishment practices as herbicide intensity increased. Tree and snag retention contributed to avian abundance and richness in the chemical-only establishment practice.

abstract={Fire is becoming a common phenomenon in Amazonian forest, modifying the structure and composition of natural assemblages. In particular, fire is known to affect patterns of bird diversity in tropical forests, but we have little understanding of the consequences of this for the functional diversity of bird assemblages. For example, frequent fires could act as an environmental filter selecting species with similar traits and, thus, producing a functional clustering pattern. Here, we used body mass, and dietary and foraging traits to calculate the functional structure of understorey bird assemblages in Amazonian forests analysed 3 years after they had passed under three disturbance levels within the 1997-1998 El-Niño period: unburned, burned once and burned twice. First, we tested whether observed levels of functional diversity were different among these forests and also from what one would expect by chance. Then, we investigated if habitat structure was able to predict changes in the functional structure of the studied bird assemblages. In general, there was no evidence of fire reducing functional diversity nor selecting species functionally more similar than expected by chance. Therefore, bird functional diversity was not different from random in unburned and burned forests. This provides some evidence in favour of high functional redundancy of bird species in the tropics, but also indicates that neutral theories of biodiversity, where processes such as dispersal and survival are more important than biological traits to community assembly, may apply to the assemblages studied. Also, we showed that bird assemblages from forests disturbed by wildfires have the tendency to be functionally overdispersed whereas assemblages from pristine forests tend to be functionally clustered. Thus, environmental structure, in part driven by forest responses to fire, is more important than simple categorical definitions of burn frequency for explaining trait-based assembly rules of understorey birds in the Amazon forest. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={Spatial modeling over broad scales can potentially direct conservation efforts to areas with high species-specific abundances. We examined the performance of regional models for predicting bird abundance at spatial scales typically addressed in conservation planning. Specifically, we used point count data on wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) and blue-winged warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera) from 2 time periods (1995-1998 and 2006-2007) to evaluate the ability of regional models derived via Bayesian hierarchical techniques to predict bird abundance. We developed models for each species within Bird Conservation Region (BCR) 23 in the upper midwestern United States at 800-ha, 8,000-ha, and approximately 80,000-ha scales. We obtained count data from the Breeding Bird Survey and land cover data from the National Land Cover Dataset (1992). We evaluated predictions from the best models, as defined by an information-theoretic criterion, using point count data collected within an ecological subregion of BCR 23 at 131 count stations in the 1990s and again in 2006-2007. Competing (Deviance Information Criteria <5) blue-winged warbler models accounted for 67% of the variability and suggested positive associations with forest edge and proportion of forest at the 8,000-ha scale, and negative associations with forest patch area (800 ha) and wetness (800 ha and 80,000 ha). The regional model performed best for blue-winged warbler predicted abundances from point counts conducted in Iowa during 1995-1996 (r s = 0.57; P = 0.14), the survey period that most closely aligned with the time period of data used for regional model construction. Wood thrush models exhibited positive correlations with point count data for all survey areas and years combined (r s = 0.58, P ≤ 0.001). In comparison, blue-winged warbler models performed worse as time increased between the point count surveys and vintage of the model building data (r s = 0.03, P = 0.92 for Iowa and r s = 0.13, P = 0.51 for all areas, 2006-2007), likely related to the ephemeral nature of their preferred early successional habitat. Species abundance and sensitivity to changing habitat conditions seems to be an important factor in determining the predictive ability of regional models. Hierarchical models can be a useful tool for concentrating efforts at the scale of management units and should be one of many tools used by land managers, but we caution that the utility of such models may decrease over time for species preferring relatively ephemeral habitats if model inputs are not updated accordingly. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Capsule Key marginal habitat features maintain their importance even when they occur at very low density. Aims To assess the importance for breeding birds of key habitat elements, such as isolated shrubs, hedgerows and untilled vegetation patches. MethodsWe investigated the habitat preferences of Red-backed Shrikes Lanius collurio in an agricultural environment where key habitat elements have been dramatically reduced. Based upon data from territorial maps, a fine-scale model of habitat preference was developed and the results of three different analytical approaches (binary logistic regression, multimodel inference and hierarchical partitioning) were compared. Results The occurrence of Red-backed Shrikes was positively influenced by the extent of non-grazed/mown grassland, isolated bushes and hedgerows, and negatively influenced by woodland cover. The model highlighted the importance of bushes/hedgerows despite their very scarce occurrence in the study areas (overall, average cover only 7.94%). Breeding densities were rather low, but mean densities were slightly higher in pasture zones in which bushes/hedgerows availability was higher than elsewhere. Conclusion These results confirm the crucial importance of these key marginal elements even in depauperated farmland landscapes. Maintaining and increasing their availability is a key management option for the encouragement of breeding Red-backed Shrikes, and potentially for other species which are also declining in these farmland habitats. © 2012 British Trust for Ornithology.},

abstract={The channelizing of the minor bed of the Drugeon river and the drainage of adjacent marshes were carried out from 1961 to 1973 in the hope of gaining 2000 ha of farmland. Those works led to important damage to the wetlands of the Drugeon basin, a Ramsar site since 2003, under the protection of several national and European laws since 1992. Actually, two hundred hectares only were gained and the stream length was shortened by 30% (8km). This changed the river into a rectilinear channel with subsequent erosion increasing the river bottom depth from some tens of centimetres to two meters, decreasing the fish populations and leading to the extinction of the White-footed Crayfish {Austropotamobius pallipes). From 1993 to 1997 the combination of EU directives and national and regional protection laws led to achieve a LIFE programme aiming at restoring 30km of the Drugeon river. This included re-meandering the stream over 20km and filling the drains that have been dug in marshes in order to re-elevate the water table in adjacent areas. The first works begun in 1997 upstream and ended in 2001. Based on the IPA method (IBCC, 1977), the present study aims at comparing the nesting bird community between 1998-1999 (at the very beginning of the works) and 2006-2007 (5 years after the end of the works). A total of 104 nesting bird species were contacted at least once; 74 in 1998 on 15 IPAs, 80 in 1998, 94 in 2006 and 83 in 2007 on 20 IPAs. Total species richness per IPA was multiplied by 1.3 ten years after the beginning of the works and by 1.9 considering wetland species only (Fig. 2). Remarkably, bird abundance represented by the sum of the IPA scores also increased significantly (Fig. 3). Species number increase was observed all along the river but was neatly larger downstream (Fig. 4). Twelve species show a significant population increase (p < 0.05) or possibly an increase (0.05 < p < 0.1). The Willow Warbler, the Marsh Warbler, the Coot, the Reed Bunting, the Mallard, the Northern Lapwing and the Little Grebe increased; the Meadow Pipit increased only in the Coot area (p < 0,05). The Common Pochard, the Tufted Duck and the Grey Wagtail possibly increased (0.05 < p < 0,1). Only the Whinchat showed a trend to decrease (0.05 < p < 0.1). Those results are discussed and compared with other bird censuses achieved along the first 80 kilometres of 5 French rivers (Seine, Saône, Loire, Allier, Loue). A remarkably high diversity of bird species was observed along the Drugeon river. The rehabilitation of the river led to improve the ecological conditions and the population of wetland species. Some of those species showed an increase in the area rehabilitated although they are known to markedly decline at European, French, Swiss and regional scales.},

abstract={Context A previous study reported major declines for native mammal species from Kakadu National Park, over the period 200109. The extent to which this result may be symptomatic of more pervasive biodiversity decline was unknown. Aims Our primary aim was to describe trends in the abundance of birds in Kakadu over the period 200109. We assessed whether any change in bird abundance was related to the arrival of invading cane toads (Rhinella marina), and to fire regimes. Methods Birds were monitored at 136 1-ha plots in Kakadu, during the period 200104 and again in 200709. This program complemented sampling of the same plots over the same period for native mammals. Key results In contrast to the decline reported for native mammals, the richness and total abundance of birds increased over this period, and far more individual bird species increased than decreased. Fire history in the between-sampling period had little influence on trends for individual species. Interpretation of the overall positive trends for bird species in Kakadu over this period should be tempered by recognition that most of the threatened bird species present in Kakadu were unrecorded in this monitoring program, and the two threatened species for which there were sufficient records to assess trends partridge pigeon (Geophaps smithii) and white-throated grass-wren (Amytornis woodwardi) both declined significantly. Conclusions The current decline of the mammal fauna in this region is not reflected in trends for the region's bird fauna. Some of the observed changes (mostly increases) in the abundance of bird species may be due to the arrival of cane toads, and some may be due to local or regional-scale climatic variation or variation in the amount of flowering. The present study provides no assurance about threatened bird species, given that most were inadequately recorded in the study (perhaps because their decline pre-dated the present study). Implications These contrasting trends between mammals and birds demonstrate the need for biodiversity monitoring programs to be broadly based. The declines of two threatened bird species over this period indicate the need for more management focus for these species. © 2012 CSIRO.},

abstract={Ecologically, potential bioindicator taxa operate at different scales within agricultural ecosystems, and thereby provide a means to investigate the influence of changing management practice on biological diversity at different scales within the agro-ecosystem. Surveys of grassland plant species at field level, parasitoid Hymenoptera at the field and farm scale, and bird populations and habitats at farm scale were carried out on 119 grass-based farms across three regions in the Republic of Ireland. In addition, habitat richness and aquatic macroinvertebrates were quantified at landscape scale. Agricultural intensity on the surveyed farms was quantified by mean farm stocking rate, calculated as livestock units per ha (LU/ha), and generalised linear mixed models used to evaluate relationships between stocking rate and the incidence of chosen bioindicator groups. Field scale bioindicators (plant species richness and parasitoid taxon richness and abundance) were negatively associated with mean farm stocking rate. Over much of its observed range, mean farm stocking rate was positively associated with total bird species richness and abundance, and the species richness and abundance of farmland bird indicator species recorded in the winter season. However, these relationships were quadratic, and above a relatively high upper limit of 2.5-3.5 LU/ha, further increase in farm stocking rate had a negative influence. Results demonstrate that different bioindicators measured at different spatial scales vary in their response to agricultural intensity. The lack of a consistent bioindicator response to farm stocking rate suggests that within predominantly farmed regions, maximising biodiversity requires a careful targeting and monitoring with bioindicator taxa that are informative of influences at relevant operational scales. The insights provided may then be much more informative for the design and implementation of agri-environment measures that maximise biodiversity within farmed landscapes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Seabird numbers can change rapidly as a result of environmental processes, both natural and anthropogenic. Informed management and conservation of seabirds requires accurate and precise monitoring of population size. However, for burrow-nesting species this is rarely achieved due to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in burrow occupancy. Here, we describe a novel method for deriving more accurate population size estimates that employs mark-recapture methods to correct for unknown variation in nest occupancy throughout a breeding season. We apply it to estimate breeding numbers of a colonial, burrowing seabird, the Little Penguin Eudyptula minor, on the Summerland Peninsula, Phillip Island, Australia. Estimates of active burrow numbers during the September 2008 to February 2009 breeding season were adjusted to numbers of breeding birds based on burrow occupation and modelled population demographics at six, fortnightly monitored reference sites. The population was estimated to be 26 100 (95% CI: 21 100-31 100) and 28 400 (23 800-33 000) breeding Penguins in two temporally separated surveys within one breeding season. We demonstrate using simulation that the method is robust to variation in burrow occupancy throughout the breeding season, providing consistent and more accurate estimates of population size. The advantage of using the corrected method is that confidence intervals will include the true population size. Confidence limits widened as burrow occupancy declined, reflecting the increased uncertainty as larger adjustments for low burrow occupancy were required. In contrast, the uncorrected method that uses burrow occupancy alone as a measure of breeding numbers was inconsistent and significantly underestimated population size across much of the breeding season. Although requiring considerably more survey effort, the corrected approach provides a more accurate means for monitoring population changes in colonially breeding animals while collecting demographic data that can help diagnose the drivers of population change. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={In the Dutch province of Friesland, historically about 100,000 ha of grasslands outside the main dike systems were regularly flooded in winter. Nowadays, only about 3,000 ha of these 'summer polders' remain. This papers compares the breeding bird assembly of grasslands managed as nature reserves in summer polders with that of similarly managed reserves that are not flooded during winter. The study is based on territory mapping in 540 plot-years in the period 1984-2009. Based on a comparison of breeding densities (table 1), 5-6 out of 19 species showed a significant preference for summer polders: Blue-headed Wagtail Motacilla flava, Ruff Philomachuspugnax, Common Quail Coturnix coturnix, Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata and Eurasian Skylark Alauda arvensis. Common Shelduck Tadorna tatorna tended to prefer summer polders as well. Three or four species reached significantly higher densities in winter polders: Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis, Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, Northern Shoveler Anasclypeata, and, marginally significant, Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa. It is suggested that habitat conditions in summer polders such as a delay of the breeding season due to the inundation until early spring, low densities of soil invertebrates and presence of long, rough grasses in the breeding season underlie these differences in preference.},

abstract={Salt marsh management often embraces diverse goals, ranging from the restoration of degraded marshes through re-introduction of tidal flow to the control of salt marsh mosquito production by altering marsh surface topography through Open Water Marsh Management (OMWM). However, rarely have these goals been incorporated in one project. Here we present the concept of Integrated Marsh Management (IMM), which combines the best management practices of salt marsh restoration and OMWM. Although IMM offers a comprehensive approach to ecological restoration and mosquito control, research evaluating this concept's practical implementations has been inadequate. A long-term IMM project at Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge located in a highly urbanized watershed on Long Island, New York, USA was designed to fill this knowledge gap. A combination of restoration and OMWM techniques was employed at two treatment marshes, the results monitored before and after alterations, and compared to two adjacent control marshes. The treatment marshes experienced decreased mosquito production, reduced cover of the invasive common reed (Phragmites australis), expansion of native marsh vegetation, increased killifish and estuarine nekton species abundance, as well as increased avian species diversity and waterbird abundance. This demonstration project validated the IMM conceptual approach and may serve as a case study for similar IMM projects in the future. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Since the 1960s, Japan has become highly dependent on foreign countries for natural resources, and the amount of managed lands (e. g. coppice, grassland, and agricultural field) has declined. Due to infrequent natural and human disturbance, early-successional species are now declining in Japan. Here we surveyed bees, birds, and plants in four human-disturbed open habitats (pasture, meadow, young planted forest, and abandoned clear-cut) and two forest habitats (mature planted forest and natural old-growth). We extended a recently developed multispecies abundance model to accommodate count data, and used the resulting models to estimate species-, functional group-, and community-level state variables (abundance and species richness) at each site, and compared them among the six habitats. Estimated individual-level detection probability was quite low for bee species (mean across species = 0.003; 0.16 for birds). Thirty-two (95% credible interval: 13-64) and one (0-4) bee and bird species, respectively, were suggested to be undetected by the field survey. Although habitats in which community-level abundance and species richness was highest differed among taxa, species richness and abundance of early-successional species were similar in the four disturbed open habitats across taxa except for plants in the pasture habitat which was a good habitat only for several exotic species. Our results suggest that human disturbance, especially the revival of plantation forestry, may contribute to the restoration of early-successional species in Japan. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={1.Mechanical management of forest fuels is increasingly used in the Euro-Mediterranean region in response to the abandonment of traditional agroforestry and the concurrent increase in fire hazard. Although fuel management may have positive side effects for biodiversity, its long-term impacts remain largely unknown. 2.We used a 70-year post-management chronosequence to investigate the influence of time since fuel management and management frequency on bird assemblages in cork oak Quercus suber forests. 3.Fuel management strongly affected bird species richness, abundances and assemblage composition, with rapid changes often occurring during the first 10-20years, followed in the next decades by a slow convergence to pre-management levels. 4.In winter, overall species richness and abundance, and that of frugivores and shrub foragers, were negatively affected by recent and recurrent management, only recovering in stands unmanaged for >50years. In spring, insectivore abundance and the richness and abundance of shrub foragers declined immediately following management, increased to a maximum about 20years later, and declined thereafter. Breeding granivores and ground foragers were the only groups that benefitted from fuel management. There were no overall effects on species of conservation concern, although a few species with unfavourable status benefitted from fuel management. 5.Synthesis and applications. Our study confirmed that mechanical fuel management has positive effects on some early-successional bird species of conservation concern, although its effects were limited. These benefits should be compared with the strong negative impacts on key bird species such as wintering frugivores, which play a pivotal role in ecosystems by promoting seed dispersal. To reconcile the positive and negative aspects, fuel management should be used to create heterogeneous mosaics of forest patches encompassing a range of sizes (10-100ha) and successional stages of understorey vegetation, including stands undisturbed for >50years. This management strategy will likely maintain conditions for a wide range of species with contrasting ecological requirements while also reducing fire hazard. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Cloud forests are unusual and fragile habitats, being one of the least studied and least understood ecosystems. The tropical Andean dominion is considered one of the most significant places in the world as regards biological diversity, with a very high level of endemism. The biodiversity was analysed in an isolated remnant area of a tropical montane cloud forest known as the "Bosque de Neblina de Cuyas", in the North of the Peruvian Andean range. Composition, structure and dead wood were measured or estimated. The values obtained were compared with other cloud forests. The study revealed a high level of forest biodiversity, although the level of biodiversity differs from one area to another: in the inner areas, where human pressure is almost inexistent, the biodiversity values increase. The high species richness and the low dominance among species bear testimony to this montane cloud forest as a real enclave of biodiversity. © 2012 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The brown creeper (Certhia americana) is one of the forest bird species most sensitive to partial harvesting in North America. We examined the detailed response of this species and its food (bark-dwelling invertebrates) during the 3rd and 4th year after experimental selection harvesting (3010% basal area removal) in northern hardwood forest. Relative to control plots, nest densities in treated plots were ca 50% lower. Because the density of nesting substrates was not significantly lower in treated plots than in controls, we investigated whether foraging substrates could be the limiting factor. Specifically, we tested for a treatment effect on 1) the abundance and species composition of bark invertebrate assemblages; 2) the biomass of bark invertebrates per unit area; and 3) the frequency of food provisioning. As predicted, treatment had a significant negative effect on food provisioning rate, though not on invertebrate biomass, when accounting for year effects. There was also no evidence for a treatment effect on the structure of bark invertebrate assemblages, which was mainly influenced by cumulative degree days. Selection harvesting thus appeared to reduce the amount of food delivered to brown creeper nestlings, unless greater amounts of food were delivered per feeding trip in treated plots. The lower density of foraging substrates in treated plots (77 versus 112 stems ha-1 in controls) may require that adults perform longer foraging trips. Future studies should determine whether this extra effort has short- or long-term consequences for adults and nestlings.},

abstract={1.Postfire salvage logging is the most commonly applied forestry practice in burned forests world-wide, mainly for economic reasons. However, it strongly affects bird communities and is generally considered to be detrimental for bird conservation. In Europe, many open-habitat species are currently declining owing to land use changes. Wildfires, which are common disturbances in the Mediterranean Basin, can create suitable habitat for these species but the effect of postfire salvage logging on bird communities is unknown. 2.We surveyed breeding birds in two burned secondary pine forests from the western Mediterranean Basin and analysed the effect of salvage logging and vegetation regeneration as determinants of individual species and community parameters. We used a pseudoexperimental before-after-control-impact approach to study the changes in the bird community during the first three springs after fire. 3.Most bird species were affected by salvage logging (measured by snag density), a relationship that was positive for forest birds and negative for open-habitat species. Species linked to shrub and edge habitats were positively affected by vegetation regrowth. Bird communities in logged areas held more species of conservation concern than those in unlogged areas. Species richness and overall density tended to decrease from the first to the second year after fire and to increase from the second to the third. 4.Salvage logging benefits a number of open-habitat species, although its effect on bird conservation depends strongly on the specific threats that birds face in each region or ecosystem. 5.Synthesis and applications. In the Mediterranean Basin, some postfire salvage logging of pine forests can be compatible with bird conservation. We recommend that managers retain some standing dead trees during logging operations and that logged forest is interspersed with unlogged stands. This will provide suitable habitat for the widest range of species. © 2012 The Authors. Journal of Applied Ecology © 2012 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={1.Organic farming is often promoted as a solution for counteracting the adverse impacts of agricultural intensification on biodiversity. However, it is unclear whether the biodiversity benefits derived from organic farming require an adoption of organic farming in its entirety (i.e. a systems-level approach) or whether the benefits derived are because of just a small subset of the associated management practices. 2.Using bird survey data collected from kiwifruit orchards in New Zealand, we assessed whether orchards managed under an organic system support higher bird densities than those under integrated management systems. To determine whether biodiversity gains might also be achieved on non-organic orchards, we tested whether variation among kiwifruit orchards in the amount of (non-crop) woody vegetation cover, density of shelterbelts and toxicity of pesticide applications are better predictors of bird densities than management systems. 3.Composite measures of breeding season densities of all native species and the subset of native insectivores were higher on organic orchards than integrated management orchards. Densities of introduced bird species were comparable among management systems. 4.Pesticide use and habitat composition variables were better predictors of native bird densities than management system, with native bird densities negatively associated with pesticide toxicity ranking and/or positively associated with woody vegetation cover. 5.Synthesis and applications. A complete conversion to an organic system may not be required to improve biodiversity in agroecosystems. Instead, the transfer of specific land management practices known to benefit biodiversity in organic systems has the potential to enhance biodiversity in other more intensively managed systems (e.g. integrated management). This may be a path towards attaining biodiversity benefits at a larger scale, because such changes may be more straightforward than conversion to an organic system. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Backyard gallinaceous bird flocks may play an important role in the spread of infectious diseases within poultry populations as well as the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans. An epidemiologic characterization was conducted of Colorado backyard flocks to gather information on general flock characteristics, human movement of birds, human-bird interaction, biosecurity practices, and flock health. Our results suggest that backyard poultry flocks in Colorado are small-sized flocks (68.6 of flocks had <50 birds); consist primarily of layer chickens (85.49 of flocks), show chickens (32.18 of flocks), and waterfowl (34.07 of flocks); and are primarily owned for food (meat or egg) production for the family (86.44) or as pet or hobby birds (42.27). The backyard flock environment may promote bird-to-bird transmission as well as bird-to-human transmission of infectious disease. Birds are primarily housed with free access to the outside (96.85), and many are moved from the home premises (46.06 within 1 yr). Human contact with backyard flocks is high, biosecurity practices are minimal, and bird health is negatively impacted by increased movement events. Increased knowledge of backyard bird characteristics and associated management practices can provide guidelines for the development of measures to decrease disease transmission between bird populations, decrease disease transmission from birds to humans, and increase the overall health of backyard birds. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.},

abstract={After a successional forest is severely disturbed by wildfire and subsequent salvage logging or by clearfell timber harvesting and slash burning, if conditions are suitable, the forest will regenerate. It then passes through a series of stages of varying floristic composition and structure until further severe disturbance occurs. The characteristics of a forest-bird assemblage vary with both the successional stage of the forest (time period since the most recent severe disturbance event) and the long-term disturbance history of the forest. To determine how the bird assemblage changes during succession in a south-eastern Australian forest type that is fire-sensitive and also subject to regular timber harvesting, we surveyed birds in five age-classes of wet forest (from 2 to >100 years post-disturbance). Bird-assemblage composition altered sequentially; the pattern and rate of change reflected those of the vegetation. Bird abundance and species richness varied little during succession. No species of bird was abundant only in early successional forest. Some species, such as Brown Thornbill (Acanthiza pusilla), Golden Whistler (Pachycephala pectoralis) and Grey Fantail (Rhipidura albiscapa), were common in all successional stages. Other species, such as White-throated Treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaea) and Striated Pardalote (Pardalotus striatus), were consistently abundant in mid- to late successional stages only; this highlighted the importance of older forests for avian biodiversity. Any increase in the frequency of severe disturbance in these forests would tend to favour only those bird species that are already common. This has implications for management programs in forests that are habitat for wildlife, but are also used by humans for timber harvesting and other commercial or recreational purposes. © 2012 BirdLife Australia.},

We investigated the impact of loss of willow shrubs on a bird community in arctic riparian sediment plains in northern Norway subject to varying intensities of reindeer browsing. In riparian habitats where willow thickets had been lost, bird species richness was more than halved compared to habitats where some patches of thickets were still present. As could be expected species previously suggested to use erect woody vegetation as nesting places and/or foraging habitats were most consistently impacted. However, even some open ground habitat specialists appeared to be negatively impacted, possibly due to loss of spatial spill-over effects of insects from willow thickets.

abstract={An important question for tropical forest restoration is whether degraded lands can be actively managed to attract birds. We censused birds and measured vegetation structure at 27 stations in young (6-9-yr old) actively and passively restored pasture and old growth forest at Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica. During 481 10-min point counts, we detected a high diversity-186 species-of birds using the restoration area. Surprisingly, species richness and detection frequency did not differ among habitats, and proportional similarity of bird assemblages to old growth forest did not differ between restoration treatments. Bird detection frequency was instead explained by exotic grass cover and understory stem density-vegetation structures that were not strongly impacted by active restoration. The similarity of bird assemblages in actively and passively restored forest may be attributed to differential habitat preferences within and among feeding guilds, low structural contrast between treatments, or the effect of nucleation from actively restored plots into passively restored areas. Rapid recovery of vegetation in this recently restored site is likely due to its proximity to old growth forest and the lack of barriers to effective seed dispersal. Previous restoration studies in highly binary environments (i.e., open pasture vs. tree plantation) have found strong differences in bird abundance and richness. Our data contradict this trend, and suggest that tropical restoration ecologists should carefully consider: (1) when the benefits of active restoration outweigh the cost of implementation; and (2) which avian guilds should be used to measure restoration success given differential responses to habitat structure. © 2011 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract={We examined foraging-habitat selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in burned forests of southwestern Idaho during 2000 and 2002 (6 and 8 years following wildfire). This woodpecker responds positively to large-scale fire disturbances and may be at risk from logging and post-fire management. With 100 radio-locations of four adult males, we used resource-selection probability functions in logistic form in an information-theoretic framework to model the Black-backed Woodpecker's selection of foraging habitat at fine and coarse spatial scales. Fine-scale data included characteristics of the foraging tree (tree level) and local habitat surrounding foraging trees (plot level, 0.04 ha), whereas coarse-scale data (224-778 ha) included patch characteristics within home ranges. Model selection by Akaike's information criterion identified a multi-scale model containing tree- and plot-level covariates, and their interaction, as the best model to characterize foraging trees. The positive effect of interaction between foraging-tree diameter and plot-level tree density suggested that foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers select both patches with dense trees and larger-diameter trees. Fire severity was not important, possibly because of the time since fire and the birds' habit of foraging on recently dead trees in adjacent unburned forests. Salvage logging that retains large-diameter trees in clumped distributions is most likely to provide long-term foraging habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers in dry coniferous forests of the interior western U.S. Following wildfire, conservation of forest patches containing weakened trees may extend the suitability of habitat for foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers by up to 8 years. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2012.},

abstract={Despite extensive research on the effects of habitat fragmentation, the ecological mechanisms underlying colonization and extinction processes are poorly known, but knowledge of these mechanisms is essential to understanding the distribution and persistence of populations in fragmented habitats. We examined these mechanisms through multiseason occupancy models that elucidated patch-occupancy dynamics of Middle Spotted Woodpeckers (Dendrocopos medius) in northwestern Spain. The number of occupied patches was relatively stable from 2000 to 2010 (15-24% of 101 patches occupied every year) because extinction was balanced by recolonization. Larger and higher quality patches (i.e., higher density of oaks >37 cm dbh [diameter at breast height]) were more likely to be occupied. Habitat quality (i.e., density of large oaks) explained more variation in patch colonization and extinction than did patch size and connectivity, which were both weakly associated with probabilities of turnover. Patches of higher quality were more likely to be colonized than patches of lower quality. Populations in high-quality patches were less likely to become extinct. In addition, extinction in a patch was strongly associated with local population size but not with patch size, which means the latter may not be a good surrogate of population size in assessments of extinction probability. Our results suggest that habitat quality may be a primary driver of patch-occupancy dynamics and may increase the accuracy of models of population survival. We encourage comparisons of competing models that assess occupancy, colonization, and extinction probabilities in a single analytical framework (e.g., dynamic occupancy models) so as to shed light on the association of habitat quality and patch geometry with colonization and extinction processes in different settings and species. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={By using pitfall trapping and ocular estimation, this paper studied the effects of Solenopsis invicta invasion on the diversity of spider communities in a corn field. A total of 16 spider species belonging to 8 families were recorded. In the plot S. invicta invaded, there were 10 spider species of 6 families, among which, 5 species of 4 families were in pesticide-treated plot, and 11 species of 8 families were in control plot. The spiders were dominated by wandering species, mainly belonging to the families Salticidae and Oxyopidae, and the dominant species were Oxyopex sertatus, Myrmarachne joblotii, and Myrmarachne sp. In the plot S. invicta invaded, the population quantity of S. invicta began to increase steadily from the late whorl stage of corn, with the peak (225 individuals) through the earring stage, but decreased steadily thereafter, with the decrement of the spiders of genus Oxyopex reached 79.2%, while the population quantity of the spiders of genus Myrmarachne had no significant change. With the growth of corn, the species number, diversity index, and evenness index of the spiders in S. invicta-invaded and pesticide-treated plot decreased and the predominant indices increased gradually, while the situation in control plot was in adverse. It was concluded that due to the S. invicta invasion in corn field, the community structure of spiders changed.},

abstract={The connectivity of remnant patches of habitat may affect the persistence of species in fragmented landscapes. We evaluated the effects of the structural connectivity of forest patches (i.e., distance between patches) and matrix class (land-cover type) on the functional connectivity of 3 bird species (the White-crested Elaenia [Elaenia albiceps], the Green-backed Firecrown Hummingbird [Sephanoides sephaniodes], and the Austral Thrush [Turdus falklandii]). We measured functional connectivity as the rate at which each species crossed from one patch to another. We also evaluated whether greater functional connectivity translated into greater ecological connectivity (dispersal of fruit and pollen) by comparing among forest patches fruit set of a plant pollinated by hummingbirds and abundance of seedlings and adults of 2 plants with bird- and wind-dispersed seeds. Interpatch distance was strongly associated with functional connectivity, but its effect was not independent of matrix class. For one of the bird-dispersed plants, greater functional connectivity for White-crested Elaenias and Austral Thrushes (both frugivores) was associated with higher densities of this plant. The lack of a similar association for the wind-dispersed species suggests this effect is linked to the dispersal vector. The abundance of the hummingbird-pollinated species was not related to the presence of hummingbirds. Interpatch distance and matrix class affect animal movement in fragmented landscapes and may have a cascading effect on the distribution of some animal-dispersed species. On the basis of our results, we believe effort should be invested in optimizing patch configuration and modifying the matrix so as to mitigate the effects of patch isolation in fragmented landscapes. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Frequent compounded perturbations in terms of lopping, grazing, biological invasions, firewood and non-timber forest product (NTFP) collection gradually alters the habitat, and consequently dependent biotic communities. However, it is quite difficult to quantify these disturbances due to their high frequency, low intensity, and interaction among themselves. In order to quantify and investigate the impact of such disturbances on the habitat of resident and migrant birds, we carried out a study in the dry forest of Rajaji National Park in the Shiwalik landscape. Grazing and firewood collection emerged as the major disturbance in the study area, which decreased linearly from the edge to the interior of the forest. Disturbance altered the structural components of the vegetation; however, we did not find major changes in the vegetation composition. Canopy opening due to lopping disturbance facilitated the growth of iMntana camara in the study area. Ninety percent of the migrant bird community wintering in the study area belonged to the insectivorous guild. Out of 18 migrant species observed during the entire study period, 44% belonged to understorey-insectivores guild and 33% to canopy-insectivores. However, in terms of abundance 67% of the migrants pertained to the canopy- insectivores guild. Guild composition in resident birds was more varied with a total of 11 guilds, and trunk-bark feeder guild comprised the maximum number of species (20%). Species richness of both migrant and resident birds did not change much with any of the disturbance components. However, densities of resident birds increased with increased lopping and timber extraction in the study area during winter. Resident and migrant birds exhibited similar distribution patterns across different disturbance gradients indicating equivalent sensitivity to disturbances. © Bombay Natural History Society 2012.},

abstract={Disturbance is a major source of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. In fire-maintained systems, disturbance by fire is often used as a management tool to increase biological diversity, restore degraded habitats, and reduce pest outbreaks. Much attention has been given to how plant communities recover from fire, but relatively few studies have examined post-fire responses of higher order species, such as insect herbivores. Because dynamic feedbacks occur between plants and their consumers, which can in turn influence the response of the entire ecosystem, incorporating higher trophic level responses into our understanding of the effects of fire is essential. In this study, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to tease apart the direct and indirect effects of fire on insect herbivore assemblages found on three common oak species in the Florida scrub (Quercus inopina, Q. chapmanii, and Q. geminata). We investigated how fire affected herbivore abundance, richness, and community composition both directly and indirectly through environmental heterogeneity at different spatial scales (e. g., leaf quality, plant architecture, and habitat structure). We also investigated how seasonality and landscape heterogeneity influenced post-fire responses of insect herbivores and whether fire effects on herbivore assemblages varied among different host plants. Our general findings were that fire effects were (1) largely indirect, mediated through habitat structure (although direct fire effects were observed on Q. inopina herbivores), (2) non-linear through time due to self-thinning processes occurring in the scrub habitat, and (3) varied according to herbivore assemblage as a result of differences in the composition of species in each herbivore community. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to examine how fire influences the assembly of insect herbivore communities through both direct and indirect pathways and at multiple spatial scales. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Tree fall gaps caused by natural disturbances are a major source of heterogeneity in intact forests. Bird species are known as ecological indicators, reflecting landscape level changes. Yet, the role of landscape context in bird species abundance within small gaps is not fully addressed. We examined the difference between avian richness and abundance within tree fall gaps and closed canopy forest areas in Kheyrud forest, located on the east of Noshahr Township, Mazandaran province in Iran as a representation of Hyrcanian forest. Breeding bird census was taken in 20 selected gaps (0.1-0.4. ha) and 250. m from the center of each gap known as controls. Birds were surveyed during breeding season in spring 2010. We also determined whether landscape context affected the abundance, richness and particular species abundance within the gaps. For this, we assessed landscape metrics by the Landscape Context Tool for every gap. Abundance (P=0.003) and richness (P=0.014) of birds were significantly higher in the gaps than in closed canopy controls. Gaps were higher in herb cover, coarse woody debris density and volume as well as pit and mound micro topography than controls. Great Tit (Parus major), Coal Tit (Parus ater), Eurasian Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), Common Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) and European Goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) were more abundant in gaps than in controls. Among which, European Goldfinch was the only gap specialist species. Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos) was the only species more abundant in controls than gaps. Mean tree diameter had a significant positive relation with avian richness and abundance in gaps, rather than landscape context rate but forest specialist richness was negatively related to gap size. Abundance of Great Tit was related to landscape context rate. Our study highlights the role of gap quality for breeding birds; therefore improving the quality of gap habitats especially maintaining dead wood should be considered as an important conservation factor. Management practices for providing habitat of gap specialists by taking out the remaining trees and making the gaps larger would increase bird species richness in a landscape scale but the shape and size of the openings should be according to the species requirements. We suggest that maintenance of tree fall gaps as a heterogeneous habitat and dead wood resource is crucial for promoting species richness. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia), listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as endangered in 1990 due primarily to habitat loss and fragmentation, is a Neotropical migrant songbird that breeds exclusively inmature juniper-oak (Juniperus-Quercus) woodlands in central Texas, USA Previous studies suggested suitable breeding habitat consists of >35% canopy closure (with 50-70% cover optimal), and 10% oak composition. However, little is known about this species' habitat relationships at the southwestern edge of its breeding range. Therefore, within this portion of the species' breeding range, we investigated influences of canopy closure and tree species composition on pairing and reproductive success of golden-cheeked warblers during 2009 and 2010. We used remote sensing and ground sampling to acquire variables to describe habitat characteristics, and we estimated pairing for breeding and reproductive success by golden-cheeked warblers. We found successfully breeding pairs in areas with >20% canopy cover, 35% juniper composition, and only 3% oak composition. A logistic model for pairing success retained juniper, oak, and the interaction between these 2 variables, and the model for reproductive success retained juniper, canopy closure, study area, and the interaction between canopy closure and study area. Our results expand our knowledge of habitat conditions that warblers use for breeding, thus expanding the range of habitat management options available for this species during breeding season. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Forest encroachment threatens the biological diversity of grasslands globally. Positive feedbacks can reinforce the process, affecting soils and ground vegetation, ultimately leading to replacement of grassland by forest species. We tested whether restoration treatments (tree removal, with or without fire) reversed effects of nearly two centuries of encroachment by Abies grandis and Pinus contorta into dry, montane meadows in the Cascade Range, Oregon, USA. In nine, 1-ha plots containing a patchy mosaic of meadow openings and forests of varying age (20 to >140 yr), we compared three treatments affecting the ground vegetation: control (no trees removed), unburned (trees removed, slash burned in piles leaving 90% of the area unburned), and burned (trees removed, slash broadcast burned). We quantified changes over 3-4 years in soils, abundance and richness of species with differing habitat associations (meadow, forest, and ruderal), and recruitment of conifers. Except for a transient increase in available N (especially in burn scars), effects of burning on soils were minimal due, in part, to mixing by gophers. Tree removal greatly benefited meadow species at the expense of forest herbs. Cover and richness of meadow species increased by 47% and 38% of initial values in unburned plots, but changed minimally in burned plots. In contrast, cover and richness of forest herbs declined by 44% and 26% in unburned plots and by 79% and 58% in burned plots. Ruderal species and conifer seedlings were uncommon in both treatments. Although vegetation was consumed beneath burn piles, meadow species recovered significantly after three years. Long-term tree presence did not preclude recovery of meadow species; in fact, colonization was greater in older than in younger forests. In sum, temporal trends were positive for most indicators, suggesting strong potential for restoration. Contrary to conventional wisdom, tree removal without fire may be sufficient to shift the balance from forest to meadow species. In meadows characterized by historically infrequent fire, small-scale disturbances and competitive interactions may be more critical to ecosystem maintenance and restoration. Managers facing the worldwide phenomenon of tree invasion should critically evaluate the ecological vs. operational need for fire in ecosystem restoration. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Problem statement: The Azores is a archipelago of nine volcanic islands, situated in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean. Oceanic islands are known hotspots of biodiversity and the Azores, although relatively young (0.3-13 MA), conform to this general pattern. The local avifauna amount to 37 birding species, with two endemic species and 11 endemic subspecies. With an estimated population of 240,000 inhabitants, with increasing needs, most of the natural habitats that support bird populations are under a constant pressure. The use of bird distribution and species richness could be used as a suitable tool for management and would also be effective when applied in other archipelagos. Approach: In the course of the Bionatura project, the Atlantis Tierra 2.0 software provided the storage of biological data from all the islands, including the avifauna, in a 500 × 500 m grid. As an outcome, important items for bird conservation and habitat management were achieved for all the species occurring in the archipelago, including species richness. Results: A detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of the endemic species and sub-species, plus the protected species, is a powerful tool for conservation and management policies in small islands where biodiversity is usually restricted to narrow distributions. Conclusion: The results defined an area of 39, 273 h (16.8% of Azores total area); providing an ideal area for conservation of suitable habitats for bird's species in the Azores. © 2012 Science Publications.},

abstract={Powerline rights-of-way (ROWs) often provide habitat for early successional bird species that have suffered long-term population declines in eastern North America. To determine how the abundance of shrubland birds varies with habitat within ROW corridors and with land use patterns surrounding corridors, we ran Poisson regression models on data from 93 plots on ROWs and compared regression coefficients. We also determined nest success rates on a 1-km stretch of ROW. Seven species of shrubland birds were common in powerline corridors. However, the nest success rates for prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor) and field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) were <21%, which is too low to compensate for estimated annual mortality. Some shrubland bird species were more abundant on narrower ROWs or at sites with lower vegetation or particular types of vegetation, indicating that vegetation management could be refined to favor species of high conservation priority. Also, several species were more abundant in ROWs traversing unfragmented forest than those near residential areas or farmland, indicating that corridors in heavily forested regions may provide better habitat for these species. In the area where we monitored nests, brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) occurred more frequently close to a residential area. Although ROWs support dense populations of shrubland birds, those in more heavily developed landscapes may constitute sink habitat. ROWs in extensive forests may contribute more to sustaining populations of early successional birds, and thus may be the best targets for habitat management. © 2012 Askins et al.},

abstract={There is vigorous debate about the potential for reforestation to offset losses in biodiversity associated with tropical deforestation, but a scarcity of good data. We quantified developmental trajectories following active restoration (replanting) of deforested pasture land to tropical Australian rainforest, using 20 different bird community indicators within chronosequences of multiple sites. Bird species composition in restored sites (1-24. years old) was intermediate between that of reference sites in pasture and primary rainforest. Total species richness was much less sensitive to land cover change than composition indicators, because of contrasting species-specific response patterns. For example, open-country (grassland/wetland) bird species declined in richness and abundance with increasing site age, while rainforest-dependent species increased. Results from two different landscapes (uplands and lowlands) were remarkably consistent, despite differing bird assemblages. After 10. years, restored sites averaged about half the number of rainforest-dependent bird species typical of rainforest. Mean values at around 20. years overlapped with the " poorest" rainforest reference sites, but projections suggest that >150. years are required to reach mean rainforest levels, and high variability among sites means that many were not on track towards ever achieving a rainforest-like bird community. Regional rainforest endemics were half as likely to occupy older revegetated sites as non-endemic rainforest-dependent species. Between-site variability and slow colonisation by regional endemics strongly constrain the potential of rainforest restoration to offset the biodiversity impacts of tropical deforestation. The results also mean that ongoing monitoring of biodiversity is an essential part of restoration management. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Remote-sensing models have become increasingly popular for identifying, characterizing, monitoring, and predicting avian habitat but have largely focused on single bird species. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been shown to positively correlate with avian abundance and richness and has been successfully applied to southwestern riparian systems which are uniquely composed of narrow bands of vegetation in an otherwise dry landscape. Desert riparian ecosystems are important breeding and stopover sites for many bird species but have been degraded due to altered hydrology and land management practices. Here we investigated the use of NDVI, coupled with vegetation, to model the avian community structure along the San Pedro River, Arizona. We also investigated how vegetation and physical features measured locally compared to those data that can be gathered through remote-sensing. We found that NDVI has statistically significant relationships with both avian abundance and species richness, although is better applied at the individual species level. However, the amount of variation explained by even our best models was quite low, suggesting that NDVI habitat models may not presently be an accurate tool for extensive modeling of avian communities. We suggest additional studies in other watersheds to increase our understanding of these bird/NDVI relationships. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Many animal populations continue to decline despite occurring in protected areas or on sympathetically managed sites. Frequently, this is because a specific habitat patch may not fulfil all the niche requirements of a threatened species. For instance, species often move between, and make use of, multiple habitat types for breeding, roosting and feeding within the same landscape. These cross-habitat interactions present a challenge for conservation. Here we quantify how the habitat associations of individual species and assemblages occurring within two distinct but adjacent habitat types (moorland and farmland) determine a suite of density and richness indicators, using the bird community of the English uplands as a case study. There was a clear association between onsite avian density and richness and offsite habitat structure (e.g. vegetation height, percent cover of dominant plant species, land management practices). Although such effects are not universal across all species and assemblages, where present (for five farmland and three moorland indicators) the increase in explanatory power offered by including offsite habitat structure can be large. By constructing scenarios of possible changes to management practice on both moorland and farmland, we demonstrate a real conservation benefit can be obtained by altering management in offsite habitats. For example, reducing burning intensity on moorland can result in a five-fold increase in snipe Gallinago gallinago density on farmland, without an alteration in farmland habitat. For one species (Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata), we demonstrate the frequency with which birds move between and utilise farmland and moorland during the breeding season, and therefore the importance of both habitat types to maintaining population densities. The multiple habitat dependency phenomenon quantified here is common and not restricted to birds. The successful conservation of many threatened species will thus depend on coordinated cross-habitat management. © 2011 The Authors. Ecography © 2012 Nordic Society Oikos.},

abstract={Fire frequency is a key land management issue, particularly in tropical savannas where fire is widely used and fire recurrence times are often short. We used an extended Before-After-Control-Impact design to examine the impacts of repeated wet-season burning for weed control on bird assemblages in a tropical savanna in north Queensland, Australia. Experimentally replicated fire treatments (unburnt, singularly bunt, twice burnt), in two habitats (riparian and adjacent open woodland), were surveyed over 3years (1year before the second burn, 1year post the second burn, 2years post the second burn) to examine responses of birds to a rapid recurrence of fire. Following the second burn, species richness and overall bird abundance were lower in the twice-burnt sites than either the unburnt or singularly burnt sites. Feeding group composition varied across year of survey, but within each year, feeding guilds grouped according to fire treatment. In particular, abundance of frugivores and insectivores was lower in twice-burnt sites, probably because of the decline of a native shrub that produces fleshy fruits, Carissa ovata. Although broader climatic variability may ultimately determine overall bird assemblages, our results show that a short fire-return interval will substantially influence bird responses at a local scale. Considering that fire is frequently used as a land management tool, our results emphasize the importance of determining appropriate fire-free intervals. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) populations have declined in the United States and Canada over the past 40a years. However, few demographic studies have been published on the species and none have addressed adult survival. During 2006-2007, we estimated survival probabilities of 80 radio-tagged red-headed woodpeckers during the breeding season in mature loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forests in South Carolina. We used known-fate models in Program MARK to estimate survival within and between years and to evaluate the effects of foliar cover (number of available cover patches), snag density treatment (high density vs. low density), and sex and age of woodpeckers. Weekly survival probabilities followed a quadratic time trend, being lowest during mid-summer, which coincided with the late nestling and fledgling period. Avian predation, particularly by Cooper's (Accipiter cooperii) and sharp-shinned hawks (A. striatus), accounted for 85% of all mortalities. Our best-supported model estimated an 18-week breeding season survival probability of 0.72 (95% CIa =a 0.54-0.85) and indicated that the number of cover patches interacted with sex of woodpeckers to affect survival; females with few available cover patches had a lower probability of survival than either males or females with more cover patches. At the median number of cover patches available (na =a 6), breeding season survival of females was 0.82 (95% CIa =a 0.54-0.94) and of males was 0.60 (95% CIa =a 0.42-0.76). The number of cover patches available to woodpeckers appeared in all 3 of our top models predicting weekly survival, providing further evidence that woodpecker survival was positively associated with availability of cover. Woodpecker survival was not associated with snag density. Our results suggest that protection of ≥0.7 cover patches per ha during vegetation control activities in mature pine forests will benefit survival of this Partners In Flight Watch List species. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={In tropical forests and savannahs worldwide, hundreds of species of cavity-nesting vertebrates depend, for nesting and roosting, on the limited resource of tree cavities. These cavities are produced by avian excavators and decay processes in trees infected with heart-rot fungi. Conservation of cavity-nesting communities requires a solid understanding of how cavities are produced and used; however, no studies have examined the interactions among cavity producers and consumers in tropical forest. Moreover, the role of heart-rot fungi in producing cavities for nesting vertebrates has not been studied at the community level anywhere in the world. We studied a " nest web" , or interspecific hierarchical network of cavity producers and users, in the Atlantic forest, a tropical biodiversity hotspot of high conservation concern, in South America. We searched for active nests in tree cavities from 2006 to 2010, and determined the species of trees, heart-rot fungi, and avian excavators that produced the cavities and the species of non-excavating birds (secondary cavity-nesters) that used them. We identified two main pathways that produced the cavities used by non-excavators. Thirty-three percent of passerine nests and 9% of non-passerine nests were in cavities produced by avian excavators; the majority of nests (83% overall) were in cavities produced directly by decay processes including mechanical damage, invertebrate damage, and fungal decay (non-excavated cavities). Trees bearing cavities produced by excavators were 2/3 the diameter of those bearing non-excavated cavities, had eight times the odds of being dead, and 37 times the odds of being colonized with heart-rot fungi in the family Polyporaceae s.l. (vs. Hymenochaetaceae that were dominant in trees bearing non-excavated cavities). In contrast to nest webs in North America, the Atlantic Forest nest web was characterized by high diversity and evenness of interactions, whereby non-excavating bird species did not depend on any one species of tree, fungus or avian excavator for cavity production. The community should thus be relatively robust to extinctions of cavity producing species. However, on-going destruction of large living trees with non-excavated cavities is likely to disrupt the major pathway of cavity production, and may result in a shift toward greater dependence on excavated cavities in smaller, dead trees, infected with Polyporaceae and occupied primarily by passerine birds. To conserve cavity-using communities in tropical forests, governments and certification agencies should implement policies that result in the retention of several large living trees per hectare. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Expansion of the monospecific mangrove, Kandelia obovata, has converted intertidal mudflats and other habitats into mangrove forests, thus reducing estuarine biodiversity in the Danshuei River estuary, northern Taiwan. Dense mangrove vegetation was removed to create a small patchwork of mudflats and a tidal creek in February 2007. Subsequent changes in sediment properties and biodiversity of the macrobenthos and avian communities were examined. The results showed that the creation of different habitats led to changes in sediment properties and biodiversity. The water content and sorting degree of the sediments differed significantly among the restored mudflat, the tidal creek, and the mangrove control site. Silt/clay, organic carbon content, and chlorophyll a concentrations varied seasonally, but not among sites. The abundance of polychaetes in the creek was greater than that in the mudflat or the mangrove (12.5 vs. 5.3 and 2.2 individuals/m 2, respectively), suggesting preferential colonization of infaunal polychaetes in habitats with prolonged submersion. Crabs showed seasonal changes in density, with higher densities in summer than in autumn and winter. The species richness of wintering shorebirds on the created mudflat increased dramatically from 2002 to 2007. The transformation of a vegetated area into an open mudflat appeared to benefit shorebirds by providing roosting habitat. Our study demonstrated that controlling the spread of estuarine mangrove forests could increase biodiversity, and could particularly benefit the migratory shorebird community. © 2010 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract={The effect of floristic and structural characteristics of vegetation on the forest songbird communities in two Nature Parks: Medvednica and Žumberak - Samoborsko gorje was studied. The point-count method was used for analyzing songbird communities and circular plot method for habitat mapping, on 101 points at both sites. Non-parametric test were used (Kruskal- Wallis and Kendal Tau). The tree basal area was used to classify studied points into five forest types (beech, oak, mixed deciduous, coniferous and mixed coniferous forests) and as indication of the stand maturity. The total of 27 and 32 songbird species were recorded on Medvednica and Žumberak - Samoborsko gorje respectively. Diversity was higher on Žumberak - Samoborsko gorje due to greater habitat fragmentation, while population density of songbirds was greater on Medvednica. Among structural characteristics, those related to forest age (average tree basal area and number of the small trees) had the most pronounced effect to the total songbird density and densities of different ecological groups of birds. Sørensen index showed that in spite of the differences in floristic composition between particular forest types in two studied areas (0.475 ± 0.120), songbird communities showed high similarity (0.872 ± 0.070). The highest similarity of songbird communities between Parks was recorded in beech and oak stands. Oak stands showed the lowest similarity in tree species composition and no significant difference in structural characteristics, while beech stands had many different structural features and several differences in densities of ecological groups of birds. The greatest difference of bird densities in the particular forest type between two Parks was found in beech and mixed coniferous stands. High structural differences between these two forests were the result of the forest age; bird populations had higher densities in older stands.},

abstract={The expansion of industrial oil palm cultivation threatens tropical biodiversity globally, especially in developing countries. Driven by plans to generate economic revenue, large-scale plantations are emerging in Southeast Asia, Africa and Brazilian Amazon. However, the ecological impacts of the sector are poorly studied with respect to oil palm management system, and recommended conservation measures are based on limited data. We studied avifauna in oil palm landscapes in Peninsular Malaysia under different management systems (large plantation estates versus smallholdings) and age classes (uniform age versus mixed-age stands). We sampled 41 large plantation estates and 14 smallholdings, as well as 20 sites in an extensively logged peat swamp forest, the type of natural forest prior to conversion to oil palms. Compared with logged peat swamp forest, our results showed that forest conversion to oil palm cultivation may have eliminated 48-60% of bird species. We also found: (i) plantation estates and smallholdings supported similar bird assemblages but the latter supported significantly more species (P=0.007); and (ii) despite reduced species richness in oil palm landscapes, we found high abundance of some individual bird species in specific types of stands including some forest, migratory, and wetland species. Conversion of natural forest to oil palm landscapes should not occur in the future through clearing of primary or secondary native forests. To complement conventional conservation approaches (e.g. the establishment of protected areas) in palm oil-producing countries, existing plantation estates and smallholdings should be managed in ways to promote improved conservation outcomes, although oil palm landscapes maintained a fraction of the original forest biodiversity. Managing habitat heterogeneity at both a local and a landscape-level is highly recommended in oil palm landscapes to maintain and/or enhance avian biodiversity. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={There is a paucity of research on the wider landscape-level effects of ski-piste construction on alpine fauna. In this study, the response of alpine bird communities to the landscape changes induced by the construction of ski-pistes was investigated in the western Italian Alps. The aims were: (i) to test the hypothesis that ski-pistes have a detrimental effect on alpine grassland bird communities at a landscape-scale; and, (ii) to model local probability distributions of bird species according to different scenarios of ski-piste restoration and ski-piste proliferation above the treeline. Species richness and presence/absence data from point counts were analyzed in relation to GIS-derived landscape variables based on a 16. ha hexagon grid. Predictive variables were selected through the LASSO model selection procedure, and logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of occurrence of each species in each hexagon. Grassland species richness, and probability of occurrence of water pipit, wheatear and black redstart, significantly decreased with increasing extent of ski-piste edge. Length of ski-piste edge was in the set of best models considering a large range of habitat and landscape predictors, and are therefore clearly features that exert a strong negative effect on high alpine grassland bird communities. Predictions of species occurrence were made by applying the models to different scenarios of habitat change. These showed predicted detrimental impacts of a relatively small 10% increase in ski-piste extent, but also that grassland restoration on existing ski-pistes could result in significantly increased occurrence rates of alpine grassland species. This study suggests that ski-pistes are perceived by birds as detrimental features of the alpine landscape. To minimize their impact, new, environmentally-friendly ways of constructing pistes should be developed, which could include habitat restoration and management to obtain a level of grass cover such that edges of ski-pistes are no longer perceived by birds. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Water level and water surface area fluctuations are important factors determining abundance of bird populations and bird assemblages structure in a wetland habitat. The water level and water surface area of the Marsh Tömörd (West Hungary) changed drastically between 1998 and 2008, and the marsh dried out because of scarce rainfall in 2000 and 2001. A habitat restoration in winter 2001 repaired the waterholding capacity of the marsh. We analyzed changes in parameters of bird assemblages in investigated wetland area in relation of environmental factors. We used full redundancy analysis (RDA) on number of caugth migratory birds per year, species richness, diversity and evenness of bird assemblages to examine correlations among water level, water surface area and vegetation core. Species like water rail, common snipe, river warbler, Savi's warbler, great reed warbler, reed warbler, marsh warbler, sedge warbler, reed bunting showed high and positive linear correlations with the water level and water surface area in the postbreeding period. Some wetland species, sedge warbler, Savi's warbler and reed bunting as well as total number of caugth birds per year and total numbers of caugth species per year were clearly associated with thick marsh vegetation. According to our results the bird species composition of the wetland might have returned to the prerestoration levels and surface areas. © 2011 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={High mountain rangelands host important populations of threatened bird species, but can be affected by extensive changes in land use. I studied the breeding bird community of two shrubland plots at 1,850-2,100 m a.s.l. in the Pyrenees. Breeding territories were mapped for four years, before and after the prescribed burning, the aim of which was to increase the grazing value of the study area. The most abundant species (reaching ≥3 breeding pairs/10 ha in at least one plot and one year) were Dunnock Prunella modularis, Dartford Warbler Sylvia undata, Stonechat Saxicola torquatus, Rock Bunting Emberiza cia and Ortolan Bunting E. hortulana. The open-shrubland plot contained a similar number of breeding species (10 vs. 9), but a lower overall density (23 vs. 28 breeding pairs/10 ha) than the dense-shrubland plot. Most breeding species also occurred in winter. After fire, the number of bird species, overall density and conservation value (an index that takes into account all species' densities and their categories of conservation concern in Europe) decreased, but tended to recover afterwards. These results may help understand the composition and dynamics of bird assemblages in managed mountain areas.},

abstract={In Australian urban environments, revegetation and vegetation restoration are increasingly utilized conservation actions. Simple methods that help assess the utility of urban vegetation for bird species will help direct this effort for bird conservation purposes. We therefore examine whether ecological principles can be used to predict, a priori, the relative abundance of different bird species in urban vegetation. Our model proposes that a bird species will be in greater abundance where vegetation structure better reflects its foraging height requirements, and this relationship will be moderated by the landscape context of the patch. To quantify and test this model, we created an index to rank existing and revegetated urban vegetation sites in order of greatest expected abundance for each of 30 bird species. We tested this model, alongside two simpler models which consider landscape context and foraging height preferences alone, using bird abundance data from 20 woodland remnants and 20 revegetated sites in Brisbane, Australia. From these bird abundance data, we calculated the relative abundance of each species between the top-ranking sites and lowest-ranking sites. The model which incorporated both foraging height requirements and landscape context made predictions that were positively correlated with the data for 77% of species in remnant vegetation and 67% in revegetation. The results varied across species groups; for example, we achieved lower predictive success for canopy foraging species in the less mature revegetation sites. Overall, this model provided a reasonable level of predictive accuracy despite the diversity of factors which can influence species occurrence in urban landscapes. The model is generic and, subject to further testing, can be used to examine the effect of manipulating vegetation structure and landscape context on the abundance of different bird species in urban vegetation. This could provide a cost-effective tool for directing urban restoration and revegetation efforts. © 2011 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2011 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract={Ecological survey was executed to assess woody species encroachment into the grassland plain of Nechisar National Park (NNP). Forty-one woody species were recorded. Dichrostachys cinerea Wight &amp; Arn., Acacia mellifera (Vahl) Benth., Acacia nilotica (L) Willd., Acacia senegal (L.) Willd., Acacia seyal Del. and Acacia tortilis (Forssk.) Hayne were among the major encroaching woody species. The majority of the woody species were found to be highly aggregated in their pattern of distribution, while only few species showed some degree of randomness. The mean woody species density was ca. 1995 woody plantsha-1. Mean cover of woody, grass, unpalatable forbs and total herbaceous species were 31%, 58%, 68% and 121%, respectively. The woody species density and cover, unpalatable forbs and bare land cover were significantly higher in the highly grazed and fire-suppressed part of the grassland plain. Pearson correlation coefficient matrix indicated that woody species cover and density were negatively correlated with total herbaceous and grass cover. The high woody, unpalatable forbs and bare land cover indicated the progressively increasing perennial grass species diversity deterioration in the grass plain of the Park. Decline in the grassland condition, unless reversed, will jeopardize the biological diversity as well as the aesthetic value of the NNP. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In fragmented landscapes, changes in habitat availability, patch size, shape and isolation may affect survival of local populations. Proposing efficient conservation strategies for such species relies initially on distinguishing the particular effects of those factors. To address these issues, we investigated the occurrence of 3 bird species in fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest landscapes. Playback techniques were used to collect presence/absence data of these species inside 80 forest patches, and incidence models were used to infer their occupancy pattern from landscape spatial structure. The relative importance of patch size, shape and surrounding forest cover and isolation was assessed using a model selection approach based on maximum likelihood estimation. The presence of all species was in general positively affected by the amount of surrounding habitat and negatively affected by inter-patch distances. The joint effects of patch size and the surrounding landscape characteristics were important determinants of occupancy for two species. The third species was affected only by forest cover and mean patch isolation. Our results suggest that local species presence is in general more influenced by the isolation from surrounding forests than by patch size alone. We found evidence that, in highly fragmented landscapes, birds that can not find patches large enough to settle may be able to overcome short distances through the matrix and include several nearby patches within their home-ranges to complement their resource needs. In these cases, patches must be defined as functionally connected habitat networks rather than mere continuous forest segments. Bird conservation strategies in the Atlantic forest should focus on increasing patch density and connectivity, in order to implement forest networks that reduce the functional isolation between large remnants with remaining core habitat. © 2011 The Authors.},

abstract={Saving the remaining natural forests in northern Europe has been one of the main goals to halt the ongoing decline of forest biodiversity. To facilitate the recognition, mapping and efficient conservation of natural forests, there is an urgent need for a general formulation, based on ecological patterns and processes, of the concept of "forest naturalness". However, complexity, structural idiosyncracy and dynamical features of unmanaged forest ecosystems at various spatio-temporal scales pose major challenges for such a formulation. The definitions hitherto used for the concept of forest naturalness can be fruitfully grouped into three dimensions: 1) structure-based concepts of natural forest, 2) species-based concepts of natural forest and 3) process-based concepts of natural forest. We propose that explicit and simultaneous consideration of all these three dimensions of naturalness can better cope with the natural variability of forest states and also aid in developing strategies for forest conservation and management in different situations. To become operational, criteria and indicators of forest naturalness need to integrate the three dimensions by combining species (e.g. red-listed-, indicator- and umbrella species) with stand and landscape level structural features that are indicative of disturbance and succession processes.},

abstract={Efficient conservation planning in managed forest landscapes requires knowledge about the location of functional habitat for specialised species. We explored the importance of different variables to predict habitat suitability for the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos Bechstein), a proposed umbrella species in deciduous forest. Specifically, we tested whether biophysical proxy variables indicating management intensity and the occurrence of natural processes constituted a useful complement to traditional remotely sensed data on tree species composition and forest stand age for modelling the woodpecker's habitat. Presence absence of the woodpecker during the study period (1986-2006) in southwestern Sweden was explained by the area of edge habitats (forest bordering water or farmland) and wetland forest, and location relative to the historical marine limit. The number of years with occurrence of the woodpecker in a territory was explained by the area of forest bordering water and wetland forest. Among traditional forest variables, the area of deciduous forest had a strong positive effect on both woodpecker presence absence and the number of years with occurrence. The results support the hypothesis that edge habitats and forest types subject to natural processes favouring deciduous trees and dead wood creation are valuable to the woodpecker and should be prioritised in conservation planning. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The Red Hills region of south Georgia and north Florida contains one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems in North America, with longleaf pine trees that are up to four hundred years old and an understory of unparalleled plant life. At first glance, the longleaf woodlands at plantations like Greenwood, outside Thomasville, Georgia, seem undisturbed by market economics and human activity, but Albert G. Way contends that this environment was socially produced and that its story adds nuance to the broader narrative of American conservation. The Red Hills woodlands were thought of primarily as a healthful refuge for northern industrialists in the early twentieth century. When notable wildlife biologist Herbert Stoddard arrived in 1924, he began to recognize the area's ecological value. Stoddard was with the federal government, but he drew on local knowledge to craft his land management practices, to the point where a distinctly southern, agrarian form of ecological conservation emerged. This set of practices was in many respects progressive, particularly in its approach to fire management and species diversity, and much of it remains in effect today. Using Stoddard as a window into this unique conservation landscape, Conserving Southern Longleaf positions the Red Hills as a valuable center for research into and understanding of wildlife biology, fire ecology, and the environmental appreciation of a region once dubbed simply the "pine barrens." © 2011 by the University of Georgia Press.

abstract={Prescribed fire is an important, ecology-driven tool for restoration of grassland systems. However, prescribed fire remains controversial for some grassland managers because of reported reductions in bird use of recently burned grasslands. Few studies have evaluated effects of fire on grassland bird populations in the northern mixed-grass prairie region. Fewer studies yet have examined the influence of fire on nest density or survival. In our review, we found no studies that simultaneously examined effects of fire on duck and passerine nesting. During 1998-2003, we examined effects of prescribed fire on the density of upland-nesting ducks and passerines nesting in north-central North Dakota, USA. Apparent nest densities of gadwall (Anas strepera), mallard (A. platyrhynchos), and all duck species combined, were influenced by fire history of study units, although the degree of influence was not compelling. Fire history was not related to nest densities of blue-winged teal (A. discors), northern shoveler (A. clypeata), or northern pintail (A. acuta); however, apparent nest densities in relation to the number of postfire growing seasons exhibited a strikingly similar pattern among all duck species. When compared to ducks, fire history strongly influenced apparent nest densities of clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). For most species examined, apparent nest densities were lowest in recently burned units, increased during the second postfire growing season, and stabilized or, in some cases, decreased thereafter. Prescribed fire is critical for restoring the ecology of northern mixed-grass prairies and our findings indicate that reductions in nest densities are limited mostly to the first growing season after fire. Our results support the premise that upland-nesting ducks and several grassland passerine species are adapted to periodic fires occurring at a frequency similar to that of pre-Euro-American settlement of the region. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Context Rehabilitation is increasingly being promoted as a strategy for minimising and even reversing biodiversity loss. Many rehabilitation strategies that aim to provide habitat focus entirely on establishing vegetation. Successful vegetation establishment, however, does not necessarily provide habitat that is ecologically equivalent to that removed by vegetation clearing. Quantitative understanding of faunal responses to rehabilitation is required if rehabilitation techniques are to be refined and deliver desired biodiversity outcomes. Aims I aimed to assess the extent to which post-mining rehabilitation restores bird habitat equivalent to that removed in the mining process on the Weipa bauxite plateau. Methods The composition, abundance and richness of bird assemblages were compared between native forest sites and a 23-year chronosequence of post-mining rehabilitation sites. Native forest sites were made up of three Weipa bauxite plateau land units, including the land unit that represents pre-mining native forest, and two land units that are considered to be potential analogues for the post-mining landscape. Key results Bird abundance and bird species richness increased with rehabilitation age. Bird species richness in the two oldest age classes of mine rehabilitation was similar to values obtained from pre-mining native forest and post-mining landscape analogue sites. The composition of bird assemblages, however, was significantly different. Of all the bird species observed, 25% occurred exclusively in native forest sites, 19% occurred exclusively in mine-rehabilitation sites, and the remaining 56% were recorded in both native forest and mine-rehabilitation sites. Site bird-detection rates were significantly related to site vegetation structure, with inter-specific differences in bird response. Conclusions Post-mining rehabilitation at Weipa has partially made up for the loss of habitat caused by clearing for mining. Twenty-three years after rehabilitation commenced, however, a clear residual impact on biodiversity remains, with a third of native forest birds absent from mine rehabilitation, including several native forest specialists. Implications Rehabilitation can partially make up for biodiversity losses caused by the initial loss of habitat. There is no evidence, however, that rehabilitation can achieve 'no net loss'. Reliance on rehabilitation to achieve conservation outcomes does not address the fact that many fauna species require resources that are found only in mature forest. © 2011 CSIRO.},

abstract={Although intensively managed pine forests are common in the southeastern US, few studies describe how combinations of mechanical (MSP) and chemical site preparation (CSP) and herbaceous weed control (HWC) techniques affect bird communities that use early successional habitats within young pine forests. Therefore, we examined effects of six treatments of increasing management intensity via combinations of MSP (strip-shear and wide spacing or roller chop and narrow spacing) and CSP (application or no application) treatments with banded or broadcast HWC on bird communities in six loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, for 8. years following site preparation. Wide pine spacing and strip-shear MSP increased bird abundance and species richness over narrow spacing and chopped MSP for 6. years after planting. Chemical SP reduced bird abundance in year 2, increased bird abundance in year 6, had no effect on abundance after year 7, and did not affect species richness in any year. Total bird abundance and species richness were similar between banded and broadcast HWC. Site preparation and HWC had no effect on bird diversity and bird communities were most similar in treatments of similar intensity. Site preparation and HWC had few or no effects on birds based upon migratory status, habitat association, or conservation value. The addition of chemical site preparation or HWC had little effect on birds beyond pine spacing, and bird abundance was not proportional to management intensity. Although we observed treatment effects, all treatments provided habitat used by a variety of bird species, and pine plantations may play an increasingly important role in bird conservation as forests become fragmented and converted to other land uses and as natural processes that create early successional habitat, such as fire, are suppressed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Habitat loss and degradation on oceanic islands are key processes leading to population decline of endemic birds and facilitating the establishment of invasive bird species. In this study, carried out in the Robinson Crusoe Island, we assessed density and habitat selection of terrestrial bird species, including juan fernandez firecrown and juan fernandez tit-tyrant, two endemics, as well as green-backed firecrown and austral thrush, which apparently originate from the mainland. Results show that perturbed habitats contained a low density of the endemic species whereas the mainland species were significantly more abundant in perturbed scrub habitats. Bird species show different habitat selection patterns, with endemics selecting for native forest and mainland species selecting for perturbed habitats, or using them at random. Bird species experienced temporal trends in their overall population sizes, with the endemic tit-tyrant suffering a significant decline in its population size of about 63% between 1994 and 2009. Only mainland species exhibited temporal changes in habitat use, significantly reducing their densities in the preferred scrub habitats, possibly as a response to decreased habitat quality. Thrushes apparently were able to compensate the population decrease in one non native habitat type by using native forests, a habitat giving them the opportunity of preying on nests of endemic species. We conclude that endemic bird species behave as specialists whereas the mainland species must be treated as invasive generalists on Robinson Crusoe Island. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={1 Wood-boring larvae in the families Cerambycidae and Buprestidae are often found in high densities in burned trees after wildland fires. They play an important role in tree decomposition, often reducing the value of salvageable timber, and represent an important avian food source. 2 Three forest areas that experienced wildfires 1-3 years previously were surveyed during the summer of 2004. Ponderosa pine trees with green, scorched and consumed needles were examined for wood borer occurrence. Within each of the three needle damage categories, the mean wood borer incidence was similar between different age fires. Trees with scorched or consumed needles had significantly more wood borers than trees with green needles. 3 Larvae collected from under tree bark were identified to family; when possible, cerambycids were identified further to Acanthocinus spp., Monochamus sp., Rhagium inquisitor (L.) and Stictoleptura canadensis (LeConte), and buprestids were identified to Chalcophora spp. and Chrysobothris sp. 4 Classification tree models showed that the estimated probability of tree infestation by wood borers varied among needle damage categories. For trees with green needles, tree injury variables of high bole char height and phloem discolouration were important predictive variables. In trees where needles were consumed, tree size variables of diameter at breast height and tree height were important predictive variables. 5 More than half the dead trees examined were infested with wood borers, indicating that infestation of fire-killed ponderosa pine may represent an important food source for species such as woodpeckers and a potential problem for the utilization of infested trees.

Each visualized bird had its behavior, pearching place and localization registered. Four environments were classified as been used by birds: tall grassland, short grassland, Pinus sp. and crops. Repeated Measures ANOVA was applied for compare seasons and environments and Factor ANOVA for relate carcasses and bird abundances. Canonical Discriminant Analysis evaluated species composition differences between environments. 13 species were found. Coragyps atratus was the more abundant specie (n = 83). Most species were rare in frequency. Specie richness did not response significant for seasons and environment interaction (F = 0,749; gl = 3; P = 0,553) and for seasons (F = 2,15; gl = 3; P = 0,180). There was significant richness differences among habitats (F = 8,83; gl = 3; P < 0,01). Abundance was significantly related with carcasses size (F = 5,62, gl = 6; P = 0,001).

abstract={Peat swamp forest is a unique wetland ecosystem covering extensive areas in Southeast Asia that has received relatively little scientific attention and is now being lost at a rapid pace. This study examines the effects of anthropogenic degradation on bird communities in disturbed peat swamp forest habitats - namely, intact logged forest, a degraded forest fragment, and non-forest regrowth - in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Results show that species richness was significantly higher and species composition significantly different in intact logged forest in comparison to the degraded forest fragment and non-forested area. Nectarivore and tree foliage-gleaning insectivore abundance declined outside the intact forest, while the regrowth was dominated by the yellow vented bulbul, an open country insectivore-frugivore. Surveys reveal that large intact tracts of logged peat swamp forest can harbour threatened and near threatened bird species (36% of records) and thus play a role in their conservation, especially for a few habitat specialists. Given the extent of unmanaged degraded peatlands and continuing pressure to development them, urgent conservation actions are needed to rehabilitate and protect this ecosystem. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={After nearly a century of height suppression, willows (Salix spp.) in the northern range of Yellowstone National Park, USA, are increasing in height growth as a possible consequence of wolf (Canis lupus) restoration, climate change, or other factors. Regardless of the drivers, the recent release of this rare but important habitat type could have significant implications for associated songbirds that are exhibiting declines in the region. Our objective was to evaluate bird response to releasing willows by comparing willow structure and bird community composition across three willow growth conditions: height suppressed, recently released, and previously tall (i.e., tall prior to the height increase of released willows). Released and previously tall willows exhibited high and similar vertical structure, but released willows were significantly lower in horizontal structure. Suppressed willows were significantly shorter and lower in horizontal cover than released or previously tall willows. Bird richness increased along a gradient from lowest in suppressed to highest in previously tall willows, but abundance and diversity were similar between released and previously tall willows, despite lower horizontal cover in the released condition. Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) and Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza lincolnii ) were found in all three growth conditions; however, Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia), Warbling Vireo (Vireo gilvus), Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii ), and Song Sparrow (Melospiza melodii ) were present in released and previously tall willows only. Wilson's Warbler (Wilsonia pusilla) was found in previously tall willows only, appearing to specialize on tall, dense willows. The results of our a priori habitat models indicated that foliage height diversity was the primary driver of bird richness, abundance, and diversity. These results indicate that vertical structure was a more important driver of bird community variables than horizontal structure and that riparian and willowdependent bird species have responded positively to increased willow growth in the region. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={We present an approach to modeling potential climate-driven changes in habitat for tree and bird species in the eastern United States. First, we took an empirical-statistical modeling approach, using randomForest, with species abundance data from national inventories combined with soil, climate, and landscape variables, to build abundance-based habitat models for 134 tree and 147 bird species. We produced lists of species for which suitable habitat tends to increase, decrease, or stay the same for any region. Independent assessments of trends of large trees versus seedlings across the eastern U. S. show that 37 of 40 species in common under both studies are currently trending as modeled. We developed a framework, ModFacs, in which we used the literature to assign default modification factor scores for species characteristics that cannot be readily assessed in such models, including 12 disturbance factors (for example, drought, fire, insect pests), nine biological factors (for example, dispersal, shade tolerance), and assessment scores of novel climates, long-distance extrapolations, and output variability by climate model and emission scenario. We also used a spatially explicit cellular model, SHIFT, to calculate colonization potentials for some species, based on their abundance, historic dispersal distances, and the fragmented nature of the landscape. By combining results from the three efforts, we can create projections of potential climate change impacts over the next 100 years or so. Here we emphasize some of the lessons we have learned over 16 years in hopes that they may help guide future experiments, modeling efforts, and management. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).},

abstract={Transportation corridors (notably roads) affect wildlife habitat, populations, and entire ecosystems. Considerable effort has been expended to quantify direct effects of roads on wildlife populations and ecological communities and processes. Much less effort has been expended toward quantifying indirect effects. In this report, we provide a comprehensive review of road/transportation corridor ecology; in particular, how this new field of ecology has advanced worldwide. Further, we discuss how research thus far has shaped our understanding and views of the ecological implications of transportation infrastructures, and, in turn, how this has led to the current guidance, policies, and management options. We learned that the impacts of transportation infrastructures are a global issue, with the potential to affect a wide variety of taxonomically diverse species and ecosystems. Because the majority of research to date has focused on the direct and more aesthetic and anthropocentric implications of transportation corridors, mainly wildlife-vehicle collisions, it is a fairly standard practice to incorporate underpasses, green bridges (i.e., overpasses), fencing, and barriers into road corridors to alleviate such impacts. Few studies, however, have been able to demonstrate the efficiency of these structures. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident that the indirect implications of transportation infrastructures (i.e., behavioral responses of wildlife individuals to roads) may be more pervasive, at least from the standpoint of biological diversity. Understanding how road corridors influence the functional connectivity of landscapes is crucial if we are to effectively manage species of concern. With these issues in mind, we propose a program of study that addresses the indirect and cumulative implications of transportation infrastructure on species distributions, community structure and ecosystem function.},

abstract={There has been a rapid decline of grassland bird species in the UK over the last four decades. In order to stem declines in biodiversity such as this, mitigation in the form of newly created habitat and restoration of degraded habitats is advocated in the UK biodiversity action plan. One potential restored habitat that could support a number of bird species is re-created grassland on restored landfill sites. However, this potential largely remains unexplored. In this study, birds were counted using point sampling on nine restored landfill sites in the East Midlands region of the UK during 2007 and 2008. The effects of restoration were investigated by examining bird species composition, richness, and abundance in relation to habitat and landscape structure on the landfill sites in comparison to paired reference sites of existing wildlife value. Twelve bird species were found in total and species richness and abundance on restored landfill sites was found to be higher than that of reference sites. Restored landfill sites support both common grassland bird species and also UK Red List bird species such as skylark Alauda arvensis, grey partridge Perdix perdix, lapwing Vanellus vanellus, tree sparrow, Passer montanus, and starling Sturnus vulgaris. Size of the site, percentage of bare soil and amount of adjacent hedgerow were found to be the most influential habitat quality factors for the distribution of most bird species. Presence of open habitat and crop land in the surrounding landscape were also found to have an effect on bird species composition. Management of restored landfill sites should be targeted towards UK Red List bird species since such sites could potentially play a significant role in biodiversity action planning. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Capsule: Fragments of olive groves and riparian galleries have a positive influence on bird assemblages in Cork Oak woodlands. Aims: Assess the impact of fragments of olive groves and riparian vegetation on the birds of the matrix of Cork Oak woodland. Methods: Bird point counts at increasing distances (0, 50, 150, 250 and 350m) from 15 olive groves and 13 sectors of riparian vegetation embedded in a matrix of Cork Oak woodland to determine species assemblages and species abundance. Results: A total of 72 bird species were recorded during the spring, and 61 in winter. The diversity of the bird assemblages of the Cork Oak matrix was somewhat greater near fragments. The density of six out of the 17 most abundant bird species varied due to the presence of olive groves or riparian vegetation. Of those, five were more abundant near the fragments and only one was less abundant. These effects could be mostly predicted from the species' density in the fragments of olive groves and riparian vegetation and depended on the season. Conclusions: In Mediterranean landscapes dominated by Cork Oak woodlands, the maintenance of the existing networks of olive grove fragments and riparian galleries has a positive effect on the bird assemblages of the woodland matrix. The increase in abundance of birds near olive groves and riparian galleries is probably due to the additional fruit resources provided by the fragments, especially in winter. We conclude that active maintenance of the existing fragments should be included in the management of this valuable agricultural-silvicultural-pastoral system. © 2011 British Trust for Ornithology.},

abstract={Farmland birds have suffered significant declines in the last decades due to agricultural intensification. Agri-environment schemes (AES) aim to reverse this process by promoting "nature friendly" practises at the field-scale. AES based on the habitat requirements of target species have usually been successful, but the concurrence of species groups with contrasting habitat requirements (guilds) makes the design of successful measures for the whole bird community difficult. The effectiveness of AES is also constrained by landscape and regional effects not addressed by its field-scale application. Effects acting at different spatial scales could differ among bird species depending on basic life-history traits such home range size and landscape perception, which should covary with body size. We are not aware, however, of any study which investigates whether relative effects at different spatial scales could vary predictably within bird guilds. We analyse whether relative effects of within-field (including AES application), landscape and regional factors on open-land birds differ according to body size. Large birds were mostly affected by regional and landscape factors, whereas for small birds landscape and within-field factors were important. Hence, relative effects at changing spatial scales showed predictable variation according to bird size within this endangered and specialised farmland guild. These size-dependent effects should be taken into account for the design of more effective, integrated multi-scale strategies for the conservation of farmland birds. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Forest managers often seek to balance economic benefits from timber harvesting with maintenance of habitat for wildlife, ecosystem function, and human uses. Most research on the relationship between avian abundance and active timber management has been short-term, lasting one to two years, creating the need to investigate long-term avian responses and to identify harvest thresholds when a small change in habitat results in a disproportionate response in relative abundance and nest success. Our objectives were to identify trends in relative abundance and nest success and to identify landscape-scale disturbance thresholds for avian species and habitat guilds in response to a variety of harvest treatments (clear-cuts, heavy and light partial harvests) over 14 years. We conducted point counts and monitored nests at an industrial forest in the central Appalachians of West Virginia during 1996-1998, 2001-2003, and 2007-2009. Early successional species increased in relative abundance across all three time periods, whereas interior-edge and forest-interior guilds peaked in relative abundance mid-study after which the forest-interior guild declined. Of 41 species with >10 detections, four (10%) declined significantly, 13 (32%) increased significantly (only three species among all periods), and 9 (22%) peaked in abundance mid-study (over the entire study period, four species had no significant change in abundance, four declined, and one increased). Based on piecewise linear models, forest-interior and interior-edge guilds' relative abundance harvest thresholds were 28% total harvests (all harvests combined), 10% clear-cut harvests, and 18% light partial harvests, after which abundances declined. Harvest thresholds for the early successional guild were 42% total harvests, 11% clear-cut harvest, and 10% light partial harvests, and relative abundances increased after surpassing thresholds albeit at a reduced rate of increase after the clear-cut threshold. Threshold confidence intervals for individual species overlapped their guild threshold intervals 91% of the time. Even though relative abundance of most species (80%) did not decline as the area affected by timber management increased, implementing management at or below our approximate forest-interior and interior-edge harvest thresholds would reduce the number of declining species by half, maintain higher relative abundances of four species with a net decline in abundance but that peaked in abundance mid-study, and maintain higher relative abundances of ten additional species. In contrast, this management strategy also would prevent the increase in relative abundance of seven species and limit the increase in abundance of three species that increased throughout the study. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Capsule: Populations of birds on farmland are larger and more stable in Hungary than in the UK and may provide baseline targets when planning population restoration programmes in more intensively farmed regions of Europe. Aims: To review the available evidence on farmland bird populations and their changes over the past century in Hungary, and to compare this with similar data for the UK. Methods: Published papers and grey literature were searched to determine long-term bird population trends for birds on farmland in Hungary, and for research evidence on the relationship between farmland management and bird diversity in Hungary. Results: Population density of common farmland birds is higher and trends are more positive in Hungary compared to the UK. These findings correlate with the recent change to generally less intensive agriculture in Hungary. However, while the birdlife associated with farmland in Hungary can be considered to have high diversity and density, it is still lower than it was in the first half of the 20th century and earlier. The few studies available showed that low-intensity traditional management promotes a rich biodiversity in both grasslands and arable systems in Hungary. Agri-environment schemes were introduced when Hungary joined the EU in 2004; however, their influence on biodiversity has not been systematically monitored. Conclusions: Insights emerging from farmland bird research in those European countries which still practice extensive agricultural techniques could be used to set general baseline targets for restoring biodiversity in regions where farmlands are now intensively managed. At the European scale urgent tasks are to: (1) investigate the relationships between management and bird diversity and density on a much wider geographical scale, (2) evaluate the geographical generality of the existing evidence base (which is mainly based on studies conducted in more intensively farmed regions), and (3) enhance the policy impact of conservation research. © 2011 British Trust for Ornithology.},

abstract={Knowledge about associations between habitat and population density is essential for ecological studies and management alike, for instance, to identify high-density areas worthy of protection. Furthermore, habitat-density associations are important for setting targets, e.g. in agri-environmental schemes. However, habitat associations need to be constant across management units, which may be entire countries; otherwise management should be targeted at smaller, internally homogenous regions. We use data on 13 Swiss farmland bird species from 128 study sites to test for the generality of the association between territory density and six key habitat descriptors: the density of hedges and woodland edges, and the proportion of meadows, pastures, crops and fallow land at each study site. We modelled observed territory counts in overdispersed Poisson regressions, with and without zero-inflation, and including the interactions between four geographical regions and six habitat descriptors. To test for spatial transferability of habitat-density associations, we also fitted the corresponding main-effects models. As a continuous alternative to discrete regions, we fitted models with altitude and its interactions with habitat, to test for the generality of habitat-density associations across the 1885 m altitudinal gradient in our study (365-2250 m a.s.l.). Finally, we tested for nonlinearity as a possible reason for geographical non-transferability of habitat-density associations. The interactions between either region or altitude and habitat-density associations were important in 10 of 13 species, showing that habitat-density associations were not transferable. Discrete regions were the best descriptor of the spatial variation in habitat-density associations in seven species, and altitude in six. Simple overdispersed Poisson regressions were superior to zero-inflated models for 12 of 13 species. For 6 species nonlinearity was a sufficient explanation for the observed non-transferability. Non-transferability of habitat-density relationships might stem from biological reasons or from methodological inconsistencies. To distinguish between them, to suggest better management actions and to improve species habitat models, focused habitat-density studies ought to be replicated at various sites. Our study emphasizes the need for spatial stratification of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environmental schemes), otherwise, they may be inefficient or even harmful. Ideally, the spatial extent of internally homogenous regions ought to be investigated for efficient conservation management. © 2011 The Authors. Ecography © 2011 Ecography.},

abstract={Many river revitalization projects are currently under development, but we still lack proper assessments of their effects on biodiversity, especially regarding non-aquatic vertebrates. We analysed the progressive changes in habitat mosaics, and the demographic response of two rare species of wading birds along a Swiss section of the Rhone river over a period of three decades. During the period preceding revitalization, the diversity of the habitat mosaic had been steadily declining. This impoverishment could however be reverted after 1994, when the revitalization was initiated: in 2006, the re-established habitat matrix was more diverse than at any time during the previous 27. years. The formerly channelized stream underwent radical transformation as it mutated into a heterogeneous braided river boosting pioneer riverine habitats. This has led the two wading bird species to establish significantly more territories than before the revitalization operations. Population size of Actitis hypoleucos and Charadrius dubius increased by 83% and 20%, respectively, between 1995 and 2007. During the same period, A. hypoleucos declined dramatically in Switzerland as a whole, whilst C. dubius showed no distinct population trend. The response of the two waders may have resulted from an increase in the number of lateral arms of the river, where the availability of productive temporary ponds provides excellent foraging opportunities. A significant proportion of these habitats was created by a targeted extraction of sediments with the objective to promote biodiversity while maintaining economic activity and improving security against floods. This suggests that gravel exploitation is not incompatible with efficient river restoration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Although snags are often considered to be a limiting factor for cavity-nesting birds within intensively managed pine (Pinus spp.) stands, there is little information regarding occurrences of snags and cavity-nesting birds for such stands in the southeastern United States. Therefore, during 2002-2003, we measured characteristics of individual snags (n = 1,218) and quantified the relative abundance of cavity-nesting birds (n = 204 observations; nine species) in 35 forest stands representing seven thinning classes (prior to thinning, three age classes following a first commercial thinning, and three age classes following a second commercial thinning entry) in intensively managed pine stands in eastern North Carolina. Snag populations were dynamic, with 649 snags falling and 75 new snags recruited between years. Stands in later thinning classes tended to have snags with larger diameters, less bark, and fewer limbs, and they were taller and more decayed (P <0.05). Our data suggest that neither density of snags (P = 0.31) nor relative abundance of cavity-nesting birds (P = 0.25) differed strongly among thinning classes. Without active management, low recruitment coupled with the high loss rates that we observed could lead to low snag densities in older managed stands. Therefore, we suggest that forest managers consider retaining large-diameter dead or live trees as reserve trees through multiple rotations to increase or maintain snags in managed stands.

abstract={Mating behaviour is an important component of species' life histories. Knowledge of natural patterns of mating can lead also to more effective management strategies for populations of conservation concern. Despite a high conservation profile many aspects of the biology of the common dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) remain unknown, potentially limiting present conservation efforts. We determine the mating behaviour of M. avellanarius at two woodland sites in the UK: (1) Bontuchel (a natural population in Wales) and (2) Wych (a population in England that was established by reintroducing captive-bred animals) by genotyping mothers and litters at a panel of 10 microsatellite loci. Adult female body weight positively correlates with litter size and no apparent reproductive skew was evident. We found that multiple mating by female dormice is prevalent at both sites, with litters containing three or more offspring sired by multiple fathers; moreover, multiple mating is adopted by released animals even after a period of captive breeding where females are mated singly or as a breeding pair. We also present evidence for low proportion of fathers identified in our samples that probably related to unsampled individuals and/or larger than anticipated population sizes. This first report of mating behaviour in M. avellanarius highlights the role of genetic studies to uncover species' reproductive behaviours and include these data for conservation management. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Lakeside wetland (aquatic-terrestrial zone) is a kind of important inter-land between the aquatic ecosystem and land terrestrial ecosystem, its main functions are as follows: keeping biodiversity of the lake wetland ecosystem, working as a buffer zone, protecting the lakeshore against the lake water erosion and so on. However the lakeshore system is also very vulnerable, in recent years, intensive human activities have resulted in deterioration of lake water, destruction of aquatic ecosystem, and especially destruction of lakeshore structure and function. In order to understand how to preserve the ecological functions of the lakeshore wetland properly, an ecological pilot project was carried out in Dalian Lake, Shanghai, and some scientific studies concerning about the restoration of ecological environment and the protection of biodiversity were also developed in the same time. This project covered the wetland ecological restoration process such as changing the land use pattern, developing the new drainage transformation, and reforming the vegetation distribution. From August 2008 to Match 2010, parameters including land use pattern, bird populations, amphibian populations, reptile communities and water quality were collected in the restoration area to assess the effects of the project. The results showed that, the conservation value and biodiversity index have been increased significantly due to the redistribution of the different ecological habitats. During the restoration period, this demonstration area which was dominated by intensive fish ponds (50%) and woods (25%) was reformed into a much more complicated landscape with open water (30%), multi- vegetation communities (50%) and with no fish ponds left anymore. A diverse ecological area which was characterized by vegetation succession with forest, shrub, herbaceous plants and aquatic plants was established instead of small fragmentation of patch woods before the project. The statistic analysis on the total number of species and individuals of the bird communities also showed an positive increase although not in a large part (P&gt;0.05), additionally, eleven bird species were newly recorded after the project, the Shannon-Wiener index (H′) and Pielou index (J) also showed a significant increase after the project, the total individual number and species of the targeted species- Geese and Ducks got a significant increase (6 species were newly recorded). On the part of amphibian and reptiles, totally twelve species of amphibians and reptiles were found both before and after the project, but the total number of individuals recorded after the project increased 59.1% comparing with the numbers recorded before the project. In terms of water quality, there was also a significant improvement, the levels of TN, NO-3, TP, Chl. a and CODMn significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05) in the restoration area comparing with those in the intensive fish ponds, which indicated that the general water quality in the project area had been significantly improved after the project. This study shows that after the implement of the ecological restoration project, the environment and habitat qualities in the lakeside wetlands of Dalian Lake have been improved significantly, and the pilot project would become a case study to promote a reasonable management on lakeside wetlands around Taihu Lake region located in low Yangtze River region.},

abstract={Habitat modification has the potential to cause changes in structure and composition of bird communities. Our goal was to determine the response of Songbird community composition to eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) removal in The Nature Conservancy's Niobrara Valley Preserve, Nebraska. We used point counts to survey birds in the riparian matrix of grassland and forest habitats. More than 60 species were recorded on surveys during 2004-2005. We also use the program PRESENCE to determine the response of five species to various habitat components, including cedar density: House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculates), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea). Species richness estimates were highest in open and mixed habitat patches. Local populations of Ovenbirds and Red-eyed Vireos responded positively to cedar density, whereas House Wren numbers declined as cedar density increased. Cedar abundance explained the most variation in bird community similarity between survey points; species richness increased as cedar density decreased. Habitat structure and composition drove variation in community composition and population abundance at fine, local scales within the Preserve. Fine-scale management to remove cedar from local areas should increase diversity of avian species by maintaining a matrix of habitat types. Cedar removal at any scale will affect the composition of bird communities, and we encourage a structured approach to management decisions. © 2010 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract={With limited financial resources available for habitat restoration, information that ensures and/or accelerates success is needed to economize effort and maximize benefit. In the Central Valley of California USA, riparian habitat has been lost or degraded, contributing to the decline of riparian-associated birds and other wildlife. Active restoration of riparian plant communities in this region has been demonstrated to increase local population sizes and species diversity of landbirds. To evaluate factors related to variation in the rate at which bird abundance increased after restoration, we examined bird abundance as a function of local (restoration design elements) and landscape (proportion of riparian vegetation in the landscape and riparian patch density) metrics at 17 restoration projects within five project areas along the Sacramento River. We developed a priori model sets for seven species of birds and used an information theoretic approach to identify factors associated with the rate at which bird abundance increased after restoration. For six of seven species investigated, the model with the most support contained a variable for the amount of riparian forest in the surrounding landscape. Three of seven bird species were positively correlated with the number of tree species planted and three of seven were positively correlated with the planting densities of particular tree species. Our results indicate that restoration success can be enhanced by selecting sites near existing riparian habitat and planting multiple tree species. Hence, given limited resources, efforts to restore riparian habitat for birds should focus on landscape-scale site selection in areas with high proportions of existing riparian vegetation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The inclusion of carbon stock enhancements under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) framework will likely drive a rapid increase in biosequestration projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere through rehabilitation of degraded primary rain forests. Such projects could also present an important opportunity to reverse losses of biodiversity from degraded rain forests, but concern has recently been expressed that management interventions to increase carbon stocks may conflict with biodiversity conservation. Focusing on a large-scale rain forest rehabilitation project in northern Borneo, we examine: (i) how intensive rehabilitation of selectively logged forests affected patterns of bird community composition and (ii) whether changes in vegetation structure explain observed shifts in avian guild structure and species composition. Bird composition differed between unlogged, naturally regenerating logged, and rehabilitated logged habitats, with the avifauna of rehabilitated forest more similar to that of naturally regenerating forest. Crucially, rehabilitation did not adversely affect either those species that declined after logging or those species that are IUCN Red Listed. Rehabilitation reduced the prevalence of vines and shrubs within regenerating forest, and across all habitats, the abundance and species richness of all birds and of obligate frugivores were positively related to vine prevalence. In contrast, the abundance and richness of frugivore-insectivore generalists and of salliers were negatively related to vines, suggesting that avifaunal responses to forest rehabilitation were attributable to liberation cutting of vines. Management intervention to increase carbon stocks had little adverse effect on avian biodiversity and we therefore argue that rain forest rehabilitation should play a strong role in future REDD+ agreements. © 2010 The Author(s).

abstract={Conservation areas are important for many species associated with old forests, but most individuals still occur in commercially-used forest landscapes. We conducted three-visit breeding bird surveys in a total of 37 study squares of 1 km , and used National Forest Inventory data to evaluate habitat associations of birds linked with old forests in three geographical regions: southern, eastern and northern Finland. All study squares were located within managed forests. Out of the total of 23 pre-selected old-forest species, 12 were recorded in the study squares of all three study regions; the number of species varied between 16 and 21 among the regions. The total abundance did not significantly vary among the regions, but the abundances of many single species varied significantly among the regions. Forest-patch size was the single most important factor, positively affecting the abundance of most of the species considered. Development class affected most species in the south and east, and species associated with mature and old forest stands in general. Tree height and stand age were included into the models more often than tree species and , diameter. In general, forest patch size, developmental class, age and tree height were among the most important factors in explaining the abundance of old-forest bird species in commercially-used forests. These stand characteristics appeared particularly important for resident species and cavity nesters. Our results indicate that the responses of old-forest bird species to environmental variation in managed, forested landscapes are individualistic, and different factors may affect them in different regions. Variables included in the patch-level forest-inventory data well explained abundance variation of species associated with old forests. Our results underscore the importance of integrating national forestinventory and bird-survey data to obtain information about species habitat requirements and forest-sector related information about the effects of forestry on birds.},

abstract={We evaluated habitat suitability and nest survival of breeding white-headed woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) in unburned forests of central Oregon, USA. Daily nest-survival rate was positively related to maximum daily temperature during the nest interval and to density of large-diameter trees surrounding the nest tree. We developed a niche-based habitat suitability model (partitioned Mahalanobis distance) for nesting white-headed woodpeckers using remotely sensed data. Along with low elevation, high density of large trees, and low slope, our habitat suitability model suggested that interspersion-juxtaposition of low- and high-canopy cover ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) patches was important for nest-site suitability. Cross-validation suggested the model performed adequately for management planning at a scale >1 ha. Evaluation of mapped habitat suitability index (HSI) suggested that the maximum predictive gain (HSI=0.36), where the number of nest locations are maximized in the smallest proportion of the modeled landscape, provided an objective initial threshold for identification of suitable habitat. However, managers can choose the threshold HSI most appropriate for their purposes (e.g., locating regions of low-moderate suitability that have potential for habitat restoration). Consequently, our habitat suitability model may be useful for managing dry coniferous forests for white-headed woodpeckers in central Oregon; however, model validation is necessary before our model could be applied to other locations. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Military lands are a valuable resource in recovery of threatened, endangered, and at-risk species worldwide and have the highest density of threatened and endangered species of all major land management agencies in the United States. Many red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) that reside on federal lands occur on 15 military installations in the southeastern United States. This close association has increased concern over potential conflicts between conservation requirements of endangered species and the military's mission of combat readiness. Our objectives were to 1) determine if military training operations affect behavior, reproductive success, and productivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers; 2) develop a frequency-weighting function to assess woodpecker hearing sensitivity; 3) identify factors that affect woodpecker responses to military training operations; 4) develop distance and dose-response thresholds for quantifying woodpecker responses to noise levels and stimulus distances; 5) characterize military training operations through quantification of sound levels, source identification, distance fromactive woodpecker nests, frequency spectra, duration, and frequency of occurrence; and 6) document baseline woodpecker nesting behavior. We conducted our study on the Fort Stewart Military Installation located in southeast Georgia, USA. Downy woodpeckers, as surrogates for red-cockaded woodpeckers, had their best hearing sensitivity within the peak range of the power spectrum of both downy and red-cockaded woodpecker vocalizations, which is at a higher frequency than that of a typical passerine. Overall, woodpeckers had a reduced auditory sensitivity relative to human hearing sensitivity and other species of small birds, especially in the frequency range >4 κHz.Woodpeckers were most sensitive in the 1.5- to 4.0-κHz range. Sensitivity appeared to drop off quickly at frequencies ^lt;1.0 κHz and >4.0 κHz. Overall, we did not find that the woodpecker-frequency-weighting function we developed provided a better predictor of woodpecker flush response compared with A-weighting. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between frequency-weighting functions and woodpecker response behavior. Potential breeding groups of woodpeckers across the population increased from 158 in 1997 to 181 in 2000, wheras nesting groups increased from 141 in 1998 to 170 in 2000, for overall increases of 14.6% and 20.6%, respectively, over the 3 years of this project. Fledging success rates for individual nests within the overall population remained consistent from 1998 to 2000, averaging 84.4%.Mean clutch sizes for woodpecker groups for 1998 to 2000 ranged from 2.75 to 3.01 eggs/nest, brood size ranged from 2.01 to 2.22 nestlings/nest, whereas the average number of young fledged ranged from 1.57 to 1.76 young/ occupied nest. We observed no difference in reproductive success or productivity between experimental and control-tested red-cockaded woodpecker groups. Overall, experimental test groups produced an average of 2.98 eggs/nest, 1.89 nestlings/nest, and 1.54 young/occupied nest from 1999 to 2000, compared with 2.73 eggs/nest, 1.91 nestlings/nest, and 1.57 young/occupied nest at control groups. We measured behavioral responses (nest attendance and arrivals and departures from the nest) of red-cockaded woodpeckers to military training events through direct and indirect (i.e., video surveillance) observation of 464.5 hours of woodpecker nesting behavior before and after controlled experimental events while recording and characterizing military-generated sound events using sound-recording equipment.We presented woodpeckers with actual 0.50- caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators from controlled distances to develop distance and sound thresholds.We used video surveillance to document potential behavioral responses of woodpeckers primarily during nonexperimental military training operations in areas that could not be safely monitored and to determine baseline woodpecker nesting behaviors. We recorded 2,846 nonexperimental military noise events in 157 data sessions at 50 red-cockaded woodpecker groups from 1998 to 2000. We also recorded 206 experimental tests at 58 woodpecker groups during 1999 and 2000. Life-table analyses of flush response time showed that at short ranges (15-30 m) the flush response was stronger for artillery simulator blasts than for blank fire in both the incubation and the nestling phases. In contrast, at medium distances (45-60 m) blank fire tended to produce more flush responses than artillery fire in both incubation and nestling phases. At longer distances (>60 m), blank fire and artillery produced similar flush responses in the incubation phase, whereas flush response was stronger for blank fire than for artillery in the nestling phase. In general, most animals that responded to military activity flushed within 5 seconds of the stimulus event. Woodpeckers returned to nests within an average of 4.4 minutes after being flushed by artillery simulators and 6.3 minutes after 0.50-caliber blank-fire tests. Woodpecker flush response rates increased as stimulus distance decreased and sound levels increased, regardless of stimulus type or year.Woodpeckers did not flush from nests when 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators were >152 m away and sound-exposure levels (decibels [dB]) were <68 dBW (woodpecker-based frequency-weighting curve) and <65 dBW, respectively. We found that blast treatments reduced arrival rates of adults at the nest, with the amount of reduction dependent on the type of blast stimulus and number of helpers at the nest. On the other hand, blast treatments had no detectable effects on nest attendance. The effect of blank fire on incubationphase arrivals over a 30-minute interval (about 40% reduction) was nearly twice that of artillery simulator fire (about a 20% reduction). There was no evidence supporting any effect of stimulus type on arrivals during the nestling phase. Blast stimuli during incubation reduced arrivals by 40% when no helpers were present, but the strength of this effect decreased to 28% when one helper was present, and was only 6% for nests with ≤2 helpers. Distance of the blast from the nest did not affect the response of arrival rates to blast treatments. Infrequent, short-duration military training exercises, as measured, did not appear to substantially impact red-cockaded woodpecker reproductive success and productivity on the Fort Stewart Military Installation. Our results may be applicable to other military installations where similar training activities and intensity levels occur. Additional research is needed to address possible habituation or sensitization of red-cockaded woodpeckers to human activities in proximity to active nest sites. Although we attempted to monitor woodpecker response to a number of military training activities, other types of military training operations or human-based activities with louder noise, longer duration, increased human presence, and greater frequency of occurrence could more negatively influence woodpecker nesting behavior and need to be investigated. Our results do not support the hypothesis that military maneuver training operations are limiting factors in the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers on military installations, based on our level and type of testing. Natural resource management policies on military installations have had a positive influence on the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers and probably outweigh the negative effects of typical military training. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Urbanization is a fundamental environmental change, today happening at accelerated speed worldwide. Despite the strong and permanent human impact, urban biodiversity has generally proved to be surprisingly high. Quantitative information on the effect of management actions on biodiversity is often lacking but is an indispensable basis for decisions by urban planners and managers. We therefore quantified key urban variables to predict changes in avian biodiversity when their urban habitat is modified. We analysed species richness, diversity (Simpson index) and community composition of 63 bird species with reference to major urban environmental gradients at 96 sampling points in three Swiss cities. Best explanatory models were selected from candidate models following information theory, and their respective predictions were averaged based on AICc-weights. Bird species richness and diversity are negatively affected by increasing fractions of sealed area or buildings, while increasing vegetation structures, in particular trees, show positive effects. Our models predict an increase from 13 species in the absence of trees to 20 species with 46% tree cover (+54%). Coniferous trees help to maximize bird species richness, with the models predicting an increase from 14 species at sites with only deciduous woody plants to 20 species (+43%) at places with equal representation of coniferous and deciduous plants. While the analysis of the Simpson index did not show any influence of the coniferous and broadleaf woody plants mixture, partial redundancy analysis revealed such an influence on bird community composition, highlighting the importance to consider several measures when analyzing biodiversity. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={An essential component of conservation science is repeated surveys over time to monitor species that might be responding to local factors, such as land management, or more broadly to global change. A systematic survey of the avifauna of Cape York Peninsula was conducted in the late 1990s and early 2000s providing an ideal basal dataset for measuring change in the avifauna. A subset (n>600) of these sites, primarily within savanna landscapes, was selected for re-survey in 2008 to investigate changes in bird communities on Cape York Peninsula. Changes in mean species richness varied across the study area (decreases in 59 grid cells and increases in 43) with no apparent pattern. Significant change in reporting rates was recorded in 30 species. Four sedentary and highly detectable species declined (Bar-shouldered Dove, Brown Treecreeper, Sulphur-crested Cockatoo and Pale-headed Rosella) and five increased (Peaceful Dove, Pheasant Coucal, Weebill, White-throated Honeyeater and Yellow Oriole). Habitat preference for the species that showed change remained relatively stable between the two survey periods. Some species that were recorded in very low numbers in the original survey and are considered to be threatened (Brown Treecreeper, Black-faced Woodswallow) remained in very low numbers or decreased in our survey suggesting that there has been no regional recovery of these species. Long-term monitoring can describe important patterns of species change over time, though in the case of large, highly seasonal environments like the tropical savannas, signals of change may manifest over decades rather than annually. © 2011 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.},

abstract={We compared avian communities among three timber harvesting treatments in 45-m wide even-age riparian management zones (RMZs) placed between upland clearcuts and along one side of first- or second-order streams in northern Minnesota, USA. The RMZs had three treatments: (1) unharvested, (2) intermediate residual basal area (RBA) (targeted goal 11.5m2/ha, realized 16.0m2/ha), and (3) low RBA (targeted goal 5.7m2/ha, realized 8.7m2/ha). Surveys were conducted one year pre-harvest and three consecutive years post-harvest. There was no change in species richness, diversity, or total abundance associated with harvest but there were shifts in the types of birds within the community. In particular, White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) and Chestnut-sided Warblers (Dendroica pensylvanica) increased while Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) decreased. The decline of avian species associated with mature forest in the partially harvested treatments relative to controls indicates that maintaining an unharvested RMZ adjacent to an upland harvest may aid in maintaining avian species associated mature forest in Minnesota for at least three years post-harvest. However, our observations do not reflect reproductive success, which is an area for future research. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Across the southeastern United States, changing disturbance regimes threaten the integrity of pine flatwoods, reducing their suitability as habitat for a variety of avian species, many of which are considered of conservation priority. Prescribed burning and roller chopping are management practices widely used in pine flatwoods to control shrubs and increase the growth of herbaceous vegetation. However, the impacts these treatments have on this system and its associated avian communities are largely unknown. We examined the effects of prescribed burning and roller chopping on pine flatwoods avian communities using a paired sample approach. Avian communities were compared between treated (e.g., burned) and untreated areas. We considered abundance and richness of all birds, but also groups of conservation concern, and those likely impacted by seasonal management practices (e.g., breeding and non-breeding categories, and woodland, successional-scrub, and grassland guilds). Dormant season burning resulted in decreases in avian species richness and abundance within the non-breeding, overwintering community. In situations where the maintenance or enhancement of this avian group is desired, growing season burning appears beneficial and should be used in preference to dormant season burning. Growing season burning benefited breeding avian communities, resulting in increases in species richness and abundance within this group. Dormant season roller chopping had no effect on species richness or abundance of any avian category or guild. Increases in abundance within breeding avian communities were observed following growing season roller chopping and a roller chopping/burning combination. Grazing, did not mediate the effects of prescribed burning or roller chopping on avian species richness or abundance. The use of dormant season burning is likely inappropriate in situations where conservation and management of non-breeding, overwintering species is a priority. The use of growing season roller chopping appears to provide a potential treatment alternative in situations where positive effects on breeding species are desired. Overall, maintenance of avian abundance and richness may be best achieved through the diverse application of prescribed burning and roller chopping based on season, frequency, and space. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={An important question in biodiversity studies is whether disturbances in ecosystems will cause a net loss of species or whether such losses can be compensated by replacement of other species. We use two natural disturbances, fire and grazing, to examine the response of bird and arthropod communities in grasslands of Serengeti, Tanzania. Both burning and grazing by migrant ungulates take place at the end of the rains in June-July. We documented the communities before disturbance, then 1, 4 and 20weeks after disturbance on three replicate plots and compared them with three undisturbed plots. Birds were recorded by observation, arthropods from pitfall, tray trap and sweepnet samples. We expected that as the grass biomass was reduced by either disturbance, bird communities would change with concomitant change in arthropod food abundance. Alternatively, bird communities would change not with the absolute amount of food but with the greater accessibility of food as the grass structure changed from long to short grass. Results showed first that both bird species richness and abundance increased after both types of disturbance, but burnt sites showed a greater increase than that for grazed sites. Second, there was a change in bird species composition with disturbance. The functionally equivalent athi short-toed lark (Calandrella athensis) was replaced by the red-capped lark (Calandrella cinerea). Third, the abundance of most groups of arthropods was lower on disturbed sites than those on undisturbed sites, and the reduction of arthropod numbers was greatest on burnt sites. These results imply that bird abundance did not occur through an increase in arthropod abundance but rather through a change in the grass structure making food more accessible; and the higher predation could have caused the lower arthropod abundance. In addition, some bird species replaced others thus functionally compensating for their loss. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract={We assessed the impact of forest management on woodpecker community structure sub-Himalayan dipterocarp sal (Shorea robusta) forests. We selected eight sites representing four management-based 'forest types' (natural unworked sal, old- and young managed sal, and teak plantations). At each site, bird surveys were conducted along 2-km-long transects, 20 times during breeding and non-breeding seasons. Habitat characteristics were enumerated using circular and belt plots. Species composition across forest types was compared using multi-response permutation procedures. Indicator analysis identified woodpecker species preferring particular forest types. Biomass, abundance, and mean species richness of woodpeckers were highest in natural sal, intermediate in managed sal, and lowest in teak. There were apparent differences in woodpecker densities between seasons. Densities were higher in breeding season than non-breeding season for natural sal, while the opposite was true for managed sal. Woodpecker species composition significantly differed across forest types. The four largest species, including grey-headed (Picus canus) and greater yellownape (Picus flavinucha) that were identified as indicators, predominated natural sal but were scarce in other types. At a broader level, mean species richness of woodpeckers strongly indicated mean richness of other avifauna during breeding season. Our study suggests that forest management has significantly altered the sub-Himalayan woodpecker community structure. Managed sal forests, particularly teak plantations, are largely unable to support the original woodpecker assemblage during breeding season, although they provide foraging grounds during non-breeding season. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We conducted three-visit surveys of 1-km2 plots and traditional Finnish single-visit line transects (considering only the 50 m wide main belt) to evaluate these methods in censusing of a predetermined set of 23 target species known to prefer old forests in three regions in Finland. The efficiency of the two methods was compared on the basis of the number of territories recorded per hour. An attempt was made to find indicators of the occurrence of suitable habitats for species preferring old forest in general, including the rarest ones, and so also largely indicating total diversity of forest bird fauna of the study area. The total number of pairs observed per hour and the abundance of sedentary bird species were significantly higher in the square surveys than in the main belt of the line transects. There were significant positive relationships between the densities of relatively abundant (density &gt; 1.0 pairs km-2) and less abundant target species. There emerged five common forest bird species that seemed to form a suitable set of indicators of the occurrence of habitats for birds preferring old forest in the northern boreal zone: Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major, Mistle Thrush Turdus viscivorus, Willow Tit Parus montanus, Eurasian Treecreeper Certhia familiaris, and Eurasian Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula. We concluded that sedentary species preferring old forest are good candidates for indicators to characterize some threatened aspects of forest bird diversity. © Copyright BirdLife International 2010.},

abstract={To examine the relationship between forest succession after severe logging forestry practices and the composition of avian communities, we investigated how forest bird composition and guild structure change as a function of structural properties along a successional gradient, including a climax mature forest (>400 years), a rehabilitated mixed forest (50-70 years), and a disturbed Masson pine forest (70 years) of the Dinghushan Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, China. Of a total of 51 resident species recorded, mixed forests hosted the highest numbers of individuals and species, reflecting the high species richness of both forest and non-forest species. For forest-dependent species, however, mature stands had the highest observed and estimated species richness. Of 6 habitat-use guilds identified, vertical-profile generalists and understory-birds formed the two dominant guilds, accounting for 54.0% and 38.7% of all individuals respectively. The results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) clearly showed that most forest-dependent species were associated with high proportions of native canopy cover and the mean density of dead trees and large trees, which are characteristic of old-growth mature forests (horizontal heterogeneity) at stand level. Accordingly, conservation efforts should focus on the specialized requirements of the most habitat-restricted species in the future, especially for understory insectivores (Babblers) and large-tree users in mature subtropical monsoon forests of southern China. Moreover, since regenerating mixed forests are very similar to mature forests in both vegetation structure and bird community composition, we recommend that logging cycles (>50 years) be increased to a minimum of 50 years in southern China, so that a balance between economic and ecological interest can be reestablished. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Food resources can limit populations of insectivorous birds. Previous studies have shown strong correlations between bird population densities and their invertebrate food, with declining populations being attributed to loss of prey. This might also be the case for the threatened Knysna warbler (Bradypterus sylvaticus), which in the last 20years has declined precipitously on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. The bird is abandoning natural, protected forests, retreating to narrow belts of suburban, riverine woodland with dense, tangled understoreys. The potential invertebrate food availability in natural forests and suburban woodland was assessed against what is known of the bird's preferred prey. The invertebrate food resource spectrum and abundance were determined using three sampling techniques in both natural forest and suburban woodland. Despite greater overall abundance of invertebrates in suburban woodland, the warbler's preferred prey items were equally abundant in both habitats. This suggests that reduced food supply does not explain abandonment of natural forests by the warbler. Rather, it is concluded that the availability of suitable nesting substrata, which are more abundant in suburban woodland, has driven the biotope shift. This is an unusual case of a localized and threatened bird species faring better under transformed conditions than in natural habitats. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Nests were found within a 93-ha study area and a 19-ha stand (a subset of the 93-ha study area) in 199.5 survey hours concentrated in March-July. The 19-ha stand had six nests, a density of 0.31 nests/ha or 0.63 individuals/ha, while the 93-ha study area had 20 nests yielding 0.21 nests/ha or 0.42 individuals/ha. These nest densities are higher than previously reported in the literature for comparable stands, indicating a large influx of nesting woodpeckers post-fire. High nesting densities in this study may have resulted from: (1) optimal timing of the fire for wood-boring beetle exploitation of burned trees, (2) the discrete nature of burned habitat in the study due to impacts of salvage logging, or (3) our focus on regions of the burn where high nesting densities occurred, as the entire burned area (404 ha) was not included in nest density calculations. © 2011 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={A survey of Scottish Crossbills Loxia scotica was carried out in 3,506 km2 of conifer woodland in northern Scotland during January to April 2008 to provide the first estimate of the global population size for this endemic bird. Population estimates were also made for Common Crossbills L. curvirostra and Parrot Crossbills L. pytyopsittacus within this range. Crossbills were lured to systematically selected survey points for counting, sexing and recording their calls for later call-type (species) identification from sonograms. Crossbills were located at 451 of the 852 survey points, and adequate tape-recordings made at 387 of these. The Scottish Crossbill had a disjunct distribution, occurring largely within the eastern part of the study area, but also in the northwest. Common Crossbills had a mainly westerly distribution. The population size of post-juvenile Scottish Crossbills was estimated as 13,600 (95% C.I. 8,130-22,700), which will approximate to 6,800 (4,065-11,350) pairs. Common Crossbills were more abundant within this range (27,100, 95% C.I. 14,700-38,400) and Parrot Crossbills rare (about 100). The sex ratio was not significantly different from parity for Scottish Crossbills. The modal number at survey points was two but numbers were larger in January than later in the survey. The numbers and distribution of all crossbill species are likely to vary between years, depending upon the size of the cone crops of the different conifers: all were coning in 2008. Common Crossbill and Parrot Crossbill numbers will also be affected by irruptions from continental Europe. A monitoring scheme is required to detect any population trend, and further work on their habitat requirement (e.g. conifer selection at different seasons) is needed to inform habitat management of native and planted conifer forests to ensure a secure future for this endemic bird. © Copyright BirdLife International 2010.},

abstract={Many species of birds inhabiting the eucalypt woodlands of southern Australia are declining. Although the basic causes are clearing, fragmentation and degradation of these woodlands, several ecological processes are involved. These include: difficulties in dispersing among remnants, interspecific competition, increased nest predation, and decline in key resources, including food. Many bird species declined during the recent long drought in south-eastern Australia. Research over the last decade has strongly emphasised effects at the landscape level. It is now clear that more native vegetation in the landscape leads to more bird species. There is stronger evidence that aggressive and nest-predatory birds contribute to the decline of many woodland birds. Several studies have linked the presence of individual bird species to key habitat features, such as high or low density of trees, shrubs and coarse woody debris. The main priorities for the conservation of woodland birds to reverse these declines are: (1) detailed studies on the population dynamics of a variety of declining woodland birds under different management regimes; (2) experiments that closely monitor the response of woodland birds to manipulation of competitors, predators and habitat features; and (3) broad-scale implementation of management based on science to aim to reverse the fortunes of woodland birds on regional and national scales. © Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2011.},

abstract={Approximately 90% of the original woodlands of the Mount Lofty Ranges of South Australia has been cleared, modified or fragmented, most severely in the last 60 years, and affecting the avifauna dependent on native vegetation. This study identifies which woodland-dependent species are still declining in two different habitats, Pink GumBlue Gum woodland and Stringybark woodland. We analyse the Mount Lofty Ranges Woodland Bird Long-Term Monitoring Dataset for 1999-2007, to look for changes in abundance of 59 species. We use logistic regression of prevalence on lists in a Bayesian framework, and List Length Analysis to control for variation in detectability. Compared with Reporting Rate Analysis, a more traditional approach, List Length Analysis provides tighter confidence intervals by accounting for changing detectability. Several common species were declining significantly. Increasers were generally large-bodied generalists. Many birds have already disappeared from this modified and naturally isolated woodland island, and our results suggest that more specialist insectivores are likely to follow. The Mount Lofty Ranges can be regarded as a 'canary landscape' for temperate woodlands elsewhere in Australia without immediate action their bird communities are likely to follow the trajectory of the Mount Lofty Ranges avifauna.

abstract={The area of non-cropped habitats has been decreasing in Europe largely due to land conversion into cropland and energy crops. In Hungary, special agri-environment schemes in Environmentally Sensitive Areas require the establishment of sown set-aside fields especially for endangered bird species. We tested if these set-aside fields are beneficial for plants and insects of agricultural landscapes. We compared the herbaceous flora, grasshopper (Orthoptera), bee (Apidae) and butterfly (Rhopalocera) fauna of five field types (1, 2 and 3 year-old set-aside, winter cereal fields and semi-natural grasslands). Species richness, abundance and species composition of insects were tested against field type and plant species richness. The wheat fields were the poorest habitats for all taxa. The species richness and abundance of the studied insects were usually higher in set-aside than in cereal fields with no significant difference between set-aside of different age. We found the highest number of orthopteran species and butterfly individuals in semi-natural grasslands. At community level, field type and plant species richness had a significant effect on orthopteran assemblages. Butterfly assemblages were significantly affected by field type. Bee assemblages were not significantly related to the above variables. We can conclude that set-aside fields provide important habitat patches for plants and insects, in some cases with similar value to semi-natural grasslands. Our results emphasise the importance of set-aside within the Hungarian agri-environment scheme. Establishment of set-aside management in other Central European countries will likely to be of a similar value as the Hungarian set-aside fields. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Oil and natural gas development in the Intermountain West region of North America has expanded over the last 2 decades, primarily within sagebrush dominated landscapes. Although the effects of energy development on high-profile game species such as the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have been documented, studies examining responses of non-game birds are lacking. Simultaneously, many songbirds that breed within sagebrush steppe habitats have shown range-wide population declines that are likely due to widespread habitat loss and alteration. We evaluated songbird abundance and species richness across gradients of oil and natural gas development intensity, as indexed by well density, at 3 energy fields (2 natural gas and 1 oil) in the Upper Green River Basin, Wyoming, USA during 2008-2009. While simultaneously accounting for important habitat attributes, increased well density was associated with significant decreases in Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri) and sage sparrow (Amphispiza belli) abundance, particularly in the Jonah natural gas field. Vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) were also negatively influenced by increased well density. Horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) increased with well density in the Pinedale Anticline natural gas field, and sage thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus) showed no response to energy development. Species richness was not significantly affected by well density. Results suggest that regional declines of some songbird species, especially sagebrush-obligates, may be exacerbated by increased energy development. Understanding the specific mechanisms underlying responses to energy development is an important next step and will aid land managers in the development of effective mitigation and management strategies for the maintenance of stable bird communities in sagebrush habitat. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Burned forests represent high-quality habitats for many deadwood-dependent species. Yet, post-fire conditions may vary greatly within and among burns and thereby may affect habitat suitability for these species. We studied habitat selection of nesting black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus Swainson) in recently burned spruce-dominated boreal forests. Our objectives were to (i) identify factors involved in snag selection for both nesting and foraging and (ii) examine selection of nest sites within the burned landscape. A total of 92 nests and 1612 foraging observations were used to investigate snag selection. Our results show that both pre-fire forest conditions and fire severity are important in determining the quality of burned forests for black-backed woodpeckers. This species selected large snags for both nesting (>20 cm DBH) and foraging (>15 cm DBH). Woodpeckers selected deciduous and degraded "pre-fire" snags for nesting whereas black spruce snags that had been created by fire and that were moderately burned were preferred for foraging. Nest sites were concentrated in burned mature stands and supported higher densities of large snags (e.g., >15 cm DBH). Our results suggest that burned forest patches of at least 20 ha and composed mainly of burned mature and old-growth forests should be maintained during post-fire harvesting. The decrease in the amount of late seral stands in managed forest landscapes raises concerns about the future availability of high-quality burned forests for this species.},

abstract={Cavity-nesting birds are dependent on large declining and dead trees that are frequently removed during partial harvesting. We compared breeding densities, nest survival, nest site characteristics, food abundance, and reproductive parameters of six species of cavity-nesting birds in partially harvested and reference woodlots in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Silvicultural practices significantly altered woodlot structure, with treatment-specific effects on bark arthropod biomass, fledging dates for the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus (Linnaeus, 1758)), and site suitability for the Yellowbellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius (Linnaeus, 1766)). Red-bellied Woodpecker, Downy Woodpecker (Picoides pubescens (Linnaeus, 1766)), and Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides villosus (Linnaeus, 1766)) experienced lower breeding densities in recently cut sites. Daily survival rates were generally greater for nests positioned higher up in large trees and for Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus (Linnaeus, 1758)) nests excavated in healthy and hard wood. Conversely, the Black-capped Chickadee (Poecile atricapillus (Linnaeus, 1766)) had higher daily survival rates in low, small trees (<10 cm diameter at breast height) and sites with lower arthropod abundance. We conclude that although partial harvesting has the potential to decrease cavity-nesting bird breeding densities, conscientious cavity tree retention during harvest may provide suitable nesting sites that maintain high rates of nest success, regardless of the silvicultural treatments that we examined. However, further research is required to monitor these trends beyond a single harvesting rotation.},

abstract={Results of a long-term study (10 years) on the population dynamics of the Rock Bunting Emberiza cia L. in a steep vineyard terrace habitat at the Middle Rhine, Germany (Schuphan 1972) were compared with results from studies (8 years) in steep spruce clearance habitats of the east hillside of the Palatine Forest (Pfálzerwald, Germany; Groh 1988) and natural steep rock steppes in the Wallis (Rhone area, Switzerland; Keusch 1991). The aim was to detect habitat differences and habitat dependent influence on population dynamic parameters of these geographically separated Rock Bunting populations. At the Rhine 618 mainly colour ringed Rock Buntings contributed to the results, in the Palatine Forest 157 and at the Rhone 993 Rock Buntings. Large differences between the habitats (vineyards, forest clearances, rock steppes) were obvious as well between the sizes of the territories. These were given at the Rhine and the Palatine Forest by topographical natural borders, in contrast to the Wallis where borders were much more flexible. The differences in size were predetermined in the case of the Palatine Forest by the sizes of the clearances, in the case of the Wallis territories obviously by limitation of initial lepidopteran food supply in spring. The small territories at the Rhine were directly affiliated with high food availability which caused a higher population density. Especially the age structure of the populations showed up considerable differences between Rhine and Wallis, for the Palatine forest no data were present. The optimal food supply, together with year round mild weather conditions affected positively the population at the Rhine. Following the first year 69 % of the ♂ (♀ 49 %) and than in the second year 42 % (♀ 23 %) of the primarily existing territory residents (100%) returned. Return quotes in the Wallis were 39% for the ♂ (♀ 27%) and in the next following year for the ♂ 16.7%. From the demographic distribution pattern resulted for the Rhine population over 10 years a mean age for the ♂ of 2.6 years (n = 103) and for the ♀ of 2.0 years (n = 101 ); in the Wallis the mean age was determined for 3 breeding periods each for the first period 1.3 years for the ♂ (n= 16), second and third period each 1.7 years (n = 9 and n = 13). About one third of the breeding birds remained at the Rhine during winter in their mild breeding habitat. The rough Palatine hillsides were vacated completely. In the Wallis all breeding birds left the breeding territories. Five abroad recoveries of Rock Buntings from the Middle Rhine (autumn-winter) point all in the direction SW; leading lines could be the NaheMoselle valleys. The most faraway recovery was realized near Biarritz (1020 km, West-France). The extinction of the Palatine population after 1990 could obviously be attributed to reforestation and the restrictions for new forest clearances. Rock Buntings in populations adapted to mountain areas like in the Wallis, Black Forest and Palatine Forest, did not colonize their neighbor steep vineyard habitats e.g. in the Alsace and the Palatine Weinstrasse, even these habitats show the typical properties of the Rock Bunting habitats like at the Middle Rhine, Nahe, Moselle, and Ahr. These different preferences of habitat structures must be considered when a well directed advancement of the Rock Bunting in management plans is intended. © DO-G, IfV, MPG 2011.},

abstract={We explore bird communities in different types of small urban greenspaces (<2. ha) in order to understand which birds occupy these structures, and the habitat and landscape features that affect them. In particular we analyzed how greenspace characteristics (size and vegetation structure), those of the adjacent landscape (area covered by urban structures and vegetation), and human disturbance variables (traffic of pedestrians, vehicles and noise levels) affected bird species richness, abundance and community composition (during summer and winter) in the city of Pachuca, Mexico. We selected 19 small greenspaces (ranging from 0.1 to 2. ha), including public parks, gardens and road strip corridors. We registered 39 species of birds of which 15 were migratory. In general bird species richness was higher in parks and gardens, and lower in road strip corridors, where more noise and traffic was registered. Greenspace area was the most important variable that positively influenced bird species richness, for both the summer and the winter communities. Summer bird species richness was lower in places that had a greater percentage of area covered by buildings in the adjacent landscape. Generalist and opportunistic species were favored by urbanization. Insectivorous species in winter were more abundant in larger greenspaces that had taller trees and more tree and shrub species, and in sites with more vegetative cover in the adjacent landscape. We suggest some management and urban planning actions that would benefit birds within many Latin American cities, where small greenspaces are often the only available refuges for birds. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Populations of several species of native parrots have been increasing in many Australian cities since the 1980s contributing to a shift in the composition of urban avian communities. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some species of parrot may move into the urban landscape during environmental disturbances, such as wild fires or periods of decreased rainfall. This study seeks to determine the extent to which fire and rainfall explain changes in the abundance of parrots in urban Sydney. Multiple regression using the Akaike Information Criterion was used to analyse a 26-year data set, beginning in 1981, to measure the change in abundance of 13 species of parrot in response to wild fire and rainfall. Wild fire, within a radial distance of 100. km, significantly predicted changes in abundance of five species of parrot in urban Sydney. Local and/or inland rainfall significantly predicted changes in abundance of six parrot species in the urban landscape, with decreases in inland rainfall resulting in an increase in abundance in the urban landscape of parrots that traditionally inhabited inland areas. © 2011.},

abstract={1. Extensive clearing of native vegetation for agriculture has severely impacted upon Australia's biodiversity. Environmental tree planting, forestry and restoration of existing remnant patches provide ways for improving the matrix habitat value between larger conservation areas. However, improved guidelines are required to inform land managers on appropriate ways to design these areas when resources for habitat improvement are limited. 2. We developed a simple habitat suitability model for woodland birds from two basic observations of ecology: (i) the species-area relationship and (ii) the relationship between bird species richness and vegetation structural diversity. The model provides a suite of species-area relationships for habitats of different structural diversity. Data from across Australia were used in developing the model to ensure its generality. 3. A single species-area relationship for patches from 2ha to 16million ha was estimated for high-quality habitat patches using data from across mainland Australia. When this was combined with information on habitat complexity, the resultant species richness model was able to adequately describe the variation in woodland bird species richness within patches of various sizes (1-500ha) in an independent data set from the Australian Capital Territory. 4. The results from the model suggest that for small patches of high quality, increases in patch size or quality reap benefits whereas the marginal return in species richness for increasing patch size is almost negligible for low quality patches above 10ha or high quality patches of 20ha. For small patches of low quality, there is little benefit in increasing patch area and so quality should be improved. These results agree with recommendations obtained using various other techniques. 5. Synthesis and applications. Investigation of the relationships embedded in the model provided similar recommendations for habitat restoration as determined by more detailed methods. The success of a simple combination of ecological principles linking area, structure and species richness supports the notion that existing basic theory can provide a sufficient basis for informing habitat restoration. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Restoration and management activities targeted at recovering biodiversity can lead to unexpected results. In part, this is due to a lack of understanding of how site-level characteristics, landscape factors, and land-use history interact with restoration and management practices to determine patterns of diversity. For plants, such factors may be particularly important since plant populations often exhibit lagged responses to habitat loss and degradation. Here, we assess the importance of site-level, landscape, and historical effects for understory plant species richness and composition across a set of 40 longleaf pine Pinus palustris woodlands undergoing restoration for the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker in the southeastern United States. Land-use history had an overarching effect on richness and composition. Relative to historically forested sites, sites with agricultural histories (i.e. former pastures or cultivated fields) supported lower species richness and an altered species composition due to fewer upland longleaf pine woodland community members. Landscape effects did not influence the total number of species in either historically forested or post-agricultural sites; however, understory species composition was affected by historical connectivity, but only for post-agricultural sites. The influences of management and restoration activities were only apparent once land-use history was accounted for. Prescribed burning and mechanical overstory thinning were key drivers of understory composition and promoted understory richness in post-agricultural sites. In historically forested sites these activities had no impact on richness and only prescribed fire influenced composition. Our findings reveal complex interplays between site-level, landscape, and historical effects, suggest fundamentally different controls over plant communities in longleaf pine woodlands with varying land-use history, and underscore the importance of considering land-use history and landscape effects during restoration. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={There is widespread concern for many understorey and ground-dwelling bird species in the Philippines that appear intolerant of forest alteration. We present density estimates for 18 key bird species in old growth forest, advanced and early secondary growth and active cultivation within the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in Palawan. Six species were not recorded in cultivation and the abundance of these and several others increased along the successional gradient from cultivation to old growth forest. Eleven species, including five endemics and three of four threatened species, had highest density estimates in old growth forest. However, several species had high density estimates in the heavily disturbed habitats and every habitat type held highest densities of at least one of the bird species. The commonest habitat association across the bird community was a preference for areas containing large trees, indicating the importance of retention of such trees in allowing suitable ground and understorey microhabitats to persist. Old growth forests have the highest conservation value for Palawan-s endemic birds and, while some species thrive in the anthropogenic habitats that occur within the Park, the present extent of cultivation and associated successional stages within its boundaries should not be increased. We caution against extrapolation of the abundance figures from the Park to the whole island but we suggest that population sizes for the threatened species are likely to be much greater than previously thought. We urge authorities to strengthen management within the protected area network in Palawan to ensure survival of key species. © 2011 Fauna & Flora International.},

abstract={Mediterranean forests are highly resilient to fires, showing a rapid recovery after disturbance. However, in some cases direct tree regeneration fails leading to radical changes in landscape composition. In this study, we evaluated the impact of landscape changes on the conservation value of bird species using the new landscape mosaic arising from non-direct regeneration after a fire. We used data from a large fire that occurred in central Catalonia (NE Spain) in 1998. The fire affected about 26,000 ha of a land mosaic mainly covered by Black Pine Pinus nigra forests and farmland dominated by cereal crops. We used line transects to estimate bird abundance and gathered information on dominant vegetation covers and landscape variables. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and generalized linear models were used to explore how the measured environmental variables explain bird species abundance and to analyze how post-fire heterogeneity in vegetation affected the conservation value of the bird community. Factors describing the main patterns in the post-fire landscape explained up to 31.2% of the total variability in bird community composition and described three main groups of bird species sharing similar ecological requirements. Additionally, 71% of the studied species significantly responded to one of the first three vegetation gradients distinguished in the study area. Finally, the conservation value of the bird community significantly decreased in areas dominated by Q. humilis resprouters and significantly increased in shrubland areas. Overall, our results suggest that large fires affecting non-direct regenerating forest types lead to a new and radically different mosaic landscape offering new opportunities to species with unfavourable European conservation status.},

abstract={Extensive conversion of Midwestern riparian areas for agricultural production has had many consequences including reduced habitat for nesting birds. However, more than 120,000 Aha of riparian habitat have been restored in this region through USDA conservation programs. In 2001 and 2002, we assessed songbird responses to burning and disking for management of conservation easements in east-central Iowa. We randomly assigned herbaceous riparian fields to burning and disking treatments and collected data on density and species richness of songbirds in these habitats. Total density of grassland and wetland species and red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were reduced by burning in the first and second breeding seasons after burning; common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) density decreased with burning only in the first season. Disking led to increased density of grassland and wetland birds and greater overall avian conservation value on treated relative to untreated fields in the year after treatment. Changes associated with burning and disking treatments were likely related to changes in both vegetation structure and abundance of arthropod food resources. Despite decreased bird densities with burning, fire is a necessary management tool to control woody vegetation. Overall, both burning and disking appear to be effective management practices for maintaining herbaceous riparian habitats for grassland birds. © 2011 American Midland Naturalist.},

abstract={In this study, I examined the composition of managed ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests used by nesting White-headed Woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) along the eastern slope of the Cascade Range in Washington. I sampled trees and snags using the point-centered quarter method to assess species composition, tree and snag density, and stand basal area in 16 forest stands containing White-headed Woodpecker nests. All stands had a history of timber management and 2 had been burned and salvage-logged. Mean live-tree density (≥ 10.16 cm dbh) was 182.3 trees · ha-1 (SE = 13.52), mean snag density (≥ 10.16 cm dbh) was 11.5 snags · ha -1 (SE = 1.92), and mean stand basal area was 17.2 m2 · ha-1 (SE = 1.58). Ponderosa pine had the highest importance value ( = 220.9, SE = 17.25) of any tree species in all but 2 stands. Mean dbh of ponderosa pines was 33.0 cm (SE = 0.26) and ranged from 26.1 to 50.2 cm within stands. Mean density of ponderosa pine was greatest in the 20.3-30.5 cm dbh size class and lowest in the 50.8-61.0 cm and &gt;61.0 cm dbh size classes. Tree density was up to 5.3 times greater than densities believed to be typical of ponderosa pine forests prior to fire suppression. Snag densities were within the range estimated for historical dry forests of the eastern Cascades, yet only 50% of all snags sampled had a dbh &gt;25.4 cm. Although White-headed Woodpeckers are considered strongly associated with old-growth ponderosa pine, my results suggest that they may be more adaptable to using forests dominated by smaller diameter trees. © 2011.},

abstract={Noise may drive changes in the composition and abundance of animals that communicate vocally. Traffic produces low-frequency noise (<3 kHz) that can mask acoustic signals broadcast within the same frequency range. We evaluated whether birds that sing within the frequency range of traffic noise are affected by acoustic masking (i.e., increased background noise levels at the same frequency of vocalizations reduce detection of vocalization) and are less abundant in areas where traffic noise is loud (44-57 dB). We estimated occupancy, the expected probability that a given site is occupied by a species, and detection probabilities of eight forest-breeding birds in areas with and without traffic noise as a function of noise and three measures of habitat quality: percent forest cover, distance from plot center to the edge of forest, and the number of standing dead trees or snags. For the two species that vocalize at the lowest peak frequency (the frequency with the most energy) and the lowest overall frequency (Yellow-billed Cuckoo [Coccyzus americanus] and White-breasted Nuthatch [Sitta carolinensis]), the presence of traffic noise explained the greatest proportion of variance in occupancy, and these species were 10 times less likely to be found in noisy than in quiet plots. For species that had only portions of their vocalizations overlapped by traffic noise, either forest cover or distance to forest edge explained more variation in occupancy than noise or no single variable explained occupancy. Our results suggest that the effects of traffic noise may be especially pronounced for species that vocalize at low frequencies. ©2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={The grasslands of central North America have experienced drastic reductions in extent, removal of historic disturbance patterns, and homogenization of remaining fragments. This has resulted in steep declines for a broad swath of grassland biodiversity. Recent work in relatively extensive grasslands has demonstrated that mimicking historic disturbance patterns using a fire-grazing interaction can increase the abundance and diversity of grassland birds through increased habitat heterogeneity. We examined the efficacy of this management strategy for promoting avian diversity in highly fragmented landscapes, which represent the bulk of remaining grassland bird habitats in the tallgrass prairie region. We quantified the population density of obligate and facultative grassland bird species along transects in 13 experimental research pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of Iowa and Missouri (USA), divided among three treatments: 1) spatially discrete fires and free access by cattle ("patch-burn grazed"), 2) free access by cattle and a single complete burn ("grazed-and-burned"), and 3) a single complete burn with no cattle ("burnedonly"). We expected that patch-burn grazing would produce a bird community that overlapped that of the grazed-and-burned and burned-only treatments, because it would provide habitat for species associated with both. However, an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that community structure on pastures managed using patch-burn grazing instead diverged significantly from both of the other treatments. Differences in community structure were most highly correlated with visual obstruction and wooded edge density in the landscape, suggesting bird communities are differentiated not only by their structural habitat requirements, but also by the varying degrees of sensitivity to landscape fragmentation of their component species. The future success of this management scheme for fragmented grasslands hinges on if, after an optimal stocking rate is identified, adequate habitat can be maintained for a diverse bird community, or whether fragmentation will perpetually limit the efficacy of this method in these landscapes. © 2011 Pillsbury et al.},

abstract={Revegetation plantings have been established throughout the world to mitigate the effects of clearing, including loss of faunal habitat. Revegetation plantings can differ substantially in structural complexity and plant diversity, with potentially differing habitat qualities for fauna. We studied bird occurrence in revegetation of different complexity and floristics in southern Australia. We assessed bird species richness and composition in remnant forest and cleared agricultural land as reference points, and in two types of plantings differing in structure and floristics-(1) "woodlot plantings" composed of native trees only and (2) "ecological plantings" composed of many species of local trees, shrubs and understorey. By approximately 20 years of age, both types of plantings had a similar bird species richness to that in remnants. Bird species richness was greater in ecological plantings than woodlot plantings. Species composition also differed. Ecological plantings contained a shrub-associated bird assemblage, whereas woodlot plantings were dominated by generalist bird species. Remnants contained a unique bird assemblage, which were not found in either of the two types of plantings, suggesting that plantings are not a viable replacement of remnant vegetation over this time period. Bird species richness responded positively to structural complexity, but not to floristic richness. Bird species richness was greater in plantings that were older, in riparian locations, and where weed cover was lower. We conclude that plantings in general can provide habitat for many species of birds, and that structurally complex ecological plantings in particular will provide unique and valuable additional habitat for birds. © 2010 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract={Forest management practices and forest fragmentation are commonly recognised as factors influencing species distribution and diversity, but it remains largely unknown how species turnover and fluctuations across years might affect generalisations from short-term predictions. There is also much uncertainty about how compositional heterogeneity within forests, through their partitioning into differently managed stands, influences species occurrence and diversity. We aimed to investigate bird species richness in different forest stands in a heterogeneous landscape and asked whether short-term studies commonly used are sufficient to describe diversity-habitat relationships. Breeding birds were monitored in 50 stands of differing forest types and management regimes in 2008 and 2009 in the heterogeneous forest production landscape of the Schwäbische Alb in SW Germany. Based on a database of 25 and 21 species observed in 2008 and 2009, respectively, we estimated local species richness and species turnover with Bayesian hierarchical multi-species occupancy models to account for imperfect detection. A suite of forest attributes at stand level (from local field inventories) and landscape level, between 100 and 2000. m in extent, which were derived from forest management maps, were screened for their explanatory power regarding bird species richness. The most meaningful variables were included in a final set of models to account for effects of forest attributes on species occurrence and resulting gradients in species richness and turnover. Bird species richness in 2008 was mostly explained by stand composition heterogeneity over a distance of 800. m around sample locations, whereas in 2009 local stand features like stand succession type and stand age mostly explained species richness. Species turnover was significantly higher in young forest stands of thicket and pole-wood stages compared with old forest stands of timber stages. Variable multi-scale impacts of forest attributes on local species richness and turnover, together with year-to-year fluctuations in the regional species pool, emphasise that the relative importance of local versus landscape-scale factors in determining bird species richness may vary across years. Long-term and multiple-scale investigations that take structural and compositional forest heterogeneity into account are necessary for improved prediction of species-habitat relationships. Die Vielfalt und Verbreitung von Arten in Wäldern sind oft in Zusammenhang von unterschiedlichen Bewirtschaftungsmaßnahmen und Fragmentierung von Forstbeständen untersucht worden, wobei weitgehend offen ist, inwieweit Fluktuationen in Populationen über mehrere Jahre Rückschlüsse von Kurzzeitstudien beeinflussen. Weiterhin wurde die landschaftsbezogene Heterogenität von Waldarealen, die oft in unterschiedlich bewirtschaftete Bestände parzelliert sind, bisher wenig in Arten-Habitat-Beziehungen berücksichtigt. Wir untersuchten die Artenvielfalt von Singvögeln in unterschiedlichen Forstbeständen in einer heterogenen Kulturlandschaft mit besonderem Fokus auf der Frage, inwieweit Rückschlüsse auf Arten-Habitat-Beziehungen aus Kurzeitstudien generalisierbar sind. Brutvögel wurden in 50 Forstbeständen mit unterschiedlichen Bestandstypen und Bewirtschaftungsweisen innerhalb der kleinräumigen Kulturlandschaft der Schwäbischen Alb in SW Deutschland in 2008 und 2009 erfasst. Basierend auf einen Datenbestand von 25 versus 21 beobachteten Arten in 2008 und 2009, wurde die Artenvielfalt und Fluktuationen mit einem Bayesischen hierarchischen Gemeinschaftsmodell unter Berücksichtigung der Unvollständigkeit von Feldbeobachtungen geschätzt. Mehrere Umweltparameter auf lokaler Bestandsebene (basierend auf Feldkartierungen) sowie auf Landschaftsebene mit Radien zwischen 100 und 2000. m um Beobachtungspunkte (basierend auf digitalen Forsteinrichtungsdaten) wurden bezüglich deren korrelativen Zusammenhang mit der Artenvielfalt getestet. Die aussagekräftigsten Variablen wurden dann in einem weiteren Modellierungsschritt auf deren relativen Einfluss auf Artenvielfalt und Fluktuationen untersucht. Die Artenvielfalt in 2008 korrelierte am stärksten mit der Komposition unterschiedlicher Forstbestände in der Umgebung bis 800. m um die Beobachtungspunkte, während die Artenvielfalt in 2009 deutlich stärker mit Variablen auf lokaler Bestandsebene wie Sukzessionsstadium bzw. Bestandsalter korrelierte. Die Fluktuationen im Vorkommen von Arten waren signifikant höher in jungen Beständen wie Dickung und Stangenholz als in älteren Baumholzbeständen. Der variierende Einfluss von Variablen unterschiedlicher räumlicher Skalenebene auf lokale Artenvielfalt und Fluktuationen im Vorkommen von Arten sowie die Variabilität im regionalen Artenpool von Singvögeln über Jahre unterstreichen, dass der relative Einfluss von lokalen und landschaftsbezogenen Umweltparametern auf Artenvielfalt über Jahre variieren kann. Langzeitstudien, die Umweltparameter auf unterschiedlichen Skalenebenen und auch Parameter wie strukturelle und kompositionelle Heterogenität bewirtschafteter Wälder berücksichtigen, sind daher notwendig, um den Zusammenhang zwischen Artenvielfalt und der zugrundeliegenden Umwelt vorherzusagen. © 2011 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.},

abstract={Early-successional forest ecosystems that develop after stand-replacing or partial disturbances are diverse in species, processes, and structure. Post-disturbance ecosystems are also often rich in biological legacies, including surviving organisms and organically derived structures, such as woody debris. These legacies and postdisturbance plant communities provide resources that attract and sustain high species diversity, including numerous early-successional obligates, such as certain woodpeckers and arthropods. Early succession is the only period when tree canopies do not dominate the forest site, and so this stage can be characterized by high productivity of plant species (including herbs and shrubs), complex food webs, large nutrient fluxes, and high structural and spatial complexity. Different disturbances contrast markedly in terms of biological legacies, and this will influence the resultant physical and biological conditions, thus affecting successional pathways. Management activities, such as post-disturbance logging and dense tree planting, can reduce the richness within and the duration of early-successional ecosystems. Where maintenance of biodiversity is an objective, the importance and value of these natural early-successional ecosystems are underappreciated. © The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Landscape heterogeneity can play an important role in providing refugia and sustaining biodiversity in disturbed landscapes. Large Macrotermes (Isoptera) termite mounds in miombo woodlands form nutrient rich islands that sustain a different suite of woody plant species relative to the woodland matrix. We investigated the role of termitaria in providing habitat for cavity-using birds in miombo woodlands that had been greatly impacted by elephants and fire, by comparing the availability of habitat favored by cavity-using birds (tall trees, trees with deadwood, and cavities) on and off mounds, and then testing its effect on species richness and abundance of cavity-using birds. We surveyed 48 termitaria paired with 48 woodland matrix sites in the breeding season; and 54 matrix-termitarium pairs in the non-breeding season in Chizarira National Park, Zimbabwe. Generalized linear mixed-effects models showed that termitaria harboured significantly higher densities (ha-1) of habitat components considered important for cavity nesting birds. Density of trees &gt;6 m in height and incidence of trees with deadwood was nearly 10 times greater on mounds than in the matrix, and the density of cavities was nine times higher on mounds compared to the matrix. A model selection procedure showed that termitaria provided refugia for cavity-using birds and contributed to the resilience of bird communities through high on-mound densities of trees with deadwood. Large termitaria thus appear to play an important role in maintaining functionally important components of the avifauna in heavily impacted Miombo woodlands. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Active and passive restoration are two important strategies to aid the recovery of large areas of deforested and degraded tropical lands. Active restoration is where management techniques such as planting seeds or seedlings are implemented, and passive restoration is when no action is taken except to cease environmental stressors such as agriculture or grazing. We compared the habitat quality of active and passive restoration sites with similar land-use histories and times since abandonment for insectivorous birds by measuring vegetation structure, arthropod biomass, and the foraging behavior of three resident bird species in southern Costa Rica. Although vegetation measures such as amount of understory cover and tree species richness and density differed between the two restoration strategies, arthropod biomass and foraging behavioral measures were similar. Our results suggest that while active and passive restoration strategies may lead to different vegetation structures, they may support similar biomass of foliage-dwelling arthropods and be similarly used by foraging insectivorous birds. Passive restoration is generally less costlier than active restoration and, if local and landscape characteristics do not impede recovery, may be a viable alternative from the perspective of birds using the sites. © 2010 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract={Coastal development and engineering projects preclude ecosystem processes that provide habitat for beach nesting birds. Management for coastal species may depend on actions that attempt to restore important habitat features and mitigate disturbance effects. However, species response to restoration or other management actions may be difficult to predict or measure. At Jones Beach State Park, on Long Island, New York, a 0.49 ha restoration project provided moist substrate foraging habitat for breeding Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) from 2002 to 2005. We examined whether foraging habitat restoration affected Piping Plover breeding population size, productivity, and fledgling production within 300 m of the restoration site. We found a positive relationship between habitat restoration and the number of fledglings produced per year. However, foraging habitat restoration did not significantly increase the number of Plover pairs breeding at Jones Beach. Our ability to evaluate restoration effects on Plovers depended on: 1) use of multiple performance criteria; 2) a design that allowed comparison of pre- and post-restoration data; and 3) a spatial control that allowed comparison of similar areas that were near and far from the restoration site. Despite the small size of the restoration project, there were measurable benefits to Plovers, indicating that foraging habitat restoration may be an effective tool for species recovery. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Species richness was lowest in salvage-logged stands, largely due to a negative effect of harvesting on the occurrence of wood- and bark-boring species. In comparison with undisturbed stands, the combination of wildfire and logging in salvage-logged stands had a greater effect on species composition than either disturbance alone. Strong differences in species composition among stand treatments were linked to differences in quantity and quality (e.g., decay stage) of coarse woody debris. We found that the effects of wildfire and logging on deadwood-associated beetles were synergistic, such that the effects of postfire salvage logging could not be predicted reliably on the basis of data on either disturbance alone. Thus, increases in salvage logging of burned forests may have serious negative consequences for deadwood-associated beetles and their ecological functions in early postfire successional forests. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Landscape restoration through revegetation is being increasingly used in the conservation management of degraded landscapes. To effectively plan restoration programs information is required on how the landscape context of revegetation influences biodiversity gains. Here, we investigate the relative influence of patch area and connectivity on bird species richness and abundance within urban revegetation patches in Brisbane, Australia. We carried out bird surveys at 20 revegetation sites, and used hierarchical partitioning and model selection to test the relative importance of patch area (the area of revegetation including all directly connected remnant vegetation) and landscape connectivity (the vegetated area connected by less than 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m cleared gaps). We controlled for a number of possible confounding variables within the hierarchical partitioning procedure. Both the hierarchical partitioning and model selection procedures indicated that connectivity had an important influence on bird species richness. Patch area in combination with connectivity were important influencing factors on overall bird abundance. We also carried out the hierarchical partitioning procedure for bird abundance data within a range of feeding guilds, yielding results specific to species groups. Overall our data suggest that greater connectivity enhances the habitat area that colonists can arrive from (resulting in greater species richness), whereas increased patch area allows for increased abundance by expanding the habitat available to species already present in a patch. A combined approach where connectivity and overall habitat area is enhanced across the landscape is likely to be necessary to meet long-term conservation objectives. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The effects that changes in forest structure and composition have on wildlife have often been considered independently, such that the potential for interactive effects has received relatively little attention. We investigated the importance of vegetation structure, floristic composition, and their interaction for predicting bird distribution in mixed broadleaf-conifer forest. We collected vegetation and bird data at 979 stations in a watershed in southern Oregon in the spring of 2001. At each station, we described the vegetation using measures of structure (total vegetation volume) and of floristic composition (broadleaf-conifer composition). We then used logistic regression to model the probability of occurrence of bird species as a function of these 2 variables, their quadratic terms, and their interaction. Using stepwise model selection we identified the best model for each species and used area under the curve (AUC) scores to evaluate model performance. Of the 44 bird species we investigated, 20 had models with AUC scores ≥0.70. Of the best models for these 20 species, 1 included vegetation composition alone, 12 included just the main effects of vegetation composition and structure, and 7 included both the main effects and interaction terms. In summer of 2001 a wildfire burned 2,500 ha of the study area, resulting in substantial changes in the vegetation structure and composition. We used 4 yr of postfire bird and vegetation surveys to test the predictive performance of the habitat models for 9 species that occurred at >15% of the burned stations.Models for 3 of these species performed poorly (AUC < 0.7) in all 4 yr. For the other 6 species, predictive performance was low in the first year after fire and improved during subsequent years, suggesting a lagged response to changes in vegetation structure and composition. Quantifying the interactive effects of vegetation structure and composition improves our understanding of how birds respond to forest management and large-scale disturbances, such as wildfires. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={In the five-year period from 2001 to 2006, 48 monitoring grids comprising the FORESTCHECK initiative were established in open eucalypt (jarrah, Eucalyptus marginata) forest in south-west Western Australia. Since 1985, revised silvicultural objectives have necessitated detailed monitoring of responses by bird species and assemblages to silvicultural treatments (timber harvesting and associated burning). Few marked changes in the avifauna were detected. Species accumulated (in terms of numbers of grids) at similar rates in gap release, shelterwood/selective cut, and reference (either never harvested or harvested more than 40 years previously) forests. In terms of individuals, species accumulated faster in the gap release forests. The number of species represented as singletons was greatest on the never harvested (8), coupe buffer (7) and gap release (6) grids. Dominance-diversity curves also showed only minor differences between silvicultural treatments. Neither nMDS nor CAP ordinations showed any clear separation between the treatments. There was little evidence of any substantial effect of silvicultural treatments on avian community structure or on individual bird species. Community structure was, however, significantly associated with forest ecosystem/year of sampling. The basal area of live trees was not correlated with bird species richness or abundance on each grid. These results are consistent with previous studies, which indicate that most bird species in jarrah forest have a high threshold level of tolerance to disturbance. It is likely that the rapid regeneration of dominant tree species after harvesting and associated fire, the patchiness of treatments at the landscape scale, the high degree of connectivity of harvested and burnt forests with forests not recently harvested or burnt, and the retention of habitat trees in the most heavily—harvested (gap release) forests all conduce to dampen local-scale impacts and conserve the avifauna in relation to the home range and normal movements of its constituent bird species. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Although niche theory predicts that disturbance should favour generalist species, the community-level implications of this pattern have been sparsely analysed. Here, we test the hypothesis that disturbance favours generalist species within communities, analysing effects of wildfires in bird communities in a Mediterranean climate area as a case study. We use bird occurrence data in more than 500 1 × 1 km squares forming a gradient running from forest to completely burnt areas. The level of specialization of bird communities was estimated by means of three complementary species specialization indices, calculated for different landscape gradients and averaged at the community level (i.e. 1 × 1 km squares), and mean species rarity. We also calculated mean habitat preferences along landscape gradients, as well as an index of conservation value and total species richness. Different estimators of bird community specialization varied in contrasting fashion along the wildfire disturbance gradient, and thus we conclude that it is not justified to expect unique community responses to the sharp variations in habitat characteristics brought by wildfire disturbances. Burnt areas tended to have rarer and urban avoider bird species, whereas unburnt forests tended to have larger proportions of forest specialist species. The mean conservation value of communities clearly increased towards the burnt extreme of the wildfire disturbance gradient, while this had a negligible effect on species richness. Wildfires seem to play an important role for the maintenance of open-habitat, urban-avoider bird populations in Mediterranean landscapes and also to benefit a set of bird species of unfavourable European conservation status. In this context, it cannot be unambiguously concluded that fire disturbance, even in a context in which fires are greatly favoured by human-related activities, leads to more functionally simplified communities dominated by generalist species. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={This study aimed to analyze the floristic composition and the structure of a savanna on rocky soil ("cerrado rupestre") woody vegetation (including monocots and lianas) in the Cerrado-Amazon Forest transition zone located at Parque Municipal do Bacaba, Nova Xavantina, State of Mato Grosso (14&lt; o&lt; 41' S and 52&lt; o&lt; 20' W), and compare it with other cerrado stricto sensu studies. Ten 20 × 50 m plots were randomly established, within which all live and dead woody plants with at least 3 cm of trunk diameter at 30 cm above ground level (DSH30 ≥ 3 cm) were measured. The cerrado rupestre showed high density (3,766 live individuals), richness (85 species, 67 genera and 34 families) and basal area (15.72 m2ha-1), as well as high levels of Shannon-Wiener species diversity (H' = 3.47) and evenness (J = 0.78) indices. The most important species were Erythroxylum suberosum, Qualea parviflora, Anacardiumoccidentale, Kielmeyera rubriflora and Vatairea macrocarpa. The greatest floristic similarity found between typical cerrado and "cerrado rupestre" communities from lower altitude areas of Northeastern Mato Grosso suggest that, in this region, altitude and geographical distance influence the species composition, regardless of the substrate. The community presented unimodality in the heights distribution and is mostly compounded by shrubby individuals with height &lt; 3 m and DSH &lt; 5 cm. We suggest that floristic and phytosociological studies conducted in "cerrado rupestre" should adopt DSH ≥ 3 cm and include monocot and liana species, so as to more realistically represent the vegetation richness, species composition and structure. The high species richness and diversity registered in this study might be related to this "cerrado rupestre" pre-Amazonian location, which emphasizes the importance of "Parque do Bacaba" maintenance as a guarantee of its biological diversity protection.},

abstract={Due to fire suppression and land use changes, Missouri glade habitats have undergone long-term declines in area and function leading to consequent declines in many bird species that rely on these habitats. We examined breeding bird species composition and vegetation community composition on three glade sites undergoing restoration with prescribed fire and compared them to three unburned glade sites and three unburned forest sites. Although we documented subtle changes in vegetation characteristics in response to prescribed fire, important structural characteristics, such as canopy cover (>55 at all study sites) and grass cover (<10 at all study sites) remain outside ranges used to characterize glades. Despite this, bird community structure shifted towards grass-shrubland (glade) birds (e.g., prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), blue-winged warbler (Vermivora pinus), yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens)) in glades that had been managed with prescribed fire. Using canonical correspondence analyses and stepwise forward logistic regression, we found that grass-shrubland (glade) birds were associated with habitat characteristics such as high stem density of small (06.3 cm diameter at breast height) trees, greater herbaceous cover, greater rock cover and a more open canopy. However, we did not detect any bird species historically associated with glades, such as Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) or field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) on any study sites but did frequently detect red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceous) on all sites. Short term application of prescribed fire has not yet produced functionally restored glades. Long term applications of prescribed fire, used in conjunction with mechanical and/or chemical removal of woody overstory, are necessary to achieve restoration at these sites. © 2011, American Midland Naturalist.},

abstract={Filter strips are strips of herbaceous vegetation planted along agricultural field margins adjacent to streams or wetlands and are designed to intercept sediment, nutrients, and agrichemicals. Roughly 16,000 ha of filter strips have been established in Maryland through the United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. Filter strips often represent the only uncultivated herbaceous areas on farmland in Maryland and therefore may be important habitat for early-successional bird species. Most filter strips in Maryland are planted to either native warm-season grasses or cool-season grasses and range in width from 10.7 m to 91.4 m. From 2004 to 2007 we studied the breeding and wintering bird communities in filter strips adjacent to wooded edges and non-buffered field edges and the effect that grass type and width of filter strips had on bird community composition. We used 5 bird community metrics (total bird density, species richness, scrub-shrub bird density, grassland bird density, and total avian conservation value), species-specific densities, nest densities, and nest survival estimates to assess the habitat value of filter strips for birds. Breeding and wintering bird community metrics were greater in filter strips than in non-buffered field edges but did not differ between cool-season and warm-season grass filter strips. Most breeding bird community metrics were negatively related to the percent cover of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) in ≥1 yr. Breeding bird density was greater in narrow (<30 m) compared to wide (>60 m) filter strips. Our results suggest that narrow filter strips adjacent to wooded edges can provide habitat for many bird species but that wide filter strips provide better habitat for grassland birds, particularly obligate grassland species. If bird conservation is an objective, avoid planting orchardgrass in filter strips and reduce or eliminate orchardgrass from filter strips through management practices.

This study provides an insight into the effects of thinning on avifauna and vegetation, 5–10 y after a thinning operation. A paired-site experimental design was used to compare bird density and species richness at thinned and unthinned sites in a mixed eucalypt production forest in Gippsland, Victoria. The 2006–2007 fires across Gippsland directly affected eight of twelve sites in this study, providing an opportunity to investigate the immediate effects of wildfire on birds. Significantly greater numbers of birds and bird species were found at thinned sites, compared with unthinned sites. Differences in vegetation structure and habitat quality were also apparent between thinned and unthinned sites. A reduction in both bird abundance and species richness occurred immediately after the wildfire. Research into the impact of silvicultural techniques, such as thinning, on forest biota is an important step towards achieving ecologically sustainable forestry.

An unburned stand, a stand burned 7 years earlier and then naturally restored, and a stand where Japanese red pine Pinus densiflora seedlings were planted after the fire were used for the survey. Habitat structure was dramatically changed by postfire silvicultural practices. Number of stand trees, shrubs, seedlings, snags, and vegetation coverage were significantly different among study stands. We made 1,421 detections of 46 bird species during 23 separate line transect surveys per stand between February 2007 and December 2008. The mean number of observed bird species and individuals, bird species diversity index (H′), and Simpson's diversity index (Ds) were highest in the unburned stand and lowest in the pine seedling stand. There were more species and individuals of forest-dwelling birds in the unburned stand than both burned stands. Canopy and cavity nesters, foliage searchers, bark gleaners, and timber drillers were significantly higher in the unburned stand. In the pine seedling stand, densities of birds that prefer open field and shrub cover were higher. Stand structure was simplified in the pine seedling stand by postfire practices. Because of differences in habitat structure and bird communities, postfire practices in the burned stand should be re-evaluated. Also, management strategies for pine forest after forest fires are needed based on results of long-term experiments. © 2010 International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering and Springer.},

Vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) were the most abundant grassland bird species; all are species of management concern in Wisconsin. Of the most abundant species, only grasshopper sparrow relative abundance increased as patch size increased; vesper sparrow and field sparrow relative abundances decreased as patch size increased. Though found at lower relative abundances, horned larks (Erephila alpestris), savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), and upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) were found at higher relative abundances as patch size increased. Patch vegetation was important for some species. Vesper sparrows were found at higher abundances in patches with shorter, less dense vegetation and higher woody cover, eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna) relative abundances were higher in patches with higher proportions of grass, and dickcissel (Spiza americana) relative abundances were higher in patches with taller, denser vegetation and lower proportions of litter. Native habitats are important for grassland bird species of management concern and large patches are particularly important for some of them.},

abstract={Passive woodland regeneration following cropland abandonment and pine plantations are two major approaches for vegetation restoration in agricultural landscapes in the Mediterranean Basin. We compared the effects of these two contrasting approaches on local bird density in central Spain on the basis of species characteristics, including regional density, habitat breadth, life-history traits and plumage colouration. Local bird density increased with regional density and habitat breadth in both woodland and pine plantation plots following macroecological patterns of bird abundance and distribution. In woodlands, dichromatic species were more abundant than monochromatic species and bird density increased with the intensity of territory defense and as the proportion of plumage colour generated by pheomelanin decreased. Contrary to our prediction, this latter observation suggests that woodlands may induce higher levels of physiological stress in birds than pine plantations even though these represent a novel habitat change. In pine plantations, sedentary species were more abundant than migratory species and bird density was negatively related to body and egg mass. These traits of bird species in pine plantations are characteristic of successful invaders. The variation in bird density explained by phylogeny was twice as high in pine plantations as in woodlands, suggesting that pine plantations limit accessibility to some clades. Our results support, from an evolutionary perspective, the described inability of pine plantations on cropland to maintain or increase bird diversity in Mediterranean agricultural landscapes. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Secondary vegetation, associated with changes in land use, presents a conservation issue in the preservation of biological diversity in agricultural landscapes. We examine the interactive effect of eucalypt regrowth and rock habitat on reptile species richness and assemblage structure in fragmented agricultural landscapes in south-eastern Australia. Zoogeographic and geomorphic factors influenced species richness and community composition. Saxicolous and arboreal species were less abundant in grassy woodland regrowth, whereas Bassian and fossorial species responded positively to forest regrowth (and tree plantings). Regrowth with rock habitat had higher reptile richness, and more old growth-associated taxa, than regrowth without rock habitat. Thus, the presence of saxicolous habitat can reduce the time required for regrowth to attain a climax community structure and elements of old growth fauna. However, in the absence of vegetation management, secondary vegetation can reduce habitat suitability for a broad range of reptiles. In agricultural landscapes historically supporting savannah-like vegetation, habitat manipulation may be necessary to maintain reptile diversity. Furthermore, tree plantings in temperate agricultural landscapes should aim to restore historical vegetation composition and structure, thereby reflecting the habitat requirements of extant species and facilitating evolutionary processes. In grassy woodland ecosystems, this may involve heterogeneous plantings which emulate natural levels of canopy cover and solar penetration. Maintaining biodiversity in agricultural landscapes will therefore involve managing trade-offs to preserve areas of dense regeneration for regrowth-dependant fauna, while at the same time, creating open-canopy environments to enhance habitat for ectothermic organisms. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Cereal pseudo-steppes hold the largest proportion of declining bird species in Europe. Understanding how this process of decline is driven is essential for designing adequate management practices. The little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) is one of such threatened steppe-land bird species, which has suffered recent dramatic range constrictions and population declines. Although low breeding success has been claimed to be the main threat for the viability of future little bustard populations, the surprising lack of studies dealing with ecological requirements of broods hinders the implementation of efficient conservation practices. We studied the ranging behaviour and the reproductive success of a little bustard population by means of female radio-tracking conducted during 2006-2008 breeding seasons in the Ebro basin (NE Spain). We recorded an average breeding success of 0.27 chicks/hen, which is not enough to sustain a viable population according to the demographic models for the species. Early-laid clutches showed more probabilities to hatch and to fledge. This was associated to two different ranging patterns (i.e. sedentary versus wandering respectively) which depended on the ability of the hen and its chicks to settle in suitable areas harbouring enough arthropods and shelter for chicks. Such resources decrease drastically as the breeding season progresses. Overall, data suggest that agricultural practices associated to agricultural intensification, particularly early harvest, reduce breeding success both directly by nest destruction and indirectly through a decrease on resource availability for broods. Based on our findings on the characteristics and structure of the home range of little bustard broods, we propose the creation of a network of permanent vegetation plots interconnected by high-quality field margins as a management practice to raise the breeding success of little bustards and other ground-nesting birds on cereal farmland. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Native pollinating bees are a vital component of the biologically diverse plant and animal community which is critical to healthy, ecologically functional range landscapes. Managing rangelands to enhance life requisites for native pollinators likely will require adjusting current practices. Many bumble bee species also nest under or on the ground, but instead of digging narrow underground tunnels, they utilize existing cavities, such as those left behind by burrowing mammals. A diversity and abundance of plants that produce nectar and pollen used by insects, combined with a variety of standing or downed dead wood, bare ground, and overgrown vegetation, are the hallmarks of rich heterogeneous pollinator habitat. Similarly, diverse rangeland plant communities support diverse assemblages of grasshoppers, crickets, and other orthopterans, with the interesting side effect of mitigating or preventing outbreaks.},

abstract={Studies in southwest Oregon suggest that riparian areas within mixed-conifer forests historically burned with frequencies and intensities similar to upland areas and that fire played an important role in maintaining both of these ecosystems. Currently, most fuel reduction projects do not include riparian, due to the perception that these riparian areas are negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbance. However, there is very little information on the ecological consequences of including riparian areas in fuel reduction projects. We compared the effects of non-commercial thin and handpile treatments followed by prescribed burns in riparian areas of intermittent and perennial streams that were treated to the streamside (unbuffered), to the typical prescription in which sites were treated only in the adjacent upland (buffered). Unbuffered fuel reduction treatments have the potential to affect bird density and reproductive success differently than buffered treatments by altering (1) available nest habitat, (2) predator and nest parasite abundance, and (3) food availability in riparian areas. This study assessed whether unbuffered fuel reduction treatments yielded similar bird response as buffered treatments by quantifying differences in density and reproductive success of five bird species, vegetation structure, the frequency of occurrence of predators and a nest parasite, and arthropod biomass. Density was greater for the shrub and tree-nesting Pacific-slope Flycatcher in buffered streams post treatment. Reproductive success showed a minimal, near-term effect for the shrub-nesting Black-headed Grosbeak. For potential causal factors, we found differences between buffered and unbuffered streams only for available nest habitat in the upper-ground strata and frequency of occurrence of raptors. Overall, results suggest that fuel reduction in riparian areas as compared with typical upland treatments with buffers had a small effect on bird density and a near-term effect on reproductive success. Additional study of fuel reduction in riparian areas is warranted because of its effectiveness in reducing the risk of unnaturally severe wildfire and, correspondingly, the potential benefit to bird communities over the long-term. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Successful regeneration of secondary tropical forest might be crucial in the conservation of rainforests, since large areas of primary forest have been destroyed or degraded. Animal communities might play an important role in restoration of biological diversity in these secondary habitats, since some groups have high mobility and capacity for dispersal. Fruit-feeding butterflies were trapped to measure differences between butterfly communities in primary rainforest and disturbed forest habitats of different stage of regeneration including clear-cut, abandoned farmland, newly planted forest and middle-aged secondary growth. 3465 specimens representing 114 species were identified from 56 traps operated for 36 days. Extremely high values of rarefied species richness were estimated in the clear-cut habitat, due to the high number of singletons and doubletons. This was caused by a gap-effect that allowed penetration of canopy and open area species after disturbance. The differences between butterfly communities were best demonstrated through ecological composition, richness and abundance of indicator groups and habitat similarity based on Jaccard's similarity index. The results show a clear ability of butterfly communities in degraded forest habitats to regenerate in 50-60 years after clearance. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={In 2006-2010, effects of four different cattle stocking rates (0, 14.4, 28.8, and 43.2 animal unit months) were compared, representing 0%, 20%, 32%, and 46% utilization of vegetation by domestic livestock, on vegetation structure (as indexed by visual obstruction), and songbird population and apparent nest density, community composition, and diversity in a Pacific Northwest bunchgrass prairie in northeastern Oregon, USA. Overall paddock-level visual obstruction decreased and structural heterogeneity increased with increasing stocking rates, and those effects carried over 1 year after grazing had ceased. Most species were able to locate nesting sites regardless of differences in visual obstruction, except western meadowlark and vesper sparrow, for which obstruction was lower in paddocks with higher stocking rates. Apparent nest density for grasshopper sparrows was negatively affected by higher stocking rates. Grazing effects on absolute songbird population density were restricted to negative effects of higher stocking rates on savannah sparrows, but this relationship was not observed until 1 year after grazing had ceased. Songbird community composition differed between control and heavily-grazed paddocks, driven by an increase in the proportion of horned larks and a decrease in the proportion of savannah sparrows in heavily-grazed paddocks from pre-treatment to post-treatment years. Bird diversity indices were unaffected by stocking rate. Negative effects of high stocking rates on densities of two species and the absence of any clear positive effect for the other three species suggest high stocking rates as applied in this experiment may not provide suitable habitat for all grassland songbirds. The absence of negative responses of density to low and moderate stocking rates suggests these grazing regimes generally provided suitable habitat for all species. © 2011.Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) returning to streams around the North Pacific Rim provide a nutrient subsidy to these ecosystems. While many species of animals feed directly on salmon carcasses each autumn, salmon-derived nutrients can also be stored in coastal habitats throughout the year. The effects of this storage legacy on vertebrates in other seasons are not well understood, especially in estuaries, which can receive a large portion of post-spawning salmon nutrients. We examine the effects of residual salmon-derived nutrients, forest habitats and landscape features on summer breeding birds in estuary forests. We compared models containing environmental variables and combined chum (Oncorhynchus keta) and pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) salmon biomass to test predictions concerning bird density and diversity. We discovered that total bird, insectivore, golden-crowned kinglet and Pacific wren densities and Shannon's diversity in the summer were strongly predicted by salmon biomass in the autumn. For most metrics, this relationship approaches an asymptote beyond 40 000 kg of salmon biomass. Foliage height diversity, watershed catchment area and estuary area were also important predictors of avian communities. Our study suggests that the legacy of salmon nutrients influences breeding bird density and diversity in estuaries that vary across a wide gradient of spawning salmon biomass. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Invasive species are regularly claimed as the second threat to biodiversity. To apply a relevant response to the potential consequences associated with invasions (e.g., emphasize management efforts to prevent new colonization or to eradicate the species in places where it has already settled), it is essential to understand invasion mechanisms and dynamics. Quantifying and understanding what influences rates of spatial spread is a key research area for invasion theory. In this paper, we develop a model to account for occupancy dynamics of an invasive species. Our model extends existing models to accommodate several elements of invasive processes; we chose the framework of hierarchical modeling to assess site occupancy status during an invasion. First, we explicitly accounted for spatial structure and how distance among sites and position relative to one another affect the invasion spread. In particular, we accounted for the possibility of directional propagation and provided a way of estimating the direction of this possible spread. Second, we considered the influence of local density on site occupancy. Third, we decided to split the colonization process into two subprocesses, initial colonization and recolonization, which may be ground-breaking because these subprocesses may exhibit different relationships with environmental variations (such as density variation) or colonization history (e.g., initial colonization might facilitate further colonization events). Finally, our model incorporates imperfection in detection, which might be a source of substantial bias in estimating population parameters. We focused on the case of the Eurasian Collared-Dove (Streptopelia decaocto) and its invasion of the United States since its introduction in the early 1980s, using data from the North American BBS (Breeding Bird Survey). The Eurasian Collared-Dove is one of the most successful invasive species, at least among terrestrial vertebrates. Our model provided estimation of the spread direction consistent with empirical observations. Site persistence probability exhibits a quadratic response to density. We also succeeded at detecting differences in the relationship between density and initial colonization vs. recolonization probabilities. We provide a map of sites that may be colonized in the future as an example of possible practical application of our work. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={A critical handicap to tropical biodiversity conservation efforts in agroecosystems is the unknowns regarding the influence of landscape-scale factors on the persistence of species. To address these uncertainties, we explored two essential landscape-scale questions, within India's biologically-rich Western Ghats, examining two nearby human-dominated landscapes that dramatically differed in their pattern of land cover. First, how does the proximity of intact forest patches affect bird community composition within agricultural landscapes? Second, can simple remote sensing-derived measures (brightness, wetness, and NDVI) be used to estimate native bird species composition within those landscapes? In both landscapes, as distance to intact forest decreased, the similarity in bird community composition between agricultural areas and intact forest increased. This suggests that the retention of tropical forest bird communities within human-dominated landscapes critically depends on the maintenance of nearby intact forest. In an answer to the second question, the remote sensing measures correlated with forest-affiliated avian species richness in only one of the two landscapes, reflecting an ecological difference between the two in the response of forest bird species to local agricultural conditions. In the landscape where a correlation was found, there was high variation in vegetative structure, which strongly impacted both the remote sensing measures and forest bird species richness. In the other landscape, forest species richness strongly correlated with changes in tree species composition in the agriculture, a factor that could not be detected by the remote sensing metrics. In order to successfully conserve biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes, our findings show that it is essential to conserve intact forest within those landscapes and to understand the effect of local agricultural practices on species. © Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={For preserving biodiversity of European-Mediterranean forest ecosystems in current and future scenarios of global change by means of sustainable forest management it is necessary to determine how environment and forest characteristics correlate with biodiversity. For this purpose, neural networks were used to model forest bird species richness as a function of environment and forest structure and composition at the 1 × 1 km scale in Catalonia (NE Spain). Univariate and multivariate models respectively allowed exploring individual variable response and obtaining a parsimonious (ecologically meaningful) and accurate neural network. Forest area (with a canopy cover above 5%), mean forest canopy cover, mean annual temperature and summer precipitation were the best predictors of forest bird species richness. The resultant multivariate network had a good generalization capacity that failed however in the locations with highest species richness. Additionally, those forests with different degrees of canopy closure that were more mature and presented a more diverse tree species composition were also associated with higher bird species richness. This allowed us to provide management guidelines for forest planning in order to promote avian diversity in this European-Mediterranean region.},

abstract={The effects of anthropogenic forest disturbance on avian populations are only starting to be understood, with most research focusing on community richness and species abundance. Monitoring nesting survival is becoming an important and increasingly reliable method for assessing habitat quality. We investigated nest survival and Brown-headed Cowbird nest parasitism of 18 Neotropical migratory bird species in experimentally managed mixed-oak forests in southeast Ohio. We monitored nests during one pre-treatment year and four post-treatment years in four treatment plots: thin, burn, thin + burn, and unmanipulated control. Nesting activity was lower in the first two post-treatment years, but returned to pre-treatment levels in the last two post-treatment years. Overall post-treatment nesting success in the thin and thin + burn treatments exceeded that in the control and burn plots. Ground and shrub nesting species responded negatively to burning alone, but were not affected by the other treatments. Understory nesting success was initially lower in the burn and thin + burn treatments than in the thin only treatment, but increased in the thin and thin + burn treatment in the final two years. Furthermore, we observed bird species nesting in the thin and thin + burn treatments in the final two years that had not been recorded in the previous three years. Hence, the thinned habitats attracted secondary scrub nesting species. Nest heights were significantly higher in burn and thin + burn treatments. We did not detect Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism until the third and fourth years post-treatment, but nest parasitism was still low at 4.1% of active nests. Our results suggest that combining selective harvests (thinning) with prescribed fire is the best of these forest management plans when considering avian nest survival. © Streby and Miles; Licensee Bentham Open.},

abstract={Important and unique breeding bird communities occur in rice fields throughout the world, but little is known about breeding densities and nest success, and, therefore, the value of rice fields to breeding birds. Breeding bird use of rice fields is divided into five categories: 1) nesting in standing rice crop, 2) nesting on levees within fields or at field perimeters, 3) nesting in associated irrigation canals and ditches, 4) nesting in other wet areas that exist because of rice cultivation, and 5) use of fields for foraging, while breeding in adjacent habitats. Nest density and nest success vary greatly based on the region, management practices, and species' requirements. Birds commonly nesting in rice fields include ducks, bitterns, rails, shorebirds, terns and some passerines. Herons often use rice fields heavily while breeding in adjacent habitat. Research on nest densities, nest success, nestling and fledgling success, and microhabitat selection is needed to better understand the bird communities that use rice fields.},

abstract={The Indian subcontinent has the world's highest cropland cover per unit area with rice (Oryza sativa) being the second-most important crop, and is home to nearly 1,300 species of birds. The significance of rice fields as bird habitat in the region is not well understood and the subject is reviewed using a combination of published and secondary information. Rice fields in the subcontinent are used by at least 351 species, although only 2.7% of birds occurring in the subcontinent breed in rice fields. The spread of rice cultivation and its attendant secondary habitats may have contributed to the increase in range and population of 64 common species but is threatening hundreds of other species, many of conservation concern. Most work in the region has focused on birds as pests of rice. Few studies have been conducted on the habits of birds that use rice fields and fewer still have compared how rice fields and similar natural habitats differ. Although rice harvesting has caused nest mortality for breeding birds, there is no comparable information from natural habitats. The guild structure of birds in rice fields is similar to that overall in the region except for a higher representation of carnivores. Rice fields are used primarily by grassland and wetland species. There are large information gaps that require filling to be able to ascertain the utility or impact of rice fields to bird populations and, thus, many research opportunities.},

abstract={The Fire and Fire Surrogate Study is a national study installed at 13 sites across the United States. One goal of the southeastern Piedmont FFS installation was to assess the effects of fuel reduction treatments such as prescribed burning and thinning on avian nest density. Nest searching and monitoring took place within twelve 10-hectare study plots during the breeding seasons of 2003 and 2004. A total of 82 nests representing 23 species were discovered and monitored. Seventy-two percent of those nests were successful in fledging young and 28% failed. Higher quantities of herbaceous material, shrubs, and small diameter trees provided more nesting substrate in Thin/Burn and Burn plots. This study suggests that prescribed burning and a combination of prescribed burning and thinning may be beneficial for Southern Piedmont bird communities, but our conclusions must be considered in light of the small sample sizes of nests. Increasing the area of upland Piedmont forest receiving prescribed burning and thinning treatments could possibly benefit early successional species that are presently experiencing population declines across the United States. © Kilpatrick et al.},

abstract={To combat severe soil erosion and improve the land productivity, construction of protection forests has been widely implemented as one of the key ecological restoration efforts on the Loess Plateau in Northwestern China. After giving a brief introduction of the concept of protection forests defined by the various researchers, several issues with respect to the goal of protection forests, the scales and the principles for developing protection forests were examined from the viewpoints of restoration ecology and eco-hydrology. A few recommendations were proposed to provide the theoretical foundations for construction of protection forests. We argue that, in addition to soil erosion control, the ultimate of protection forests in the Loess area should serve both water regulation and erosion control. We should recognize the hierarchical system of protection forests. In addition to the structural-optimization techniques at the stand level and the spatial arrangements measures at the watershed level, determination of both zonal vegetation types and the coverage on the regional scale should be considered in designing protection forests. To succeed in constructing protection forests and fulfilling the established targets, several theories should be followed in practice, including the principle of water balance, the theory of ecological suitability, the biological diversity, and the theory of ecosystem regeneration and succession. Construction of protection forests should not alter the balance of water availability and tree growth requirement. Dominant tree species of secondary forests should be encouraged to enhance forest succession and bio-diversity when implementing the conventional principle of "tree and site match". We conclude that the following four key aspects should be reinforced: (1) evaluation of the vulnerability of protection forests, and developing adaptation strategies for managing protection forests under a changing climate and variability; (2) implementation of the principle of "tree-site match" by assessment of suitability of reforestation at high spatial and temporal resolution based on the interactive relations between soil, hydrology, vegetation, and climate; (3) predicting the spatial distribution of potential vegetation of the loess area using restoration ecology theories and constructing the protection forests with the pattern of close-to-nature to restore the vegetation of the Loess area; (4) understanding the hydrological responses of protection forests to the change in vegetation patterns, species composition, as well as coverage using physically-based distributed eco-hydrological models; developing theories for forest restoration design on forest structure and spatial distributions of protection forests.},

abstract={In East Africa fire and grazing by wild and domestic ungulates maintain savannas, and pastoralists historically set fires and herded livestock through the use of temporary corrals called bomas. In recent decades traditional pastoral practices have declined, and this may be affecting biodiversity. We investigated the effects of prescribed fires and bomas on savanna bird communities in East Africa during the first and second dry seasons of the year (respectively before and after the rains that mark the onset of breeding for most birds). We compared abundance, richness, and community composition on 9-ha burned plots, recently abandoned bomas, and control plots in the undisturbed matrix habitat over a 3-year period. Generally, recently burned areas and abandoned bomas attracted greater densities of birds and had different community assemblages than the surrounding matrix. The effects of disturbances were influenced by interactions between primary productivity, represented by the normalized difference vegetation index, and time. Bird densities were highest and a greater proportion of species was observed on burned plots in the months following the fires. Drought conditions equalized bird densities across treatments within 1 year, and individuals from a greater proportion of species were more commonly observed on abandoned bomas. Yearly fluctuations in abundance were less pronounced on bomas than on burns, which indicate that although fire may benefit birds in the short term, bomas may have a more-lasting positive effect and provide resources during droughts. Several Palearctic migrants were attracted to burned plots regardless of rainfall, which indicates continued fire suppression may threaten their already-declining populations. Most notably, the paucity of birds observed on the controls suggests that the current structure of the matrix developed as a result of fire suppression. Traditional pastoralism appears critical to the maintenance of avian diversity in these savannas. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Krüper's Nuthatch (Sitta krueperi, Passeriformes) is small-area confined species and it mainly occurs in Anatolia in Turkey, but small numbers are found on the adjacent Lesvos Island and the Caucasus region. It is considered as a "near" threatened species by IUCN. Breeding success of Krüper's Nuthatchs, which use nest cavities excavated by woodpeckers or make their own entrance holes in slightly decayed old tree trunks, is about 72% fledged birds and main food is composed of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera. Although this species is mainly confined to red pine (Pinus brutia) forest, it occurs also in the other coniferous habitats. Krüper's Nuthatch was surveyed in four regions of Mediterranean Turkey: the Antalya, Central Taurus, Aladaglar region and Amanos Mountains on an area of 27.9 km2. Total of 395 point counts were taken in coniferous forests during the breeding season 2005 to explore the factors which affect the population distribution and density. For each point counts following habitat parameters were measured: (1) height of canopy top, (2) height of canopy bottom, (3) tree diameter at breast height, (4) percentage cover (5) average distance between two trees, (6) total number of strata of vegetation and topographic data (altitude, degree of slope, direction of slope, soil texture). The average density of Krüper's Nuthatch recorded in the all sites was 7.38 ± 0.57 birds km2. However, it differs between regions (ANOVA; P &lt;0.0001) with highest density in the Antalya region (12.10 ± 2.10 birds km-2), and a decrease to the east with lowest density in the Amanos Mountains (2.42 ± 0.98 birds km-2). Krüper's Nuthatch breeding density was higher in high altitude and in black pine (Pinus nigra) forest. The highest mean density was found in black pine forests (12.69 ±2.4 birds km-2; n = 29), followed by Cilician fir (Abies cilicica) forest (11.61 ± 2 birds km -2; n = 39), Lebanon cedar forest (Cedrus libani) (8.49 ± 1.8 birds knr-2; n = 25) and red pine (Pinus burutia) forest (7.75 ± 0.9 birds km-2; n = 188) respectively. We also found a negative correlation between the densities of Krüper's Nuthatch and the total number of strata of the vegetation. High number of the birds occurs in more open coniferous forests. Mature coniferous forests especially black pine forests at high altitudes should be preserved for its conservation in Antalya region.},

abstract={The use of aural surveys to estimate population parameters is widespread in avian studies. Despite efforts to increase the efficacy of this method, the potential for ecological context to bias population estimates remains largely unexplored. For example, food availability and nest predation risk can influence singing activity independent of density and, therefore, may bias aural estimates where these ecological factors vary systematically among habitats or other categories of ecological interest. We used a natural fire event in a mixed-conifer forest that experienced variation in fire severity (low, intermediate, and high) to determine if aural surveys produce accurate density estimates of Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) independent of ecological context. During the first 2-yr postfire, we censused junco populations in each burn type with intensive spot-mapping and nest searching, locating 168 nests. Simultaneously, we conducted fixed-radius point-count surveys and estimated food availability and nest predation risk in each burn type to test whether ecological context may influence aural detection probability independent of actual density. We found no difference in nesting densities among patches burned at different severity. Arthropod food availability was inversely related to fire severity during the first postfire breeding season, but increased to higher levels across all severities during the second. In both years, aural detections were significantly greater in intermediate severity patches that consistently represented the habitat with the lowest nest predation risk. These results suggest that nest predation risk may significantly bias aural estimates of avian populations. Although traditional aural survey methods such as the Breeding Bird Survey measure habitat attributes, our findings highlight the difficulty in assessing relevant covariates in estimates of avian population. Future research must consider the potential for nest predation and other ecological factors to drive interannual or interhabitat variation in avian population estimates independent of true changes in population size. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={The principal ecosystem driver in arid Australia is unpredictable rainfall, but it is hypothesised that fire also plays an important role in determining the distribution of animals. We investigated the effect of fire on birds in mulga (Acacia aneura) woodland in the central Australian arid zone. The study was conducted at UluruKata Tjuta National Park using 63 sites classified into one of three time-since-fire classes: burnt 2002; burnt 1976; and long-unburnt. Birds were sampled in the winter and spring of 2005 and 2006 and vegetation structure was measured at all sites. Vegetation structure varied with time-since-fire. The burnt 2002 treatment was an early seral stage of mulga woodland and effectively a grassland. The burnt 1976 and long-unburnt treatments were both woodland, but the long-unburnt treatment had greater canopy cover and height. The bird community in the burnt 2002 treatment was characterised by granivores, whereas that in the burnt 1976 and long-unburnt treatments was characterised by foliar insectivores. All species showed monotonic responses to time-since-fire (i.e. none were at significantly highest density in the burnt 1976 treatment). Fire in mulga woodland changed the vegetation structure and consequently also changed the composition of the bird communities. © 2010 IAWF.},

In this study, we used more than two decades of data from permanent plots in mixedconifer forests of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, California, to explore changes in plant diversity and abundance following reintroduction and repeated use of fire. Data on stand structure, fuel loading, fire severity and heterogeneity, and the richness and abundance of major growth forms were collected on 51 plots representing one of three treatments: control, first-entry burn, and second-entry burn. Understories showed distinct compositional changes over time in first- and second-entry burns. Burned plots supported more than twice as many species as controls 10 yr after treatment; first-entry plots showed a nearly threefold increase in richness by year 20. Burned plots supported four to five times as many shrub species as controls 5-10 yr after burning. Total plant cover (dominated by perennial forbs and shrubs) increased in first-entry plots, but did not differ from controls until 20 yr after treatment. Following secondentry, cover did not change through final sampling (year 10). Nonnative species were rare, occurring in only three plots at low abundance. Higher severity fires led to greater numbers of species and to greater plant cover. Species richness was not correlated with burn heterogeneity. Long-term observations suggest that reintroduction of fire in previously unmanaged forests can gradually enhance the diversity and abundance of understory species. Repeated burning-necessary to achieve structural and fuel-reduction objectives-does not appear to have a detrimental effect on plant diversity and may enhance the distributions of species that are adversely affected by fire exclusion. If fire is to play an important role in restoration, however, it will need to be maintained as a frequent and spatially dynamic process on the landscape. © 2010 Webster and Halpern.},

abstract={We compared the bird and woody plant communities of 2 to 24-year-old rehabilitation areas at Gove bauxite mine (20 km2) in the seasonal tropics of northern Australia, where Alcan has maintained a consistent rehabilitation program since it began operation in 1974. Birds were censused every second month over 2 years in 30 widely separated 0.25-ha plots, representing five chronosequence stages. These were also compared with six ("off-mine") plots adjacent to the mine, which represented the annually burnt open forest typical of the region. Short-lived Acacias dominated the early chronosequence stages, whereas eucalypts dominated in later stages. Mean avian species richness and abundance increased significantly along the chronosequence, with values for the oldest rehabilitation plots being very similar to those for the off-mine plots. However, analyses of similarity revealed that the bird communities of the oldest rehabilitation plots were distinct from those of the off-mine plots, indicating that succession in rehabilitation areas is not following a direct trajectory toward the native open forest surrounding the mine. Several hollow-nesting bird species were scarce or absent in the rehabilitation areas, probably reflecting the absence of older hollow-bearing trees. Many differences between the rehabilitation and the off-mine areas in vegetation structure, woody flora, and avifauna appear to be related to the exclusion of fire from the minesite. We recommend the initiation of experiments designed to assess the effects of fire on the biota but caution against the use of fires for the majority of rehabilitation areas. © 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract={Capsule: Hedgerows and margins managed under agri-environment schemes appear to attract greater numbers of some farmland bird species. Aims: To examine fine-scale habitat associations of farmland birds to determine whether Entry Level Stewardship, the wider countryside agri-environment scheme for England, provides a mechanism for affecting population changes. Methods: Ninety-seven 1-km squares in East Anglia were surveyed to create two-dimensional habitat maps showing the location of all habitat patches and associated stewardship management. Modified territory-mapping techniques were used to produce relative estimates of bird numbers within each discrete habitat patch within each square. The effect of Entry Level Stewardship on species density was then analysed using GLM s. Results: Boundaries managed under Entry Level Stewardship appeared to attract higher densities of Blue Tits, Dunnocks, Common Whitethroats and Yellowhammers. Margins managed under the scheme also had higher densities of Yellowhammers. Conclusions: Existing boundary habitat management under Entry Level Stewardship may provide a mechanism for increasing the populations of some farmland bird species. Boundary management options should continue to be promoted, although rebalancing the scheme more towards in-field options is likely to be more widely beneficial. © 2010 British Trust for Ornithology.},

abstract={Prescribed fire is used widely to manage grasslands on National Wildlife Refuges and other public lands in the northern Great Plains, but its effects on habitat use or production of wildlife in the region are poorly understood. During 19982003, we used point counts to examine effects of prescribed fire on vegetation and passerines in a mixed-grass prairie complex in north-central North Dakota, USA (n 7 units, each 4070 ha). Vegetation structure and, to a lesser extent, plant community composition varied with year of study (likely related to changes in annual precipitation) and with number of growing seasons since fire. Fire altered plant structure, especially the amount of residual vegetation, which in turn influenced bird species richness and abundance. The number of indicated pairs for sedge wren (Cistothorus platensis), clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), Le Conte's sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) were lowest during the first postfire growing season but generally increased and stabilized within 23 postfire growing seasons. Our results support the premise that grassland passerines are well-adapted to frequent, periodic fires, generally corresponding to those occurring prior to EuroAmerican settlement of the region. Prescribed fire is important for reducing tree and shrub invasion, restoring biological integrity of plant communities, and maintaining or enhancing populations of grassland-dependent bird species. Managers in the northern mixed-grass prairie region should not be overly concerned about reductions in bird abundances that are limited mostly to the first growing season after fire. © 2010 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Tree cavities are proposed to limit populations and structure communities of cavity-nesting birds. Although the greatest diversity of cavity-nesting birds is found in tropical and subtropical moist forests, little is known about how tropical logging affects the abundance of cavities or cavity-nesting birds. We compared the abundance of cavities and cavity nests between primary and selectively-logged subtropical moist Atlantic forest in Argentina, and conducted the first before-after controlled nest-box addition experiment to determine whether nest sites limit the breeding density of cavity-nesting birds in tropical or subtropical moist forest. Visual inspection of 86 cavities identified through ground-surveys revealed that only 19% were suitable for nesting birds, suggesting that cavity abundance may be overestimated in the literature on tropical forests. Suitable cavities were found in fewer than 1% of 1156 trees <60. cm. dbh but 20% of 20 trees >100. cm. dbh. Logged forest had half the basal area of primary forest, one third the density of large trees, nine times fewer cavities suitable for nesting birds, and 17 times fewer active nests. When we added nest boxes, nesting density increased on treatment plots but not on control plots in both logged and primary forest, suggesting that cavity supply can limit nest density even in relatively undisturbed forest. This is the first experiment to show how reduced cavity supply in logged tropical forest can limit breeding density of cavity-nesting birds. International initiatives such as forest certification should promote tropical timber management strategies that conserve large live cavity-bearing trees. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Factors determining species distributions have frequently been shown to vary geographically, yielding spatially variable species-environment relationships when developing species distribution models. Using occurrence data for four bird species, we analysed to what extent position within the distribution range along a gradient of population aggregation determined geographical variation of distributional constraints. We built generalised linear models for the whole dataset (global models) and separately for each region within the species range with decreasing population aggregation (core, middle and peripheral). For both global and regional models, we compared species responses to habitat conditions showing an overall higher model fit in peripheral regions than in middle and core regions. Better model fit in peripheral regions was also found after including a spatial factor (i.e. an autocovariate estimating the proportion between the presences and total observations within a 10 km radius) into the global and regional models.The scattered availability of suitable habitat patches in a predominantly hostile landscape matrix seems to be the limiting factor for species distributions in peripheral regions. Conversely, the larger number of spatially dependent occurrences in core and middle region may favour source and sink population dynamics, yielding poorer relationships between habitat conditions and species occurrence. The role of the spatial factor after removing the co-variation with habitat conditions separately for each region suggests that endogenous processes such as dispersal vary throughout the species range but differently for each species. Geographical variation in distributional constraints can be interpreted as a consequence of the inherent spatial character of ecological processes and their interaction with varying environmental conditions throughout the species range. Overlooking the effects of spatial variation in distributional constraints may lead to erroneous management conclusions and inadequate estimation of the species' response to environmental changes. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Although increased attention is being paid to animals when studying restoration processes, little is known on the effects that different restoration efforts have on birds. In this study we evaluated the variation of bird communities in a managed landscape that includes cropfields and two different restoration strategies. To evaluate possible differential effects of both restoration strategies (plus former-state and natural-state comparisons as controls), we compared their bird communities. After five growing seasons, bird species richness was highest in native forest remnants and lowest in cropfields. Although species richness values from the restoration treatment did not show differences in relation to those from the forest treatment, values for the reforestation treatment did. Bird densities were highest in the forests and alike in cropfield, reforestation, and restoration treatments. However, bird communities recorded in the restoration treatment were fairly even when compared to the reforestation treatment, and highest bird species composition similarity was recorded between the restoration and forest treatments. These results suggest that the studied restoration treatment attracts a higher number of bird species in relation to former states and thus enhance bird richness. Also, we demonstrate that restoration efforts that include more actions can affect more ecosystem components. In this study, nurse plants not only offered a quick growing structural vegetation component that enhanced habitat structure, but also provided abundant food resources for birds. Given the scarcity of comparable habitat matrices to replicate our study, our results should be taken with caution as they are not generalizable to all Mexican temperate forest conditions. Although further studies need to address whether restoration practices using Lupinus elegans positively affect bird primary population parameters (e.g., survival, reproduction), our results show that restoration practices that include nurse plants can promote rich bird communities after only 5 years from the implementation of restoration measures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Throughout the Midwestern U.S., grassland birds have been declining faster than any other group of birds, with the main cause for these declines being the extensive loss of native prairies. During the last 25 y, surrogate grasslands, such as Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands, have become increasingly important as an alternative habitat for grassland birds. However, many CRP grasslands that once provided excellent habitat are now dominated by monculture stands of grass, resulting in a less diverse habitat that has reduced wildlife benefits. In summer 2002, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and Pheasants Forever partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency and Natural Resource Conservation Service to initiate a program that promotes disking and interseeding legumes as a mid-contract management practice in CRP fields. The objectives of this study were to determine grassland bird abundance and nest-productivity in disked and interseeded CRP fields and evaluate vegetative responses to disking and interseeding. We conducted our study on 16 CRP fields in Stanton County, Nebraska where we used fixed transects to determine avian species richness and abundance and nest-searched twelve 4-ha plots to determine nest productivity in treatment (managed by disking and interseeding) and reference (unmanaged) CRP fields. We also recorded vegetation characteristics along each transect and at each nest. Overall abundance in treatment fields was 4.49 ± 0.25 (se) birds/transect compared to 2.93 ± 0.21 birds/transect in reference fields. Species richness and diversity were also higher in treatment fields. There was no difference in nest density or nest success between treatment and reference fields. Treatment field vegetation had higher percentages of forbs and bare ground than reference sites. Maximum vegetation height and horizontal visual obstruction were also higher in treatment sites. To accommodate the most grassland bird species in CRP fields, management of CRP fields should include establishing an annual rotation of disking/interseeding, while leaving portions of fields in mature grass stands. Future research should focus on methods that will increase the longevity of the vegetation effects of disking/interseeding legumes. © 2010, American Midland Naturalist.},

abstract={Since European settlement, changes in the fire regime of eastern deciduous forests of North America have led to changes in biological diversity and stand structure. These changes may be attenuated in xeric forests at the western limit of the eastern deciduous forest where woody plant species richness is low, and dominance high, due to the rigorous biotic and physical environment. Effects of fire frequency on woody plant species richness and stand structure were studied in a xeric, oak-dominated (Quereus spp.) old-growth forest in eastern Oklahoma where prescribed burning had been conducted over 20 years at frequencies ranging from zero to five fires per decade. Regeneration (stem height < 1.4 m) cover was not affected by fire frequency. Increasing fire frequency had a strong negative effect on species richness of saplings and shrubs (stem dbh < 5 cm) but no significant effect on small tree (stems 5 cm < dbh < 10 cm) and large tree (stems dbh > 10 cm) species richness. While oak sapling density was not affected by fire frequency, the density of non-oak saplings and shrubs was very high at zero and one fire per decade and strongly reduced by fire frequencies of two or more per decade. Although 20 years of treatment may not have been sufficient to show fire frequency effects on canopy trees, the effect on species composition of saplings was strong and may have long-term consequences for forest canopy composition. These results suggest that, without at least two fires per decade, tree species richness of these forests will increase and oak dominance will diminish.},

abstract={Two new Peruvian species of Axinaea (Melastomataceae) are described. Axinaea francisco-cabiesii and Axinaea reginae are small trees, endemic to the cloud forest zone in the northern Andean region of Peru. The border region of Peru and Ecuador is one of the Earth's most biologically diverse areas. The Huancabamba depression of the central Andean Cordillera allows for dispersal of flora and fauna between the Amazon Basin and the Pacific lowlands. Additionally, the region is characterized by a fast transition between the humid mountain forests of the northern Andes and the dry, deciduous forests of the northern Peruvian lowlands, making it a hotspot for endemic species. Field observations indicate that both new Axinaea species have small population sizes, occurring in a very restricted habitat. Axinaea flava was described only a few years ago from the cloud forest- paramo transition zone in southernmost Ecuador between 3400 and 3800 m a.s.l. This small tree is the only yellow-flowered species of the genus. The original assessment counted about 100 individuals. In the last decade, livestock grazing and widespread burning have intensified in the region, and a new assessment yielded only 10 individuals, four of which were damaged by fire. This puts the species in danger of extinction. We encourage search for other populations in southern Ecuador and northern Peru. © 2010 The Authors.},

abstract={We investigated how variation in fire severity (control or no fire; low, medium, and high severity fires) and interval (1-2 years vs. 3-6 years after fires) affected habitat and avian abundance, species diversity, richness, and evenness in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Fire severity and interval had significant implications for both habitat and avian communities. Species richness within 2 years of fires was on average 26% higher in areas receiving medium and high severity treatments than in unburned control units. Species diversity and species richness were markedly greater 3-6 years after fires within high severity treatments (12 and 44%, respectively), compared to unburned controls. Relative abundance and species evenness did not vary with fire severity or time since fire. The short-term effects of low severity fires, or high severity fires with short rotation periods (≤2 years) may have limited positive effects on avian communities. Facilitation of disturbance regimes including mid to high severity fires, which foster uneven-aged forests, can be an effective conservation tool for restoring avian communities. © 2010 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={The mountains of south-eastern Nigeria are a western extension of the Cameroon mountain range, which is classified as an endemic bird area (EBA). Unlike its eastern extension in Cameroon, most of the ornithological surveys in the western extension of the Cameroon highlands in Nigeria have produced only limited checklists and inventories. There is a clear need for quantitative baseline data so that conservation problems can be identified. Twenty line transects covering a total transect length of 28.8 km were used to survey five sites (Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary, Oban Division and Okwangwo Division of Cross River National Park, Sankwala Mountains and Mbe Mountains) in the westernmost extension of the Cameroon Mountains EBA in south-eastern Nigeria. Vegetation measurements were taken to control for the potential confounding effect of variation in vegetation density and structure on detectability of birds between sites. The 193 bird species recorded in Afi, 158 in Sankwala, 124 in Oban, 100 in Mbe and 73 in Okwangwo Division included most of the Cameroon highlands restricted range species. The results show that the mountains of south-eastern Nigeria are important parts of the Cameroon EBA, particularly Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary. However these sites are threatened by fire and livestock grazing on the hilltops, shifting agriculture on the hillsides and lowlands, and logging for timber in some parts, as well as wildlife hunting for bushmeat.

abstract={Common reed (Phragmites australis) forms dense stands with deep layers of residual organic matter that negatively affects plant diversity and possibly habitat use by wetland birds. We sought to determine whether seasonal relative abundance and species richness of birds varied among 3 habitat types in Great Lakes coastal wetland complexes recently invaded by common reed. We used fixed-distance point counts to determine species relative abundances and species richness in edge and interior locales within common reed, cattail (Typha spp.), and meadow marsh habitats of various sizes during 2 summers (2001 and 2002) and 1 autumn (2001) at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada. We found that total relative abundance and species richness of birds were greater in common reed habitat compared to cattail or meadow marsh habitats. However, we also found that relative abundance of marsh-nesting birds was greater in meadow marsh habitat than in cattail and common reed during summer. Lastly, we found that, irrespective of habitat type, habitat edges had higher total relative abundance and species richness of birds than did habitat interiors. Our results show that common reed provides suitable habitat for a diversity of landbirds during summer and autumn but only limited habitat for many marsh-nesting birds during summer. Based on these results, we recommend restoration of meadow marsh habitat through reduction of common reed in Great Lakes wetlands where providing habitat for breeding marsh-nesting birds is an objective. Managers also might consider reducing the size of nonnative common reed stands to increase edge effect and use by birds, possibly including wetland birds. © 2010 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Fire is a key ecological force in pine forests worldwide, and faunal responses to this disturbance have been a major topic of ecology, yet little is known for oceanic island environments. Using line transects we surveyed the bird community of a natural Pinus canariensis forest burned in the summer of 2007 on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Our goal was to identify important environmental variables and the thresholds that influenced the pattern of bird abundance at the community, foraging guild, and species-specific level. Models were constructed by means of regression trees and cross validation applying the 1-SE rule. Mixed results were observed and only 2 species were clearly affected by fire severity. Overall, total bird abundance, total species richness, and total bird diversity were positively influenced by low, very low, and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively, and the presence of either Erica or Myrica shrubs. Consequently, high canopy fire severity had an overall negative effect on bird community characteristics. Abundance of Myrica shrubs affected positively general ground foragers such as common blackbird (Turdus merula cabrerae) and Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis), a canopy forager. The number of thin trees was important for canopy foragers such as goldcrest (Regulus regulus teneriffae) and African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae teneriffae), but also for a bark forager, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major canariensis). European robin (Erithacus rubecula superbus) and the ubiquitous endemic blue chaffinch (Friugilla teydea teydea) were influenced by low and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively. We recommend that land managers incorporate these results into future post-fire management plans. Priority post-fire actions should be directed toward the protection and conservation of the endemic blue chaffinch, a species of conservation concern on the nearby island of Gran Canaria.},

abstract={Guadeloupe Woodpeckers (Melanerpes herminieri) are the only endemic bird species on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. These woodpeckers were classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List following a population survey in 1994. To reassess the Guadeloupe Woodpecker population, we conducted a new survey in 2007, with 21 transects distributed across eight habitats known to be used by the woodpeckers. Habitats with the highest estimated population densities were seasonal evergreen secondary growth forest, followed by swamp forest and rainforest. Surveys revealed an estimated population of 8469 pairs in 2007 compared to 7368 pairs in 1994, a difference that was not significant. However, our 2007 survey revealed that Guadeloupe Woodpeckers had recolonized the last large patch of available forest on Basse-Terre, one of the two main islands in the Guadeloupe archipelago. Although our results suggest that the Guadeloupe Woodpecker population has remained relatively stable since 1994, deforestation remains a serious threat and we recommend that the IUCN Red List status of Near Threatened be retained. Management measures that would benefit Guadeloupe Woodpeckers include halting deforestation and providing financial support to people on private land to plant trees and leave dead trees standing. Regular monitoring will be important for determining the possible effects of such measures on the Guadeloupe Woodpecker population. ©2010 The Authors.

abstract={Open marsh water management (OMWM), a method of mosquito reduction through habitat alteration, is widely practiced in Mid-Atlantic salt marshes. The effect of these habitat modifications on obligate salt marsh breeding birds is poorly understood. The present study was conducted to quantify the extent of OMWM and determine if the technique affected Seaside Sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) reproductive success and nesting ecology. Seaside Sparrow territory density, nest density, nest survival, productivity and vegetation cover was estimated on 19 plots (13 ha) within tidal marshes in Sussex County, Delaware in MayAugust 20062007. Plots were characterized as limited (N = 10) or extensive OMWM (N = 9) based on the amount of alterations and time since manipulations. Seaside Sparrow territory density and nest density were two times greater on limited OMWM plots than extensive OMWM plots. Also, the number of Seaside Sparrow eggs/ha and fledglings/ha were greater on limited OMWM plots. Seaside Sparrow nest survival rates did not differ between limited and extensive OMWM plots, but reproductive output (# nests/ha, eggs/ha, and fledglings/ha) was greater on areas with limited OMWM. OMWM may be an alternative means of mosquito control but should not be considered a method of habitat enhancement for Seaside Sparrows and possibly other obligate salt marsh bird species.},

abstract={Information about the immediate and potentially prolonged impacts of salvage logging is needed to develop prescriptions that maintain forest productivity, reduce the risk of catastrophic fires, and conserve biological communities. Most salvage logging studies have investigated post-fire salvage, often clearcutting, and impacts documented in these studies may be more severe than selective logging prescriptions applied to forests affected by beetle outbreaks. We evaluated the effects of selective salvage logging on avian nest survival in beetle-killed lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests on the Fremont and Winema National Forests, south-central Oregon, USA, 1997-1999. Using logistic-exposure models, we found that nest survival for weak (period nest survival: 0.64; 95% CL: 0.50, 0.75) and strong (period nest survival: 0.71; 95% CL: 0.46, 0.87) cavity nesters was significantly higher than for ground nesters (period nest survival: 0.31; 95% CL: 0.18, 0.46), while nest survival for open cup nesting birds (period nest survival: 0.57; 95% CL: 0.47, 0.66) was intermediate. We did not find significant differences in nest survival for American robin (Turdus migratorius), chipping sparrow (Spizella passerine), dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), dusky flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri), mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli), or yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) (these six species comprised ∼80% of the sample). Our results suggest that, unlike post-fire salvage logging, selective harvesting prescriptions after beetle outbreaks may be suitable for meeting multiple management objectives, including generating a flow of commodities and maintaining avian nest survival rates. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) are secondary cavity-nesters and their dependence on snags has potential repercussions on forest management practices. Descriptive studies exist regarding habitat characteristics around saw-whet nest and roost areas, yet few studies have examined associations within larger areas or relative to snag characteristics (e.g., density). We conducted owl broadcast surveys and snag sampling during the spring and summer of 2006 and 2007 in the Lake Tahoe Basin of the central Sierra Nevada; we measured additional habitat variables from Geographic Information System layers. We modeled detection and occupancy probabilities for saw-whets using sampling and site covariates at survey sites. In addition, we used stepwise logistic regression to compare habitat characteristics at owl use sites and nonuse sites at 2 spatial scales. Detection probability was low in 2006 and decreased throughout the survey period; detection probability was slightly higher in 2007 and unaffected by day of survey. Probability of occupancy was affected by elevation and dominant tree species in 2007. Similarly, stepwise logistic regression indicated saw-whet occurrence was negatively correlated with the percentage of area dominated by white fir (Abies concolor) at both the macrohabitat (approx. 260 ha) and microhabitat (approx. 20 ha) scales and was positively correlated with the percentage of area containing open canopy at the microhabitat scale. We did not find correlations between saw-whet occurrence and snag characteristics. Current restoration projects in areas of the Sierra Nevada aim to decrease relative abundance of white fir and the number of snags in forest stands. We recommend continued monitoring of saw-whets to understand potential effects of these restoration activities. Our estimates of saw-whet occupancy and detection probabilities can be used by forest managers to determine necessary survey effort for reliable results when developing monitoring protocols. © 2010 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={We evaluated thirteen years (1995-2007) of Charadrius melodus (Piping Plover) nesting activity at Jones Beach State Park (JBSP) to examine temporal trends in the number of pairs, productivity, total young produced per year, and nest initiation. The number of plover pairs has decreased over time at JBSP, while productivity (and total number of young produced per year) has increased. Productivity has increased more at JBSP compared to other areas in their range. In addition, nest initiation was significantly later in the nesting season in recent years. Increased productivity indicates that management efforts to increase this population parameter may have had a positive effect on nesting plovers. The decreased numbers of nesting pairs, however, suggests that management techniques to increase numbers of breeding pairs, such as nesting-habitat restoration, may also be necessary to increase local population size. In the absence of suitable nesting habitat for recruitment of locally fledged birds, JBSP may be functioning as a "source" for other regional breeding populations.},

abstract={Land use management practices often change habitat structure, which in turn influence diversity and the composition of floral and faunal assemblages. In the southern Kalahari, southern Africa, heavy grazing after above-average rainfall has lead to bush thickening, and widespread use of arboricides and/or removal of large trees for firewood has also impacted habitat structure. At sites near Kimberley, in South Africa, we investigated the effects of these changes on bird species richness and which aspects of habitat structure most influenced bird assemblage diversity and composition. We also investigated correlations between bird life history traits and habitat characteristics using RLQ analysis. Bird species richness and abundance were both explained by vertical habitat heterogeneity and density of woody species between the heights of 0-2 m, with bird species richness also explained by the density of woody species at heights above 6 m. Large trees within bush-thickened areas dampened the effects of bush thickening on bird assemblages by enabling certain species to persist, consistent with the idea that large trees are keystone structures. Smaller insectivorous gleaners, ball- and cup-nesters, birds with parts of their range extending into arid areas and birds with long-wavelength plumage (i.e. red, orange or yellow plumage) dominated bush-thickened habitats. Seed-eaters, burrow- and ground-nesters, bark-foragers, birds that perch and sally, or perch and swoop to the ground, were all negatively associated with bush thickening. Cavity-nesters, bark-foragers, hawkers, frugivores, birds that perch and sally and species with iridescent plumage were negatively affected by the loss of large trees. Of the common species analysed, nearly 40% of species had life history traits tied to large trees; and 68% had traits negatively associated with bush thickening and removal of large trees together, suggesting that where these changes in habitat occur simultaneously, bird diversity will be strongly affected. © 2009 The Authors.

abstract={Conifer dominated plantations in central and northern Europe are associated with relatively low ecological values, and in some cases, may be vulnerable to disturbances caused by anthropogenic climate change. This has prompted the consideration of alternative tree species compositions for use in production forestry in this region. Here we evaluate the likely biodiversity costs and benefits of supplanting Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures with polycultures of spruce and birch (Betula spp.) in southern Sweden. This polyculture alternative has previously been evaluated in terms of economic, recreational, and silvicultural benefits. By also assessing the ecological implications we fill a gap in our understanding of the range of socio-ecological benefits that can be achieved from a single polyculture alternative. We project likely broad scale changes to species richness and abundance within production stands for five taxonomic groups including ground vegetation, tree-living bryophytes, lichens, saproxylic beetles, and birds. Our research leads us to three key findings. First, the replacement of spruce monocultures with spruce-birch polycultures in the managed forest landscapes of southern Sweden can be expected to result in an increase in biological diversity for most but not all taxa assessed, but it is unlikely to improve conditions for many red-listed forest species. Second, modification of other aspects of forest management (i.e. rotation length, dead wood and green tree retention, thinning regimes) is likely to contribute to further biodiversity gains using spruce-birch polycultures than spruce monocultures. Third, the paucity of empirical research which directly compares the biodiversity of different types of managed production stands, limits the extent to which policy relevant conclusions can be extracted from the scientific literature. We discuss the wider implications of our findings, which indicate that some climate change adaptation strategies, such as risk-spreading, can be readily integrated with the economic, environmental and social goals of multi-use forestry. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Capsule Set-aside (land temporally removed from agricultural production) features and their regional locations influence steppe-bird species of conservation concern in Catalonia. Aims To identify set-aside features important to the ecology of four ground nesting species, namely Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, Stone-curlew Burhinus oedicnemus, Greater Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla and Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra. Methods Set-aside fields were surveyed in four regions of Catalonia (northeast of Spain) for the selected species during the 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons. Set-aside habitat descriptors (e.g. size, vegetation structure) were collected. Ordination plots and information theoretic methods were used to assess the relationship between the selected bird species, set-aside features and the regions. Results The region where the set-aside was located had a strong effect on the abundance of the selected species. In addition, vegetation coverage, field shape of set-aside and surrounding natural habitats were critical features, but with contrasting effects on the different species. Conclusion Populations of the selected species of conservation concern could be improved by effective management of set-aside. As selected species responded differently, we recommend that management at local level should take into account the conservation value at a regional level of the protected area for each of the selected species. © 2010 British Trust for Ornithology.},

abstract={This study compared the bird assemblages of native semi-natural woodlands and non-native Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) plantations in Ireland to identify what vegetation variables most influenced birds and to identify management targets in plantations to maximise future bird conservation. Point counts were conducted in 10 Oak (Quercus spp.) and 10 Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) native woodlands and in five Mid-rotation (20-30 years old) and five Mature (30-50 years old) Sitka spruce plantations. Ordination was used to characterise woodland types according to their constituent bird species. Total bird density (calculated using Distance software) and species richness were assessed for the different woodland types. Oak and Ash woodland bird assemblages were separated from Mid-rotation and Mature plantations by the ordination. There was no difference in total bird density between any of the woodland types. Oak woodlands had significantly higher species richness than either Mid-rotation or Mature Sitka spruce plantations. Ash had higher species richness than Mature Sitka spruce plantations. Understorey vegetation was negatively associated with total bird density, which also varied with survey year. Understorey vegetation was positively associated with species richness. Reasons for the relationships between vegetation and bird assemblages are discussed. Management should seek to increase shrub and understorey vegetation in the Mid-rotation phase to improve the contribution of plantations to bird conservation. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Agricultural intensification in Europe has affected farmland bird populations negatively, both during summer and winter. Although the migratory period poses separate challenges on birds than breeding and wintering, the consequences of farming practices for birds during migration remain poorly investigated. We monitored abundance and species richness of migratory birds in autumn at matched pairs of organic and conventional farms situated either in intensively farmed open plains (homogeneous landscapes) or in small-scale farming landscapes (heterogeneous landscapes) in southern Sweden. Total bird density did not differ between landscape types but was marginally higher on organic compared to conventional farms. When including taxonomic status in the model (passerines vs non-passerines), we found significantly more birds on organic farms, and more non-passerines in the homogeneous landscapes. The effect of farming practice and landscape type on density differed between functional groups. Omnivore density was higher in the homogeneous landscapes, and invertebrate feeders were marginally more abundant on organic farms. The effects of farming practice on the overall species richness and on the density of granivorous birds were landscape dependent. In the homogeneous landscapes, organic farms held a higher number of species and density of granivorous birds than conventional farms, but there was no such difference in the heterogeneous landscapes. Thus, organic farming can enhance abundance and species richness of farmland birds during migration, but the effect differs between landscape types and species. The effectiveness of organic farming was highest in the homogeneous landscape making it important to promote organic farming there. However, for some species during migration, increased heterogeneity in homogeneous landscapes may have negative effects. We propose that migratory bird diversity in homogeneous landscapes may be best preserved by keeping the landscape open, but that a reduced agricultural intensity, such as organic farming, should be encouraged. © 2009 The Authors.},

abstract={Salinas systems are artificial wetlands which are interesting from the viewpoint of nature conservation. They play an important role both as habitats for migratory waterbird species and as nodes of biotic connectivity networks. In the Mediterranean basin, where the coastal salinas are highly significant as alternative and complementary habitats for waterbirds, a process of abandonment occurs, and many seminatural systems of this kind are disappearing. This abandonment is having serious consequences for migratory bird populations and for the ecological role these play. In the present paper, this group of waterbird species has been used to evaluate these wetlands for conservation purposes. We have developed a methodological approach for the selection of ecological indicators for the conservation and management of these Mediterranean habitats and waterbird assemblages, the main consumers therein. The stepwise procedure developed constitutes a practical tool for this task. Application thereof enabled us to differentiate the habitats available for the waterbirds and to identify the biotic and abiotic indicators for the maintenance and management of the salina ecosystems. These variables can then be incorporated into monitoring programs. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Species distributions are determined by complex interplays between multi-scale factors. Conservation management, however, often occurs at a single scale of the site level. This is true for bird communities of restored savannas and mixed woodlands in the central U.S. In this region, many historic open-canopy oak savanna habitats have become closed canopy mixed woodlands due to loss of landscape-scale disturbance from fire and grazing. Site-level management efforts return some mixed woodland habitats back to savanna through fire and mechanical thinning. Savanna and woodland historically formed complex mosaic landscapes at the ecotone between prairies and Eastern deciduous forests and now exist within landscapes that vary in amount of open (e.g., perennial grassland and row crop agriculture) and woodland habitat. To understand the interplay between site and landscape level factors in savanna restoration, we sampled the breeding bird community in four combinations of site and landscape: restored savanna in open landscapes, restored savanna in woodland landscapes, and closed canopy woodland in both landscapes. We found that the outcome of site-level savanna restoration depended on the surrounding landscape. Compared to other treatment types, restored savannas in open landscapes supported a distinctive bird community characterized by high species richness, bird abundance, and percent of ground feeders, shrub nesters, and edge species. Both savanna and woodland sites in the open landscape had a higher percent of species of conservation concern, while at both site and landscape levels, woodland was associated with a higher percent of area sensitive species and habitat specialists. Our results suggest savanna restoration efforts should focus on sites that exist either in open country or on edges where closed canopy forest meets open country. This strategy would combine site and landscape level benefits of savanna restoration for avian diversity, while also preserving the conservation benefits of large tracts of intact forest. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Conservation of threatened and endangered species requires maintenance of critical habitat. The red-cockaded woodpecker Picoides borealis (RCW) is a threatened bird species, endemic to the mixed conifer forests of the southeastern United States. RCW nests and forages preferentially in mature longleaf pine Pinus palustris, but also uses mature loblolly pine Pinus taeda and shortleaf pine Pinus echinata forests. In the last century, the extent of mature pine forests has been greatly reduced by logging. The RCW, in contrast to other woodpeckers, excavates nest cavities in living trees and senescence symptoms (year round leaf chlorosis and leaf mortality) have been observed in mature pine stands across the southeast. Widespread mortality of the mature pine forests would threaten the long-term survival of the RCW. We used airborne hyperspectral data across a portion of Ft. Benning Military Installation, Georgia, U.S.A., to determine if senescent trees can be identified and mapped and assess the likely persistence of mature pines in the RCW habitat. Univariate analysis of variance showed good separation between asymptomatic, senesced and dead physiological conditions with asymptomatic trees having significantly higher reflectance for all bands in the wavelength range between 0.719 and 1.1676 μm, senescent trees having significantly lower reflectance for bands in the range between 1.1927 and 1.3122 μm, and dead trees having significantly higher reflectance for bands in the range between 1.8151 and 1.9471 μm. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models achieved correct classification rates and kappa statistics above 70%. CART models selected information from wavelength regions similar to those identified from the ANOVA, which likely explains their performance. Our aggregated CART model of tree senescence estimated that 141.4 ha (3%) of the study area is affected. RCW nests occurred in areas with significantly higher tree cover, and trees within foraging and home ranges did not have significantly more senescence than areas without RCW. These results indicate that although tree senescence is widespread, mortality is yet to significantly affect RCW habitat. Results and analysis of critical habitat similar to those exemplified in this study can extend our knowledge about the stressors of these important and imperiled components of biodiversity. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Communities of purple moor-grass meadows are generally decreasing. Many important problems of classification and phytogeography are connected with them. The main goal of the present study was to evaluate changes in species diversity that took place after mowing of Molinion meadows in Kampinoski National Park was discontinued from 1993 to 2006. Selected Molinion meadows in the park were evaluated in terms of their biological diversity. The data collected represented meadows that were still maintained, as well as meadows that had been abandoned at different times in the past. Biodiversity was evaluated using standard ecological indices and Disturbance Index (Z). In general, the Disturbance Index showed an increase in plant community forms that were abandoned or invaded by alien species. An association that was most like the typical form was seen in well maintained meadows, which suggests that the Disturbance Index continually rises with time after a meadow is abandoned. Ecological strategies and mowing tolerance were determined with the help of the BIOLFLOR database. Numerical classification revealed a highly diverse pattern of variability in the meadows examined. Correlations between ecological indicators and phytocenotic variability in Molinion meadows were also evaluated. Unmanaged meadows were compared to meadows in which meadow conservation management practices were carried out.},

abstract={There is an intense debate about the effects of postfire salvage logging versus nonintervention policies on regeneration of forest communities, but scant information from experimental studies is available. We manipulated a burned forest area on a Mediterranean mountain to experimentally analyze the effect of salvage logging on bird-species abundance, diversity, and assemblage composition. We used a randomized block design with three plots of approximately 25 ha each, established along an elevational gradient in a recently burned area in Sierra Nevada Natural and National Park (southeastern Spain). Three replicates of three treatments differing in postfire burned wood management were established per plot: salvage logging, nonintervention, and an intermediate degree of intervention (felling and lopping most of the trees but leaving all the biomass). Starting 1 year after the fire, we used point sampling to monitor bird abundance in each treatment for 2 consecutive years during the breeding and winter seasons (720 censuses total). Postfire burned-wood management altered species assemblages. Salvage logged areas had species typical of openand early-successional habitats. Bird species that inhabit forests were still present in the unsalvaged treatments even though trees were burned, but were almost absent in salvage-logged areas. Indeed, the main dispersers of midand late-successional shrubs and trees, such as thrushes (Turdus spp.) and the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius) were almost restricted to unsalvaged treatments. Salvage logging might thus hamper the natural regeneration of the forest through its impact on assemblages of bird species. Moreover, salvage logging reduced species abundance by 50% and richness by 40%, approximately. The highest diversity at the landscape level (gamma diversity) resulted from a combination of all treatments. Salvage logging may be positive for bird conservation if combined in a mosaic with other, less-aggressive postfire management, but stand-wide management with harvest operations has undesirable conservation effects. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Over the past half century, grassland birds in Europe have declined dramatically and in order to maintain and restore their populations it is critical to understand how habitat structures and quality within pastures affect birds. This study investigated the effects of habitat structure and pasture abandonment on grassland birds in IBA Ponor, western Bulgaria. Birds were sampled using the point count method at 143 randomly located circular plots and a total of 1,401 observations of birds from 31 species were recorded. The results showed that habitat complexity, management and landscape position influenced bird community structure and species occurrence within the upland pastures. Extensively grazed pastures supported higher structural complexity of vegetation cover and higher bird-species richness and diversity compared with abandoned ones. Moreover, bird species with a preference for grazed rather than abandoned pastures had higher conservation status and most were associated with shrub cover. To maintain high levels of avian diversity, habitat complexity within pastures should be maintained through extensive grazing, to ensure availability of scrub vegetation wherever possible. Finally, this study provided evidence that agri-environmental schemes should not be directly extrapolated from one country or region to another without been tested first, because within the same management, differences in habitat structural characteristics may exist due to the landscape and socio-economic characteristics of the region.

In 2007, the bird species composition was assessed using the point count method in three types of habitat: windthrow left undisturbed for natural regeneration, managed windthrow (all fallen trees removed), and intact forest (undisturbed by the windstorm, used as the control). In total, 2,365 individual birds of 70 species were recorded in the three analyzed habitats. The mean number of individuals per point and species per point was significantly higher in the natural windthrow than in the two other habitats. The diversity of the bird community was higher in the natural and managed windthrow, as compared to the control. The bird community of the control was significantly more similar to that of the natural windthrow than to the one in the managed windthrow. These results lead to a conclusion that the bird community was affected more by the clearing and artificial replanting following the windthrow than by the windthrow itself. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Bird-habitat stations were distributed in broom shrublands from a few months to 51 years after fire, at 1400-2100 m a.s.l. Overall, shrub cover was the main habitat variable affecting the bird community composition. The abundance trends of bird species for half a century after fire were varied, but population recovery seemed slower (especially in the Dartford warbler Sylvia undata) than it had been reported at a lower altitude. Three species of European conservation concern (. Alauda arvensis, Lullula arborea and Lanius collurio) showed abundance peaks at 10-19 years after fire. This time interval showed the highest species richness, abundance and conservation value, whereas shrub cover continued to increase afterwards. The bird assemblage tended to impoverish with increasing fire severity in the first year after a fire. Our results emphasize: (1) the slow recovery of bird community of burnt mountain shrublands; (2) the need for long-term biodiversity assessments to help improve planning of fire intervals at different altitudes; (3) the relevance of reducing fire severity due to its impact on fauna. © 2009 The Authors.

abstract={With recent emphasis on sustainable agriculture, conservation of native biota within agricultural systems has become a priority. Remnant trees have been hypothesized to increase biological diversity in agro-ecosystems. We investigated how remnant Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) trees contribute to conserving bird diversity in the agro-ecosystem of the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. We compared bird use of isolated oak trees in three landscape contexts - croplands, pastures, and oak savanna reserves - and ranked the relative importance of four factors thought to influence bird use of individual trees: (i) tree architecture; (ii) tree isolation; (iii) tree cover in the surrounding landscape; and (iv) landscape context, defined as the surrounding land use. We evaluated species-specific responses and four community-level responses: (i) total species richness; (ii) richness of oak savanna-associates; (iii) tree forager richness; and (iv) aerial and ground forager richness. We documented 47 species using remnant oaks, including 16 species typically occurring in oak savanna. Surprisingly, landscape context was unimportant in predicting frequency of use of individual trees. Tree architecture, in particular tree size, and tree cover in the surrounding landscape were the best predictors of bird use of remnant trees. Our findings demonstrate that individual remnant trees contribute to landscape-level conservation of bird diversity, acting as keystone habitat structures by providing critical resources for species that could not persist in otherwise treeless agricultural fields. Because remnant trees are rarely retained in contemporary agricultural landscapes in the United States, retention of existing trees and recruitment of replacement trees will contribute to regional conservation goals. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Predation pressure on vulnerable bird species has made predator control an important issue for international nature conservation. Predator removal by culling or translocation is controversial, expensive, and time-consuming, and results are often temporary. Thus, it is important to assess its effectiveness from all available evidence. We used explicit systematic review methodology to determine the impact of predator removal on four measurable responses in birds: breeding performance (hatching success and fledging success) and population size (breeding and postbreeding). We used meta-analysis to summarize results from 83 predator removal studies from six continents. We also investigated whether characteristics of the prey, predator species, location, and study methodology explained heterogeneity in effect sizes. Removing predators increased hatching success, fledging success, and breeding populations. Removing all predator species achieved a significantly larger increase in breeding population than removing only a subset. Postbreeding population size was not improved on islands, or overall, but did increase on mainlands. Heterogeneity in effect sizes for the four population parameters was not explained by whether predators were native or introduced; prey were declining, migratory, or game species; or by the study methodology. Effect sizes for fledging success were smaller for ground-nesting birds than those that nest elsewhere, but the difference was not significant. We conclude that current evidence indicates that predator removal is an effective strategy for the conservation of vulnerable bird populations. Nevertheless, the ethical and practical problems associated with predator removal may lead managers to favor alternative, nonlethal solutions. Research is needed to provide and synthesize data to determine whether these are effective management practices for future policies on bird conservation. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to model the trade-offs between ecological and productive performance of a grassland agroecosystem. We developed a dynamic model linking grass dynamics controlled by livestock grazing to stochastic population dynamics of two wader bird species with high conservation value. Bird dynamics were driven by both direct and indirect effects of grazing. Viable control framework was used to predict grazing strategies ensuring production and conservation and to generate the whole trade-off curve between ecological and productive performance. Bird population size was used as an indicator of ecological performance and the total number of grazing days defined productive performance. Model results show that conciliating ecological and productive performance implies a temporal shift in grazing sequences. The best ecological performance was obtained at intermediate levels of productive performance. Without grazing or with too low a grazing intensity, it was not possible to maintain any of the bird populations due to the indirect effects of grazing on habitat quality. However, too high a level of grazing implied fast population decline for both populations due to direct negative effects of grazing on nest survival. Field data on current grazing regimes and grass height showed a low proportion of suitable fields in our case study area. This result indicates an antagonism between direct and indirect effects of grazing on wader birds, implying the need of very specific management of grassland. Our results illustrate the fact that European grasslands are anthropic habitats which are highly dependent on human activity. In such habitats, trade-off curves are not expected to be strictly decreasing or increasing. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Climate and land-use changes are expected to cause many species to shift into or beyond the boundaries of protected areas, leading to large turnover in species composition. Here, we tested whether long-established protected areas in Canada were more robust to such climate change impacts than areas with no formal protection by measuring changes in modeled butterfly species distributions (n = 139) within them. We used a recently established distribution modeling technique, Maxent, to model butterfly species' distributions in two epochs (1900-1930 and 1960-1990). We compared rates of butterfly species richness and composition change within protected areas against distributions of randomly selected, ecologically similar, but non-protected, areas. Change in species richness and composition within protected areas were, for the most part, the same as changes observed among random areas outside protected area boundaries. These results suggest that existing protected area networks in Canada have provided little buffer against the impacts of climate change on butterfly species richness, possibly because land-use change surrounding long-standing protected areas has not been substantial enough to elevate the habitat protection afforded by these protected areas relative to other areas. Although protected areas are unarguably beneficial in conserving biological diversity, their capacity to maintain habitat appears insufficient to prevent broader-scale climate changes from sweeping species beyond their boundaries. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Lowland riparian vegetation in the southwestern United States is critically important for maintaining a high richness and density of breeding birds. Further investigation is needed within riparian corridors, however, to evaluate the relative importance of vegetation type and hydrologic regime for avian density and nest survival as targets for regional conservation or restoration efforts. We estimated the densities of 40 bird species and for species grouped on the basis of nest height and dependence on surface water in gallery cottonwoodwillow (Populus spp.Salix spp.) forests, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) shrub lands, and terrace vegetation types along a gradient in the hydrologic regime of the San Pedro River, Arizona, USA. We also assessed nest survival for shrub-nesting insectivores and herbivores. Canopy-nesting birds as a group and 14 individual bird species reached their greatest densities in cottonwood forests regardless of the hydrologic regime. Water-dependent birds as a group reached their highest density in both intermittent- and perennial-flow cottonwood stands, but certain species occurred almost exclusively in perennial-flow sites. Two shrub-nesting species and the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were most abundant in saltcedar shrub lands, and the brown-headed cowbird was most abundant in saltcedar stands with intermittent flows. Mesquite (Prosopis spp.) and big sacaton (Sporobolus wrightii) grassland each maintained the highest densities of certain species within ≥1 hydrologic regime. Shrub-nesting insectivores had the greatest nest survival in cottonwood, including Arizona Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii arizonae), and also had lower proportions of nests parasitized and preyed upon, although 95 confidence intervals among vegetation types overlapped. Nest survival for both shrub-nesting insectivores and herbivores was lowest in intermittent-flow saltcedar, although, again, confidence intervals overlapped. Nest survival was lower in parasitized than nonparasitized nests in mesquite and across vegetation types for Arizona Bell's vireo and in cottonwood for Abert's towhee (Pipilo aberti). Riparian management that maintains heterogeneous riparian vegetation types, including floodplain vegetation comprising cottonwoodwillow gallery riparian forests with some stretches of perennial flow, are important for maintaining the high diversity and abundance of breeding birds on the San Pedro River and probably across the region. Cottonwood stands also appear to maintain highest nest survival for some shrub-nesting birds. © The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Staging areas and migratory stopovers of wetland birds have the potential to function as geographic bottlenecks; entire populations within a flyway may be affected by the quality and quantity of available wetland habitat at stopover sites. Although approximately 90 of playa wetlands in the Rainwater Basin (RWB) region of south-central Nebraska, USA, have been destroyed, the area still provides essential stopover habitat for >10 million waterfowl each spring. We evaluated community patterns and species associations to assess importance of assembly rules in structuring wetland bird communities during migration and to better facilitate multispecies conservation and management strategies. We surveyed 3640 playas twice weekly in the RWB and observed approximately 2.6 million individual migratory wetland birds representing 72 species during 3 spring migrations 20022004. We evaluated spatial and temporal species co-occurrence patterns of geese, dabbling ducks, diving ducks, and shorebirds using null model analysis. Goose species co-occurrence scores did not differ from random in any year of the study, suggesting that goose species frequently use the same habitats during migration. Co-occurrence patterns among dabbling ducks were not different than expected by chance in any year; however, when we evaluated co-occurrence at a weekly scale, dabbling ducks co-occurred less often than expected during weeks of peak migration (high abundance), indicating that dabbling duck species spatially segregated at high densities. Diving duck co-occurrence patterns did not differ from random in any year, suggesting that diving duck species used the same habitats during migration. Shorebird species co-occurred less often than expected in 2002 and 2004, and during weeks of high shorebird abundance, indicating that shorebird communities were distinctly structured during those times. Most association values among lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens) and dabbling duck species were positive, indicating dabbling ducks did not avoid wetlands with snow geese, a concern for waterfowl managers. However, we frequently observed snow geese and dabbling ducks using different microhabitats within a wetland, which indicate species associations and co-occurrence patterns may have occurred at a finer spatial scale than we measured. This approach of co-occurrence analysis will allow wildlife managers charged with multispecies management at migration stopover sites to make informed conservation and management decisions based on community structure rather than historic single-species approaches. © The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Invasive alien plants constitute a major threat to local biodiversity. Moreover, their appearance often coincides with land use change. Many endangered groups of organisms suffer from habitat loss, which is often a consequence of the invasion of alien plants. This paper examines how invasive alien goldenrods Solidago spp. affect the richness of endangered grassland bird species and numbers of breeding pairs in abandoned meadows in southern Poland. Meadows invaded by goldenrods (n = 15) had lower bird species richness and a lower number of breeding pairs than meadows in which goldenrods were absent (n = 15). Two important factors positively influencing bird species richness were meadow area and shrub density (the latter only in meadows without goldenrods). Moreover, both the index of potential food density (number of butterflies) and plant species richness were much lower in meadows invaded by goldenrods than in meadows without these plants. Urgent action aimed at preventing the invasion of alien goldenrods in abandoned meadows is needed and such measures should involve regular mowing. Our results also highlight the fact that land abandonment in Central and Eastern Europe is not necessarily as beneficial for biodiversity as it is commonly believed and it may even lead to a decrease in the populations of several bird species in the agricultural landscape. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Summary: Large scale ecological restoration in a highly heterogeneous and species-rich landscape requires big commitment to fine scale planning. In the southwest of Western Australia, in the Fitz-Stirling area of Gondwana Link, the Peniup Restoration project aimed to improve on such works. A multi-faceted approach was employed to re-establish a self-replicating biologically diverse plant system, ecologically informed in its design and consistent with the heterogeneous mosaic of plant associations found in the surrounding landscape. Outcomes from the project included a 950-ha restoration map composed of nine newly developed soil landscape/vegetation associations. A new 6 m wide direct seeding machine was developed to improve delivery and spatial configuration of establishing plants. These two developments were put to the test in 2008 through a 250 ha biodiverse carbon-funded restoration effort.

The relationship between bird abundance and vegetative characteristics might be an important consideration in the development of management and restoration plans Of the 49 bird species we observed, we examined 13 and 16 species in detail for winter and summer seasons, respectively. A noticeable shift in species composition occurred between 3% and 10% woody plant cover. During winter, Chestnut-collared Longspurs (Calcarius ornatus) and Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris) showed significant positive relationships with grass cover and negative relationships with woody plant cover, occurring in greatest numbers where woody cover was < 1% The richness of sparrow species during winter was highest among sites with 6% to 15% woody plant cover In addition to showing significant positive relationships with woody cover, Vesper Sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus), Black-throated Sparrows (Amphispiza bilineata), Brewer's Sparrows (Spizella breweri), and Chipping Sparrows (S. passerina) showed significant positive relationships with shrub species richness Our results showed that reductions of woody plant cover below 3% in combination with the presence of native grasses could substantially enhance the presence of several bird species. Maintenance of woody cover between 6% and 15% could increase use by a suite of other species, especially wintering sparrows. © 2010.},

abstract={We employed a multi-scale approach to examine the evolving spatial patterns of avian diversity following rewatering (19911999) of the Owens River Gorge in eastern California. We based our analysis on three independent data sets representing 18 canyon locations (4 reference and 14 rewatered) consisting of bird counts, measures of landscape variation (canyon dimensions), and vegetation structure and composition (foliage height diversity, total vegetation volume, and plant species diversity). We analyzed our data by grouping sites according to bird diversity and environmental factors using Sørenson's similarity index and cluster analysis and by employing correlation (Spearman rank) and regression (multiple and backward stepwise) procedures to determine the relative importance of environmental factors on avian diversity at different spatial scales. Our results revealed: (1) that valley bottom width determines the extent of riparian vegetation (rs = .73, P < 0.01) and, indirectly, bird species diversity (rs = .52, P < 0.05) at the landscape scale; and (2) that avian diversity at the habitat scale is most strongly correlated with plant species diversity (rs = .57, P < 0.05). These results indicate avian diversity is responding to habitat restoration resulting from the rewatering of the Owens River Gorge but is spatially constrained by canyon dimensions that limit the area of riparian habitat and, indirectly, plant species diversity. We suggest future evaluations of stream restoration and its role on animal communities consider the merits of a multi-scale analysis.},

abstract={Intensive management of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) plantations has led to a population increase and breeding range expansion of the endangered Kirtland's Warbler (Dedroica kirtlandii Baird). However, no study has quantified the different bird communities that are associated with Kirtland's Warbler habitat management. We examined bird species conservation scenarios of warbler habitat management by addressing the following: (1) how do bird community structure and conservation scenarios differ among jack pine habitats of three discrete age classes (YOUNG, < 5 years; KW, 523 years; and OLD, > 23 years)?; (2) what functional groups (e.g., nest placement groups, foraging groups) of bird species are represented among these three habitat types?; and (3) what are the relationships between bird communities and the composition and structure of these habitat types? Sixty bird species were observed in 37 habitat patches across the three habitat types. Conservation metrics based upon the pooled species lists for each of the habitat types indicated no difference (P > 0.05) among them. Five bird species of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Conservation Priority were found among the habitat types, with all but Kirtland's Warbler most common in the YOUNG habitat. Five indicator species associated with the YOUNG and KW habitat types were observed, while nine species were associated with the OLD habitat. A functional group analysis indicated that stand structure was important for breeding species across habitat types. We believe our results support increased ecologically-based planning and management across jack pine habitats for more than just Kirtland's Warbler.},

abstract={Natural area managers in regions of the semi-arid west, particularly on the Colorado Plateau, are presently dealing with expanding pinyon (Pinus spp. Engelm.) juniper (Juniperus spp. Engelm.) woodlands on rangelands. Increased equipment costs associated with 'chaining', and dangers associated with prescribed fires, have resulted in more instances where mechanical thinning of woodlands is being used. Our 2005 to 2006 study within Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, Utah, examined responses of breeding birds to the mechanical reduction of pinyon-juniper woodlands within a randomized 4-block design that incorporated 11 control and nine treatment bird count stations. We surveyed birds within 3.1-ha bird-count stations (n = 20) prior to, and following, pinyon-juniper mechanical reduction treatments. Thinning in April 2006 removed a mean of 92% (+ 6.4% SE) of live trees from treatment blocks. The avian guild most greatly influenced by mechanical thinning included pinyon-juniper obligate species. Species eliminated following mechanical thinning were Gray Vireo (Vireo vicinior) and Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), while Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerine) numbers were significantly reduced. Birds in the shrub-nesting guild, including the sagebrush specialist Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri), and habitat generalists such as the Bushtit (Psaltriparius minimus), increased in relative abundance following treatment. We conclude that mechanical thinning within the Intermountain West has the potential for natural area managers to design treatments that can influence numbers of both pinyon-juniper and sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) steppe avian species.},

abstract={Sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) communities are a unique component of grassland bird habitat in eastern New Mexico and have been impacted by human activities for decades. These communities are frequently managed with livestock grazing and herbicide application for shrub control, strategies that potentially can be used to restore the historical shrub-grass composition of this plant community. During spring migration and the breeding seasons of 2004 and 2005, we compared density and community structure of grassland bird species among four combinations of tebuthiuron application and grazing treatments that were being evaluated for restoration of shinnery oak communities. We performed biweekly point transects on sixteen 65-ha study plots in these communities. Density of all avian species combined did not differ between grazed and ungrazed plots. Tebuthiuron-treated plots had a 40% higher average density for combined species than untreated plots. There was a 41% higher average density of all species during spring 2005 than 2004, but density was similar during the breeding season of both years. These trends were predominantly influenced by densities of migratory Cassin's Sparrow (Aimophila cassinii), which were greater in tebuthiuron-treated plots in both years. Densities of resident Meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) exhibited little response to tebuthiuron or grazing treatments. Avian species richness, evenness, and diversity were only minimally affected by the tebuthiuron and grazing treatments. This study occurred over a period of highly variable precipitation, so future assessments, spanning longer wet-dry cycles and maturing plant communities, may be necessary to completely determine avian response to these restoration efforts. © 2008 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract={Global conventions on biological diversity force governments to develop region-wide conservation strategies. Such strategies are difficult to design for all taxa because little is known about the important spatial scales. Here we applied additive partitioning of the diversity of saproxylic beetles in Bavarian forests in Southern Germany using a nested hierarchical design of five increasingly broader spatial levels: trap, strata, forest stand, forest site, and ecoregion. We consistently found a significantly higher percentage than expected by chance of between ecoregion diversity and significantly lower α diversity within traps. A significant proportion of β diversity was also found between stands. Analysis of species represented by <0.005% of all specimens in our samples and of species classified as threatened revealed similar results. Critical spatial scales for threatened species encompassed the critical levels of common species. Within habitat substratum guilds, the proportion of β diversity increased from species associated with fresh wood to those associated with rotten wood to those associated with fungi. Our results suggest that the most effective way to ensure saproxylic beetle diversity in a state-wide strategy is to add new conservation sites within different ecoregions and to establish new conservation areas in additional forest stands, rather than to enlarge reserves. Our findings further suggest that monitoring of saproxylic beetle diversity on a broader scale in European temperate forests can be restricted to "monitoring species", i.e. a subgroup of families easy to identify, and that canopy sampling can be neglected without a substantial loss of information. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={I used a randomized, replicated, controlled study design to test the hypothesis that nest-site availability limits breeding densities of secondary cavity nesting species in even-age southern pine (Pinus spp.) forests. Breeding densities of secondary cavity nesters increased significantly on treated plots after nest boxes were introduced. Total number of nesting attempts also increased several fold post-treatment. These data indicate nest-site availability was a limiting factor for breeding densities of secondary cavity nesting species. The response of individual species to nest boxes ranged from moderately high (Great Crested Flycatcher "Myiarchus crinitus"), to low (Tufted Titmouse "Baeolophus bicolor", Eastern Bluebird "Sialia sialis") to no response (Carolina Wren "Thryothorus ludovicianus"). At least three factors accounted for interspecific differences in this study: different levels of reliance on cavities excavated in snags, different body sizes, and differences in local population densities. The large number of unoccupied nest boxes (only 9% were used for nesting) suggests secondary cavity nesters were not limited solely by cavity availability but also by habitat quality. Prescribed burning appeared to facilitate discovery and use of nest boxes by birds in this study, consistent with the hypothesis that nest-site limitation is mitigated by habitat structure. © 2010 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Woodpeckers (family Picidae) merit specific monitoring and management efforts, both as keystone/facilitator species and as indicators of forest condition. Recent studies indicated that species richness of woodpeckers was correlated with richness of all forest birds, thus suggesting potential exists for management practices that can address needs of woodpeckers in particular and other forest birds in general. We used data from a long-term study (1995-2008) from forest sites in the interior of British Columbia to evaluate how abundances of seven woodpecker species varied with habitat variables previously identified as associated with forest bird richness. We found that tree species richness had either a neutral or positive effect on the abundance of all woodpecker species, whereas abundances of most woodpecker species tended to be lower in stands with high densities of lodgepole pine. Abundances of most woodpecker species were positively correlated with density of beetle-killed pines. Relative to control sites, higher densities of most woodpecker species were found at harvested sites where most trembling aspen and large Douglas-fir trees had been retained. Therefore, management strategies that favour a mixture of tree species, with particular attention to retention of aspen, should safeguard populations of most woodpecker species. Abundances of individual woodpecker species were weakly but positively inter-correlated before the beetle outbreak, and less so during and post-outbreak. It thus appears that no strong trade-offs exist among woodpecker species. These results, combined with previously identified positive correlations between woodpecker and forest bird richness, indicate woodpeckers can be managed as a suite for the purpose of managing avian biodiversity as a whole.

abstract={As forests undergo succession after major disturbance events their assemblages of birds also change. Thus the frequency and extent of wildfire or clearfelling in the landscape can potentially affect the species-richness and abundance of forest birds. We used a chronosequence approach to investigate succession of bird communities in Tasmanian lowland wet eucalypt forest, from shortly after disturbance through to old-growth forest aged approximately 200-250 years. The number of native bird species recorded per survey per site increased as a linear function of stand-age. However, succession did not involve a unidirectional transition in assemblage-composition because of differences in successional responses among individual species and also among guilds of birds that mostly inhabited different strata of the forest. This was exemplified by the crescent honeyeater, which was observed most frequently in the youngest (6-8 years) and oldest (200-250 years) forests that we surveyed, and by the superb lyrebird (introduced to Tasmania from mainland south-eastern Australia) which favoured mid-aged regrowth (42-43 years) after clearfelling. Forests aged 200-250 years had the greatest richness-per-survey of those native species that were observed mostly in the lower layer or mid-layer. However, the greatest richness-per-survey of canopy-dwelling species and the highest native species-richness across the survey period were found in forests aged around 150 years. Younger regrowth was generally less rich in birds, although regrowth in the first decade after clearfelling was the only seral stage inhabited by superb fairy-wrens. These results suggest that, in the Tasmanian lowland wet eucalypt forest landscape, species-richness of birds may be greatest when old-growth forest is interspersed with young regrowth forests. Hence for bird conservation, a challenge is to ensure that old-growth forest continues to prevail in the production forest landscape. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Partners in Flight North American Landbird Conservation Plan provided estimates of population sizes for 448 landbird species using a multiplicative model. Input parameters in this calculation included the area of state × Bird Conservation Region polygons, area-specific mean Breeding Bird Survey counts circa 1995, and adjustment factors for the distance over which species may presumably be correctly counted, the assumed pairing of singing males with non-singing females, and variability in the propensity of birds to sing over the course of the survey day. I assessed the sensitivity of this population calculation to changes in the input parameters. I assessed both local and global sensitivity of the model to changes in the parameters with Monte Carlo one-at-a-time simulations and the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST). Monte Carlo simulations were an estimate of local model sensitivity whereas FAST estimated global model sensitivity, accommodating the potential shared variance between model parameters. Monte Carlo simulations suggested population estimates were 39% more sensitive to changes in the detection distance adjustment than to the other parameters; the other parameters were nearly equal in their contribution to model sensitivity. Conversely, FAST analysis determined that each of the input variables aside from the pair adjustment provided roughly equal contributions to variability in population estimates. The most efficient means for improving continental population estimates for birds surveyed by the Breeding Bird Survey will be through increased scrutiny of the species-specific distance detection and time-of-day adjustments and improved understanding in the spatial and temporal variability in the mean Breeding Bird Survey count.},

abstract={Staging areas and migratory stopovers of wetland birds can function as geographic bottlenecks; common dependence among migratory wetland bird species on these sites has major implications for wetland conservation. Although 90 of playa wetlands in the Rainwater Basin (RWB) region of Nebraska, USA, have been destroyed, the area still provides essential stopover habitat for up to 10 million waterfowl each spring. Our objectives were to determine local (within wetland and immediate watershed) and landscape-scale factors influencing wetland bird abundance and species richness during spring migration at RWB playas. We surveyed 3640 playas twice weekly in the RWB and observed approximately 1.6 million individual migratory wetland birds representing 72 species during spring migrations 2002-2004. We tested a priori hypotheses about whether local and landscape variables influenced overall species richness and abundance of geese, dabbling ducks, diving ducks, and shorebirds. Wetland area had a positive influence on goose abundance in all years, whereas percent emergent vegetation and hunting pressure had negative influences. Models predicting dabbling duck abundance differed among years; however, individual wetland area and area of semipermanent wetlands within 10 km of the study wetland consistently had a positive influence on dabbling duck abundance. Percent emergent vegetation also was a positive predictor of dabbling duck abundance in all years, indicating that wetlands with intermediate (50) vegetation coverage have the greatest dabbling duck abundance. Shorebird abundance was positively influenced by wetland area and number of wetlands within 10 km and negatively influenced by water depth. Wetland area, water depth, and area of wetlands within 10 km were all equally important in models predicting overall species richness. Total species richness was positively influenced by wetland area and negatively influenced by water depth and area of semipermanent wetlands within 10 km. Avian species richness also was greatest in wetlands with intermediate vegetation coverage. Restoring playa hydrology should promote intermediate percent cover of emergent vegetation, which will increase use by dabbling ducks and shorebirds, and decrease snow goose (Chen caerulescens) use of these wetlands. We observed a reduction in dabbling duck abundance on wetlands open to spring snow goose hunting and recommend further investigation of the effects of this conservation order on nontarget species. Our results indicate that wildlife managers at migration stopover areas should conserve wetlands in complexes to meet the continuing and future habitat requirements of migratory birds, especially dabbling ducks, during spring migration. © 2010 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Fire is a frequent event in Mediterranean ecosystems, yet the effects on animal diversity are poorly understood. In this paper, the short-term effects of a severe fire on the tenebrionid beetles in a planted pinewood in Central Italy are investigated in comparison with those recorded in other animal communities, namely collembolans, isopods and birds. The use of statistical tests to compare values of dominance, diversity and equitability (measured with various indexes), between burned and unburned habitats, as well as the use of two major niche-based species abundance models (the geometric series and the MacArthur broken stick model), revealed a strong decrease in diversity and evenness in all investigated animal groups, including birds, for which previous research suggested minor effects. In particular, tenebrionids are proved to be particularly indicative of habitat transformations determined by fire, showing important changes in community structure, from that characteristic of woodlands to that of open habitats. Because most of the original vegetation of Mediterranean woodlands has been removed by the continued influence of man, mature pinewoods, even if artificial, represent an important surrogate habitat for most species of tenebrionids (and likely other animals of conservation concern, such as bird species), and their preservation from catastrophic fires is of paramount importance. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

Examples of this approach demonstrate how to expand the currently accepted Convention on Biological Diversity definition, based on the "variability" of genes, species and ecosystems, since the numerical expression of the indices allows the probability of difference between biodiversity quality trends and values over time, and between sites or taxonomic groups, to be assessed for statistical inference of difference or similarity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Forest management practices conducted primarily at the stand scale result in simplified forests with regeneration problems and low structural and biological diversity. Landscape models have been used to help design management strategies to address these problems. However, there remains a great deal of uncertainty that the actual management practices result in the desired sustainable landscape structure. To investigate our ability to meet sustainable forest management goals across scales, we assessed how two models of forest dynamics, a scaled-up individual-tree model and a landscape model, simulate forest dynamics under three types of harvesting regimes: clearcut, gap, and uniform thinning. Althougth 50- 100 year forecasts predicted average successional patterns that differed by less than 20% between models, understory dynamics of the landscape model were simplified relative to the scaled-up tree model, whereas successional patterns of the scaled-up tree model deviated from empirical studies on the driest and wettest landtypes. The scale dependencies of both models revealed important weaknesses when the models were used alone; however, when used together, they could provide a heuristic method that could improve our ability to design sustainable forest management practices.},

abstract={The golden-headed lion tamarin Leontopithecus chrysomelas occurs in the Atlantic forest of southern Bahia, Brazil, where shade-cocoa agroforestry (known as cabruca) predominates. The economic decline of the cocoa industry has caused many landowners to convert cabruca into cattle pasture or diversify their plantations with other crops. These and prior anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat fragmentation are threatening lion tamarin persistence. For some lion tamarin groups, cabruca comprises a large part of their home range. Considering these factors, the maintenance of the biological diversity in cabruca favorable to golden-headed lion tamarins is of considerable interest to their long-term survival. Here we identify plant species that provide food and sleeping sites for the lion tamarins and examine their occurrence in cabruca plantations, in order to investigate alternatives for conservation management practices that benefit both lion tamarins and cabruca. We determined the total number of trees and the frequency of individuals and species used for food and sleeping sites by lion tamarins in Una Biological Reserve, Bahia, from 1998 to 2006. We used this information to compare the richness and frequency of use across habitats (cabruca, mature and secondary) and to create a ranking index considering various components of a tree species' utility to the lion tamarins. Lion tamarins used 155 tree species, 93 for food and 93 for sleeping sites. Fifty-five species were ranked as 'Extremely Valuable,' eight as 'Valuable' and 92 as 'Of Interest.' Of 48 families, Myrtaceae and Sapotaceae were used the most. Cabruca contained fewer individual trees used by lion tamarins, but the highest frequency of use per tree compared with other habitats, indicating the large influence of single trees in these plantations. Using the key tree species identified in our study in the management of cabruca would be of considerable benefit to the long-term survival of lion tamarins. © 2009 The Authors.

abstract={Bonelli's Eagle Aquila fasciata is one of the rarest birds of prey in Europe, where it has suffered a significant decline in recent decades. We present information on the home-ranges and spatial parameters of 18 Bonelli's Eagles radiotracked in 2002-2006 in Catalonia (northeast Spain) and describe the home-range probability kernel, distances moved, breeding area eccentricity, territorial overlap, nearest neighbour distance and breeding site fidelity, and assess the influence of sex, breeding status, season and geographical area on these parameters. Median home-range according to the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and 95% kernel were 50.3 and 36.1 km2, respectively. The median breeding area eccentricity was 1477 m. There was considerable overlap in the home-range of both sexes within pairs (MCP: 71.4% and 95% kernel: 98.5%), indicating close pair bonding and similar foraging patterns. Overlap in home-ranges of up to 15% between neighbouring individuals also occurred and was positively related to breeding pair density. There was no difference in spatial parameters between sexes or with breeding status, but during the non-breeding season Eagles had larger home-ranges and stayed further from nests. The high consistency across birds suggests a pattern of spatial use that is characteristic of this species. The high level of use of breeding areas and their surroundings (50% kernel) throughout the year makes it important that these areas be protected from human disturbance. Additionally, it is necessary that heavily used areas away from nesting sites, which are used for foraging and roosting, are identified, protected and managed in a sustainable fashion. © 2009 British Ornithologists' Union.},

abstract={We used microsatellites to assess ongoing captive breeding and reintroduction programs of the lesser kestrel. The extent of genetic variation within the captive populations analysed did not differ significantly from that reported in wild populations. Thus, the application of widely recommended management practices, such as the registration of crosses between individuals in proper stud books and the introduction of new individuals into the genetic pools, has proven satisfactory to maintain high levels of genetic variation. The high rates of hatching failure occasionally documented in captivity can therefore not be attributed to depressed genetic variation. Even though genetic diversity in reintroduced populations did not differ significantly when compared to wild populations either, average observed heterozygosities and inbreeding coefficients were significantly lower and higher, respectively, when compared to the captive demes where released birds came. Monitoring of reproductive parameters during single-pairing breeding and paternity inference within colonial facilities revealed large variations in breeding success between reproductive adults. The relative number of breeding pairs that contributed to a large part of captive-born birds (50-56%) was similar in both cases (28.6 and 26.9%, respectively). Thus, the chances for polygyny (rarely in this study), extra-pair paternity (not found in this study) and/or social stimulation of breeding parameters do not seem to greatly affect the genetically effective population size. Independently of breeding strategies, the release of unrelated fledglings into the same area and the promotion of immigration should be mandatory to counteract founder effects and avoid inbreeding in reintroduced populations of lesser kestrels. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract={Areas of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks in the Black Hills can provide habitat for black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), a U.S. Forest Service, Region 2 Sensitive Species. These outbreaks are managed through removal of trees infested with mountain pine beetles to control mountain pine beetle populations and salvage timber resources. To minimize impacts to black-backed woodpeckers while meeting management objectives, there is a need to identify characteristics of these areas that support black-backed woodpeckers. We examined the habitat associations of this species nesting in areas of beetle outbreaks in the Black Hills, South Dakota in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic approach and discrete choice models to evaluate nest-site selection of 42 woodpecker nests at 3 spatial scales-territory, nest area, and nest tree. At the territory scale (250 m around nest), availability and distribution of food best explained black-backed woodpecker selection of beetle outbreaks versus the surrounding forest. Selection at the territory scale was positively associated with densities of trees currently infested by mountain pine beetles and indices of wood borer (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) abundance, and was greatest at distances of 50-100 m from the nearest patch of infestation. At the nest-area scale (12.5 m radius around the nest), densities of snags positively influenced nest-area selection. Finally, at the nest-tree scale, aspen (Populus tremuloides) and 3-5-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags were important resources. The association between abundant wood-boring insects and black-backed woodpeckers creates a difficult challenge for forest managers. In the absence of fire, areas of beetle outbreak might serve as the only substantial source of habitat in the Black Hills. Regulating insect populations via salvage logging will reduce key food resources to black-backed woodpeckers during nesting. Therefore, given the relatively infrequent occurrence of large-scale fire in the Black Hills, management should recognize the importance of beetle-killed forests to the long-term viability of the black-backed woodpecker population in the Black Hills. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Bird communities of 11 fir forests (Abies pectinata and A. pinsapo + maroccana) and 6 pine forests (Pinus silvestris and P. pinaster) were compared along a 2000 km transect from the Vosges (N.-E. France) to the Middle Atlas (Marocco). A common background of ca 15 Palearctic bird species accounts for three quarters of relative abundances in all communities. However, significant differences appear at several levels. (1) Between the medio-european and Mediterranean biogeographical areas, middle latitudes of Spain prevent the presence southward of ca 10 species, such as the Goldcrest and the Bullfinch. Conversely, although belonging to the same faunistic region, 11 species, such as the Short-toed Tree Creeper and the Serin, are more frequent in the Mediterranean than further north. Over the two forest types investigated, there are only 33 Passerine species, over a total of 54, common to Middle Europe and the Mediterranean area. (2) Abies and Pinus forests have in common a striking figure of 46 bird species. The distinctive species are the Firecrest and the Blackcap in fir forests, the Crested Tit and the Common Crossbill in pine forests. As already noted by various authors, as a consequence of its insularity and mesological peculiarities the Mediterranean forest avifauna can be considered as an impoverished version of its Medio-european counterpart. (3) At the broad regional scale, a multivariate analysis shows an avifaunistic gradient running from climacic forests, mainly on north-facing slopes from Vanoise (French Alps) to the Pyrenees, to para-climacic pre-forests, mainly on south-facing slopes, in Andalucia and Marocco. In the former case, boreal bird species account for three quarters of the abundances in the community but less than half in the latter where the rest consists predominantly of rather biogeographically and ecologically ubiquitous species (Carduelinae, Woodlark, Rock Bunting) which, for a mix of ecological and anthropogenic reasons, are able to colonize more and more common southward thermo-xerophilous and open wooded landscapes.},

abstract={Broad-spectrum herbicide applications and improved harvesting efficiency of crops have reduced the availability of weed seeds and waste grains for game and nongame wildlife. Over the last decade, corn and soybean plantings have steadily increased in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North Dakota, while sunflower plantings have declined. The PPR is an important corridor for migratory birds, and changes in food availabilities at stopover habitats may affect how food resources are used. In early spring 2003 and 2004, we compared bird use of harvested fields of sunflower, soybeans, small grains, and corn in the PPR of North Dakota. Across both years and all crop types, we observed 20,400 birds comprising 29 species. Flocks of Lapland Longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus) and Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris) and flocks of Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) made up 60% and 15%, respectively, of the bird counts. We found that species richness and bird densities were higher in harvested sunflower fields and cornfields than in harvested small-grain and soybean fields, with soybean fields harboring the fewest species and lowest bird density. Blackbird densities tended to be lower in fields tilled after fall harvest than in fields not tilled. These results suggest that some granivorous bird populations in the Northern Great Plains could be positively affected by planting of row crops with postharvest vertical structure (e.g., sunflower, corn) and use of no-till land management practices.},

abstract={We undertook a 3-week expedition to Papua New Guinea in April-May 2007 to assess the breeding, threats and population densities of the Papuan Harrier Circus spilonotus spilothorax and to determine a first global population estimate for this almost entirely unknown species. Two of the first nests known were discovered in April 2007 with three chicks each, in the eastern lowlands, in rank grass and reeds. The melanistic form of this subspecies was more common in the lowlands (&lt; 1,500 m a.s.l) than in the highlands, but interbreeding of this and the typical form occurred in the lowlands. Movements of identifiable individuals through two highland grasslands indicated up to eight birds per day on passage, corroborating local knowledge that other raptors move into the highlands at the start of the dry season (April). Linear road counts indicated no harriers in the wooded highlands but up to 2.9 harriers 10 km1 in lowland grasslands. Area counts gave an average of 6.5 harriers 100 km 2 in the grasslands and a breeding density of 1.21 nests 100 km 2. Given that preferred grassland and swamp habitat comprises c. 7% of the forest-dominated island of New Guinea, the global Papuan Harrier population can be no more than c. 3,600 birds and c. 740 breeding pairs. Wildfires peaked at 38 per month in the study area, occur throughout the dry season, and led to the loss of both nests. This suggests that many nests and prey may be lost at critical times and burning may be ultimately detrimental for the species. Grassland fires throughout Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are increasing with climatic warming and ENSO events, so we suggest that the Papuan Harrier may warrant a Vulnerable conservation ranking due to small total population size and an accelerated reduction in habitat quality due to ongoing climate change. © BirdLife International 2009.},

One significant symptom of habitat fragmentation and disturbance in Australia is the increased occurrence of the aggressive noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). In Queensland, however, even large continuous areas of woodland appear to be dominated by the noisy miner. Aims.We examined the severity of this phenomenon by identifying the interactions between habitat structure, noisy miner abundance and avian assemblages in a private and a public conservation reserve in central Queensland. We investigated potential constraints on restoration of avian diversity including: (1) how changes in habitat structure as a result of grazing by feral animals and burning regimes affect bird assemblages; and (2) how the noisy miner impacts on avian assemblages in these unfragmented woodlands. Methods. Bird surveys and habitat assessments were conducted in 49 sites on three separate occasions. Fire history and intensity of grazing pressure were determined for each site with direct and indirect observations. Sampling for lerp from insects of the family Psyllidae was also undertaken during the survey periods. A Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach was used to model avian response to each of the habitat variables. Key results. The noisy miner dominated most of the study area, reducing small passerine abundance and species richness. Noisy miners were advantaged where shrub cover was low and feral grazing impacts were evident. Disturbance factors including recent wildfire and heavy grazing strongly reduced small passerine bird richness and abundance. Conclusions. Reducing the abundance of this 'reverse keystone' species requires control of feral herbivore populations and modification of fire regimes to achieve a mosaic including patches with a dense shrub layer. Implications. Deleterious interactions with competitive native species, such as noisy miners, are obstacles to bird conservation not only in fragmented landscapes but also in large, continuous woodland areas. Land mangers of protected areas need to be aware of shifts in interactions among native species driven by habitat disturbance, which may ultimately affect conservation outcomes. © CSIRO 2009.},

abstract={As human development continues in coastal areas, shoreline properties adjacent to expansive tidal marsh habitat are increasingly used for access to coastal waterways via long piers (>30 m) over marsh habitat. These tidal wetlands provide breeding and foraging habitat for many marsh birds, which may be affected by the human disturbance associated with long piers. Our objectives were to determine the effect of long piers over vegetated tidal marshes on the relative abundance and species richness of marsh birds. We completed combined passive and callback surveys in tidal marsh habitat at 22 sites with long piers and 24 sites without long piers, MayJuly 20052006 in Worcester County, Maryland, USA. Pier sites had lower relative abundance and species richness of obligate marsh birds than nonpier sites. Pier sites had a greater relative abundance of gulls, terns, herons, and egrets than nonpier sites. Pier sites had fewer species of herons and egrets than at nonpier sites. The presence of long piers had no affect on facultative marsh birds. Long pier density was negatively related to obligate marsh bird relative abundance and species richness, and facultative marsh bird species richness, whereas it was positively related to the relative abundance and species richness of gulls and terns. Herons and egrets relative abundance and species richness were not related to long pier density. Obligate marsh birds were negatively affected by long piers, whereas herons, egrets, gulls, and terns appeared to benefit from perching opportunities. Based on the negative effects of long piers on obligate marsh birds, management should focus on reducing the presence and density of long piers in tidal marshes by requiring the removal of existing long piers, or reducing or eliminating permits for construction of new long piers. © 2009 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Effects of silvicultural activities on birds are of increasing interest because of documented national declines in breeding bird populations for some species and the potential that these declines are in part due to changes in forest habitat. Silviculturally induced disturbances have been advocated as a means to achieve suitable forest conditions for priority wildlife species in bottomland hardwood forests. We evaluated how silvicultural activities on conservation lands in bottomland hardwood forests of Louisiana, USA, influenced species-specific densities of breeding birds. Our data were from independent studies, which used standardized point-count surveys for breeding birds in 124 bottomland hardwood forest stands on 12 management areas. We used Program DISTANCE 5.0, Release 2.0 (Thomas et al. 2006) to estimate density for 43 species with >50 detections. For 36 of those species we compared density estimates among harvest regimes (individual selection, group selection, extensive harvest, and no harvest). We observed 10 species with similar densities in those harvest regimes compared with densities in stands not harvested. However, we observed 10 species that were negatively impacted by harvest with greater densities in stands not harvested, 9 species with greater densities in individual selection stands, 4 species with greater densities in group selection stands, and 4 species with greater densities in stands receiving an extensive harvest (e.g., >40 canopy removal). Differences in intensity of harvest influenced densities of breeding birds. Moreover, community-wide avian conservation values of stands subjected to individual and group selection, and stands not harvested, were similar to each other and greater than that of stands subjected to extensive harvest that removed >40 canopy cover. These results have implications for managers estimating breeding bird populations, in addition to predicting changes in bird communities as a result of prescribed and future forest management practices. © 2009 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Stream-riparian ecosystems are dynamic and complex entities that can support high levels of bird assemblage abundance and diversity. The myriad patches (e.g., aquatic, floodplain, riparian) found in the riverscape habitat mosaic attract a unique mixture of aquatic, semiaquatic, riparian, and upland birds, each uniquely utilizing the river corridor. Whereas standard morning bird surveys are widely used across ecosystems, the variety of bird guilds and the temporal habitat partitioning that likely occur in stream-riparian ecosystems argue for the inclusion of evening surveys. At 41 stream reaches in Vermont and Idaho, USA, we surveyed bird assemblages using a combination of morning and evening fixed-width transect counts. Student's paired t-tests showed that while bird abundance was not significantly different between morning and evening surveys, bird assemblage diversity (as measured by species richness, Shannon-Weiner's index, and Simpson's index) was significantly higher in the morning than in the evening. NMS ordinations of bird species and time (i.e., morning, evening) indicated that the structure of morning bird assemblages was different from that of evening assemblages. NMS further showed that a set of species was only found in evening surveys. The inclusion of evening counts in surveying bird assemblages in stream-riparian ecosystems has important experimental and ecological implications. Experimentally, the sole use of morning bird surveys may significantly underestimate the diversity and misrepresent the community composition of bird assemblages in these ecosystems. Ecologically, many of the birds detected in evening surveys were water-associated species that occupy high trophic levels and aerial insectivores that represent unique aquatic-terrestrial energy transfers. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The rise of extinction rates associated with human activities has led to a growing interest in identifying extinction-prone taxa and extinction-promoting drivers. Previous work has identified habitat alterations and invasive species as the major drivers of recent bird extinctions. Here, we extend this work to ask how these human-driven impacts differentially affect extinction-prone taxa, and if any specific driver promotes taxonomic homogenization of avifauna. Like most previous studies, our analysis is based on global information of extinction drivers affecting threatened and extinct bird species from the IUCN Red List. Unlike previous studies, we employ a multivariate statistical framework that allows us to identify the main gradients of variation in extinction drivers. By using these gradients, we show that bird families with the highest extinction risk are primarily associated with threats posed by invasive species, once species richness and phylogeny are taken into account. As expected, the negative impact of invasive species was higher on island species, but our results also showed that it was particularly high in those species with small distribution ranges. On the other hand, mainland species and island species with large ranges tended to be affected by habitat destruction. Thus the impacts of invasive species promote the process of taxonomic homogenization among islands and between islands and continents. Consequently, introduced species may increase biotic homogenization not only directly, as generally believed, but also indirectly through their disproportional impact on endemic species imperilment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={It has been suggested that golf courses can serve as wildlife habitat, provided key landscape features are present. Breeding bird communities were characterized on six golf courses and six green spaces in the Montreal area, Quebec, Canada. Landscape variables were measured to see which were the best correlates of avian species richness within and across sites. While there was no difference in the mean number of bird species (golf: 31 ± 2.4 SE; green: 33 ± 4.5 SE), golf courses supported fewer total species (golf: 55; green: 66). However, most of the species contributing to the green spaces' higher cumulative total were found at one site. Species composition differed between golf courses and green spaces, and was most correlated with site size, housing density surrounding the site, and extent of coniferous tree, grass, and vegetated water cover. Our results support the work of others, and suggest that golf course architects can improve habitat quality by: (1) increasing deciduous and coniferous tree cover; (2) increasing native vegetation within and surrounding all water bodies; (3) reducing the amount of highly managed grass area; (4) ensuring large, undeveloped buffers are maintained to prevent a shift in avian community composition with increasing urban sprawl; and (5) ensuring sites are planned as large as possible. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A collaborative project between researchers, regional natural resource management organisations and landholders set out to explore three questions about the relationships between biodiversity and land use in Australia's mixed-farming landscapes: (1) the extent to which farm-scale measures of biodiversity were related to agricultural production; (2) the influence of the type and intensity of agricultural production on native biodiversity on farms; and (3) the relative influence of site and farming system on selected measures of biodiversity. Four land-use types on 47 mixed farms across nine regions, derived from several of Australia's 56 natural resource management regions, were surveyed in autumn and spring 2006 and 2007. Surveys of birds, surface invertebrates (beetles, ants, spiders), vegetation and soils were undertaken on four land classes on each farm; crop, 'rotation' (break crop/pasture phase), perennial pasture and remnant vegetation. Data were collected by participating regional staff, using a standard protocol, which were sent to a central collection point for collation, analysis and interpretation. Species richness, functional diversity and vegetation structure were assessed. This introductory paper focuses on results relating to species richness, which for most taxa was greater in remnant vegetation than other land-use classes and declined along a disturbance gradient (remnant, pasture, rotation, crop). Properties with a greater proportion of perennial pastures recorded higher species richness than properties that were dominated by crop. Properties that recorded high wheat yields (t/ha) also recorded lower species richness for spiders and birds. The presence of insectivorous birds and beneficial invertebrates (spiders, beetles and ants) in all land-use classes suggests the potential to apply integrated pest management approaches to mixed-farming systems across the country. Site and system features were found to be important determinants of biodiversity, with their relative importance varying with the scale of investigation and the taxa. At the landscape scale, bird species richness was correlated with the amount of remnant vegetation within a 5-km radius of the farm boundary, and with the condition of native vegetation on the farm. The average size of remnant vegetation patches was 5 ha or less on nearly half of the properties surveyed. At the farm scale, ant species richness was correlated with site features, while beetles were correlated with management/system features such as the presence and fertility of perennial pastures. Analyses at the functional group level will provide more detailed information on relationships between different land-use types. Further experimental work needs to be undertaken to qualify the suggested impact of land management practices on different taxa, while repeated surveys will allow for the collation of datasets over time, from which population dynamics may be determined. © 2009 CSIRO.},

abstract={Many shrubland bird species are declining in eastern North America and as a result forest managers have used a variety of techniques to provide breeding habitat for these species. The maintenance of permanent "wildlife openings" using prescribed burns or mechanical treatments is a widely used approach for providing habitat for these species, but there have been no studies of the effects of treatment regime on bird abundance and nest survival in managed wildlife openings. We studied shrubland birds in wildlife openings on the White Mountain National Forest (WMNF) in New Hampshire and Maine, USA, during 2003 and 2004. We analyzed bird abundance and nest survival in relation to treatment type (burned versus mowed), treatment frequency, time since treatment, and patch area. We found that wildlife openings provided habitat for shrubland birds that are not present in mature forest. There was relatively modest support for models of focal bird species abundance as a function of treatment regime variables, despite pronounced effects of treatment on habitat conditions. This probably was attributable to the combined effects of complex site histories and bird site fidelity. Overall nest success (52%) was comparable to other types of early-successional habitats in the region, but there were few supported relationships between nest survival and treatment variables. We conclude that wildlife openings provide quality habitat for shrubland birds of high conservation interest as long as managers ensure treatment intervals are long enough to permit the development of woody vegetation characteristic of the later stages of this sere. Also, wildlife openings should be large enough to accommodate the territory sizes of all target species, which was ≥1.2 ha in this study.},

abstract={Despite numerous studies on the response of Mediterranean ecosystems to fire, few have measured the respective resilience of vegetation and fauna compartments. For 28 years, we conducted an annual monitoring of avifauna composition and vegetation structure (cover profile) following a severe wildfire in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) stand in southern France. Our aim was to estimate the time necessary for this bird-vegetation system to return to a state analogous to its pre-fire state. In the burned plots, low herbaceous and shrub layers were gradually replaced by higher, woody layers of vegetation. Neither bird species richness nor inter-annual bird species turnover showed significant differences from one year to the next over the study period. In contrast, bird species composition did change steadily, leading to an almost complete replacement of early-successional species by late-successional ones. Using the first axes of multivariate analyses as 'proxy variables' of vegetation or avifauna recoveries, we estimated by extrapolation the recovery times of these two ecosystem components at ca. 50 and 35 years, respectively. Towards the end of the study period, the rate of change in avifauna composition decreased comparatively to that of vegetation structure. Our results show that holm oak woodlands are highly resilient and seem to tolerate a ~50-year fire interval, even if it remains to be assessed how resilient they would be in the case of increased fire frequency. More generally, our multivariate approach, which allows comparative estimations of resilience in different components of an ecosystem using qualitative as well as quantitative criteria, could be applied to various case studies in disturbance and restoration ecology. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={We examined the relationship of breeding birds to elevation across and within four adjacent mountain ranges in the central Great Basin, a cold desert in western North America. Data came from 7 years of point counts at elevations from 1,915 to 3,145 m. We focused on eight passerine species that in this region are associated frequently with Pinus monophylla-Juniperus spp. (pinyon-juniper) woodland. Mean elevation of species' presence differed significantly among mountain ranges for all species except Spizella passerina (Chipping Sparrow); all species except Spizella breweri (Brewer's Sparrow) occurred at the highest mean elevation in the Toquima Range. Observed patterns were consistent with the elevational distribution of pinyon-juniper woodlands that provide nesting and foraging habitat for these species. Across the Great Basin, driven in part by climate change, pinyon-juniper woodland is increasing in density and expanding its distribution at lower elevations. However, breeding habitat for species dependent on mature trees may not be available in expansion woodlands for several decades, and increased tree densities may have negative effects on bird species that are dependent on shrubs within open pinyon-juniper woodlands. Responses of individual species to elevation differed from the response of assemblage-level patterns. Responses to biotic and abiotic variables within guilds of birds are sufficiently diverse, and responses of individual species sufficiently heterogeneous, that one management strategy is unlikely to meet the needs of all species in the group. © 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

In this study, we measured arthropod community assemblages on Ceanothus fendleri A. Gray (Fendler's ceanothus) plants that were growing inside and outside of 4-m2 exclosures. We used univariate analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate relationships within this herbivore-plant-arthropod system in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests of northern Arizona, USA. Results showed that individual arthropod abundance, family diversity, family richness, and functional group richness were significantly greater on plots where C. fendleri plants were protected from large ungulate herbivores (e.g., mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni)) than on unprotected plots in each of the three study years. Results also indicated the following: (1) arthropod abundance was significantly greater on protected plants than unprotected plants; (2) rarefaction curves suggested arthropod family richness was similar between protected and unprotected plants in two of the three years when scaled by number of individuals but the estimated total richness was consistently higher on protected plants; (3) arthropod abundance was directly affected by protection from herbivores, plant stem length, and number of flowers; (4) arthropod family richness was related to the number of individuals collected and affected by stem length. Results from this study illustrate that arthropod communities are directly affected by foraging vertebrate herbivores as well as indirectly affected through complex plant-mediated factors in this model system. Protection of preferred forage plants such as C. fendleri from ungulate herbivores can potentially increase diversity of arthropod assemblages in these forests, help conserve biological diversity, and enhance ecosystem restoration efforts. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={One common problem encountered when restoring grasslands is the prominence of non-native plant species. It is unclear what effect non-native plants have on habitat quality of grassland passerines, which are among the most imperiled groups of birds. In 2004 and 2005, we compared patterns of avian reproduction and the mechanisms that might influence those patterns across a gradient of 13 grasslands in the Zumwalt Prairie in northeastern Oregon that vary in the degree of non-native plant cover (0.9-53.4%). We monitored the fate of 201 nests of all the breeding species in these pastures and found no association of percent non-native cover with nest densities, clutch size, productivity, nest survival, and nestling size. Regardless of the degree of non-native cover, birds primarily fed on Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and Araneae. But as percent non-native cover in the pastures increased, Orthoptera made up a greater proportion of diet and Coleoptera made up a smaller proportion. These diet switches were not the result of changes in terrestrial invertebrate abundance but may be related to decreases in percent bare ground associated with increasing cover of non-native vegetation. Measures of nest crypticity were not associated with cover of non-native vegetation, suggesting that predation risk may not increase with increased cover of non-native vegetation. Thus, the study results show that increased non-native cover is not associated with reduced food supplies or increased predation risk for nesting birds, supporting the growing body of evidence that grasslands with a mix of native and non-native vegetation can provide suitable habitat for native grassland breeding birds. © 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract={Studies on bird fauna of urban environments have had a long history, but the potential of studies mapping the distribution of birds in cities probably has not fully developed. The bird fauna of the municipality of Valencia (Spain) was studied to determine the influence of urbanization on bird species richness and abundance. Birds were censused during winter and the breeding season of years 1997-1998 in 197 squares measuring 49 ha each from a rural and an urbanized area. Across seasons the number of species decreased around 40% in the city compared with the rural landscape surrounding it. Such pattern could be attributed to the low number of farmland species capable to use the habitats inside the city, and the limited ability of urban parks in attracting woodland species. In the urban landscape, the influence of the dimensions and spatial arrangement of habitat patches was outweighed by the amount of each habitat per square. Bird richness and the abundance of most species were negatively related with the amount of built-up habitat per square and positively with the amount of urban parks, and of habitat diversity. Conversely, bird fauna was largely independent of mean park size per square especially during winter, indicating that at the landscape scale even small patches of habitat could play an ecological role. Conservation of urban bird diversity could benefit of two complementary strategies: (i) the protection of the surrounding rural landscape from urban development; (ii) habitat enhancement within the city. Particularly, a proper design and habitat management of urban parks could improve their suitability for urban bird fauna. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

Within 50, 0.25-ha plots (25 used by WbW and 25 random) tree-species composition, tree condition, tree diameter at breast height DBH and characteristics of dead trees were measured. WbW and random plots were similar in overall structure; only the volume of fallen timber was significantly larger in WbW than in random plots (65.3 and 47.4 m3/ha, respectively). There was also a tendency for the occurrence of more snags of 11 -20 cm DBH within WbW plots. Thus, the amount of fallen timber might determine WbW choice of the foraging habitat. However, due to the relatively high similarity of WbW vs. random plots, the sections of Białowieża National Park that are covered with old-growth deciduous stands represent high-quality habitat for WbW foraging.},

abstract={Prescribed fire is a management tool used to reduce fuel loads on public lands in forested areas in the western United States. Identifying the impacts of prescribed fire on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive, threatened, and migratory bird species. Recent developments in occupancy modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for detection probability, and we demonstrate the model's usefulness for identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities. Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the flexibility of the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our modeling of the impacts of prescribed fire on avian communities in a ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed fire treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several bark-insectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed fire, whereas three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined following treatments. Land management agencies interested in determining the effects of habitat manipulations on wildlife communities can use these methods to provide guidance for future management activities. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is considered a fire specialist throughout its breeding range. Given its high abundance in recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time. Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success declined from 84% the first year after fire to 73% and 25%, respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests. Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests. Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature and over-mature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Hairy woodpecker density was 5 times greater in burn units, whereas white-breasted nuthatches and pygmy nuthatches had similar densities between treatments. Compared to available trees, trees used by foraging hairy woodpeckers had 9 times greater odds of having bark beetles in control units and 12 times greater odds in burn units. Tree diameter appeared to be the main factor bark-foraging birds used in selecting winter foraging trees.

abstract={1. Modern farmed landscapes have witnessed substantial losses in biodiversity principally driven by the ecological changes associated with agricultural intensification. The causes of declines are often well described, but current management practices seem unlikely to deliver the EU-wide policy objective of halting biodiversity losses. 2. Available evidence suggests that property-scale factors can be influential in shaping patterns of biodiversity; however, they are rarely included in studies. Using 44 upland farms in the Peak District, northern England, we investigate the roles of ecological, agricultural and socio-economic factors in determining avian species richness, for the first time incorporating information from all three influences. 3. Although we might expect that habitat quality would be the main factor affecting species richness, these variables had little influence. The landscape context of each property was unimportant in explaining any of the three measures of species richness (Total, Upland and Conservation Concern) used here. Within-property habitat quality did explain 42% of the variation in richness of upland specialist species, but had no influence on Total or Conservation Concern Richness. 4. Socio-economic circumstances of farms alone accounted for 24% of the variation in Total Richness, with land tenure and labour inputs important predictors of avian diversity. However, net income, rental value and the level of Agri-Environment Scheme (AES) payments did not play a role in predicting species richness. 5. Farm management variables, including many of the main prescriptions outlined in AES, accounted for 23% of the variation in the richness of species of Conservation Concern, but less than 10% for Total Richness. However, no farm management variable alone was shown to offer better predictive power of avian species richness than random. 6. Synthesis and applications. The agricultural landscape is managed by a mosaic of landowners, all of whom can influence biodiversity conservation. We demonstrate that variation at the property-scale in habitat, management and socio-economics can feed into determining patterns of biodiversity. Currently, farmland conservation policy largely assumes that socio-economic barriers and financial costs of implementing conservation measures are constant. Incorporating a consideration of the varying circumstances of individual properties into policy design is likely to result in substantial biodiversity gains. © 2008 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Fire is a crucial element needed to understand the biodiversity patterns of forest landscapes in most Mediterranean countries. However, little is known about the quantitative responses of bird communities to postfire forest management in this region, in which the logging of burnt trees is a common practice. Several studies have already described the negative effects of felling burnt trees on birds but none has focussed on the remaining wood remnants. We investigated this question in a large burnt area located in north-east Iberian Peninsula. The amount of logging remnants left on the ground had positive linear and negative quadratic relationships with the indices of bird abundance and bird richness. The results obtained at a species level were similar, since 36% of the most abundant species revealed the same type of relations with logging remnants, whereas none showed an opposite pattern. Thus, birds in general seem to be positively influenced by the amount of wood remnants left on the ground to a certain point, from which the relation reverses. The results of this study indicate that a moderate amount of wood remnants left on the ground may be positive for the overall bird community. We suggest that management plays a role in the recovery of the bird community after fire and, therefore, biodiversity criteria should be incorporated in the guidelines driving postfire actions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract={Channelization of rivers and streams threatens bottomland forest bird communities because it can lead to the formation of lateral gullies that connect streams to adjacent wetlands and unnaturally accelerate the draining of wetlands, potentially exposing some birds to high rates of nest predation. I studied how the hydrologic restoration of off-channel wetlands (plugging gullies that drain off-channel wetlands) affects the diversity, abundance, and nesting success of birds breeding within forested wetlands within the Cache River watershed in Illinois. I compared surface area, water depth, bird diversity, bird densities, and nesting success between treatment (gully plugs added) and control (gully plugs not added) wetlands pre- and post-treatment. During the breeding season of birds, treatment wetlands retained more flooded area and greater depths of water compared to control wetlands. Bird diversity was unaffected by the installation of gully plugs. The density and nesting success of prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea) was higher in treatment wetlands than in control wetlands. Documenting changes in the bird community in response to this conservation action provides a means to measure the success of restoration activities in the Cache River watershed and inform conservation plans and restoration efforts in other bottomland forest ecosystems. © 2009, The Society of Wetland Scientists.},

abstract={Landscape-scale disturbance events, including ecological restoration and fuel reduction activities, can modify habitat and affect relationships between species and their environment. To reduce the risk of uncharacteristic stand-replacing fires in the southwestern United States, land managers are implementing restoration and fuels treatments (e.g., mechanical thinning, prescribed fire) in progressively larger stands of dry, lower elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest. We used a Before-After/Control-Impact experimental design to quantify the multi-scale response of avifauna to large (;250-400 ha) prescribed fire treatments on four sites in Arizona and New Mexico dominated by ponderosa pine. Using distance sampling and an information-theoretic approach, we estimated changes in density for 14 bird species detected before (May-June 2002-2003) and after (May-June 2004-2005) prescribed fire treatments. We observed few site-level differences in pre- and posttreatment density, and no species responded strongly to treatment on all four sites. Pointlevel spatial models of individual species response to treatment, habitat variables, and fire severity revealed ecological relationships that were more easily interpreted. At this scale, pretreatment forest structure and patch characteristics were important predictors of posttreatment differences in bird species density. Five species (Pygmy Nuthatch [Sitta pygmaea], Western Bluebird [Sialia mexicana], Steller's Jay [Cyanocitta stelleri ], American Robin [Turdus migratorius], and Hairy Woodpecker [Picoides villosus]) exhibited a strong treatment response, and two of these species (American Robin and Hairy Woodpecker) could be associated with meaningful fire severity response functions. The avifaunal response patterns that we observed were not always consistent with those reported by more common studies of wildland fire events. Our results suggest that, in the short term, the distribution and abundance of common members of the breeding bird community in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests appear to be tolerant of low- to moderate-intensity prescribed fire treatments at multiple spatial scales and across multiple geographic locations. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Extensive habitat loss and changing agricultural practices have caused widespread declines in grassland birds throughout North America. The Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma - the largest remaining tallgrass prairie - is important for grassland bird conservation despite supporting a major cattle industry. In 2004 and 2005, we assessed the community, population, and demographic responses of grassland birds to the predominant management practices (grazing, burning, and haying) of the region, including grasslands restored under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). We targeted 3 species at the core of this avian community: the Dickcissel (Spiza americana), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna). Bird diversity was higher in native prairie hayfields and grazed pastures than CRP fields, which were dominated by Dickcissels. Although Dickcissel density was highest in CRP, their nest success was highest and nest parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Moluthrus ater) lowest in unburned hayfields (in 2004). Conversely, Grasshopper Sparrow density was highest in grazed pastures, but their nest success was lowest in these pastures and highest in burned hayfields, where cowbird parasitism was also lowest (in 2004). Management did not influence density and nest survival of Eastern Meadowlarks, which were uniformly low across the region. Nest success was extremely low (5-12%) for all 3 species in 2005, perhaps because of a record spring drought. Although the CRP has benefited grassland birds in agricultural landscapes, these areas may have lower habitat value in the context of native prairie. Hayfields may provide beneficial habitat for some grassland birds in the Flint Hills because they are mowed later in the breeding season than elsewhere in the Midwest. Widespread grazing and annual burning have homogenized habitat - and thus grassland-bird responses - across the Flint Hills. Diversification of management practices could increase habitat heterogeneity and enhance the conservation potential of the Flint Hills for grassland birds. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Fire is a widespread natural disturbance agent in most conifer-dominated forests. In light of climate change and the effects of fire exclusion, single and repeated high-severity (stand-replacement) fires have become prominent land management issues. We studied bird communities using point counting in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of Oregon, USA at various points in time after one or two high-severity fires. Time points included 2 and 3 years after a single fire, 17 and 18 years after a single fire, 2 and 3 years after a repeat fire (15 year interval between fires), and >100 years since stand-replacement fire (mature/old-growth forest). Avian species richness did not differ significantly among habitats. Bird density was highest 17 and 18 years after fire, lowest 2 years after fire, and intermediate in repeat burns and unburned forest. Bird community composition varied significantly with habitat type (A = 0.24, P < 0.0001) with two distinct gradients in species composition relating to tree structure (live to dead) and shrub stature. Using indicator species analysis, repeat burns were characterized by shrub-nesting and ground-foraging bird species while unburned mature forests were characterized by conifer-nesting and foliage-gleaning species. Bird density was not related to snag basal area but was positively related to shrub height. Contrary to expectations, repeated high-severity fire did not reduce species richness, and bird densities were greater in repeat burns than in once-burned habitats. Broad-leaved hardwoods and shrubs appear to play a major role in structuring avian communities in the Klamath-Siskiyou region. In light of these results, extended periods of early seral broadleaf dominance and short-interval high-severity fires may be important to the conservation of avian biodiversity. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hybrid poplar plantations are increasing worldwide and are often accused of impoverishing bird communities. We conducted 124 bird point counts in a landscape where plantations, semi-natural forests and farmland occupied similar surface areas. As expected, birds occurred at higher densities in areas dominated by forests than dominated by plantations, mostly due to the scarcity of late-successional forest birds in plantations. Contrary to expectations, bird communities were the poorest in farmland dominated areas and the most specialised in areas dominated by young plantations. Indeed, many grassland species, including some of conservation concern in Europe, frequently used young plantations. However, plantations have probably depleted grassland bird communities by fragmenting open areas, while playing a limited positive role on forest species. Total length of unpaved roads had a positive effect on community specialisation index, while total length of paved roads and mean forest/plantation patch size played no role. Bird density increased with the development of the understory vegetation in mature poplar plantations. We conclude that poplar should not be planted at the expense of areas of high conservation value; in other cases, they may increase the overall diversity of bird communities. At the plantation scale, we advocate stopping understory removal as soon as possible and maintaining old trees and hedgerows alongside or within plantations to provide suitable breeding habitats for bird species that may be foraging in the plantations. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Over an 18-month period regular counts were made of the water birds inhabiting lakes and ponds in the Lann National Park in Argentinean Patagonia. A total of 130 bird surveys were conducted on 21 wetland areas, detecting 6,364 individuals belonging to 27 species from nine families. The most abundant and frequent species were Cloephaga poliocephala, Anas flavirostris, Fulica armillata and Fulica. leucoptera. Species richness was higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter, involving 31 and 27 expected species, respectively. In contrast, bird abundance did not differ between season. The presence and abundance of bird species with respect to the surface area of the water body highlights the importance of certain lakes in particular. Thus, small water bodies (<100 ha) support higher numbers of birds; an average of 78.445.0 individuals as compared with larger lakes with an average of 18.58 birds. However, some species such as Phalacrocorax olivaceus, Podiceps major, Tachyeres patachonicus and Anas specularis were observed more at larger lakes, such differences being statistically significant. In contrast, Anas flavirostris, A. platalea and A. sibilatrix were more common in small and medium-sized lagoons. This information contributes to the development of management guidelines for the conservation of Patagonian wetlands.},

abstract={To determine the effectiveness of conservation efforts, scientists and land managers must evaluate the ability of conservation areas to protect biological diversity. The historic town of Concord, Massachusetts, home of the philosopher and naturalist Henry David Thoreau, provides a unique opportunity to examine how well conservation areas preserve biodiversity in a suburban landscape. About 35% of total land area in the town has been protected, and botanists, including Thoreau, have surveyed plants in Concord five times over the last 170 years. We spent 5 years (2003-2007) re-surveying a subset of Concord's flora for species presence and abundance. Of the species seen by Thoreau in the mid-19th century in Concord, we could not locate 27%, and an additional 36% persist in one or two populations where they are vulnerable to local extinction. Most species losses appear to have occurred in the past three to four decades. Certain groups, such as orchids, have shown particularly severe losses. More native species are declining in abundance than are increasing. Non-native species represent an increasing percentage of the flora, with many increasing in abundance. The flora has experienced a net loss of species over the past four decades, with 82 species gained and 236 species missing. Because many species are rare on a local scale, persisting as one or two small populations, local extinctions will likely continue in coming decades. Habitat management, primarily to prevent tree establishment, appears to have allowed many rare species of open habitats to persist and recover. Active management of existing sites will likely be the key to protecting the species diversity of the Concord flora and maintaining the living connection to the writings of Thoreau. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Estimates of community attributes such as species richness, local extinction, and turnover are critical when evaluating ecological restoration efforts. Estimates of species richness based on counts can be biased by variation in the probability of detection among different species. We quantified the effects of livestock exclusion on riparian bird communities using mark-recapture models to account for variation in species detection rates. Specifically, we estimated species richness and other community parameters for fenced and grazed sites with robust design models where closed-captures were treated as mixtures, and then used transition rates to calculate derived vital rates for avian communities. Estimates of species richness based on unadjusted counts were correlated with estimates from robust design models, but counts failed to detect important temporal changes in species richness. Estimates of species richness from robust design models increased at fenced and grazed sites over an 8-year period, but community vital rates were unaffected by cattle exclusion. We examined qualitative changes in abundance of birds in four nesting guilds, and concluded that temporal changes may have been driven by regional dynamics in avian communities. Our mark-recapture analysis allowed us to compare standardized estimates of community parameters between habitats, observers, and time periods after accounting for variation in detection rates. Robust design models are a useful tool that will facilitate accurate assessments of community dynamics following future restoration efforts.},

abstract={Land-cover changes from the last decades are leading to important declines in habitat quality, giving rise to changes in bird species distribution all over the world. However, land-cover changes result from a variety of different processes, and it is not clear how effective species distribution models are in capturing species responses to these changes. In this study, we evaluated our ability to predict the effects of land-cover changes on shifts in species distributions at large spatial and temporal scales using Mediterranean landscapes and earlysuccessional, open-habitat birds as study models. Based on presence-absence data from the second Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (1999-2002), we applied six different species distribution modeling techniques for 10 bird species using climate, topographic, and land-cover data as predictor variables. Then we back-projected the models on land-cover conditions from 1980 to evaluate the projections with field observation data from the first Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (1975-1983). Finally, we assessed if, in addition to changes in habitat suitability resulting from land-cover shifts, descriptors of fire impact contributed to further explain species distribution dynamics: colonization and local extinction. We developed accurate model projections of current and past global patterns of species distribution, but our ability to predict species distribution dynamics was reduced. Colonization dynamics were generally more strongly related to fire descriptors than to changes in overall habitat suitability derived from land-cover changes. Our results warn of the dangers of projecting species distribution models onto future conditions if processes behind species distribution dynamics are not explicitly included. Consideration of ecologically meaningful processes for species (i.e., fire disturbance) when modeling species' distribution might contribute to a better explanation of species' colonization dynamics. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={In coniferous forests of western North American, fire is an important disturbance that influences the structure and composition of floral and faunal communities. The impacts of postfire management, including salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5-6 snags retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon. We used analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three hypotheses concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage on densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds, and two hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage logging on relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined the relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species. We did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities or relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P. villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment. We detected significant differences between years for four species of birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting robust patterns that transcend particular locations. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={To gain insight into the question of which vegetation characteristics have the most influence on avian assemblages in late-successional forests, the habitat preferences of bird-guilds in old-growth endemic forests of Macedonian pine were studied over 3 years in the Pirin National Park, Bulgaria. Bird-habitat relationships were investigated by comparing vegetation characteristics, and bird species richness, diversity, abundance, and guild structure of birds (determined according to food type, foraging and nesting sites) between mature (60-100 years old) and over-mature (>120 years old) Macedonian pine forest stands. Studied forest age-classes differed mainly by the density, height and diameter of trees, and the amount of dead wood. The first one of these parameters decreased and the latter two parameters increased with the forest succession. The difference in the vegetation structure affected the abundance of bird-guilds and thus, the overall bird abundance and the structure of avian assemblages within Macedonian pine forests. There was no significant difference in bird diversity among studied forest age-classes, but the overall bird abundance increased with forest maturation. Analyzed by study plots, species richness was higher in over-mature forests, but at cluster level, there was no significant difference between mature and over-mature forest age-classes. Half of the studied (insectivorous, hole- and ground-nesters, bark- and canopy-foraging bird species) guilds were more abundant in over-mature forests, while there was no bird-guild exhibiting a preference for mature forest stands. The abundances of bird-guilds were correlated with tree height, diameter at breast height and the amount of dead wood between the studied forest age-classes and this might explain their preferences for over-mature pine forests. Therefore, for future sustainable management of these endemic forests and the conservation of their avifauna, efforts should focus on protecting the remaining native old-growth forest stands and the importance of the structure of Macedonian pine forests on their bird assemblages should be considered in forestry practices. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Processes derived from global change such as land-use changes, climate warming or modifications in the perturbation regime may have opposite effects on forest extent and structure with still unknown consequences on forest biodiversity at large spatial scales. In the present study, we aimed at determining forest dynamics associated with global change processes (forest spread, maturation and fire) that have driven the variation in forest bird distributions in Mediterranean forest ecosystems in recent years. The study was located in Catalonia (NE Spain) and used changes in richness of specialist and generalist forest bird species in the last 20 years of the 20th century as indicators of forest biodiversity change. Forest bird distribution changes showed strong spatial patterns and appeared to be related to population processes occurring beyond sampling units (10 km × 10 km squares). Forest maturation appeared as the most important driver of such changes because most of the studied species have a non-Mediterranean origin and are associated with more mature forests. To a lower degree, forest spread also contributed to forest bird distribution changes whereas the impact of forest fires was not associated to a decrease in the richness of either group of forest species. Given the relatively coarse scale at which our study was conducted, caution should be taken when extrapolating our results to the possible future impacts of climate change on fire regime and forest bird distribution. Our results indicate that large-scale forest maturation and spread due mainly to land abandonment in Catalonia has overridden the potentially negative effects of fires on forest bird distributions and are currently driving changes in forest biodiversity patterns across the region. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract={Forest harvesting strategies that approximate natural disturbances have been proposed as a means of maintaining natural species' diversity and richness in the boreal forests of North America. Natural disturbances impact shoreline forests and upland areas at similar rates. However, shoreline forests are generally protected from harvest through the retention of treed buffer strips. We examined bird community responses to forest management guidelines intended to approximate shoreline forest fires by comparing bird community structure in early (1-4 years) post-burned and harvested boreal riparian habitats and the adjacent shoreline forest. We sampled riparian areas with adjacent: (1) burned merchantable shoreline forest (n = 21), (2) burned non-merchantable shoreline forest (n = 29), (3) 10 m treed buffer with 25% retention in the next 30 m (n = 18), and (4) 30 m treed buffer (n = 21). Only minor differences were detected in riparian species' abundance and bird community composition between treatments with greater differences in these parameters occurring between post-fire and post-harvest upland bird communities. Indicators of all merchantable treatments were dominated by upland species with open-habitat species and habitat generalists being typical upland indicator species of burned merchantable habitats and forest specialists typical upland indicators of harvested treatments. Riparian species indicative of burned riparian habitats were Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii) and Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus) and indicators of 30 m buffers were Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum) and Wilson's Warbler (Wilsonia pusilla). Multivariate Redundancy Analysis (RDA) of the overall (riparian and upland birds) community showed greater divergence than RDA with only riparian species suggesting less effect of fire and forestry on riparian birds than on upland birds. Higher natural range of variability (NRV) of overall post-fire bird communities compared to post-harvest communities emphasizes that harvesting guidelines currently do not achieve this level of variability. However, lack of a large negative effect on common riparian species in the first 4 years post-disturbance allows for the exploration of alternative shoreline forest management that better incorporates bird community composition of post-fire riparian areas and shoreline forests. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Large wildfire events in coniferous forests of the western United States are often followed by postfire timber harvest. The long-term impacts of postfire timber harvest on fire-associated cavity-nesting bird species are not well documented. We studied nest-site selection by cavity-nesting birds over a 10-year period (1994-2003), representing 1-11 years after fire, on two burns created by mixed severity wildfires in western Idaho, USA. One burn was partially salvaged logged (the Foothills burn), the other was primarily unlogged (the Star Gulch burn). We monitored 1367 nests of six species (Lewis's Woodpecker Melanerpes lewis, Hairy Woodpecker Picoides villosus, Black-backed Woodpecker P. arcticus, Northern Flicker Colaptes auratus, Western Bluebird Sialia mexicana, and Mountain Bluebird S. currucoides). Habitat data at nest and non-nest random locations were characterized at fine (field collected) and coarse (remotely sensed) spatial scales. Nest-site selection for most species was consistently associated with higher snag densities and larger snag diameters, whereas wildfire location (Foothills versus Star Gulch) was secondarily important. All woodpecker species used nest sites with larger diameter snags that were surrounded by higher densities of snags than at non-nest locations. Nests of Hairy Woodpecker and Mountain Bluebird were primarily associated with the unlogged wildfire, whereas nests of Lewis's Woodpecker and Western Bluebird were associated with the partially logged burn in the early years after fire. Nests of wood-probing species (Hairy and Black-backed Woodpeckers) were also located in larger forest patch areas than patches measured at non-nest locations. Our results confirm previous findings that maintaining clumps of large snags in postfire landscapes is necessary for maintaining breeding habitat of cavity-nesting birds. Additionally, appropriately managed salvage logging can create habitat for some species of cavity-nesting birds that prefer more open environments. Our findings can be used by land mangers to develop design criteria for postfire salvage logging that will reserve breeding habitat for cavity-nesting birds.},

abstract={We investigated home-range characteristics and habitat selection by Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in an unburned, boreal forest landscape managed by mosaic harvesting in Quebec, Canada. Habitat selection by this species was specifically examined to determine home-range establishment and foraging activities. We hypothesized that Black-backed Woodpeckers would respond to harvesting by adjusting their home-range size as a function of the amount of dead wood available. Twenty-two birds were tracked using radiotelemetry, and reliable estimates of home-range size were obtained for seven breeding individuals (six males and one female). The average home-range size was 151.5 ± 18.8 ha (range: 100.4-256.4 ha). Our results indicate that this species establishes home ranges in areas where both open and forested habitats are available. However, during foraging activities, individuals preferentially selected areas dominated by old coniferous stands. The study also showed that the spatial distribution of preferred foraging habitat patches influenced space use, with home-range area increasing with the median distance between old coniferous habitat patches available within the landscape. Finally, these data show that Black-backed Woodpeckers may successfully breed in an unburned forest with at least 35 m3 • ha-1 of dead wood, of which 42% (15 m3 • ha-1) is represented by dead wood at the early decay stage. © 2009. by the author(s).},

abstract={Policy direction to emulate natural disturbance in managed boreal forests has spurred a need to contrast the dynamics of biota on landscapes originating from timber harvest and from wildfire (hereafter, "managed" and "natural"). Typically, emphasis is on pattern emulation, and less on processes, such as competition, predation or habitat selection. Knowing how communities in the boreal forest assemble can provide further insight to the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the processes responsible, permitting assessments about whether forestry practices emulate processes as well as patterns. We contrasted variation in species richness among forest types, with stand area, and between local (forest stand) and regional (landscape) scales on managed and natural boreal landscapes in NW Ontario. Species richness varied more among forest stand types than between landscapes, or with stand area, on either landscape. On both landscapes, mean local species richness was 1/3 of regional richness, consistent with the hypothesis that competition structured stand-level assemblages regardless of stand origin. We further compared the structure of stand-level assemblages from randomized null models using presence/absence and abundance data with observed assemblages on each landscape, while controlling for variation in habitat structure among stands. Local bird assemblages were over-dispersed in niche space relative to random assemblages, also consistent with the competition hypothesis, regardless of stand origin. We found no evidence that patterns of variation in diversity of songbirds and woodpeckers, nor the processes that govern them, differed between managed and natural boreal forest landscapes. Our results suggest that past forest practices in this region, if by default, nevertheless emulated natural patterns of variation in diversity and species assembly of bird communities.},

abstract={We tested a previously described model to assess the wildlife habitat value of New England salt marshes by comparing modeled habitat values and scores with bird abundance and species richness at sixteen salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island USA. As a group, wildlife habitat value assessment scores for the marshes ranged from 307-509, or 31-67% of the maximum attainable score. We recorded 6 species of wading birds (Ardeidae; herons, egrets, and bitterns) at the sites during biweekly survey. Species richness (r2 = 0.24, F = 4.53, p = 0.05) and abundance (r2 = 0.26, F = 5.00, p = 0.04) of wading birds significantly increased with increasing assessment score. We optimized our assessment model for wading birds by using Akaike information criteria (AIC) to compare a series of models comprised of specific components and categories of our model that best reflect their habitat use. The model incorporating pre-classification, wading bird habitat categories, and natural land surrounding the sites was substantially supported by AIC analysis as the best model. The abundance of wading birds significantly increased with increasing assessment scores generated with the optimized model (r2 = 0.48, F = 12.5, p = 0.003), demonstrating that optimizing models can be helpful in improving the accuracy of the assessment for a given species or species assemblage. In addition to validating the assessment model, our results show that in spite of their urban setting our study marshes provide substantial wildlife habitat value. This suggests that even small wetlands in highly urbanized coastal settings can provide important wildlife habitat value if key habitat attributes (e.g., natural buffers, habitat heterogeneity) are present. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

abstract={We investigated whether partial cutting used to mimic small-scale natural disturbances could maintain cavity and bark nesting breeding birds. We assessed changes in the relative abundance of cavity nesting birds in two intensities of partial cutting, compared to uncut and clearcut stands, 9 years post-treatment. We then examined the relationship between forest structure and nesting abundance (stand scale) and compared characteristics of used nest and forage trees to unused trees (tree scale). The relative abundance of most species was highest in either heavy removal or light removal treatments 9 years post-harvest. Brown creepers were most abundant in uncut, and red-breasted sapsuckers were most abundant in clearcut and heavy removal treatments. The proportion of deciduous trees and the density of dead trees were the best predictors of nest abundance. Individual nest tree use was predicted by the presence of large deciduous trees with broken tops and early to advanced stages of decay. Forage tree use was predicted by the presence of large conifer trees in advanced stages of decay. To maintain breeding habitat for cavity nesters, we suggest that forest managers retain the specific structural attributes required for nesting, but also the diverse forest conditions required for foraging. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Disturbance is a key ecological process influencing the distribution and abundance of many elements of the earth's biota. Predicting the response of biota to disturbance is therefore important, but it nevertheless remains difficult to make accurate forecasts of response. We tested predictions from disturbance-related theories and concepts in 10 vegetation types at Booderee National Park (southeastern Australia) using a retrospective study of bird responses to fire history (over 35 years) on 110 sites and a prospective study following a single wildfire event in 2003 at 59 of these sites. Our data did not support predictions from the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis; observed bird species richness at a site was significantly (F1,99 = 6.30, P = 0.014) negatively related to the number of fires since 1972 and was 8.7% lower (95% CI, 1.8-15.1%) for each additional fire. In contrast to fire history effects, we found that after the 2003 fire, the vast majority of individual species and the bird assemblage per se in most vegetation types recovered within two years. Thus, recovery after a single fire did not reflect long-term effects of multiple fires on overall bird species richness at a site. We postulated that the recovery of bird species richness and bird assemblage composition after the 2003 fire would be fastest in structurally simple vegetation types and slowest in structurally complex vegetation, but observed the opposite. Although observed bird species richness in vertically heterogeneous forest and woodland had returned to prefire levels by 2006, bird species richness in structurally simple vegetation types (e.g., sedgeland) had not. Postfire vegetation regeneration, together with a paucity of early-successional specialists, would explain the speed of recovery of the bird assemblage and why it changed relatively little during our investigation. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={The San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona is one of the last free-flowing rivers in the southwestern United States that maintains significant stretches of perennial water. While critical for birds, this river is vulnerable to salt cedar (tamarisk, Tamarix spp.) invasion, woody encroachment into grassland, and alteration of hydrologic regime resulting from groundwater pumping. Bird species richness and community composition metrics provide a means to assess effects of management or conservation efforts. To estimate these metrics, we used methods that incorporated species detection probabilities from data collected at 160 points at 23 sites on the San Pedro River during 1998-2001. Species richness, co-occurrence, and uniqueness were estimated as a function of four riparian vegetation types (cottonwood-willow [Populus-Salix], salt cedar, mesquite [Prosopis spp.], and grassland), three hydrologic regimes (perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral), and riparian location (floodplain and terrace). We found significantly higher species richness in cottonwood and mesquite compared with salt cedar and grassland. Intermittent and perennial flow sites had higher species richness compared with ephemeral. Cottonwood and mesquite supported more unique species compared with grassland and salt cedar, and cottonwood or perennial sites supported canopy or water-dependent species, for which habitat is rare on the landscape. Within the intermittent class, salt cedar maintained an estimated 0-2 unique species compared with native woody vegetation types, while cottonwood and mesquite contributed an estimated 20-21 unique species compared with salt cedar. Thus, while maintaining relatively high species richness, salt cedar contributed little to regional avian diversity compared with native woody riparian vegetation. This research has important implications for regional conservation planning and riparian restoration efforts. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2008.},

abstract={The aims of this study were (1) to examine the geographic distribution of red-listed species of agricultural environments and identify their national threat spots (areas with high diversity of threatened species) in Finland and (2) to determine the main environmental variables related to the richness and occurrence patterns of red-listed species. Atlas data of 21 plant, 17 butterfly and 11 bird species recorded using 10 km grid squares were employed in the study. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were constructed separately for species richness and occurrence of individual species of the three species groups using climate and land cover predictor variables. The predictive accuracy of models, as measured using correlation between the observed and predicted values and AUC statistics, was generally good. Temperature-related variables were the most important determinants of species richness and occurrence of all three taxa. In addition, land cover variables had a strong effect on the distribution of species. Plants and butterflies were positively related to the cover of grasslands and birds to small-scale agricultural mosaic as well as to arable land. Spatial coincidence of threat spots of plants, butterflies and birds was limited, which emphasizes the importance of considering the potentially contrasting environmental requirements of different taxa in conservation planning. Further, it is obvious that the maintenance of various non-crop habitats and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes has an essential role in the preservation of red-listed species of boreal rural environments. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Despite this an important parcel of the threatened or near-threatened birds (33%) are grassland species. It may reflect the situation of their habitats, which are under intensive anthropogenic pressure due to, for example, extensive monocultures plantations of Pinusspp., for timber or other uses; hydroelectric dams; roads, inappropriate field management with fire and other kind of human environmental modifications. Based on almost all literature produced about the region and the field work done along the last 10 years focusing on the highlands and their species, we elaborated a brief diagnostic of the knowledge produced until here. We also described the situation of conservation considering the diversity and composition of birds and their habitats. We concluded that the number of published papers about stricted grassland birds is four times lower than the ones that involve birds of forested habitats. We presented 42 new records and/or distribution extensions of birds for the studied region, which reflects the current lack of knowledge about its specific diversity. We emphasized the necessity of conservation initiatives that consider important areas to grassland birds. We indicated four biodiversity conservation priority areas.},

abstract={Many scientists and forest land managers concur that past fire suppression, grazing, and timber harvesting practices have created unnatural and unhealthy conditions in the dry, ponderosa pine forests of the western United States. Specifically, such forests are said to carry higher fuel loads and experience fires that are more severe than those that occurred historically. It remains unclear, however, how far these generalizations can be extrapolated in time and space, and how well they apply to the more mesic ponderosa pine systems and to other forest systems within the western United States. I use data on the pattern of distribution of one bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) as derived from 16 465 sample locations to show that, in western Montana, this bird species is extremely specialized on severely burned forests. Such specialization has profound implications because it suggests that the severe fires we see burning in many forests in the Intermountain West are not entirely "unnatural" or "unhealthy." Instead, severely burned forest conditions have probably occurred naturally across a broad range of forest types for millennia. These findings highlight the fact that severe fire provides an important ecological backdrop for fire specialists like the Black-backed Woodpecker, and that the presence and importance of severe fire may be much broader than commonly appreciated. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Habitat restoration strategies for fragmented high Andean forest landscapes must consider the influence of within-patch habitat quality on bird abundance. I examined vegetation and bird abundance at three locations within a highly fragmented Polylepis forest landscape in the Cordillera Vilcanota, southern Peru. Across the landscape, there was significant variation in the vegetation structure of Polylepis forest patches of different size categories, especially in terms of tree girth, tree height, tree density, and canopy vegetation structure. Principal Component Analysis extracted five factors of habitat quality, which together accounted for 74.2% of the variability within 15 habitat variables. Polylepis bird species differed in their responses to habitat quality but, overall, variation in Polylepis bird abundance was not fully captured by the range of habitat quality variables. Tall, dense vegetation cover was clearly important for 11 conservation-important species, a high density of large trees was important for 10 species and primary forest ground cover was important for eight species. Habitat quality exhibited no significant influence on the abundance of only one species - Asthenes urubambensis. The abundance of seven species was associated with lower elevation forest, but only one species was associated with higher elevation forest. Management of habitat quality in large and medium remnant forest patches throughout the Cordillera Vilcanota, particularly in the 3800-4200 m elevation range, will be a cornerstone in ensuring the persistence of the majority of conservation-important bird species populations. © 2008 The Author.},

abstract={There is limited understanding of the influence of fire and vegetation structure on bird communities in dry oak (Quercus spp.) savannas of the Upper Midwest and whether bird communities in restored savanna habitats are similar to those in remnant savannas. During the 2001 and 2002 breeding seasons, we examined the relationship between bird communities and environmental variables, including vegetation characteristics and site prescribed-burn frequencies, across a habitat gradient in dry oak savannas in central Minnesota. The habitat gradient we studied went from: (1) prairie to (2) remnant oak savanna to (3) oak woodland undergoing savanna restoration via fire or mechanical removal of woody vegetation to (4) oak woodland. We conducted fixed-radius point counts (n = 120) within habitats with either prairie groundcover or predominately oak canopy. We described canopy and groundcover characteristics at a sub-sample (n = 28) of non-prairie points, and collected canopy and woody species richness data and prescribed-burn frequencies over the past 20 years for all points. Observed bird communities were most strongly correlated with canopy cover and burn frequency and, to a lesser extent, attributes of the shrub component. Most savanna points had bird communities that were distinct from those found at oak woodland or oak woodland points undergoing restoration via burning. Savanna points similar to oak woodland points were in areas managed by periodic cutting rather than burning. Remnant savanna bird communities were more strongly associated with prescribed burning than those in other habitat types, but it appeared that most oak woodlands that had undergone ≥ 20 years of prescribed burning remained ecologically distinct from remnant savannas. This suggests that some savannas that have converted to oak woodlands may exist in an alternative, or stable, ecological state even following extended restoration efforts.},

abstract={The coastal Jacarepaguá lowlands are situated in the western municipality of Rio de Janeiro, with a lagunar system including the most important coastal lagoons of the region. Originally, the region was covered by restinga scrub located in sand soils with several marshes and swamps areas. The intensive urban occupation, principally since the 1970's, has fragmented the natural landscapes in the region. Isolation has been the destiny of the local restinga vegetation, while lagoons have been polluted and diminished by deposition of sediment and detritus. Since May 2004 we have studied the birds of the Jacarepaguá lowlands. Several visits have been made to the municipal parks Chico Mendes, Bosque da Barra, Prainha and Marapendi. A bibliographical revision also was made searching by published ornithological studies in the region. A total of 176 species has been recently recorded for us in the field, corresponding to 63,5% of the 277 bird species known to the region. Thirty five species were never before reported for the Jacarepaguá lowlands, although some species are common in the region, as Pale-breasted Thrush Turdus leucomelas and the invaders Picazuro Pigeon Patagioenas picazuro and Chestnut-capped Blackbird Chrysomus ruficapillus. Important bird species are the winter visitants Black-backed Tanager Tangara peruviana (a probably threatened species in the state of Rio de Janeiro), Ruby-crowned Tanager Tachyphonus coronatus, and Creamybellied Thrush Turdus amaurochalinus. The first record of Picui Ground-Dove Columbina picui in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro was made in the Chico Mendes Municipal Park. Our study has shown a significative and inevitable reduction of the local bird diversity in the last decades due to increasing human occupation and the isolation of the natural environments in the region.},

abstract={In northern Europe, a long history of land use has led to profound changes within forest ecosystems. The white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) is one of several specialised forest species whose populations have declined. Conservation management directed at this species' habitat has made it a de facto umbrella species for conservation of the biodiversity associated with forests rich in deciduous trees and dead wood. We assessed empirically the value of the white-backed woodpecker as an indicator and umbrella species in central Sweden. Occurrence of the woodpecker in breeding bird atlas squares (5 × 5 km 2) indicated high species richness of forest birds, particularly species of special conservation concern, which included on average 13% more species in squares with than without the woodpecker. The number of red-listed cryptogam species expected to benefit from conservation actions directed at white-backed woodpecker habitats was higher in squares where the woodpecker bred compared to where is was absent. However, no such pattern was found for red-listed beetles, a group with very few records in the studied squares. White-backed woodpecker occurrence was positively associated with the current area of deciduous and mixed forest of high conservation value. Considering its indicator value, its specialised habitat requirements and its potential as a communication tool, using the white-backed woodpecker as an umbrella species may provide a coarse filter for the conservation of several other deciduous forest species. However, focusing solely on white-backed woodpecker habitat may not provide for the conservation of all such species, which stresses the need for a suite of complementary planning approaches. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Grassland birds have declined more than any other North American habitat-associated bird community. Because most species of grassland birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines, especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an alternative grassland management practice known as patch-burning has been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296 dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures. Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides further evidence that this practice can be a useful tool for grassland bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation, patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g., trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects of grazing, which are not available under traditional management. Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains.},

abstract={In a 2005 serological survey, carried out in response to an outbreak of H5N2 avian influenza (AI) in ostriches in the Eastern Cape Province, 16.3% of ostrich farms in the Western Cape Province of South Africa were found to be seropositive to H5 AI virus. We subsequently carried out a questionnaire-based census survey on all available registered Western Cape ostrich farms that still existed at the end of 2005 (367 farms, of which 82 were seropositive), in order to identify risk factors associated with farm-level seropositivity. A farm was classified as seropositive for H5 AI virus if one or more birds had tested positive (haemagglutination inhibition titre >1:16) in the 2005 survey, which had been designed to detect a minimum within-group seroprevalence of 10%. For each farm, risk factor information was collected using a questionnaire administered during a face-to-face interview with each farm owner or manager. Information was obtained on the ostrich population, movements of birds, environmental factors, management practices, and frequency of contact between ostriches and various wild bird species. Multiple logistic regression models were developed for the whole Western Cape Province and also for the two largest ostrich farming regions, "Klein Karoo" and "Southern Cape". Seroprevalence differed between regions, being highest in the Klein Karoo (31.6%). In all three models, increased risk of farm-level H5 AI virus seropositivity was associated with increasing numbers of ostriches, excluding chicks, present on the farm. Increased risk of seropositivity was associated with reduced frequency of cleaning of feed troughs (<1×/week vs. >1×/week), both overall (odds ratio (OR) = 4.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5, 13.3) and in the Southern Cape (OR = 53.6; 95% CI: 3.3, 864), and with failure to clean and disinfect transport vehicles, both overall (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.8) and in the Klein Karoo (OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 6.5). Increased risk of seropositivity was also associated with increasing frequency of contact of ostriches with certain wild bird species: overall with white storks (Ciconia ciconia), in the Southern Cape with gulls (Larus spp.), and in the Klein Karoo with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca). © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This study quantified combined effects of Imazopyr and prescribed fire on the breeding season avian community characteristics and pine volume growth in thinned, midrotation afforested loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L) plantations in Mississippi. Herbicide treatments were applied in fall of 2002 and winter burns were conducted during winter and early spring of 2002-2003. ES bird species richness was significantly greater in the treated plots compared with controls for both 2003 and 2004. Ten individual species exhibited treatment effects.

abstract={The Siskiyou Mountains of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon are a floristic hotspot, and the high diversity of conifers there likely results from a combination of geological, ecological, climatological and historical factors. To evaluate how past climate variability has influenced the composition, structure and fire regime of the Siskiyou forests, pollen, charcoal, and lithological evidence was examined from two lakes along a moisture gradient to reconstruct the vegetation, fire and climate history. The late-glacial period was characterized by subalpine parkland and infrequent fire at both sites. During the late-glacial/Early Holocene transition period, subalpine parkland was replaced by a closed forest of Pinus, Cupressaceae, Abies and Pseudotsuga and more frequent fires a 1000 years earlier at the wetter site, and it is likely that reduced Pacific Ocean upwelling created warmer drier conditions at the coast. In the Early Holocene, Pinus, Cupressaceae were less abundant and fire less frequent at the coastal site during a period of increased coastal upwelling and fog production. In the Late Holocene, Abies, Pseudotsuga, Pinus, and Quercus vaccinifolia increased in the forest at both sites suggesting a widespread response to cooling. Fewer fires at the wetter site may account for the abundance of Picea breweriana within the last 1000 years. The comparison of the two records implies that large-scale controls in climate during the last 14,000 cal yr BP have resulted in major changes in vegetation and fire regime. Asynchrony in the ecosystem response of wetter and drier sites arises from small-scale spatial variations in effective moisture and temperature resulting from topographically-influenced microclimates and coastal-to-inland climate gradients. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Boreal forest birds have adapted to changes caused by natural disturbances such as fire and this adaptation forms the basis for the Natural Disturbance Paradigm (NDP) underlying recent proposed changes in forest harvesting practices in western Canada. To date, this paradigm has been evaluated primarily at the stand level and within conventional harvesting systems. The potential for improvements in avian conservation at the landscape scale by adopting the NDP approach is largely unknown. We examined the effects of landscape-scale disturbances on forest bird communities by contrasting richness and abundance of birds in (1) 16 single-pass harvest sites with residual forest patches, (2) 29 multi-pass harvest sites with residuals; and (3) 15 salvage-logged post-fire sites with variable harvest intensity. We contrasted bird communities in these treatments with those in unsalvaged post-fire sites of similar age. Post-fire sites were used to provide a metric of the Natural Range of Variation (NRV) to be expected in bird communities. Sites were surveyed for avian community composition and abundance 1-5 years post-disturbance. Redundancy analysis indicated that bird communities differed from the NRV in all of the harvest treatments. However, single-pass harvests provided a somewhat better fit to NRV than did multi-pass harvesting. Avian community similarity was influenced by non-linear responses to area harvested, amount of residual retention, residual composition and pre-disturbance forest composition. An optimization routine created from a General Linear Model, suggests that community similarity to NRV can be maximized by using single-pass harvests over multi-pass harvests, harvesting 66-88% of the timber in the planning unit, and retaining 5-19% of the disturbance area as live residual patches, with 50% of harvests having at least 9% of the area in residuals.

abstract={We assessed responses of the breeding bird community to mechanical thinning and prescribed surface fire, alone and in combination, between 2000 and 2006 in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in northern Arizona, USA. Fuel-reduction treatments did not affect species richness or evenness, and effects on density of 5 commonly detected species varied among species. Populations of some species, such as the western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), increased following burning treatments, whereas others, such as the mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli), decreased in response to thinning treatments. Our results also identified a temporal response component, where avian community composition and structure changed synchronously on all treatments over time. Given the modest effects these small-scale fuel-reduction treatments had on avian composition and the specific density responses of particular species, our results suggest that land managers should consider implementing prescribed surface fire after thinning projects, where appropriate.},

abstract={Large tracts of natural habitat are being replaced by agriculture and urban sprawl in Mediterranean regions worldwide. We have limited knowledge about the effects of human activities on native species in these landscapes and which, if any, management practices might enhance the conservation of native biodiversity within them. Through a citizen volunteer bird-monitoring project, we compared bird abundance and species richness in northern Californian riparian zones surrounded by vineyards, urban areas, and natural areas. We assessed both local and landscape-level variables that may enhance native bird diversity in each land use type. We also demonstrate a new statistical approach, generalized estimating equations, to analyze highly variable data, such as that collected by volunteers. Avian abundance was highly correlated with both landscape context and local habitat variables, while avian richness was correlated with local habitat variables, specifically shrub richness, and percent of tree cover. In particular, shrub species richness has a strong positive correlation with riparian-preferring bird species. This suggests that active local management of riparian zones in human-dominated landscapes can increase our ability to retain native bird species in these areas. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The feather moss layer of boreal coniferous forests is known to buffer the underlying soil temperature and to be a major component in the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles by efficient scavenging of nutrients from throughfall and direct precipitation. Through indirect or direct effects the feather moss layer may also play a significant role in forming soil organism communities. In this 4-year experimental field study, the predatory Gamasina mite diversity was estimated in plots where the feather moss layer was removed or disturbed by turning over, in relation to that in control plots. Species richness, Shannon's diversity and equitability in spring but not autumn were decreased when the feather moss layer was removed. Those species that decreased in abundance and frequency tended to prefer the moss layer as opposed to the organic layer in control plots. The results suggest that the observed decline in diversity of the top carnivore microarthropod guilds was due mainly to a loss of moss habitat and not via changed abiotic conditions in the O horizon. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract={Point count distance sampling surveys were conducted at three sites in the Cordillera Vilcanota to determine whether variation in high-Andean species richness, diversity and abundance was a reflection of Polylepis habitat quantity. Bird community and abundance measures revealed that there was considerably variation in bird species richness, diversity and mean encounter rates between large, medium, and small forest patches. Densities of Polylepis-dependent bird species (including five globally-threatened and eight restricted-range species) were greater in larger forest patches and differed significantly between different patch size categories. Density estimates for matrix-dependent species were higher in smaller Polylepis patches indicating that the matrix exerts an influence on bird species composition and abundance in remnant Polylepis forests, particularly smaller patches. Comparison of lowland forest habitat specialists using three categories of rarity revealed that between 19-22% of all Polylepis-dependent species were intrinsically rare within larger forest patches, and a greater number (34-74%) were rare in smaller forest patches. Population estimates for all species, in particular for all threatened species, were extremely low, numbering ≤ 10 individuals at nine of the ten sites examined. The results suggest that declines in the densities of certain Polylepis birds may be predictable following habitat loss and that these patterns of rarity should govern population recovery goals through appropriate habitat restoration strategies. Such strategies are urgently required and must be designed to prevent further habitat loss, and to increase Polylepis habitat quantity to boost threatened bird populations in the Cordillera Vilcanota. © Birdlife International 2008.},

abstract={The diversity and relative abundance of birds were investigated in Alatish during the wet and dry seasons. Based on topographic map, satellite image and preliminary survey, four habitat types were identified comprising 37 blocks in 100 km2. Eleven blocks were randomly selected based on the type of vegetation. Transects of 10 krn length and width of 0.2 km or less were randomly selected to cover 20% of the area. One hundred forty three species of birds including endangered, rare and vulnerable species were recorded. Sixty five species of birds were residents during both seasons. A total of 122 species of birds was recorded during the wet season and 86 during the dry season. The relative abundance of birds was determined using encounter rates that give ordinal scale. This resulted in 97 species of birds as rare, 20 uncommon, 19 frequent, four common and three abundant. The wet season survey showed highest species diversity in the wooded grassland habitat owing to the presence of resources. The dry season survey showed the highest avian species diversity, evenness and richness in the riverine woodland habitat due to the availability of water. Most species of birds in Alatish were locally rare as a result of habitat degradation. This hindered the establishment of species distribution pattern especially during the dry season. Availability of food, water and cover were the major factors determining the diversity and abundance of birds. Habitat destruction by the nomadic Falata community with their livestock, poaching and forest fire contributed to the deterioration in the diversity and number of birds. Urgent conservation measures are needed to conserve the biological diversity of Alatish. © National Institute of Ecology, New Delhi.},

abstract={Breeding bird communities were studied by line-transect in burnt pinewood and unburnt pinewoods, during three years subsequently to a fire event, in a coastal woodland of Mediterranean central Italy. We analyzed data following a diversity/dominance approach that ranks the species in order of their abundance, to obtain rank/abundance diagrams ('Whittaker plots'). Although it is generally accepted that fire may induce structural changes in forest communities of breeding birds, we observed more evident effects when considering the assemblage of forest-specialist species. When considering the whole community of birds, ordinate intercepts of the regression between rank and relative abundance of species were not significantly different between unburnt and burnt plots in any of the three years of study. However, when considering only the forest-related species, there was a significant difference between unburnt and burnt plots in all the years of study. Evenness showed lower values that were explicited by the diversity/dominance diagrams (lower collocation of the curves of burnt pinewoods if compared to unburnt ones). Overall, the patterns observed in this study suggest that the effects of fire disturbance were more evident at the ecological level than at the taxonomic-level assemblages. The gradual decline of the more sensitive species due to fires and the proportional increase of edge/generalist species may induce a species turnover in burnt woods with cascade and relaxation effects which could be evidenced by diversity/dominance diagrams. Consequently, it is useful to separate the effects of fires at community-level and at assemblage-level when studying bird communities in areas subjected to fires. © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

abstract={Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests with Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) are associated with higher bird abundance and diversity than are ponderosa pine forests lacking Gambel oak. Little is known, however, about specific structural characteristics of Gambel oak trees, clumps, and stands that may be important to birds in ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (hereafter pine-oak) forests. We examined associations among breeding birds and structural characteristics of Gambel oak at a scale similar in size to individual bird territories in pine-oak forests in northern Arizona and western New Mexico, USA. Avian species richness and occurrence of some bird species were associated with specific growth forms of Gambel oak. Estimated probability of Virginia's warblers (Vermivora virginiae), black-headed grosbeaks (Pheucticus melanocephalus), and red-faced warblers (Cardellina rubrifrons) occurring at points increased with increasing density of pole-sized Gambel oak 7-15 cm in diameter at breast height. We also found evidence that large Gambel oak trees (≥23 cm dbh) were associated with increased occurrence of yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata) at points. Some avian associations with oak were influenced by characteristics of ponderosa pines. For example, bird species richness was positively associated with the abundance of large Gambel oak when density of large pine trees ≥23 cm in diameter at breast height was low. Because large oak trees are rare and their numbers are thought to be declining, efforts should be made to retain and promote growth of additional oaks in this size class. Forest management practices that maintain forest openings, such as prescribed burning, could promote growth of pole-sized Gambel oak, which appears important to some bird species in pine-oak forests.},

abstract={The effectiveness of agri-environment schemes (AESs) in promoting biodiversity was recently debated. One reason for limited effectiveness of AESs may be their application to small and scattered patches of land. This study presents the evaluation of a scheme adopted by the canton of Aargau, Switzerland, which seems to be unique in its consequent focus on entire farms, aiming at increasing quality and quantity of ecological compensated areas (ECAs). In vascular plants and snails, the species richness increased during a period of 5 years on plots with AES, but not on control plots without AES. In butterflies and birds, no significant differences were found between AES plots and control plots in the change of species richness over time. While butterfly species numbers generally decreased, bird species numbers increased on both AES plots and control plots. It appears that agri-environment schemes can be effective in protecting and promoting biodiversity, but the effect may depend on the group of organisms. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Forest plantations of exotic conifers represent an important economic activity in NW Patagonia, Argentina. However, there is a remarkable lack of information on the impact of forestry on native biodiversity. We analyzed the effect of Pinus ponderosa plantations on bird communities, considering different stand management practices (dense and sparse tree covers), and different landscape contexts where they are planted (Austrocedrus chilensis forest and steppe). Ultimately we wished to assess in which way plantations may be designed and managed to improve biodiversity conservation. Bird richness and abundance did not change significantly in the steppe, although community composition did, and was partially replaced by a new community, similar to that of ecotonal forests. In contrast, in the A. chilensis forest areas, species richness decreased in dense plantations, but bird community composition remained relatively constant when replacing the native forest with pine plantations. Also, in A. chilensis forest, stand management practices aiming at maintaining low tree densities permit the presence of many bird species from the original habitat. In the steppe area in turn, both dense and sparse plantations are unsuitable for most steppe species, thus it is necessary to manage them at higher scales, maintaining the connectivity of the native matrix to prevent the fragmentation of bird populations. We conclude that pine plantations can provide habitat for a substantial number of native bird species, and this feature varies both with management practices and with the landscape context of areas where afforestation occurs. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={This study examined the importance of natural and manmade structural features on the avian community relative to management-induced vegetation dynamics. The study was conducted within the context of two alternative vegetation management treatments applied to pastures on a tallgrass prairie site in northcentral Oklahoma from 2001 to 2003. The brown-headed cowbird, a brood parasite, and the grasshopper sparrow, a common grassland obligate species, were most abundant in areas managed under a traditional treatment in which entire pastures were annually burned. Conversely, Henslow's sparrow, a grassland obligate of conservation concern, was completely absent from traditional treatment pastures. Total bird species diversity and grassland obligate richness was highest in the patch-burn treatment, in which only discrete portions of each pasture were burned each year to create a mosaic of vegetation 'patches' in various stages of recovery from disturbance. Models of bird abundance reflected not only species-specific vegetation preferences, but also the often negative influence of structural features such as woody edges, roads, and ponds on breeding bird use of grasslands. Our study demonstrated that both disturbance-derived vegetation attributes and structural features contribute to heterogeneity and influence subsequent use by and composition of grassland bird communities. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={We compared the effects of two contrasting silvicultural treatments and prescribed fire on bird occupancy at Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest. Each silvicultural treatment was applied to two approximately 100 ha units within each of three blocks. Prescribed burning was applied to one-half of each silvicultural treatment in a split-plot design. Occupancy was estimated at eight points in each plot for 11 bird species and three foraging guilds (bark gleaners, woodpeckers, and foliage gleaners). The frequencies of species detections on the point counts were used to estimate species richness on each plot. Occupancy did not differ among treatments for any of the guilds. Four of the 11 bird species, the American robin (Turdus migratorius L., 1766), the chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina (Bechstein, 1798)), the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis Latham, 1790), and the western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana (A. Wilson, 1811)), showed responses to the treatments. Species richness did not differ between the silvicultural or the burn treatments. The general lack of response of the bird community to the silvicultural and burn treatments is likely a result of the relatively large size of the trees and snags retained on both silvicultural treatments, the low intensity of the prescribed burns, and the lack of a strong contrast in tree density between the silvicultural treatments. © 2008 NRC.},

abstract={Identification of valid indicators of biodiversity is a critical need for sustainable forest management. We developed compositional, structural and functional indicators of biodiversity for five taxonomic groups-bryophytes, vascular plants, spiders, hoverflies and birds-using data from 44 Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) plantation forests in Ireland. The best structural biodiversity indicator was stand stage, defined using a multivariate classification of forest structure variables. However, biodiversity trends over the forest cycle and between tree species differ among the taxonomic groups studied. Canopy cover was the main structural indicator and affected other structural variables such as cover of lower vegetation layers. Other structural indicators included deadwood and distances to forest edge and to broadleaved woodland. Functional indicators included stand age, site environmental characteristics and management practices. Compositional indicators were limited to more easily identifiable plant and bird species. Our results suggest that the biodiversity of any one of the species groups we surveyed cannot act as a surrogate for all of the other species groups. However, certain subgroups, such as forest bryophytes and saproxylic hoverflies, may be able to act as surrogates for each other. The indicators we have identified should be used together to identify stands of potentially high biodiversity or to evaluate the biodiversity effects of silvicultural management practices. They are readily assessed by non-specialists, ecologically meaningful and applicable over a broad area with similar climate conditions and silvicultural systems. The approach we have used to develop biodiversity indicators, including stand structural types, is widely relevant and can enhance sustainable forest management of plantations. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={In contrast to most other European breeding sites, the breeding population of the Redshank Tringa totanus in the European Wadden Sea is stable in most areas of the ecosystem. As suggested by recent studies on hatching success, however, Redshank reproduction is spatially variable and cannot reliably explain the population trend mentioned above. From 2004 to 2006, a telemetry study on Redshank chicks was conducted in Petersgroden (mainland) and on the island of Wangerooge to record annual breeding success and its spatial variability and to derive predictions on future population trends. Due to lower predation, birds on Wangerooge achieved considerably higher hatching success than birds at the mainland (2005/06: 64 and 93% of clutches vs. 4 to 15%, 2004-2005). Apart from total losses due to weather conditions in 2004 at the mainland, chick mortality was relatively constant between regions and years (70-80%). Derived from chick mortality, breeding success was 0.51 (2005) and 1.0 (2006) chicks per pair on Wangerooge and constantly 0.15 chicks per pair at the mainland. Considering published estimates of annual subadult (35%) and adult (25%) mortality, breeding success achieved during this study should not be sufficient to maintain the regional population of the mainland study site. In contrast, the Wangerooge population produced more chicks than needed to sustain its local population. The assumption of spatially varying reproduction of Redshanks breeding in the Wadden Sea could be confirmed by this study. However, it still has to be clarified whether Redshank population dynamics is explained by this varying breeding success. Due to a lack of knowledge in annual survival rates, the necessity of initiating an integrated population monitoring project is discussed. As additionally revealed by chick telemetry, non-fledged chicks were found up to only about 200 m from its former nest site and used about 0.4 ha of the respective saltmarsh habitat. Small home range sizes of Redshank broods within the saltmarsh suggest a potential vulnerability to agricultural habitat management, especially to mowing. Derived from these results, it is unlikely that agriculture is an appropriate way of managing saltmarsh for breeding birds. © DO-G, IfV, MPG 2008.},

abstract={To examine the relationship between forest succession following fire and the composition of bird communities, we investigated the vegetation structure, bird population density, foraging behavior and guild structure in bamboo grasslands (11 years since the last fire), pine savanna (41 years), pine woodland (58 years), old-growth hemlock forest (never burned), and old-growth spruce forest (never burned) in the Tatachia area of central Taiwan. Canopy height, total foliage cover, tree density, total basal area of tree, total basal area of snags, foliage height diversity, and tree species richness all increased with successional age. However, shrub cover peaked in intermediate successional stages. The vertical profile of foliage cover was more diverse in later successional forests, which had more breeding bird species and ecological guilds. All the breeding bird species recorded in early and intermediate stages were also found distributed in the late successional forests. Because Taiwan has high precipitation and humidity, and most forest fires in Taiwan are caused by human activities, forest fires and large areas of early successional vegetation were probably rare in the mountain areas of Taiwan prior to the arrival of humans. Therefore, bird species have not had enough time to adapt to areas with early or intermediate successional vegetation. Moreover, late successional forests host all the major plant species found in the early and intermediate stages and have higher foliage height diversity index, which was positively correlated with the bird species richness and bird species diversity index in this study. As a result, all breeding bird species and guilds in the area can be found in late successional forests. Efforts for conserving avian diversity in Taiwan should focus on protecting the remaining native old-growth forests. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Large cavity-nesting birds depend on large-diameter trees for suitable nest sites. The increased spatial extent of commercial timber harvesting is modifying forest structure across the land base and may thus compromise the availability of large trees at the landscape scale. In this study, our objectives were to (1) characterize the availability of large living and dead trees in old-growth stands dominated by different tree species and surficial deposits that encompass the range of natural cover types of eastern Québec's boreal forest; (2) analyze the distribution of trees among decay-classes; and (3) compare the availability of large trees in unharvested, remnant, and harvested stands for the entire range of decay-classes. A total of 116 line transects were distributed across unharvested forests, remnant linear forests, and cutblocks in cutover areas. Unharvested forest stands (black spruce [Picea mariana], balsam fir [Abies balsamea]-black spruce, balsam fir-white spruce [Picea glauca] and balsam fir) reflected a gradient of balsam fir dominance. The remnant forests selected were isolated for 5-15 years. Analyses were performed at two diameter cut-off values. Trees with DBH ≥20 cm were considered for availability of total trees whereas trees with DBH ≥30 cm were considered for availability of large trees. Forest stands comprised high proportions of standing dead trees (33% of all stems, 8% were large dead stems). Availability of total and large standing trees increased with the dominance of balsam fir in stands. Forest stands located on thick surficial deposits showed higher densities of large dead trees for every stand type suggesting a higher productivity on those sites. Availability of stems according to decay-classes showed a dome-shaped distribution with higher densities of snags in intermediate decay stages. However, for large stems, black spruce stands showed a significantly lower availability that was consistent across all decay-classes. In linear remnant forests, pure balsam fir stands were absent. Remnant stands thus showed a much lower availability in large trees when compared with unharvested balsam fir stands. Clearcuts had the lowest densities of dead trees across sampled stands. Current even-aged management practices clearly affect availability and recruitment of large trees, therefore forest-dwelling wildlife relying on these structures for breeding is likely to be affected by large-scale harvesting in coniferous boreal forests.},

abstract={Conservation programs that facilitate restoration of natural areas on private land are one of the best strategies for recovery of valuable wetland acreage in critical ecoregions of the United States. Wetlands enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) provide many ecological functions but may be particularly important as habitat for migrant and resident waterbirds; however, use of, and factors associated with use of, CREP wetlands as stopover and breeding sites have not been evaluated. We surveyed a random sample of CREP wetlands in the Illinois River watershed in 2004 and 2005 to quantify use of restored wedands by spring migrating and breeding waterbirds. Waterbirds used 75% of wetlands during spring migration. Total use-day abundance for the entire spring migration ranged from 0 to 49,633 per wetland and averaged 6,437 ± 1,887 (SE). Semipermanent wetlands supported the greatest total number of use-days and the greatest number of use-days relative to wetland area. Species richness ranged from 0 to 42 (x - = 10.0 ± 1.5 [SE]), and 5 of these species were classified as endangered in Illinois. Density of waterfowl breeding pairs ranged from 0.0 pairs/ha to 16.6 pairs/ha (x - = 1.9 ± 0.5 [SE] pairs/ha), and 16 species of wetland birds were identified as local breeders. Density of waterfowl broods ranged from 0.0 broods/ha to 3.6 broods/ha and averaged 0.5 ± 0.1 (SE) broods/ha. We also modeled spring stopover use, waterbird species richness, and waterfowl reproduction in relation to spatial, physical, and floristic characteristics of CREP wetlands. The best approximating models to explain variation in all 3 dependent variables included only the covariate accounting for level of hydrologic management (i.e., none, passive, or active). Active management was associated with 858% greater use-days during spring than sites with only passive water management. Sites where hydrology was passively managed also averaged 402% greater species richness than sites where no hydrologic management was possible. Density of waterfowl broods was 120% greater on passively managed sites than on sites without water management but was 29% less on sites with active compared to passive hydrologic management. Densities of waterfowl broods also were greatest when ratios of open water to cover were 70:30. Models that accounted for vegetation quality and landscape variables ranked lower than models based solely on hydrologie management or vegetation cover in all candidate sets. Although placement and clustering of sites may be critical for maintaining populations of some wetland bird species, these factors appeared to be less important for attracting migrant waterbirds in our study area. In the context of restored CREP wetlands, we suggest the greatest gains in waterbird use and reproduction may be accomplished by emphasizing site-specific restoration efforts related to hydrology and floristic structure.},

abstract={Unique components of tropical habitats, such as abundant vascular epiphytes, influence the distribution of species and can contribute to the high diversity of many animal groups in the tropics. However, the role of such features in habitat selection and demography of individual species has not been established. Understanding the mechanisms of habitat selection requires both experimental manipulation of habitat structure and detailed estimation of the behavioral and demographic response of animals, e.g., changes in movement patterns and survival probabilities. Such studies have not been conducted in natural tropical forest, perhaps because of high habitat heterogeneity, high species diversity, and low abundances of potential target species. Agroforestry systems support a less diverse flora, with greater spatial homogeneity which, in turn, harbors lower overall species diversity with greater numerical dominance of common species, than natural forests. Furthermore, agroforestry systems are already extensively managed and lend themselves easily to larger scale habitat manipulations than protected natural forest. Thus, agroforestry systems provide a good model environment for beginning to understand processes underlying habitat selection in tropical forest animals. Here, we use multistate, capture-recapture models to investigate how the experimental removal of epiphytes affected monthly movement and survival probabilities of two resident bird species (Common Bush-Tanager [Chlorospingus ophthalmicus] and Golden-crowned Warbler [Basileuterus culicivorus]) in a Mexican shade coffee plantation. We established two paired plots of epiphyte removal and control. We found that Bush-Tanagers were at least five times more likely to emigrate from plots where epiphytes were removed compared to control plots. Habitat-specific movement patterns were not detected in the warbler. However, unlike the Golden-crowned Warbler, Common Bush-Tanagers depend upon epiphytes for nest sites and (seasonally) for foraging. These dispersal patterns imply that active habitat selection based on the presence or absence of epiphytes occurs in C. ophthalmicus on our study area. Survival rates did not vary with habitat in either species. Interestingly, in both species, survival was higher in the nonbreeding season, when birds were in mixed-species flocks. Movement by Common Bush-Tanagers into areas with epiphytes occurred mostly during the breeding season, when mortality-driven opportunity was greatest. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={We report the effects of an extensive (&gt;7000 km 2), high-intensity late-dry-season fire in the central Kimberley, Western Australia, on the species richness and abundance of mammals, reptiles and birds. Five weeks after the fire we surveyed 12 sites (six burnt, six unburnt); each pair of sites was closely matched for soil type and vegetation. The species richness and abundance of mammals and reptiles was greater at unburnt sites, especially for mammals (with a 4-fold difference in abundance between burnt and unburnt sites). There was an indication that reptiles immigrated into unburnt patches, but mammals did not. There were also species-specific responses to the fire: Rattus tunneyi and Pseudomys nanus were much more abundant in unburnt sites, whereas Pseudomys delicatulus was caught in equal numbers at burnt and unburnt sites. Diurnal reptiles were more abundant at unburnt sites, but nocturnal reptiles were equally common at burnt and unburnt sites. Avian species richness and overall abundance was similar between burnt and unburnt patches, although a few species showed preferences for one state or the other. The overall high trapping success for mammals (18% across all sites; 28% in unburnt patches) contrasts with the well documented mammal collapse in parts of northern Australia and seems paradoxical given that our study area has experienced the same increase in fire frequency and extent that is often blamed for species collapse. However, our study area has fewer pressures from other sources, including grazing by large herbivores, suggesting that the effects of these pressures, and their interaction with fire, may have been underestimated in previous studies. © CSIRO 2008.},

abstract={Tree planting has become a cornerstone strategy for natural resource management in agricultural landscapes, yet its contribution as habitat for woodland birds has not been fully investigated. A case study from the Holbrook region in southern New South Wales was used to assess woodland birds in young plantings of native trees and shrubs. Ground-foraging insectivorous woodland birds were under-represented in the plantings, partly due to a lack of native forb diversity (wildflowers) and leaf litter. Of 69 woodland bird species recorded over a three-year period, 48 species (70%) occurred in planted sites, 59 species (86%) occurred in remnant woodland, and 34 species (49%) occurred in adjacent paddock sites. The greater diversity of birds in planted sites relative to paddock sites was mostly due to understorey birds. The proportion of mist-netted birds recaptured was similar in both planted (15%) and remnant woodland (16%) sites, suggesting that individual birds were staying in planted sites. The proportion of woodland birds showing breeding activity (as measured by the presence of a brood patch) was slightly lower in planted sites (24% of all woodland species) than in remnant woodland (29%). Birds such as the superb fairy-wren, red-browed finch and southern whiteface were more likely to occur in planted sites, suggesting that plantings provide unique, transitional-stage habitat within agricultural landscapes. Restoring native forbs, as part of a broader strategy of woodland management, will help to reverse the decline of ground-foraging insectivorous woodland birds in agricultural landscapes. © CSIRO 2008.},

abstract={Large urban parks can support a diverse bird community. However, the effects of variability among habitats and of park management on bird assemblages are poorly understood. We studied bird communities within the Yarkon Park, Tel Aviv, the largest urban park in Israel. We examined species richness, abundance and community composition across 20 locations that differ in levels of park management to identify habitat variables responsible for variation in bird richness and composition. Of 91 recorded bird species, 13 were aliens (14%), 4 were urban exploiters (4%), 54 were urban adapters (60%) and 20 were migrants (22%). Management had a significant effect on native bird richness and bird community structure varied among areas with different management regimes. Species richness of all the above species' groups was lowest in intensively managed areas. Areas with intermediate levels of management had higher or equal richness compared to unmanaged areas. The majority of urban exploiters were found at all locations within the park reaching their highest abundances in intensively managed areas. Species richness of alien birds did not vary across levels of management. Bird species richness was negatively associated with lawn cover and with distance from nearest water source and was positively associated with the number of woody plant species. We suggest that urban parks should be designed such that the heterogeneity of native vegetation is preserved, if we aim to maintain native bird species diversity and minimize urban exploiter and alien species. When lightly managed or unmanaged, urban parks can retain large remnants of sub-natural habitats and can serve as important contributors to the conservation of native biodiversity within a large urban metropolis. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Many of the world's large river systems have been greatly altered in the past century due to river regulation, agriculture, and invasion of introduced Tamarix spp. (saltcedar, tamarisk). These riverine ecosystems are known to provide important habitat for avian communities, but information on responses of birds to differing levels of Tamarix is not known. Past research on birds along the Colorado River has shown that avian abundance in general is greater in native than in non-native habitat. In this article, we address habitat restoration on the lower Colorado River by comparing abundance and diversity of avian communities at a matrix of different amounts of native and non-native habitats at National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona. Two major patterns emerged from this study: (1) Not all bird species responded to Tamarix in a similar fashion, and for many bird species, abundance was highest at intermediate Tamarix levels (40-60%), suggesting a response threshold. (2) In Tamarix-dominated habitats, the greatest increase in bird abundance occurred when small amounts of native vegetation were present as a component of that habitat. In fact, Tamarix was the best vegetation predictor of avian abundance when compared to vegetation density and canopy cover. Our results suggest that to positively benefit avian abundance and diversity, one cost-effective way to rehabilitate larger monoculture Tamarix stands would be to add relatively low levels of native vegetation (∼20-40%) within homogenous Tamarix habitat. In addition, this could be much more cost effective and feasible than attempting to replace all Tamarix with native vegetation. © 2008 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract={Key physicochemical factors associated with microbial community composition and functions in Australian agricultural soils were identified. Soils from seven field sites, with varying long-term agricultural management regimes, were characterised physicochemically, on the basis of their bacterial and fungal community structures (using PCR-DGGE), and by assessing potential catabolic functions (MicroResp™). Soil type, rather than agricultural management practice, was the key determinant of microbial community structure and catabolic function (P<0.05). Following multivariate analysis, soil pH was identified as the key habitat-selective physicochemical soil property associated with variation in biological diversity and profiles of organic substrate utilisation. In particular, the capacity of soils to catabolise different C-substrates was closely correlated (ρ=0.604, P=0.001) to pH. With decreasing pH, the catabolism of common low molecular weight organic compounds (especially cysteine and aspartic acid) declined, however catabolism of two others (lysine and arginine) increased. Shifts in the capacity of soil microbiota to cycle common organic compounds have implications for overall geochemical cycling of C and N in acidifying soils. The genetic structure of the bacterial communities in soil strongly correlated with pH (ρ=0.722; P=0.001) and that of soil fungi with pH and % sand (ρ=0.323; P=0.006). Catabolic function was more closely associated with the structure of the bacterial than fungal communities. This work has shown that soil pH is a primary driver of microbial diversity and function in soil. Agricultural management practices thereby act to selectively shift populations and functions against this background. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We studied bird community composition and abundance within the logged and unlogged forest areas of a certified forestry concession in lowland Bolivia. The logged forest was harvested using reduced-impact logging techniques between one and four years previously. We used canonical correspondence analysis to describe the relationship between selected environmental variables and bird species abundance data, and the Indicator Value procedure to test for associations between bird species and the logged and unlogged habitats. Approximately one-third of birds were restricted to either the logged or unlogged areas, with 20% of all species only encountered in, or significantly more abundant in, the unlogged areas of the concession. The majority of birds found in significantly higher abundance in the unlogged areas of the concession were associated with forest habitats dominated by large trees, or a high diversity of trees, providing dense canopy cover and deep leaf litter, with an understorey dominated by ferns. Over 40% of bird species that were significantly associated with the unlogged areas of the concession are of conservation concern. In contrast, the majority of birds associated with the logged areas of the concession are known to be relatively resilient to human disturbance. The majority of species which exhibited significant lower abundances in the logged areas of the concession belonged to insectivorous or frugivorous feeding guilds. We discuss whether current management practices within this certified concession are sustainable and how our results can be used to guide future research and inform better practice. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Large wildfires are common in many western coniferous forests, and these fires can affect woodpecker reproduction and habitat use. Our objectives were to examine nesting densities, reproductive parameters, and species-specific habitat selection of woodpeckers in a recently burned region of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, between 2001 and 2004. Postfire nesting densities were greatest in areas dominated by high prefire canopy cover, and reproductive success averaged >70%. For some species of woodpeckers, factors such as diameter at breast height, burn severity, and distance to unburned patches were important for nest-site selection. Our data indicated that nesting densities of many woodpeckers in the Black Hills were lower than what has been recorded elsewhere following recent, large wildfires in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. Management activities that simulate mixed-severity fire effects and retain higher numbers of large snags are likely to benefit cavity nesters in this region.},

abstract={GIS and aerial photographic techniques were lied to assessing riparian vegetation quality in an agricultural landscape formerly covered in lowland rainforest. Canopy cover and width of woody riparian vegetation, both easily determined from remotely sensed data, were investigated as indicators of riparian quality. High correlations between field measurements of canopy cover and width of woody riparian vegetation with several other vegetation attributes indicative of vegetation quality (weed abundance, debris, human disturbance, native species richness) demonstrated that these two habitat attributes were suitable field vegetation quality surrogates. Desktop quality analysis combined GIS measurement of riparian width with aerial photographic analysis of canopy cover. Desktop quality equalled field quality in 78% of cases, with a further 13% showing errors due to clearing or thickening of vegetation after aerial photographs were taken. Bird communities in higher vegetation quality areas comprised mainly rainforest-depandent species, whereas poor quality areas mostly supported birds of open habitats. Bird community diversity and rainforest-dependent bird diversity increased significantly both with increasing levels of canopy cover and greater riparian width, but a combination of these factors explained more variance than each factor separately. Desktop riparian vegetation quality therefore proved a satisfactory indicator of habitat quality for birds in rainforest riparian zones. This quick and efficient desktop method of riparian habitat quality assessment can determine conservation values of rainforest riparian areas with minimal field validation, thereby allowing more effective targeting of appropriate management practices, identification of areas of conservation concern and prioritisation of revegetation and rehabilitation efforts.},

abstract={Capsule: Farmland bird species occurred at low densities and were highly aggregated in a small proportion of available pastures, stubble fields and farmyards. Aim: To document the current distribution and abundance of farmland birds and their habitats within the lowland farmland of Britain in winter. Methods: Over three winters volunteer observers visited a stratified random sample of 1090 1-km squares within which they counted a suite of 30 farmland bird species and mapped agricultural habitats. Results: For individual species, less than 10% of habitat patches were occupied and densities in occupied patches were low. Several differences were apparent in patterns of relative abundance compared to the 1980s. In particular marked declines of Tree Sparrow and Corn Bunting were apparent. The national distribution of cereal stubbles was localized. A large proportion of most species was found in grassland. Positive associations at the patch scale were apparent for improved grassland by invertebrate feeders and cereal and maize stubbles and farmyards, mostly by granivores. Conclusion: Many farmland passerines are highly aggregated, even within particularly favoured field types. These results are consistent with winter food resources being highly localized and the need to create more food-rich patches if declines are to be reversed. © 2008 British Trust for Ornithology.},

abstract={Predicting how bird populations may respond to climate change is a major challenge which could be addressed by understanding how past environmental processes have driven the variations of breeding population size and productivity. In inhabited regions, this issue may be complicated by the interference associated with heterogeneous levels of habitat management. Here, we have explored how several hydrological variables influenced the breeding of the Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus in the Camargue (Rhone delta, southern France) over a 28-year period (1974-2001). In this region, Flamingos breed in a commercial salt pan. They forage in both salt pans and adjacent brackish lagoons. We hypothesized that breeding numbers, productivity and body condition of chicks at fledging were influenced positively by water levels of the Vaccares, the main lagoon of the delta, in spring (water and food availability) and the Rhone discharge in winter (nutrient availability in the salt pans). We controlled for variations of the flooding date of the breeding salt pan by the salt company and the size of the breeding island. We first found the Vaccares water levels and Rhone discharge to be negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Secondly, the number of Flamingo breeding pairs (range 3560-22 200) increased by 1767 ± 1418 (95% CI) with a 10-day advance of the flooding date of the breeding salt pan and by 1146 ± 1081 per 10-cm water level rise in the Vaccares. Productivity was 0.46 ± 0.41 chicks per pair and could not be explained by any of the variables considered. Finally, chick body condition decreased with the number of breeding pairs and Rhone discharge. Our results show that (1) this intensely managed system remains sensitive to large-scale climate variations, (2) the breeding of the Greater Flamingo is affected by both climate variations and management of the salt pan, and (3) the expected enhancement of delta productivity by high river discharge was absent, probably prevented by dykes and embankments along the river. The response of bird populations to climate variations can thus be complex in intensely managed biological systems as found in the Mediterranean. We encourage pursuing such analyses incorporating anthropogenic variables explicitly in order to expand our capacity to make inference on the future of these systems. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={In British Columbia, Canada, management efforts used to control mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks have included treatment of infested trees with an organic arsenic pesticide, monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA). Cumulative pesticide applications over a large geographic area have generated concerns about arsenic loading in the environment and potential toxicity to nontarget wildlife. We investigated woodpecker foraging patterns in infested stands with and without MSMA treatment using a combination of tree debarking indices, point count surveys, and radiotelemetry methods in addition to insect flight traps to measure mountain pine beetle emergence. Debarking indices indicated woodpecker foraging of MSMA-treated trees was significantly lower than nontreated trees in all sampling years. However, ∼40% of MSMA trees had some evidence of foraging. Focal observations of foraging woodpeckers and point count surveys in MSMA treatment areas further confirmed that several species of woodpeckers regularly used MSMA stands during the breeding season. Radio-tagged Hairy (Picoides villosus) and Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) Woodpeckers spent on average 13% and 23% (range 0-66%) of their time, respectively, in treated stands, despite the fact that these areas only comprised on average 1-2% of their core home range (1 km2). MSMA strongly reduced the emergence of several bark beetle (Coleoptera, Scolytidae) species including the mountain pine beetle, and there was a highly significant positive relationship between Dendroctonus beetle abundance and Three-toed Woodpecker abundance. This study identifies the potential negative impact that forest management practices using pesticides can have on woodpecker populations that depend on bark beetles and their host trees. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Georgia land lottery maps from the 1820s reveal two tree species, water oak (Quercus nigra) and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), were formerly limited to major floodplains in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain. These species are now common in upland sites as a result of past land use and disruption of fire regimes. We investigated the effect this invasion had on breeding bird diversity in upland mixed pine (Pinus spp.) stands based on 90 point counts conducted in spring 2005. Half of these stands had no water oak or sweetgum (open stands) and half had a minimum of 25% of their basal area as water oak and/or sweetgum (invaded stands). Bird species richness and abundance were 42 and 41% lower, respectively, in invaded stands. Thirty-five bird species had more than 20 records and were tested for an association with invaded stands. No species were positively associated with invaded stands while 10 were negatively associated with invaded stands; these were mostly grassland pine savanna and shrubland bird species of high conservation value. Invasion of upland pine forest by these native tree species is similar to invasion by exotic species, and appears to disrupt ecosystem function causing declines in bird diversity.},

abstract={The main objective of this paper was to investigate factors that affect bird species diversity at local spatial scales including the role of habitat heterogeneity. The studies were carried out in a mosaic landscape of southern Poland, in habitat fragments, each described by variables which characterised the size of the plot and its spatial structure, including vegetation. A species diversity index was then calculated for each plot using Shannon-Wiener index, based on count of nesting birds obtained through territory mapping method. Correspondence analysis (CA) was then used to illustrate relationships between groups of plots of different scopes of species diversity and the measured characteristics of the plots. The high diversity among birds was found to be primarily connected with an increase in the proportion of old forest, whereas the diversity decreased with an increase in the proportion of 'farmland' (including meadows and pastures). Other significant effects on the changes in species diversity were exerted by the degree of density in the herb layer and the tree canopy layer, as well as by the presence of wetlands. The local-scale inertia in the heterogeneous-type habitats results primarily from the differences in quality and structure of the plot, which reflect their position between the 'forest' - 'non-forest' gradient. In the studied range of sizes (0.2-40 ha), the size of a given plot is of lesser significance than that of the vegetation structure. All the variables which represent potential effects upon the local-scale diversity of birds, and the suitability of CA are discussed against the background of the results of this study and available literature data.},

abstract={The variability of natural disturbance regimes implies that retention cutting, aimed at emulating natural disturbances to support biodiversity, should be forest-type specific. We explored in four site types (ranging from dry nutrient-poor to wet nutrient-rich) in Estonia how the retention of live and dead trees affects post-cut abundance and species richness of birds. The whole bird communities and harvest-sensitive species groups responded differently: while the total abundance and relative species richness of birds increased along with the abundance of dead trees, the species of national conservation concern occurred more frequently at higher densities of live trees. Hence, although the species of conservation concern and hole-nesters preferred the cuts having the generally densest and most species-rich avian communities, this co-variation was obviously insufficient for using the total community characteristics (particularly density) as indicators of forestry impacts on bird biodiversity. In contrast to expectations, tree retention always influenced birds independently of forest type. This may be related to the particular study system (notably low retention levels) but future studies should nevertheless explicitly address to what extent forest species are adapted to natural disturbances, and in which cases that knowledge can be used for forestry planning. © Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2007.

abstract={Climate change and fire suppression have facilitated expansion of pinyon-juniper woodlands into sagebrush-steppe ecosystems of the Great Basin, USA, resulting in a loss of biological diversity. To assess the effects of using prescribed fire in restoration efforts, ant abundance, species richness, and composition were examined pre- and post-burn along the elevation and tree cover gradients encompassed by a pinyon-juniper woodland in a central Nevada watershed. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps in 6 sites for the elevation study and in 2 sites for the tree cover study, representing paired burn and control sites in a randomized block design. Vegetation and ground cover variables were also sampled to determine how variation in ant populations was correlated with differences in vegetation and ground cover. Ant species richness remained unchanged for all treatments. Tree cover had no significant effect on ant populations. Significantly more ants were trapped after the burn treatment on burn plots. Variation in ant populations was not directly correlated with any of the vegetation or ground cover variables. According to ANOVA and multivariate analyses, elevation had the greatest effect on changes in ant communities, likely due to increased moisture availability. Our results suggest that management for conservation of sagebrush-steppe ecosystems in this and similar watersheds should include a range of elevations to ensure maximum ant species diversity.},

abstract={From 1992 to 1995, the breeding birds of a mature Oak-Elm riverine forest along the Rhine (Erstein Forest, Alsace, NE France- a nature reserve since 1989) were studied in order to identify the main characteristics of this insufficiently known forest type. Species richness is high (34) and breeding densities are high (129.3 pairs per 10 ha) as well as global diversity (SHANNON index of 4.13). These results are analysed then discussed in relation to other non-riverine conifer and broadleaved forests. This richness can be explained by the architectural complexity of the studied forest resulting from the specific dynamics of riverside habitats: diversity of woody plant species, high vertical stratification, horizontal heterogeneity, abundance of large vines and vigour of plant growth are the most striking features of this habitat. Bird populations are similar to that of ordinary European Oak forest with three differences: a very high breeding density (50% higher), an abundance of shrubby habitats species in the heart of the forest, and the presence of species whose ecological optimum in Eastern France is cool montane habitat (Black Woodpecker, Dryocopus martius, Firecrest Regulus atricapillus, Common Tree-creeper Certhia familiaris, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca). A comparison with the ancient Bialowieza forest has also been drawn: the higher temperatures and a much thicker and abundant woody vegetation explain the higher densities recorder in the Rhine riverine forest. Finally, a critical analysis of absolute population census tools is provided, highlighting weaknesses and suggesting possible alleys of improvement. In conclusion, we must unfortunately accept the fact that deep hydrological changes in European river habitats will modify the typical riverine forest architecture and will lead to the transformation of the Querco-Ulmetum minoris into a yet unknown different type of forest.},

Restoration treatments were designed to create stand structure and composition similar to pre-settlement forests, which were influenced by a frequent fire regime. Overall, avian community composition was changed as a result of the treatments. Cassin's Finch, Chipping Sparrow, and Yellow-rumped Warbler were found at higher densities in treated stands, whereas Mountain Chickadee, Western Tanager, and Red-breasted Nuthatch had higher densities in untreated stands. White-headed Woodpecker and Western Bluebird were only detected in the treated stands. Brown-headed Cowbird showed no response to treatments. We detected changes in the density of four of five foraging guilds in response to restoration treatments. Tree seedeaters, low understory and ground insectivores, and aerial insectivores all increased in density in treated stands. Overall, bark insectivores showed no density response to treatments. Tree foliage insectivore density was lower in treated than in untreated stands. Overall avian density, density of neotropical migrants, and density of some focal species were higher in treated stands.

abstract={Oak savannas were historically common but are currently rare in the Midwestern United States. We assessed possible associations of bird species with savannas and other threatened habitats in the region by relating fire frequency and vegetation characteristics to seasonal densities of 72 bird species distributed across an open-forest gradient in northwestern Indiana. About one-third of the species did not exhibit statistically significant relationships with any combination of seven vegetation characteristics that included vegetation cover in five vertical strata, dead tree density, and tree height. For 40% of the remaining species, models best predicting species density incorporated tree density. Therefore, management based solely on manipulating tree density may not be an adequate strategy for managing bird populations along this open-forest gradient. Few species exhibited sharp peaks in predicted density under habitat conditions expected in restored savannas, suggesting that few savanna specialists occur among Midwestern bird species. When fire frequency, measured over fifteen years, was added to vegetation characteristics as a predictor of species density, it was incorporated into models for about one-quarter of species, suggesting that fire may modify habitat characteristics in ways that are important for birds but not captured by the structural habitat variables measured. Among those species, similar numbers had peaks in predicted density at low, intermediate, or high fire frequency. For species suggested by previous studies to have a preference for oak savannas along the open-forest gradient, estimated density was maximized at an average fire return interval of about one fire every three years. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2007.},

abstract={We quantified breeding bird abundance, diversity, and indicator species in riparian and upland dry forests along 6 third- to fourth-order streams on the east slope of the Cascade Range, Washington, USA. Upland dry forest on southerly aspects was dominated by open ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plant associations. Upland mesic forest on northerly aspects was dominated by closed-canopy Douglas-fir or dry grand fir (Abies grandis) plant associations. Riparian overstory vegetation was dominated by black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) plant associations with a prominent hardwood tree and shrub component. We quantified bird assemblages, diversity, and abundance from parallel point transects on riparian and adjacent dry and mesic upslope forests. We detected 80 bird species from >12,000 point-transect observations during 1998-1999. Eighteen species accounted for 75% of all detections. Species richness and evenness were similar in all 3 forest types, with approximately 35 species and high evenness (0.85) in each forest type. Bird species assemblages differed among dry, mesic, and riparian forest types, with the greatest differences between riparian and both dry and mesic upland forests. Riparian forest had the greatest number (9) of strong characteristic, or indictor, species among the 3 forest types. Upland mesic forest was characterized by 7 indicator species. Upland dry forest had 4 indicator species. Our results indicate that current standards and guidelines for riparian buffers zones would allow for avian refuge and corridor functions along these streams. Forest managers could use our indicator species to predict and monitor shifts in upland forest species composition from thinning and prescribed burning practices that are used to reduce fuels in uplands and to reduce continuity of fire effects between riparian and upland zones.},

abstract={Forestry is obliged to record as well as maintain and/or enhance biological diversity in forests due to national and international agreements. Accordingly, it is necessary to work out methodological approaches for the assessment of biodiversity in forests. In the study presented here, we focus on the total plant species pool (563 vascular plant and bryophyte species) of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests in NE Germany to identify indicators for plant species richness. We distinguished several groups like "herb", "grass-like", "woody", "endangered", and "exotic species", for which we detected indicators for low (class #1), intermediate (class #2), and high (class #3) species numbers. From a total of 84 species, which were identified by a three-step procedure, most indicators were found for class #3. Only few indicators have been revealed for intermediate species numbers, i.e. class #2. With help of Ellenberg's ecological indicator values and information on the main occurrence in Central European vegetation types and plant communities, respectively, we characterized the indicator species ecologically. The ecological site preferences of the indicator species in general reflect the fact that species richness is highest in base-rich, light, and anthropogenically disturbed pine forests. On the contrary, species-poor forests were revealed by indicators, which mainly occur on acidic sites. It is concluded that a considerable set of indicators for species richness can help facilitate biodiversity assessments in forestry and ecosystem restoration practice. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

Potential effects of woodland fragmentation include reduction in regional woodland cover, reduced patch size, edge effects with loss of core habitat, and increased isolation with disruption of dispersal and metapopulation dynamics. We adopt an evidence-based approach to review how each of these affects woodland birds with an emphasis on studies from the UK and use this to identify management priorities for mitigation. There is evidence for both patch area and composition effects: larger woodlands support more woodland bird species, and woods located within sparsely wooded landscapes are less valuable to specialist woodland species. Bird assemblages show a nested pattern with respect to area, and thus species found in small woods also occur in large woods but not vice versa. However, small woods may be preferred by a few edge species, while small woods also have greater variability in bird species composition. Consideration of the metapopulation dynamics of specialist species with poor dispersal shows that creating or buffering large woodlands is more efficient than a greater total area of small fragments. Connectivity appears most useful for widespread generalist species with almost continuous populations. Woodland structure and quality are of overwhelming importance: as well as mature woodland, young growth, scrub and edges are also key components. There is an urgent need to examine the relationship between nest predation and landscape structure within UK woodlands. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={Breeding bird communities in burnt and unburnt residual pinewoods were studied over 3 years by line-transect method, following a catastrophic fire event in Castelfusano (Rome, Central Italy; July 2000). We applied bootstrap procedures to evaluate whether the observed data were true or just produced by chance, and then examined the emerging patterns at three levels: community, guild and species levels. At the community level, fire acted on breeding bird communities by altering especially the total abundance patterns: the species abundance decreased in the burnt pinewood compared to the residual one, but other parameters were not significantly affected by fire. As a consequence of fire, the destruction and structural simplification of the canopy and shrubby component, as well as the increase of edge habitat and patchiness at landscape scale, induced a turnover in species between pinewoods. Species turnover was higher at the burnt than at the residual pinewoods, during all the 3 years of study. At the guild level, the forest species decreased strongly in terms of richness and abundance in the burnt pinewoods, contrary to the edge and open habitat species which increased in terms of richness, abundance and evenness. Edge species showed the highest turnover in burnt pinewood during the whole period of study. At species level, after an a priori subdivision (based on bibliographic search) of the various species in two ecological guilds (forest versus edge species), it was found that an a posteriori statistical analysis confirmed the expected trend, i.e. that the species which decreased significantly in burnt pinewood were essentially the forest species, whereas the species which increased were essentially the edge/open habitat ones. Overall, in order to investigate the effects of fire catastrophes on birds, the guild approach seems more exhaustive than the taxonomic community approach, where intrinsic confounding trends are present. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={The hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus) is a keystone species in forest ecosystems of Washington, USA, providing nesting and roosting cavities for many species of wildlife. Therefore, management practices that promote healthy populations of this bird will help to conserve cavity-nesting communities as a whole. The objective of this study was to determine patterns in forest type and landscape use by hairy woodpeckers, and thus, provide landscape-level recommendations to forest managers. We documented the ranging patterns and habitat use of 23 hairy woodpeckers on the Olympic Peninsula using radiotelemetry and a Geographic Information System analysis. Use patterns of stand age, type, and size, as well as distance-from-edge analyses revealed that the hairy woodpecker is a relative generalist in its use of the managed forest landscape. However, certain features, such as older stands with large trees, were used more heavily by nesting pairs. Hairy woodpeckers used 61-80-year forest stands significantly (P < 0.05) more than expected relative to their availability within the birds' home ranges. We also documented significant underuse of 6-10-year and 11-20-year stands, whereas the birds used 41-60-year stands, >80-year stands, and clearcuts (<5 yr) equivalent to their availability. We suggest that hairy woodpeckers select older stands with larger, dying trees for foraging, but also use clear-cuts proportionally due to the residual snags, decaying trees, and remnant dead wood available. Higher use (P < 0.001) by hairy woodpeckers of small forest patches (0-5 ha) and intermediate-sized stands (5-30 ha) than large patches (>30 ha) may be a result of the older, higher-quality habitat available in small stands in the managed forest landscape. We recommend that land managers interested in maintaining healthy managed forest ecosystems with a full complement of cavity-using species in forests of western Washington and northwestern Oregon maintain a landscape mosaic with approximately 45% of the landscape in stands >40 years, and >30% of the landscape in stands >60 years.},

abstract={From 1992 to 1995, the breeding birds of a mature Oak-Elm riverine forest along the Rhine (Erstein Forest, Alsace, NE France- a nature reserve since 1989) were studied in order to identify the main characteristics of this insufficiently known forest type. Species richness is high (34) and breeding densities are high (129.3 pairs per 10 ha) as well as global diversity (SHANNON index of 4.13). These results are analysed then discussed in relation to other non-riverine conifer and broadleaved forests. This richness can be explained by the architectural complexity of the studied forest resulting from the specific dynamics of riverside habitats: diversity of woody plant species, high vertical stratification, horizontal heterogeneity, abundance of large vines and vigour of plant growth are the most striking features of this habitat. Bird populations are similar to that of ordinary European Oak forest with three differences: a very high breeding density (50% higher), an abundance of shrubby habitats species in the heart of the forest, and the presence of species whose ecological optimum in Eastern France is cool montane habitat (Black Woodpecker, Dryocopus martius, Firecrest Regulus atricapillus, Common Tree-creeper Certhia familiaris, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca). A comparison with the ancient Bialowieza forest has also been drawn: the higher temperatures and a much thicker and abundant woody vegetation explain the higher densities recorder in the Rhine riverine forest. Finally, a critical analysis of absolute population census tools is provided, highlighting weaknesses and suggesting possible alleys of improvement. In conclusion, we must unfortunately accept the fact that deep hydrological changes in European river habitats will modify the typical riverine forest architecture and will lead to the transformation of the Querco-Ulmetum minoris into a yet unknown different type of forest.},

abstract={Forest structure and diversity have generally been well studied, but the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on structural differences of hemi-boreal old-growth and managed mature stands have not been quantified along a wide range of the productivity gradient. This study compared 39 quantitative or qualitative characteristics and various widely accepted biodiversity indicators of a stand, its understorey and the forest floor in old-growth and conventionally managed mature stands of dry alvar and fresh boreo-nemoral forests. This study has to produce a statistically supported set of indicators for evaluating of forest "naturalness". We examined 154 stands over a wide biogeographical range in Estonia. Many forest structural characteristics, including stand basal area and composition, amount of dead wood, and coverage of understorey layers (shrub, herb and moss layers) followed productivity and/or biogeographical gradients. Old-growth forests had higher proportions of deciduous trees, a larger amount of coarse woody debris (CWD, consisting of logs and snags), a higher frequency of logs in each decay class, a denser understorey and herb layer, and a more heterogeneous pattern of herb layer diversity than mature managed forests. We found a correlation between live trees greater than 40 cm in diameter and forest age. The effects of forest management on the forest floor are both direct and indirect. Anthropogenic disturbance directly decreased shrub and herb layer coverage. Indirectly forest management increased herb layer coverage, proportion of graminoids, and species richness of the herb layer by improving light conditions as stand canopy was opened. The sets of indicators for assessing ecosystem quality in each forest site-type have overlapping features, such as the amount of dead wood, canopy closure of the stand and the presence of woodpeckers and specific lichens. Several other old-growth or disturbance indicators are forest-type specific, related to the composition of shrub and herb layer vegetation. Results suggest that stands managed with an extended rotation can be compositionally very similar to old-growth forests. Stands differ quantitatively in structural features, but these differences are confounded by other environmental factors, such as soil productivity, forest age or biogeography. Mature and old-growth forests still enclose features created by the mid-term (decades) and long-term (centuries) history of forest management practices. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Considering the frequent nature of fires and resultant drastic change in habitat following fire, research on the effects of fire on birds in the grasslands of South Africa is surprisingly scarce. For at least five months after burns we followed the changes in bird species composition, species richness and densities of two controlled burns and one accidental fire at the Barberspan Nature Reserve in grasslands that had not been burned or grazed in 10 years. Compared with the control areas, species richness and densities increased in the burned areas immediately following the burns, with more species and birds recruited to the burned areas than were lost. Immediate post-burn opportunists tended to be larger species, and the biomass increase mirrored the increases in species richness and densities in burned areas. Avian species richness, densities and biomass tended to return to the initial conditions after a number of months. Although the bird communities from two controlled-burns differed before the burns, they converged to a characteristic immediate post-burn composition. Five months after the burns however, the bird communities reflected a pre-burn composition. Indications were that birds in an area larger than that burned were affected. Mosaic burning, with shifting large and small patches, should be considered on a landscape scale. Copyright © NISC Pty Ltd.},

abstract={Riparian zones and agricultural fields adjacent to incised streams in northwestern Mississippi are impacted by gully erosion initiated by runoff flowing over unstable streambanks. Currently, installation of erosion control structures (drop pipes) at the riparian zone-agricultural field interface halts gully erosion and simultaneously establishes one of four riparian habitat types. Avian communities were compared among four types of restored habitats and among four seasonal periods in northwestern Mississippi from June 1994 to May 1996. Fifty-seven species were observed among riparian habitats, of which 49% were neotropical migrants. Habitat type and season significantly affected species richness, abundance, and diversity. Species richness, abundance, and diversity increased as habitat area, pool volume, and vertical structure of woody vegetation increased among riparian habitat types. Additionally, species richness, abundance, and diversity increased during spring and fall. The influence of habitat type on avian species richness, abundance, and diversity did not differ among seasons. Present drop pipe installation practices focus on erosion control without consideration of habitat creation. Installation practices can be altered to more effectively incorporate habitat creation to provide the greatest ecological benefits for avian communities within impacted riparian zones.},

abstract={Most data on the effects of partial-harvest silviculture (where live trees are purposely retained at the time of harvest) on birds come from one or a few discrete harvesting treatments. It is thus difficult to infer species responses across a continuous gradient of tree retention from individual studies. To quantify the levels of tree retention expected to produce specified changes in the relative abundance of individual species, we carried out a meta-analysis of 42 studies that examined the impacts of uniform partial harvesting on North American birds. Of 34 species, sigmoidal models showed a negative effect of harvesting for 14 species and a positive effect for 6 species. Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Brown Creepers (Certhia americana) were the species most sensitive to harvesting. Most of the 14 species that were negatively affected by harvesting showed 25%, 50%, and 75% reductions in abundance (relative to control sites) at tree retention levels ranging from 45 to 85%, 30-70%, and 15-50%, respectively. A few species, such as Yellow-rumped Warblers (Dendroica coronata), exhibited these levels of response at lower tree retention or were not predicted to decrease by 75% in harvested stands. Five of the 6 species that were positively affected by harvesting showed at least a 50% increase in abundance at nearly all levels of tree retention, although other early successional bird species did not appear to benefit from the relatively small openings created by uniform partial harvesting. Three of 20 species exhibited stronger responses to harvesting at a given level of tree retention in boreal and northern mixed forests of North America than other regions of the continent, but, with these exceptions, lack of variation among forest regions supported the broad-scale generality of species' responses to harvesting. The species response models we developed represent useful tools for evaluating stand-level impacts of partial harvesting on birds within an adaptive management framework. Uniform partial harvesting at light and, to a lesser degree, moderate intensities may be effective approaches to managing habitat for late successional bird species as part of broader ecosystem-based forest management. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Most of the original forest and woodland cover on the western slopes of New South Wales and the northern plains of Victoria has been cleared for agriculture (wheat, sheep and cattle) and what remains is highly fragmented and modified by a long history of disturbance. Over the past three decades, native eucalypt trees and shrubs have been planted extensively in a part of this region to provide a range of environmental benefits. Our aim was to determine the extent to which these plantings could improve biological diversity in agricultural landscapes in south-eastern Australia and to identify the variables influencing their effectiveness. We sampled birds at 120 sites encompassing the range of available patch sizes, stand ages, floristic and structural conditions, and habitat attributes for revegetated areas and remnants of native vegetation, and we compared these to nearby paddocks. Eucalypt plantings were found to provide significant improvements in bird population density compared with cleared or sparsely treed paddocks, and mixed eucalypt and shrub plantings had similar bird communities to remnant native forest and woodland in the region. Birds displayed a strong response to patch size, with both larger (≥5-20 ha) eucalypt plantings and larger (≥5-20 ha) remnants having more species and more individuals per unit area than smaller (<5 ha) patches of these vegetation types. Older (10-25 years) plantings had more bird species and individuals than young (<10 years) plantings. The distance from remnant forest and woodland (habitat connectivity) appeared to be an important variable influencing bird species richness in eucalypt plantings. The main differences were due to the greater numbers of species classified as woodland-dependent in the larger-sized patches of plantings and remnants. Eucalypt plantings provided useful habitat for at least 10 declining woodland-dependent species, notably for the Speckled Warbler, Red-capped Robin and Rufous Whistler. The Brown Treecreeper and Dusky Woodswallow appeared to be the species most limited by the extent of remnant forest and woodland in the region. Plantings of all shapes and sizes, especially those larger than 5 ha, have an important role to play in providing habitat for many bird species. Restoration efforts are more likely to be successful if eucalypt plantings are established near existing remnant vegetation. © 2007 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract={This paper develops a comprehensive and objective picture of bird distributions relative to habitats across Britain. Bird species presence/absence data from an extensive field survey and habitat data from the remotely sensed UK Land Cover Map 2000 were analysed in 36,920 tetrads (2 km×2 km) across Britain (a 65% sample of Britain's c. 240 000 km2). Cluster analysis linked birds to generalised landscapes based on distinctive habitat assemblages. Maps of the clusters showed strong regional patterns associated with the habitat assemblages. Cluster centroid coordinates for each bird species and each habitat were combined across clusters to derive individualised bird-habitat preference indices and examine the importance of individual habitats for each bird species. Even rare species and scarce habitats showed successful linkages. Results were assessed against published accounts of bird-habitat relations. Objective corroboration strongly supported the associations. Relatively scarce coastal and wetland habitats proved particularly important for many birds. However, extensive arable farmland and woodland habitats were also favoured by many species, despite reported declines in bird numbers in these habitats. The fact that habitat-specialists do not or cannot move habitat is perhaps a reason for declining numbers where habitats have become unsuitable. This study showed that there are unifying principles determining bird-habitat relations which apply and can be quantified at the national scale, and which corroborate and complement the cumulative knowledge of many and varied surveys and ecological studies. This 'generality' suggests that we may be able, reliably and objectively, to integrate and scale up such disparate studies to the national scale, using this generalised framework. It also suggests the potential for a landscape ecology approach to bird-habitat analyses. Such developments will be important steps in building models to develop and test the sustainable management of landscapes for birds. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Four experimental units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of 3 replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, North Carolina, USA. Treatments were 1) prescribed burn, 2) mechanical understory reduction (chainsaw-felling of shrubs and small trees), 3) mechanical + burn, and 4) controls. We conducted mechanical treatments in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls. Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird spedes did not detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species richness, total bird density, and some species, induding indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year delay, eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus) dedined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions, and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open habitat while retaining many forest and generalist spedes, but may have short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.},

abstract={A study was carried out in a tropical scrub forest in India, to investigate the effects of extractive activities such as fodder and firewood collection, on native bird communities and to study the relative influences of altered vegetation composition and structure. The study was based on comparison between six 'disturbed' (extracted) and four 'undisturbed' (non-extracted) sites that were delineated using quantitative disturbance indicators. Birds were sampled seven times over two different seasons utilising the fixed radius point count method. Six different variables related to vegetation structure (canopy cover, basal area, average forest height, tree density, tree height diversity and tree species richness) were quantified, as was tree species composition. There was no significant difference in number of recorded species or bird abundance between disturbed and undisturbed sites. However, bird species diversity was significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Overall, bird species composition also differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Nine of 38 locally abundant bird species (23.6%) showed significant selection for either disturbed or undisturbed habitats. Of these nine species, seven chose undisturbed habitats and two chose disturbed. All seven species adversely affected by disturbance are primarily insectivorous. Canopy cover, tree basal area and height of trees were significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. In both habitats, bird species composition was significantly dependent on these components of altered vegetation structure. Tree species composition was also significantly altered by disturbance in scrub forest. However, altered tree species composition did not significantly affect bird species composition. Partial Mantel's tests confirmed that there were no significant residual effects of tree species composition on bird composition after the effects of vegetation structure were accounted for. Our study indicates that rural biomass extraction can have significant effects upon bird species composition of tropical scrub forest which is caused principally by alteration of vegetation structure, rather than by changes in forest tree composition. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Plant and bird diversity in the Indonesian jungle rubber agroforestry system was compared to that in primary forest and rubber plantations by integrating new and existing data from a lowland rain forest area in Sumatra. Jungle rubber gardens are low-input rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforests that structurally resemble secondary forest and in which wild species are tolerated by the farmer. As primary forests have almost completely disappeared from the lowlands of the Sumatra peneplain, our aim was to assess the contribution of jungle rubber as a land use type to the conservation of plant and bird species, especially those that are associated with the forest interior of primary and old secondary forest. Species-accumulation curves were compiled for terrestrial and epiphytic pteridophytes, trees and birds, and for subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds. Comparing jungle rubber and primary forest, groups differed in relative species richness patterns. Species richness in jungle rubber was slightly higher (terrestrial pteridophytes), similar (birds) or lower (epiphytic pteridophytes, trees, vascular plants as a whole) than in primary forest. For subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds, species richness in jungle rubber was lower than in primary forest. For all groups, species richness in jungle rubber was generally higher than in rubber plantations. Although species conservation in jungle rubber is limited by management practices and by a slash-and-burn cycle for replanting of about 40 years, this forest-like land use does support species diversity in an impoverished landscape increasingly dominated by monoculture plantations. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={Predation is the primary cause of nest failure for northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). There are few reliable data documenting the species diversity and relative importance of bobwhite nest predators in southern Texas, USA. We used infrared video-monitoring systems to document nest fates of 127 bobwhite nests over 4 nesting seasons from 2002 to 2005 in southern Texas. A majority of depredation events (83%) were caused by 4 species: coyote (Canis latrans), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), southern fire ant (Solenopsis xyloni), and badger (Taxidea taxus). Observed bobwhite nest fates for the study period were 0.50 successful, 0.34 depredated, and 0.16 abandoned or undetermined. A universal approach to mitigating nest predation is not likely to be applicable in regions similar to southern Texas, with high nest-predator diversity (e.g., fire ants, rodents, and mammalian carnivores). We believe that infrared video surveillance is a valuable tool for documenting baseline information on predator context and nest fate for many avian species, considering the limitations of past methods (e.g., postfate evidence).},

abstract={1. Habitat structure long has been identified as a primary factor influencing local assemblage composition. Most evidence has been in the form of correlations of species occurrence and assemblage composition over a range of habitats, with experimental verification of relationships being relatively uncommon because of the difficulties of enacting precise manipulations of habitat structure. 2. Fallen timber (also known as coarse or large woody debris) is one of the few habitat-structural elements in forests and woodlands that can be manipulated with relatively high precision. We report on manipulations of wood-loads on 30 experimental 1-ha plots in floodplain forests of northern Victoria, Australia, over 4 years (one pre- and three post-manipulation). 3. We show that very high wood-loads (80 Mg ha-1) and intermediate wood-loads derived from tree crowns (40 Mg ha-1) increase species richness (all species and ground-foraging species) and numbers of birds (all species and ground-foraging species) relative to the control plots. 4. Three bird species consistently increased most following manipulations: white-plumed honeyeater Lichenostomus penicillatus (Gould 1837) (fam. Meliphagidae), brown treecreeper Climacteris picumnus (Temm. &amp; Laug. 1824) (fam. Climacteridae) and yellow rosella Platycercus elegans flaveolus (Gould 1837) (fam. Psittacidae). The honeyeater is not considered as a ground or fallen timber dependent species, while the treecreeper and rosella both are regarded as being dependent on ground-layer structure. 5. Fallen timber management needs to be considered in a landscape and temporal context for improving conservation of avian biodiversity. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={Measures of abundance and population trends are necessary for informed management of rare species, but obtaining reliable estimates of sparsely occurring species is an ongoing challenge in conservation biology. It is even more difficult when the species of interest is also cryptic. We censused a population of one such species, the Western Ground Parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), over several years to develop a monitoring protocol to assist in future management, extend understanding of its response to fire, and provide a model that could be used with other cryptic bird species. Abundance of Western Ground Parrots, monitored by means of calling frequencies, varied from year to year at a study site in Fitzgerald River National Park, south-western Australia. Frequency of calling increased significantly from 1996 to 2000. During this time, frequency of calling peaked in 1998 in part of the study site that had been unburnt for more than 40 years, and remained high in 2000. Frequency of calling was similar in a more recently burnt part of the study area except in May 1998, when frequency was lower following a fire that burnt part of this area five months previously. Frequency of calling dropped significantly in both the long unburnt and recently burnt areas between 2000 and 2004; exact reasons for this are unknown. Western Ground Parrots can use recently burnt vegetation where it is immediately adjacent to an established population, but do not need fire to create habitat, at least in the timescale of 40 years. The current monitoring protocol, where eight listening posts are counted approximately three times each, is capable of detecting an annual change in frequency of calling of ∼13%. The number of listening posts would need to be increased to 14 in order to detect an annual change of 10%, and would need to be increased to 40 in order to detect an annual change of 5%. © Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2007.},

abstract={1. Conversion of established forests of undesirable species composition or structure to a multi-age, native forest community is a common restoration goal. However, for some ecosystems, the complexity of multiple disturbances and biotic factors requires unique approaches to advance community development. We use the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Miller) ecosystem as a model of such a restoration paradigm with an approach that utilizes the undesirable species as a functional or structural bridge to foster ecological processes. 2. In the conversion of adult slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) plantations to the biologically diverse longleaf pine forests that once dominated the south-eastern US Coastal Plain, we examine techniques for restoring and maintaining critical structural and functional components. Through partial and variable retention of the undesirable slash pine canopy, establishment of longleaf pine seedlings is facilitated, while maintaining fuels essential for prescribed fire, a necessary management practice for longleaf pine. Furthermore, we project that with subsequent fires, fine fuels and species richness will be encouraged in the ground cover, and with future slash canopy harvest, established longleaf pine seedlings will be released. 3. In this study, we present a statistical approach that examines the compositional movement of vegetation in restoration sites over time relative to the reference conditions that are also changing through time. 4. Synthesis and applications. Restoration efforts that remove undesirable species initially may actually hinder rather than facilitate restoration. Restoration of fire-maintained ecosystems in which the production of adequate fuels is an important consideration may require the retention of a portion of the existing canopy to provide fuels during the restoration process, even if the canopy is comprised of less preferred species. Individual species often provide similar structural features and influences on function within an ecosystem; thus, systems other than longleaf pine may also benefit from retention of the undesirable species through the restoration process. We conclude that a gradual approach to restoration may be advantageous when legacies of past management have altered complex ecological dynamics and promoted development along a successional pathway strongly differing from that of the reference conditions. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={To be able to plan productive uses of the land compatible with the conservation of the biodiversity, it is essential to evaluate the changes that they cause. The Andean patagonic forests undergo different anthropogenic disturbances, like fires, grazing, wood extraction and substitution by exotic coniferous plantations. These activities cause changes on the vegetation and animal communities, and could be affecting the functioning of the forest ecosystems. In Argentine Patagonia, there is a growing opposition to productive activities, particularly to pine plantations, because of its supposed negative ecological consequences, however their impacts are unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate in which measure different uses of the vegetation of the basin of Foyel river (NO Argentine Patagonia) cause changes on bird communities, especially on the functionally important and the endangered species. Birds counts were conducted from November 2004 to March 2005 (summer) using the variable circular-plot method, in twenty four sites of Nothofagus antarctica native forests and scrubs with different levels of grazing and wood extraction (closed, semiopened, opened), and in eight exotic plantations of Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus spp. Although, the vegetation structure of each site was characterized, to identify structural elements of the forests that could be important for bird habitat. Population densities of birds did not differ between vegetation types (25.4 ± 8.4 individuals/ha) associated to different disturbances. Bird richness and diversity (Shannon Index), however, were different among the vegetation types, in forestations both were similar to the undisturbed vegetation types, whereas they increased in vegetations with a medium intensity of wood extraction and grazing, and were highest in those sites whit a high intensity of wood extraction and grazing. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis and an analysis of species composition similarity showed that there are two differentiated communities: those of the more altered N. antarctica forests (by grazing and wood extraction), dominated by birds of opened areas; and another community in the rest of the vegetation types, dominated by species characteristic of forests. Among the key species for the Andean patagonic forests processes, foliage insectivores (Elaenia albiceps and Aphrastura spinicauda) were not seriously affected by any of the anthropogenic disturbances; ground insectivores (Scelorchilus rubecula and Pteroptochos tarnii) used the coniferous plantations, but not the areas opened by intense wood extraction and grazing; whereas the wood insectivore species (Campephilus magellanicus) was rare in all types of vegetation. Our results suggest that the structure and composition of the forest bird communities is mainly determined by changes in the structure of the vegetation, and not by changes in the floristic composition. The bird community of the coniferous plantations is similar to the community of the original systems. Intensive wood extraction and grazing, however, cause great changes, incorporating some species to the area, but eliminating others that are forest dependent.},

In one study area, density of nesting pairs of pileated woodpeckers decreased from five to one after extensive regeneration cuts eliminated most of the stands of mature and old-growth grand fir (Abies grandis) and reduced the density of nest and roost trees and foraging substrate since 1990. Density of nesting pairs, reproductive success, and home range location remained fairly consistent over 30 years in a second study area with extensive tree mortality resulting from insect outbreaks but without regeneration harvests. The amount of unharvested stands and closed canopy stands in home ranges were positively correlated with reproductive success, and the amount of area in harvested stands was negatively correlated with reproductive success in 2003-05. High tree mortality and subsequent loss of canopy closure in stands of grand fir and Douglas-fir from insect outbreaks did not appear to be detrimental to pileated woodpeckers provided that dead trees and logs were abundant and that stands were not harvested.},

abstract={Habit at loss and fragmentation of natural and semi-natural habitats are considered as major threats to plant species richness. Recently several studies have pinpointed the need to analyse past landscape patterns to understand effects of fragmentation, as the response to landscape change may be slow in many organisms, plants in particular. We compared species richness in continuously grazed and abandoned grasslands in different commonplace rural landscapes in Sweden, and analysed effects of isolation and area in three time-steps (100 and 50 years ago and today). Old cadastral maps and aerial photographs were used to analyse past and present landscape patterns in 25 sites. Two plant diversity measures were investigated; total species richness and species density. During the last 100 years grassland area and connectivity have been reduced by about 90%. Present-day habitat area was positively related to total species richness in both habitats. There was also a relationship to habitat area 50 years ago for continuously grazed grasslands. Only present management was related to species density: continuously grazed grasslands had the highest species density. There were no relationships between grassland connectivity, present or past, and any diversity measure. We conclude that landscape history is not directly important for present-day plant diversity patterns in ordinary landscapes, although past grassland management is a prerequisite for the grassland habitats that can be found there today. It is important that studies are conducted, not only in very diverse landscapes, but also in managed landscapes in order to assess the effects of fragmentation on species. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={This study reports on the responses of bird assemblages to woodland clearance, fragmentation and habitat disturbance in central Queensland Australia, a region exposed to very high rates of vegetation clearance over the last two to three decades. Many previous studies of clearing impacts have considered situations where there is a very sharp management contrast between uncleared lands and cleared areas: in this situation, the contrast is more muted, because both cleared lands and uncleared savanna woodlands are exposed to cattle grazing, invasion by the exotic grass Cenchrus ciliaris and similar fire management. Bird species richness (at the scale of a 1-ha quadrat) was least in cleared areas (8.1 species), then regrowth areas (14.6 species), then uncleared woodlands (19.9 species). Richness at this scale was unrelated to woodland fragment size, connectivity or habitat condition; but declined significantly with increasing abundance of miners (interspecifically aggressive colonial honeyeaters). At whole of patch scale, richness increased with fragment size and decreased with abundance of miners. This study demonstrates complex responses of individual bird species to a regional management cocktail of disturbance elements. Of 71 individual bird species modelled for woodland fragment sites, the quadrat-level abundance of 40 species was significantly related to at least one variable representing environmental position (across a rainfall gradient), fragment condition, fragment size and/or connectivity. This study suggests that priorities for conservation management include: cessation of broad-scale clearing; increased protection for regrowth (particularly where this may bolster connectivity and/or size of woodland fragments); control of miners; maintenance of fallen woody debris in woodlands; increase in fire frequency; and reduction in the incidence of grazing and exotic pasture grass. © 2007 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract={Anthropogenic changes in forest structure threats the persistence of numerous organisms. In Spain, Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests are mainly subjected to three sylvopastoral management systems which determine variations in the forest structure: (i) "young forests" subjected to frequent disturbance by fires and clear-cuttings; (ii) "Pyrenean oak dehesas", subjected to a traditional sylvopastoral system exclusive to Spain which favours the development of both old oaks and pasture; (iii) largely undisturbed "mature forests". We examined the effects of these sylvopastoral management systems on habitat use and reproduction of the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius), a forest specialist bird, at the south-western edge of its distribution range. Habitat use was examined at multiple spatial scales. Within the territories, woodpeckers preferred large diameter oaks for foraging and decay oaks with holes for nesting. Within the forest tracts, no significant relationships between territory density and habitat structure in the forest tracts were found. At the landscape scale, dehesas and mature forests, both with high densities of important foraging and nesting trees, were occupied by woodpeckers. Young forests, with low densities of those trees, were avoided. No significant differences in territory density or reproductive success were found between dehesas and mature forests. The maintenance of viable woodpecker populations requires conservation actions at several spatial scales. Within the forest tracts, suitable densities of important foraging and nesting trees must be maintained. At the landscape scale, management decisions must consider the maintenance of traditional sylvopastoral systems in dehesas and mature forests. At the regional scale, taking into account a habitat cover in the landscape of the 7% for the Cantabrian Mountains, we estimated an area of 285,000 ha to be included in the conservation planning unit for the middle spotted woodpecker. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Historic losses and fragmentation of tallgrass prairie habitat to agriculture and urban development have led to declines in diversity and abundance of plants and birds associated with such habitat. Prescribed burning is a management strategy that has potential for restoring and rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, and through such restoration, might create habitat for birds dependent upon prairies. To provide improved data for management decision-making regarding the use of prescribed fire in tallgrass prairies, we compared responses of plant and bird communities on five burned and five unburned tallgrass prairie fragments at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, Iowa, USA, from 1995 to 1997. Overall species richness and diversity were unaffected by burning, but individual species of plants and birds were affected by year-treatment interactions, including northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), which showed time-delayed increases in density on burned sites. Analyses of species/area relationships indicated that, collectively, many small sites did make significant contributions to plant biodiversity at landscape levels, supporting the overall conservation value of prairie fragments. In contrast, most birds species were present on larger sites. Thus, higher biodiversity in bird communities which contain area-sensitive species might require larger sites able to support larger, more stable populations, greater habitat heterogeneity, and greater opportunity for niche separation. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Riparian forest communities in the southwestern United States were historically structured by a disturbance regime of annual flooding. In recent decades, however, frequency of flooding has decreased and frequency of wildfires has increased. Riparian forests provide important breeding habitat for a large variety of bird species, and the effects of this altered disturbance regime on birds and their breeding habitat is largely unknown. To evaluate effects of high-intensity spring and summer wildfire on the quality of breeding bird habitat in the Middle Rio Grande valley, we measured vegetation structure and composition, avian nest use, and nest success at 4 unburned plots and 4 wildfire plots over a 3-year period. We measured avian nest use and success at nest boxes located in unburned riparian forest plots and plots recently burned by wildfire. Recent wildfire plots (<7 yr after fire) had a much different vegetation structure than unburned plots; an older (>7 yr after fire) wildfire plot more closely resembled its paired unburned plot than did recently burned plots. Ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens) and Bewick's wrens (Thryomanes bewickii; hereafter, flycatchers and wrens, respectively) used nest boxes in most of the plots. A model selection procedure applied to logistic regressions showed that frequency of nest box use by flycatchers was positively associated with wildfire, although flycatchers used boxes in unburned plots as well. Wrens showed a preferential use of nest boxes that were in unburned sites and in close proximity to vegetative cover. Growth rates, feeding rates, and fledging mass of flycatchers were similar in wildfire and unburned plots. Growth rates for wrens were slower in wildfire plots, while feeding rates and fledging mass were similar. Nest predation varied between years, was higher for flycatchers than for wrens, and was not directly influenced by wildfire. Model selection showed that predation increased with grass cover, an indicator of forest openness, and decreased with distance to habitat edge. Recovery of dense vegetation appears important in maintaining populations of Bewick's wrens, whereas ash-throated flycatchers were less sensitive to vegetative structure and composition of postfire succession. Postfire management that maintains nest sites in large forest strips would enhance nesting density and success of these cavity-nesting birds in riparian zones.},

Bird densities increased with decreasing remnant area although densities did not differ significantly between remnant categories. Ranked bird densities varied between remnant categories, with relatively even distributions in large remnants in high condition, and uneven distributions in small remnants in low condition. Densities of small insectivores were much lower in small, low-condition remnants than in large, high-condition remnants. Densities of generalists such as noisy miner and galah showed the reverse pattern.

abstract={Forestry practices such as fuel-reduction burning and maintenance of road networks can negatively impact avian assemblages, both directly by changing habitat structure and indirectly by creating conditions favorable for predators or competitors. The Brigalow Belt forests include some of the largest contiguous areas of native forest in the temperate and sub-humid zones of eastern Australia. Over 1 million ha of these forests are proposed to be converted from forestry to conservation tenure, yet the impacts on the avifauna of current and potential future forest management practices are not known. We investigated the influence of road edges and habitat type and structure on the avifauna of a 356 000 ha forest. Survey sites were either <50 m or >300 m from a road, and in either cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla forest, spotted gum Corymbia citriodora forest with a regenerating cypress pine/buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii understorey or spotted gum forest with an open understorey due to fuel-reduction burning. The avifauna differed significantly among vegetation types but not with proximity to a road, with the greatest differences between cypress pine and both types of spotted gum forest. The noisy miner Manorina melanocephala, an aggressive avian competitor, appears to be the factor mediating these assemblage-level differences. Noisy miners were rare in cypress pine forest but were three times more numerous than any other species in spotted gum forest. Spotted gum forest with a regenerating understorey had fewer noisy miners. Although total bird abundance was highest in open spotted gum forest, the species richness and abundance of passerines smaller than noisy miners was significantly lower in this forest type. Abundance of small passerines was eight times higher in sites where <3 noisy miners were recorded. Only one species, the eastern yellow robin, was influenced by proximity to a road edge. Cypress pine forest is potentially an important refuge for smaller birds. The results suggest that burning regimes that reduce regeneration of the cypress pine and buloke subcanopy in spotted gum forest potentially are exacerbating the problem of noisy miner domination of the avifauna. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The effects of burn severity on avian communities are poorly understood, yet this information is crucial to fire management programs. To quantify avian response patterns along a burn severity gradient, we sampled 49 random plots (2001-2002) at the 17 351-ha Cerro Grande Fire (2000) in New Mexico, USA. Additionally, pre-fire avian surveys (1986-1988, 1990) created a unique opportunity to quantify avifaunal changes in 13 pre-fire transects (resampled in 2002) and to compare two designs for analyzing the effects of unplanned disturbances: after-only analysis and before-after comparisons. Distance analysis was used to calculate densities. We analyzed after-only densities for 21 species using gradient analysis, which detected a broad range of responses to increasing burn severity: (I) large significant declines, (II) weak, but significant declines, (III) no significant density changes, (IV) peak densities in low- or moderate-severity patches, (V) weak, but significant increases, and (VI) large significant increases. Overall, 71% of the species included in the after-only gradient analysis exhibited either positive or neutral density responses to fire effects across all or portions of the severity gradient (responses III-VI). We used pre/post pairs analysis to quantify density changes for 15 species using before-after comparisons; spatiotemporal variation in densities was large and confounded fire effects for most species. Only four species demonstrated significant effects of burn severity, and their densities were all higher in burned compared to unburned forests. Pre- and post-fire community similarity was high except in high-severity areas. Species richness was similar pre- and post-fire across all burn severities. Thus, ecosystem restoration programs based on the assumption that recent severe fires in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have overriding negative ecological effects are not supported by our study of post-fire avian communities. This study illustrates the importance of quantifying burn severity and controlling confounding sources of spatiotemporal variation in studies of fire effects. After-only gradient analysis can be an efficient tool for quantifying fire effects. This analysis can also augment historical data sets that have small samples sizes coupled with high non-process variation, which limits the power of before-after comparisons. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Migration routes used by Nearctic migrant birds can cover great distances; they also differ among species, within species, and between years and seasons. As a result, migration routes for an entire migratory avifauna can encompass broad geographic areas, making it impossible to protect continuous stretches of habitat sufficient to connect the wintering and breeding grounds for most species. Consequently, ways to enhance habitats converted for human use (i.e. for pasture, crop cultivation, human settlement) as stopover sites for migrants are especially important. Shelterbelts around pastures and fields, if planted with species targeted to support migrant (and resident) bird species that naturally occupy mature forest habitats and that are at least partially frugivorous, could be a powerful enhancement tool for such species, if the birds will enter the converted areas to feed. I tested this approach for Nearctic migrant birds during the spring migration through an area in Chiapas, Mexico. Mature forest tree species whose fruits are eaten by birds were surveyed. Based on life form, crop size and fruit characteristics, I selected three tree species for study: Cymbopetalum mayanum (Annonaceae), Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae) and Trophis racemosa (Moraceae). I compared the use of fruits of these species by migrants and residents in forest with their use of the fruits of isolated individuals of the same species in pasture and cropland. All three plant species were useful for enhancing converted habitats for forest-occupying spring migrants, although species differed in the degree to which they entered disturbed areas to feed on the fruits. These tree species could probably enhance habitats for migrants at sites throughout the natural geographic ranges of the plants; in other geographic areas for other target bird groups, other tree species might be more appropriate. © BirdLife International 2007.},

abstract={Winter roosts afford escape from extreme climatic conditions, reduce heat and energy loss, and provide protection from predators for North American woodpeckers. We monitored the use and characteristics of 12 winter roosts used by nine radio-marked Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona that had experienced wildfire in 1996 and 2000. Roost trees were larger in diameter than 95% of non-roost trees and on average 2.5 times larger within burned areas of similar severity. Roost trees were within patches less dense than 95% of measured patches across study sites, which were on average 1.5 times as dense. Two-thirds of roost trees were created by fire and were smaller than those created by other means. Six birds each used one roost and three males each used two roosts. Two-thirds of the roosts were outside or on the edge of estimated home ranges. Maximum straight-line distances traveled, from roost to farthest point of home range, were > 1 km for 8 of 9 birds. Woodpeckers have a significant role in providing cavities for secondary cavity nesters. Thus, understanding habitat requirements for winter roosts could provide managers with essential tools to maintain or enhance populations of this species.},

abstract={Decline of grassland diversity throughout Europe within the last decades is threatening biological diversity and is a major conservation problem. There is an urgent need to determine the underlying factors that control vascular plant species richness and composition in managed grasslands. In this study, 117 grasslands were sampled using standardised methods. Explanatory variables were recorded for each grassland site, reflecting the local field management, site-specific environmental conditions and large-scale spatial trends. Using variation partitioning methods, we determined the pure and shared effects of these three sets of explanatory variables on the plant species richness and composition in grasslands. Most of the explained variation in plant species richness was related to the joint effect of local field management and environmental variables. However, the applied variation partitioning approach revealed that the pure effect of spatial variables contributed relatively little to explaining variation in both the plant species richness and species composition. The largest fractions of explained variation in plant species composition were accounted for by the pure effects of environmental and local field management variables. Moreover, the results revealed that the main mechanisms by which these sets of explanatory variables affect plant species vary according to the type of management regime under study. From our findings we could conclude that particularly a reduction of nitrogen fertilisation on meadows and grazing at a low stocking rate on pastures can help to conserve biodiversity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={We monitored the nest densities and nest survival of seven cavity-nesting bird species, including four open-space foragers (American Kestrel [Falco sparverius], Lewis's Woodpecker [Melanerpes lewis], Western Bluebird [Sialia mexicana], and Mountain Bluebird [S. currucoides]) and three wood-foragers (Hairy Woodpecker [Picoides villosus], Black-backed Woodpecker [P. arcticus], and Northern Flicker [Colaptes auratus]), after two wildfires (one partially salvage-logged and one unlogged) in western Idaho from 1994-2004. We estimated the relationship between nest density and time since fire, tested for statistical differences in nest densities and nest survival in the partially salvage-logged vs. unlogged wildfires, and tested for differences in nest survival between early (1-4 years after fire) and late (5-12 years after fire) postfire periods. Nest densities of open-space foragers and Northern Flickers generally increased with time since fire, whereas nest densities of Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers peaked 4-5 years postfire. Nest densities of wood-foraging species and Mountain Bluebirds were significantly higher in the unlogged burn, whereas Lewis's Woodpeckers had significantly higher nest densities in the partially logged burn. Kestrels tended to favor the partially logged burn, while Western Bluebird nest densities were nearly equal in both burned areas. For most species, postfire period and treatment (partially logged vs. unlogged) had little influence on nest survival. However, Hairy Woodpecker nest survival was significantly lower in the partially logged burn versus the unlogged wildfire in the early postfire period, and Lewis's Woodpecker nest survival was significantly reduced in the later postfire period versus the early postfire period in the partially logged burn. Importantly, the salvage logging was designed to retain more than half of the snags over 23 cm in diameter, which provided suitable nesting habitat for open-space foragers during the decade following fire. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2007.},

abstract={Anthropogenic habitat disturbance is a major threat to tropical forests and understanding the ecological consequences of this disturbance is crucial for the conservation of biodiversity. There have been many attempts to determine the ecological traits associated with bird species' vulnerability to disturbance, but no attempt has been made to synthesize these studies to show consensus. We analyzed data from 57 published studies (covering 1214 bird species) that investigated the response of tropical bird assemblages to moderate forest disturbance (e.g., selective logging). Our results show that the mean abundance of species from six commonly reported feeding guilds responded differently to disturbance and that species' ecological traits (body size, local population size, and geographic range size) and evolutionary relationships may influence responses in some guilds. Granivore abundance increased significantly and insectivore and frugivore abundance decreased significantly following disturbance. These general conclusions were robust to the effects of ecological traits and phylogeny. Responses of carnivores, nectarivores, and omnivores were less clear, but analyses that accounted for phylogeny indicated that these guilds declined following disturbance. In contrast to the other guilds, the reported responses of carnivores and nectarivores differed among regions (Asia vs. Neotropics) and were influenced by the sampling protocols used in different studies (e.g., time since disturbance), which may explain the difficulty in detecting general responses to disturbance in these guilds. Overall, general patterns governed the responses of species to habitat disturbance, and the differential responses of guilds suggested that disturbance affects trophic organization and thus ecosystem functioning. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity has set ambitious targets for the establishment and management of protected areas. For the oceans, the overall aim is to establish, by 2012, an effectively managed, representative, global system of marine protected areas (MPAs) covering 10% of all marine ecological regions, comprising both multiple use areas and strictly protected areas. An analysis of data for three countries in Eastern Africa, where considerable efforts to promote MPAs by many agencies have been made over the past decade, shows that rapid progress has been made towards achieving this target. Since the first MPAs were established in the 1960s and 1970s, 8.7% of the continental shelf in Kenya, 8.1% in Tanzania and 4.0% in Mozambique has been designated, with the size of recently protected sites markedly larger than earlier sites. Commitments to expand the MPA networks in these countries would, if implemented, largely achieve the 10% coverage target. The location of existing marine protected areas shows good correlation with known sites of high species diversity; and coral reefs and Important Bird Areas are well represented. Management effectiveness of MPAs is also improving. However, there are major constraints to meeting the MPA target in these countries. Many habitats and species are not yet fully represented, the area closed to fishing is less than the recommended 20-30%, and capacity building is needed to improve many aspects of management. Furthermore, despite considerable investment in monitoring of coral reefs and other coastal habitats, the data available do not show clearly whether biodiversity and socio-economic objectives are being met. Although East African countries need to be congratulated for their vision, the results thus far indicate the urgency of both improving monitoring systems for measuring progress towards the targets, and also taking further steps to expand and improve management of existing MPAs. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The study compared plant and avian diversity and species composition between four habitats to review the potential implications of two distinct management practices on a forestry estate, namely to rehabilitate riparian zones to grasslands or woodlands as the two habitats that historically occurred on the property. The study habitats were Plantation (Pinus trees in riparian zone), Bushland (recently harvested), Grassland (cleared of broadleaf plants), and Woodland (control). At seven sampling sites per habitat, a vegetation assess- ment was conducted, while birds were caught with mist nests. Plant species richness increased from Plantation to Woodland, whereas most bird species and individuals were found in Bushland. Plant and bird species composition differed significantly between habitats. Bushland and Grassland birds were closely associated with exotic forbs. Grassland attracted birds with diverse habitat and nesting-site associations, and Woodland birds associated with woody plants. It is recommended that the majority of riparian zones be managed as grasslands, although the exact affect of the biennial summer burning and presence of exotic plants on birds needs to be investigated. To attract cavity-nesting birds to the Estate, some suitable riparian zones should be rehabilitated to Woodland by planting Ficus and Acaciatrees, as these trees are the most abundant and frequently occurring in this habitat. Rather than manage avian diversity per se, the African stonechat in Grassland and lesser honeyguidel in Woodland can be employed as indicators of the rehabilitation state of the riparian zones.},

abstract={Oak savannas and woodlands historically covered millions of hectares in the midwestern United States but are rare today. We evaluated the ecological distinctiveness and conservation value of savannas and woodlands by examining bird distributions across a fire-maintained woody-vegetation gradient in northwest Indiana encompassing five habitats - open habitats with low canopy cover, savannas, woodlands, scrublands, and forests - during migration, breeding, and overwintering. Savannas and woodlands were significantly different in overall bird species composition from open and forest habitats but were often intermediate between open and forest in guild densities. Few bird species were consistently and highly concentrated in savannas or woodlands, and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) was the only species significantly more abundant in savannas and woodlands than in open, scrub, and forest habitats. Fire frequency over a 15-year interval was a significant predictor of bird community composition and was positively related to species diversity, spring transient migrant density, and density of the most threatened species. Each habitat type had characteristics potentially important for avian conservation. Scrub had the highest density of transient migrants, which suggests it plays an important role as migration stopover habitat. More species were significantly concentrated in open or forest habitats than in the other habitats. Lack of species concentration and intermediate community composition suggested that birds experienced savannas and woodlands more as ecotones than as habitats distinct from forests or grasslands. However, this intermediate character can benefit conservation, as evidenced by savannas and woodlands having the highest density of the most threatened species along this woody-vegetation gradient. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2007.},

abstract={Restoration Ecology is the application of principles from Evolutionary Ecology to recover ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed by human activities. Successful restoration requires clearly defined objectives and the means to assess progress in meeting them. Often this includes monitoring population trajectories (changes in population size over time) of focal species. Unfortunately, population trajectories in and of themselves are often ambiguous and open to interpretation. Incorporation of additional information can increase the information content of such monitoring programs. Here we advocate using behavioral indicators, particularly the giving-up density (GUD) of food in experimental foraging patches, to complement more traditional monitoring programs that track changes in population sizes over time. We use the results of two field studies to demonstrate how GUDs reflect changes in environmental quality (background food abundance), changing physiological costs of maintenance over an annual cycle, and risk of predation. We then illustrate, through hypothetical examples, how knowledge of changes in GUDs over time can inform interpretation of actual population trajectories (based on 12 years of monitoring) of four bird species of conservation concern at the United States Forest Service Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois, USA. We conclude with a prospectus providing guidelines for incorporating behavioral indicators like the GUD in monitoring programs. Integrating behavioral indicators with more traditional population monitoring approaches provides an effective means of acquiring useful information in a timely and efficient manner.},

abstract={This study was carried out to establish the direction of environment-ecological planning for the Eco-city through a survey to determine Seoul's environment-ecological status. The survey focused on entropy, water circulation and biological diversity. First the temperature rise may be continued by a high ratio of commercial areas developed with high density in terms of entropy. Second the underground development in high density built-up areas and the high ratio of impermeable pavement were analyzed as water- circulation. Lastly, although the ratio of forest and river biotope was high, those were distributed in the suburbs of Seoul and were artificially established. In addition, the damp areas which had critical functions as habitats in the city were distributed on a small-scale. Therefore, as the direction of energy circulation plan, 7 detailed planning items were required as follows: the improvement of roadside's trees and green spaces, the formation of brook street, tree-planting in the school's playground, an extension and new formation of children's park green space, tree-planting around public institutions and religious facilities, tree-planting on roofs and walls, an increase in green space around apartment complexes and the establishment of environment-ecological planning. In terms of water circulation; ecological restoration of artificial rivers, security of rainfall reservoir and establishment of residential area with satisfactory water circulation were suggested. Also, improvement plans for the biological diversity must be established by classifying into the three parts; the security of the biological habitats, the formation of urban ecological axis and the activation of ecological culture. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Additionally, environmental variables were measured within a 25 m radius of each plot. Three years after fire the number of birds and bird species were similar for undisturbed and burned forests, but species diversity and turnover were significantly lower in the burned forests. The bird species composition also differed significantly between undisturbed and burned forests, with a strong decline of closed forest preferring bird species accompanied by a strong increase in degraded forest preferring species in burned forests. These differences were strongly related to differences in environmental conditions such as shifts in vegetation cover and layering and differences in ground and understorey vegetation structure. We also found significant shifts in body mass distribution, foraging height and feeding guilds between the bird communities in unburned and burned forests. Surprisingly, repeated burning did not lead to increasing impoverishment of the avifauna, and both once and twice burned forests still contained most of the bird species that were also present in undisturbed forest, even though their densities were considerably lowered. © 2006 Springer.},

Vocalizations were broadcasted monthly at sunrise, noon and sunset, during one year. For B. leucoblepharus, C. caudata and T. surrucura, sunrise and noon were more efficient than sunset. Batara cinerea presented higher efficiency from July to October. Playback expanded the favourable period for avifaunal surveys in tropical forest, usually restricted to early morning in the breeding season. The playback was efficient in detecting the presence of all species when the abundance was not too low. But only B. leucoblepharus and T. surrucura showed abundance values significantly related to this efficiency. The present study provided a precise indication of the best daily and seasonal periods and a confidence interval to maximize the efficiency of playback to detect the occurrence of these forest species.},

abstract={The large intact areas of old-growth forest of the Archangelsk oblast represent today a possibility of studying taiga ecology in ecosystems that we do not find in Fennoscandia. They are to be regarded as the sources for the taiga-elements in our own coniferous forests. This study of bird communities was done in the core of one of the old remaining, intact forests of Archangelsk, alongside the Yula river in Pinega and Vinogradovsky rayons («regions»). Bird communities in mature spruce and pine dominated forests were studied in spring 2005. These communities from the core area of the taiga are compared with coniferous forest in the rural municipality of Lierne in eastern central Norway, studied in 2004. This latter area should be representative for the westernmost parts of the taiga. Due to extensive forestry exploitation and natural heterogeneity it is heavily fragmented, leaving behind only smaller fragments of more or less coherent old-growth stands. Findings in our comparison: • Species dependent on sufficient amount of dead wood, e.g. woodpeckers, comprise far less of the bird communities within the small-grained old-growth fragments in Lierne compared with the situation in the virgin taiga at Yula. • The abundance of all hole-nesters (including those using snags and cracks in the trunks) is considerably diluted in the bird community within the old-growth forest in Lierne compared with those found in the coniferous forests at Yula. • The assemblage forming the old-growth bird guild (predominately passerines) is still almost as abundant in the remaining fragments in Lierne as in the large block of taiga at Yula. As high abundance of hole-nesters might reflect the occurrence of several other vulnerable forest species among insects, vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens, our findings from the bird survey should also indicate a more general high conservation value of this large block of taiga at Yula.},

abstract={Currently over 14.6 million ha of land at an annual cost of US$1.76 billion are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The habitat benefits of CRP frequently are lauded, but documentation that wildlife is responding as hoped is urgently needed. We evaluated plant and breeding bird responses to 92.4 ha of CRP grasslands at Chino Farms in northeastern Maryland, USA. In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and facilitate stand establishment. In 6 years cumulative plant species richness increased to 261, 105 of which were species exotic to the region. During the third growing season, we initiated a schedule of prescribed burning on a 3-year rotation to remove accumulated litter and to retard woody succession, and in 2003 we added additional management to control aggressive plant species. Several at-risk bird species colonized the restored grasslands in the first year and established sustainable breeding populations. We implemented a comprehensive observation and banding program, which included mapping male territories for selected bird species and recording nest locations. We marked 1,985 grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; GRSPs) in 7 years. Breeding GRSP populations ranged annually from 70 to 90 socially monogamous pairs with an additional 40 non-territorial males. Annual return rates in the last 5 years were 57% for adult males, 41% for adult females, and 12% for hatch-year individuals. Adults and young birds exhibited high site fidelity, but overgrown fields left unburned for 2-3 years were unpopulated by GRSPs but attracted several shrub-land bird species. Habitat preference for territories was influenced more by vegetation structure than by plant species composition. We recommend the management of grasslands restored for birds include spatial and temporal rotation of prescribed fire and herbicide applications to sustain vegetation physical structure rather than species composition.},

abstract={We investigated how changes in vegetation structure and prey resources following wildfire affected the winter ecology of hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona, USA. Using point-counts, radiotelemetry, and focal bird observation, we assessed the relative abundance, home range size and composition, and habitat use by foraging hairy woodpeckers in 3 stands that had experienced wildfire in 1996, 2000, or 2002. Because we conducted the study over 2 years, we used the 1996 fire to represent 6 and 7 years after fire, while we used the 2000 fire to represent 2 and 3 years after fire in a space-for-time substitution chronosequence analysis. We also assessed bark beetle and woodborer density by x-raying bark samples collected from a subset of trees within burned areas. We detected significantly greater hairy woodpecker relative abundance in burned forests representing 1 and 2 years after fire, and bark beetle and woodborer density was highest in these stands as well. Woodpecker home range size increased across stands representing increasing time since fire. Within a burn, hairy woodpeckers used high-severity burned areas more than moderate-severity burned areas representing 2 and 3 years after fire, but not m areas representing 6 and 7 years after fire. Bark beetle and woodborer densities were also higher in high-severity burned stands representing 2 and 3 years after fire. Hairy woodpeckers used edges of high-severity burned areas more than the interior. We hypothesize that an initial increase in bark beetle and woodborer density following fire allowed for higher woodpecker abundance and smaller home ranges, but as burned forests aged, bark beetle and woodborer density within trees decreased, killed trees fell, and, in response, hairy woodpecker relative abundance decreased and home range size increased. These patterns suggest that high-severity burned areas provide important but ephemeral resources to this dominant primary cavity-nester. The higher bark beetle and woodborer densities and greater use of edges of high-severity burned areas by woodpeckers suggests that salvage logging of these areas could remove potential prey and preferred foraging areas for hairy woodpeckers, especially when trees are removed along severely burned edges.},

abstract={The combined effects of rapid habitat loss, fragmentation and disturbance on tropical forest avifaunas have not been examined to date. The southern Amazonian 'arc of deforestation' marks the boundary of the most aggressive agricultural frontier in tropical forests worldwide. We sampled 21 disturbed and undisturbed primary forest patches, ranging in size from 1.2 to 14,476 ha, to elucidate the synergistic effects of both forest disturbance and fragmentation on bird community structure, and pinpoint which species were the "winners" and "losers" from this process. A number of forest patch metrics, derived from an independent remote sensing approach, explained much of the resulting presence/absence matrix. The bird community exhibited a highly nested structure, with small patches being most dissimilar from one another. Bird species differed in their response to both forest patch size and forest canopy perforation according to their dependence on closed-canopy primary forest. Forest patch geometry, which clearly modulated the shape of species-area relationships accounted for 83-96% of the variation in species richness, but forest habitat quality resulting from logging and surface-fire disturbance was also a significant predictor of species richness for the most forest-dependent taxa. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Farmland birds have suffered a severe decline in recent years throughout Europe including Ireland. Agricultural intensification is believed to be the main cause and this has led to the introduction of agri-environmental schemes, of which set-aside is a part. Bird abundance and diversity were compared between set-aside and adjacent tillage or grassland at 18 locations. The set-aside sites were also assigned to one of four management types: rotational set-aside, non-rotational set-aside, first year set-aside that was productive grassland in the previous year, and long-term set-aside that was grazed by animals in winter. Species diversity and the abundances of skylark, meadow pipit and woodpigeon were significantly greater in set-aside sites. Species diversity was not significantly different between set-aside management types and meadow pipit, skylark, pheasant, house sparrow, magpie, snipe and starling were closely associated with non-rotational set-aside, which also contained significantly larger numbers of these species compared to the other set-aside types. This study shows that set-aside does enhance bird diversity and abundance and that, in Ireland, the most effective form of set-aside is non-rotational. It also shows that the most appropriate form of set-aside will vary from situation to situation and that a one size fits all view should not be taken in the development of agri-environmental schemes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={We investigated the effects of postfire salvage logging on cavity-nesting birds by comparing nest densities and patterns of nest reuse over a three-year period in seven logged and eight unlogged patches of mixed-conifer forest in the Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife Management Area, Montana. We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots, but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots. Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in the salvage-logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent species in the northern Rocky Mountains - American Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters, which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots, nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially populations of primary cavity-nesting species. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2006.},

abstract={There are four major bird management plans in effect in Canada: the North American Landbird Management Plan, the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, the Canadian Shorebird Conservation Plan, and Wings Over Water (the Canadian waterbird conservation plan). These plans cover almost all native bird species that occur regularly in Canada. All of these plans operate under the North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI). The intent of this report is to increase awareness of the four major Federal bird plans among the forest industry, to provide forest managers a common reference point relative to the Federal government's perspective on managing various types of birds in Canada, and to synthesize information on birds that is most relevant to forest management planning. About 634 species of birds occur in Canada. We reviewed all of those bird species and identified species which may be affected by forestry operations. Effects of forestry on birds may be positive, negative, or mixed depending on the species, specific management practices, spatial scale, and time scale. We also reviewed the Bird Conservation Region (BCR) concept, a tool developed for the North American Bird Conservation Initiative. BCRs are ecologically defined units that share similar avifaunas and provide a consistent spatial framework for bird conservation across North American landscapes. The BCR concept is very relevant to the forest industry because most of the forest bird conservation planning processes currently underway in Canada are related to BCRs and the priority forest bird species within each. The plan most relevant to the forest industry is the Partners in Flight North American Landbird Conservation Plan (NALCP). It provides a continental synthesis of priorities and objectives to guide conservation actions for landbirds, many of which are forest-dwelling species. The primary objective of the NALCP is to maintain a representative diversity of avifauna in all ecoregions of Canada and the U.S. Many of the 448 species covered by the NALCP breed in forested landscapes and may be directly or indirectly affected by forestry operations in positive and negative ways over various temporal and spatial scales, depending on the species and practice in question. We estimate that 48 of those species, which are all on Watch or Stewardship Lists, are of interest to the forest industry, as special management may be required to conserve populations. Other species that may be affected by forestry operations are thought to be secure under current conditions. The North American Waterfowl Management Plan (NAWMP) is an international (Canada, U.S., Mexico) action plan to conserve migratory waterfowl (ducks, geese, and swans) throughout the continent. The NAWMP was initiated in 1986, updated in 1998, and is a partnership of federal, provincial/state and municipal governments, non-governmental organizations, industry and many individuals. The primary objective of the NAWMP is to restore North American waterfowl populations to levels recorded during the 1970s, a period of relative abundance for waterfowl populations. Notably, there are several species that have already exceeded these objectives. Of the 39 waterfowl species that occur in Canada and that are covered by the NAWMP, only 8 species are thought to be potentially affected by forestry operations; most of these species are cavity-nesting ducks. The Canadian Shorebird Conservation Plan (CSCP) is a national plan designed to promote the conservation of shorebirds in Canada. The plan is intended to cooperate with other bird conservation initiatives including the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan, the Western Hemispheric Shorebird Reserve Network, the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, and Wings Over Water. The CSCP's stated vision is to ensure that healthy populations of shorebirds are distributed across their range and diversity of habitats in Canada and throughout their global range. Of the 47 shorebird species covered by the CSCP, we suggest only 4 species (listed as Not at Risk in Canada by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) are potentially impacted by forestry operations: lesser yellowlegs, greater yellowlegs, solitary sandpiper, and American woodcock. Wings Over Water (WOW), Canada's Waterbird Conservation Plan is the Canadian component of North American Waterbird Conservation Plan. The purpose of the plan is to sustain or restore, throughout the lands and waters of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean, the distribution, diversity, and abundance of populations and habitats of waterbirds. We suggest that only 5 of the 93 species covered by WOW are potentially impacted by forestry operations in Canada: Bonaparte's Gull, Green Heron, and Sandhill Crane ('Not at Risk'), and Great Blue Heron fannini subspecies ('Special Concern') and Marbled Murrelet ('Threatened'). We briefly reviewed linkages between Canada's Species At Risk Act and the 4 bird conservation plans, mainly as they may lead to future bird species conservation priorities at federal and provincial levels. Finally, we provide concluding remarks on the plans' similarities, differences, and relevance to the forest industry. The four bird conservation plans reviewed in this report have clear, but mainly indirect, relevance to forest management in Canada. The plans provide strategic-level guidance on goals and objectives for national and international conservation of birds, and on issues and threats for birds, but provide only high-level commentary on management actions or strategies. Specific management recommendations are lacking. The forest industry will need to rely on provincial and corporate guidelines, biodiversity management policy, effective operational-level actions, and formation of partnerships with other stakeholders to help attain the goals and objectives of the four federal bird conservation plans discussed herein. © 2006 by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc.},

abstract={Locally derived information is needed if management guidelines intended to improve wildlife habitat are to be relevant, reliable, and applicable. Within the Intermountain West, few studies have examined habitat relationships of forest songbirds in mixed-conifer forests. During 1996-1997, we studied breeding bird communities in a mixed-conifer forest in west-central Idaho, USA, to describe how relative avian abundance was related to forest structure. Our study objectives were to 1) describe bird use of 3 distinct forest age-classes, 2) identify groups of species that expressed similar relationships with forest structural attributes, and 3) model species-specific bird-habitat relationships. We sampled 46 study sites (forest stands) classified into 1 of 3 common "vegetation growth stages" (seral stages): 1) shrub/seedling/sapling (n = 75 stands), 2) small tree (n = 16 stands), and 3) old growth (n = 15 stands). In each stand we surveyed breeding birds using fixed-radius point counts and measured forest structure at each point-count location. Of 30 species examined, the relative abundance of 10 differed among vegetation growth stages. Differences in stand structure were reflected by several strong gradients of vegetation structure and composition (e.g., canopy cover, diameter of large trees, snag density, and stump density) across vegetation growth stages. We used cluster analysis to establish novel information about how birds responded to these gradients and identified 3 distinct bird assemblages: forest generalists, early seral specialists, and mid- to late-seral specialists. Habitat models derived from multiple linear regression revealed that canopy cover was the best predictor of variation in abundance for numerous bird species. We conclude that changes in the amount of overstory cover will have the greatest influence on birds. Where canopy cover is reduced below, or increased above, a threshold level of approximately 25-40% cover, we predict that occurrence or density of some breeding birds will change. Our habitat models suggest that Townsend's warbler (Dendroica townsendi), red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), and brown creeper (Certhia americana) would respond negatively to reductions in canopy cover; chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina), dusky flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri), and warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus) would respond positively. This type of information will contribute to regional planning processes by allowing species "trade-offs" to be assessed under different forest management scenarios.},

abstract={Bottomland hardwood forests of the southeastern United States support a rich avifauna, including >20 species of conservation concern; understanding the impact of land use practices on these communities is critical to their conservation. Selective timber harvesting is a common management practice in southern bottomland hardwood forests, but little research has examined impacts > 5 years after harvesting. We studied breeding bird communities in selectively harvested bottomland forests in northeastern Louisiana during 2003-2004. We conducted point counts in recently harvested stands (1-5 yr postharvest) and older harvests (12-18 yr postharvest); we paired each with a reference stand that had not been harvested for >30 years. Of 35 species with sufficient detections for analysis, we found evidence that abundances of 17 species differed among treatments. Three species were sensitive to creation of canopy openings by timber harvests, including 2 species of concern in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, USA, prothonotary warbler (Protonotaria citrea) and Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens). However, 4 species of concern often associated with densely vegetated canopy gaps were more abundant in older harvests than in reference stands: Swainson's warbler (Llmnothlypis swainsonii), hooded warbler (Wilsonia citrina), white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus), and Kentucky warbler (Oporornis formosus). As expected, a suite of species typically associated with shrub and forest-edge habitats was more abundant in recent harvests than in reference stands. We conclude that selective logging has a strong influence on bird abundances in both recent and older harvests in bottomland forests. With the exception of Acadian flycatcher, older harvests and reference stands supported similar abundances of the species typically found in closed-canopy bottomland forests. In addition, older harvests supported substantially higher abundances of gap-dependent species than other treatments. Our results should be useful to land managers and conservation planners evaluating short- and long-term effects of timber management practices on breeding birds in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. However, measures of breeding productivity are necessary to evaluate more fully the habitat quality of harvested forests.},

abstract={In tallgrass prairie, disturbances such as grazing and fire can generate patchiness across the landscape, contributing to a shifting mosaic that presumably enhances biodiversity. Grassland birds evolved within the context of this shifting mosaic, with some species restricted to one or two patch types created under spatially and temporally distinct disturbance regimes. Thus, management-driven reductions in heterogeneity may be partly responsible for declines in numbers of grassland birds. We experimentally altered spatial heterogeneity of vegetation structure within a tallgrass prairie by varying the spatial and temporal extent of fire and by allowing grazing animals to move freely among burned and unburned patches (patch treatment). We contrasted this disturbance regime with traditional agricultural management of the region that promotes homogeneity (traditional treatment). We monitored grassland bird abundance during the breeding seasons of 2001-2003 to determine the influence of altered spatial heterogeneity on the grassland bird community. Focal disturbances of patch burning and grazing that shifted through the landscape over several years resulted in a more heterogeneous pattern of vegetation than uniform application of fire and grazing. Greater spatial heterogeneity in vegetation provided greater variability in the grassland bird community. Some bird species occurred in greatest abundance within focally disturbed patches, while others occurred in relatively undisturbed patches in our patch treatment. Henslow's Sparrow, a declining species, occurred only within the patch treatment. Upland Sandpiper and some other species were more abundant on recently disturbed patches within the same treatment. The patch burn treatment created the entire gradient of vegetation structure required to maintain a suite of grassland bird species that differ in habitat preferences. Our study demonstrated that increasing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of disturbance in grasslands increases variability in vegetation structure that results in greater variability at higher trophic levels. Thus, management that creates a shifting mosaic using spatially and temporally discrete disturbances in grasslands can be a useful tool in conservation. In the case of North American tallgrass prairie, discrete fires that capitalize on preferential grazing behavior of large ungulates promote a shifting mosaic of habitat types that maintain biodiversity and agricultural productivity. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Species richness was 25% greater in forested stands compared to clearcut areas, yet total bird density was 50% greater in clearcut areas. Bird communities ranged from open-habitat assemblages in clearcut areas to forest-obligate assemblages in ST stands. Little overlap of avian community composition was observed between ST stands and clearcut areas. PT and SS stands supported avian communities where most species were observed at intermediate abundance values compared to ST or clearcut areas. Highly fragmented, closed-canopy stands embedded within the silvicultural landscape of HSNF do not support large populations of species traditionally associated with detrimental edge effects on forest-obligate songbirds. Intensively managed PT and SS stands appear to provide suboptimal habitat for forest and grassland species. Land managers in HSNF could maximize regional avian diversity by maintaining a mosaic of large closed-canopy, oak-pine stands, and fire-maintained open areas embedded among other silvicultural stand types.},

abstract={By emulating natural disturbances like wildfire, managers hope to maintain biodiversity in managed forests. Leaving residual live trees in harvested areas is an important component of this strategy. However, the influence of this approach on songbird communities is largely unknown. We surveyed songbirds in 166 stands in the Rocky Mountains in BC, Canada, that had been logged or burned by wildfire. Stands were located in mid or high elevation biogeoclimatic zones, and varied from 7 to 45 years since disturbance and in density of residual trees from 0 to 320 conifer overstory, 0 to 832 conifer understory, and 0 to 68 broadleaf trees/ha. Although differences in bird communities between burned and logged stands of similar ages were detected, these differences were not consistent between biogeoclimatic zones, nor did they explain a large amount of the variation in bird communities. Logged stands had a higher density of birds, but expected species richness did not differ between logged and burned stands. All but a few rare species were detected in both disturbance types. Of 26 species analysed in detail, densities of 14 were greater in logged stands, 6 were greater in burned stands, and 6 were not significantly different between disturbance types. The bird community, bird abundance and densities of individual species were influenced by residual tree density and type. As time since disturbance increased, bird communities in burned and logged stands in the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir zone became more similar, but those in the Montane Spruce zone became less so, likely due to differences in residual tree density. Results suggest differences in bird communities in logged and burned stands ≥7 years post-disturbance are mainly in abundance rather than community composition, but abundances of individual species can be significantly influenced by residual tree density and type. Managers can influence the abundance of some species in harvested areas by manipulating the type and density of residual trees. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The frequency of wild and prescribed fires in montane forests of the southwestern United States has increased after a century of fire suppression and subsequent fuels accumulation. To assess the effects of recent fires (median time since fire = 6 yr) on the montane forest bird community, we surveyed birds in 8 Sky Island mountain ranges in southeastern Arizona, USA, and examined how the distribution (i.e., presence-absence) of 65 species and relative abundance of 16 species correlated with evidence of severe and less severe fire at >1,500 survey points. We detected associations between fire and bird presence-absence for 17% of the 65 species analyzed and between fire and bird relative abundance for 25% of the 16 species analyzed. Most species (73%) were positively associated with burned areas and displayed stronger associations (i.e., more extreme odds ratios) with survey points that had evidence of severe as opposed to less severe fire. Positive associations with severe fire were strong (>3 to 1 odds) for western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and house wren (Troglodytes aedon), and negative associations with severe fire were strong for warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus) and red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis). Although recent fires appear to have had a positive effect on the distribution and relative abundance of several montane forest bird species in the region, these species are not the open-woodland birds that we would have expected to have benefited from fire based on previous research. Nevertheless, our results confirm associations between fire and bird presence-absence and relative abundance reported previously for 7 species of birds. Our results also provide new information for Grace's warbler (Dendroica graciae) and greater pewee (C. pertinax), 2 species for which fire data were formerly lacking. Managers can use these data to make and test predictions about the effects of future fires, both severe and less severe, on montane forest birds in the southwestern United States.},

abstract={Heterogeneous landscapes are biodiversity 'hotspots'. Degradation resulting from acidification, desiccation and eutrophication not only decreases habitat quality, but also causes heterogeneity to decline. While restoration measures aim at restoring habitat quality, they can further reduce heterogeneity when they affect large parts of an area (large scale) or cause disturbance (high intensity). Successful restoration of biological diversity therefore requires knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the relation between landscape heterogeneity and species diversity. This paper addresses two questions: (1)Do bog pools in a heterogeneous landscape harbour more aquatic macroinvertebrate species than those located in more homogeneous landscapes?(2)Is distance between water bodies an important factor determining species composition? To answer the first question, aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages in bog pools with a similar water chemistry range were studied in bog remnants differing in landscape heterogeneity. The most heterogeneous remnant (Korenburgerveen) had the highest scores on all diversity indices, indicating that bog pools situated in a heterogeneous landscape have a higher diversity than those located in more homogeneous landscapes. To answer the second question, the most heterogeneous remnant was studied in greater detail. Adjacent water bodies were more similar in species composition than expected on the basis of differences in local environmental conditions. This indicates that not only environmental conditions, but also spatial configuration determines the species composition. In conclusion, species diversity in heterogeneous landscapes (i.e. those with a combination of different parts) is greater than the total number of species that would be present if the individual parts were separated. Conservation and restoration strategies should not only focus on enlarging habitat areas and restoring a single habitat type, but also on conserving and strengthening landscape heterogeneity. We present some guidelines for improving habitat quality without causing heterogeneity to decline. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A functional network of green space is important for the maintenance of the ecological dimension of a sustainable urban landscape. We used avian ecological diversity as a proxy for evaluating the functionality of different types of urban green space. The urban landscape of the municipality of Örebro in Sweden was stratified into four strata (City centre, Residential, Greenway and Periphery). Bird species found in these strata were classified into four ecological groups with decreasing degree of specialisation (woodpeckers, hole-nesters, forest birds and urban birds). Overall there was lower bird species richness in the City centre and Residential areas compared to the Greenway and Periphery. Woodpeckers, hole-nesters and forest birds showed an increasing trend in the number of species as well as individuals from the City centre to the Periphery while urban birds showed the opposite trend. The amount and quality of green space as well as natural vegetation increased from the City centre to the Periphery. Species richness of woodpeckers, forest birds and hole-nesters were positively correlated with tree density while urban birds showed an inverse correlation. There was no dead wood in City centre, Residential and Greenway in contrast to the Periphery, which held some dying trees, stumps and old windthrows. Our findings emphasise the importance of urban green space with natural structures to maintain high ecological diversity. Finally, we discuss how conflicts between habitat for biodiversity maintenance and other functions of green space could be handled by zoning. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Fire is an important determinant of many aspects of savanna ecosystem structure and function. However, relatively little is known about the effects of fire on faunal biodiversity in savannas. We conducted a short-term study to examine the effects of a replicated experimental burn on bird diversity and abundance in savanna habitat of central Kenya. Twenty-two months after the burn, Shannon diversity of birds was 32% higher on plots that had been burned compared with paired control plots. We observed no significant effects of burning on total bird abundance or species richness. Several families of birds were found only on plots that had been burned; one species, the rattling cisticola (Cisticola chiniana), was found only on unburned plots. Shrub canopy area was negatively correlated with bird diversity on each plot, and highly correlated with grass height and the abundance of orthopterans. Our results suggest that the highest landscape-level bird diversity might be obtained through a mosaic of burned and unburned patches. This is also most likely to approximate the historical state of bird diversity in this habitat, because patchy fires have been an important natural disturbance in tropical ecosystems for millennia. © 2006 The Authors.},

Home-range sizes of paired males and females (n = 4 pairs) were similar within habitat type; mean distances between consecutive locations differed by habitat type and sex.

abstract={Although the American black duck (Anas rubripes) has been designated a priority species in eastern North America, no systematic survey has been done in the agricultural lowlands of southern Québec, where the species is suspected to be relatively abundant and cohabits with the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), often considered as a competing species. During the spring of 1998 and 1999, we surveyed breeding waterfowl in 343 4-km2 plots distributed in the lowlands of the St. Lawrence Valley and Lac-Saint-Jean, Canada, and in agricultural areas of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Canada. American black duck densities were higher in dairy farm and forested landscapes (&gt;39 indicated breeding pairs [IBPs]/100 km2) than in cropland landscapes (8 IBPs/100 km2). Mallard densities were similar across all landscape types (30-43 IBPs/100 km2). Habitat modeling using data derived from satellite imagery indicated that the presence of black ducks decreased with increasing areas of corn, ploughed fields, and deciduous forests, whereas it was favored in areas where topography was undulating with slopes of 10-15%. The same parameters had the opposite effect on mallard presence. The odds of black ducks being present were doubled where mallards were present, indicating that both species seem to be attracted to areas supporting adequate habitats, which contradicts the hypothesis of competition between these 2 species to explain for recent declines in the black duck population. Results of our habitat analyses support the hypothesis that habitat changes may be a primary factor leading to these declines. Dairy farm landscapes are of great importance for black ducks, and the conversion of this type of landscape toward a cropland landscape represents a threat to an important portion of the population of this species.},

abstract={Although considered by some as a less "ecologically suitable" forestry model than "near-natural" stand management, even-aged plantation forest management, with regeneration procedure involving clearcutting, creates temporary habitat for many early-successional birds. The present study addresses the question of the conservation value for birds of clearcutting-related open areas in European temperate forest, in the context of a mixed woodland-farmland landscape. The point count technique was used to census the breeding birds on 300 sampling plots, distributed in the eight main habitat types of the Ardenne region (southern Belgium), including agricultural land, edge habitats, closed forest habitats and open areas in forest. Most of these open areas in forest derive from clearcutting practices, rapidly planted with young Norway Spruce (Picea abies). We quantified the conservation value of a given habitat type by using a "conservation value index", integrating the frequency of occurrence of each species in the considered habitat and their conservation status in Europe or in southern Belgium. Both conservation value index and species richness were higher for edge habitats and open areas in forest, compared to forest interior and agricultural land. Detrended Correspondence Analysis of the plot species lists showed that bird assemblages from open area in forest are not intermediate between forest and agricultural open land, as opposed to external edge habitats. Hence, open areas in forest do not contain bird assemblages composed of forest species mixed with colonizing agricultural species but rather shelter specific bird assemblages. An Indicator Species analysis further emphasized this specificity and identified seven species, which, in the Ardenne context, form a group of species specific to open areas in forest. Due to major changes of land use in the Ardenne during the 20th century, which leads to a tremendous decrease of moor, heath and fallow land areas, clearcut openings in the plantation forest progressively gained high conservation value at the regional scale. Further studies about habitat requirement of the conservation interest species inhabiting these open areas is needed, including a better understanding of how early-successional species react to forest planning. If plantation forestry evolves to an uneven-aged and more permanently closed forest, then other options, including semi-natural habitat restoration, are urgently required to save early-successional bird communities. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Within boreal forests of western North America, the dominant large-scale natural disturbance is wildfire. Thus, harvesting that is as similar as possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities. We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds) from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies. Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a single forest type. © 2006 NRC.},

abstract={Persistent questions concerning the warning coloration of unpalatable insects address whether the bright aposematic colour itself or its combination with a species-specific dark pattern is the key factor in their protection against insectivorous birds, and how chromatic polymorphism originates and is maintained in aposematics. In the present study, these questions were tested experimentally, using the birds Parus major, Parus caeruleus, Erithacus rubecula, and Sylvia atricapilla as predators, and chromatically polymorphic firebug Pyrrhocoris apterus: red wild form, white, yellow, and orange mutants (all four of them with the same black melanin pattern, the mutants differing in colour of pteridine pigments only) and the nonaposematic brown-painted wild form as prey. The results show that a specific colour is essential for the birds to recognize the specific aposematic prey; the melanin pattern is not sufficient. White mutants were no better protected than nonaposematic firebugs; red wild-type and orange mutants were equally well protected against all bird species; and the reaction of birds to yellow mutants was species-specific. An evolutionary scenario of 'recurrent recessive mutations' is formulated to explain the origin of colour polymorphism in some aposematics. © 2006 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={Our purpose was to define a quantitative and expeditious method to analyze the effects of processes that influence species distribution and abundance at different organizational scales. We considered habitat loss, the breaking apart of habitat patches, and habitat structural alteration critical processes that affect species distribution and abundance. We evaluated the effects of these processes by considering the response of selected indicator species to isolation (landscape scale), patch size and edge effect (patch scale), and habitat structure (plot scale). We used broadleaf forests as our case-study ecosystem and birds as indicator species. Faunal data came from a georeferenced, long-term, breeding-bird database, and environmental data were obtained from field surveys and land-use digital cartography. Birds, grouped according to their sensitivity to patch isolation, patch size, edge effect, and habitat structure, indicated how environmental conditions affected species abundance. The most sensitive group to the above-mentioned processes included the Marsh Tit (Parus palustris), Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), and Short-toed Treecreeper (Certhia brachydactyla). We evaluated the umbrella effect of these species for the conservation of the other co-occurring birds and found that their effectiveness varied according to the criterion used to select sites for protection. Site selection based on indicator species identified forest patches with greater species abundance than an alternative criterion that chose sites based on patch isolation and size, edge effect, and forest structure. The alternative criterion, although not as efficient as indicator species, may nevertheless be useful and effective for conservation when faunal data are lacking and guidelines for habitat management or restoration are needed. Our method is applicable to other ecosystems and taxa because the processes we considered occur in many ecosystems and may have significant effects on species from all taxonomic groups. © 2006 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Efforts to restore and maintain oak savannas in North America, with emphasis on the use of prescribed fire, have become common. Little is known, however, about how restoration affects animal populations, especially those of birds. I compared the breeding densities, community structure, and reproductive success of birds in oak savannas maintained by prescribed fire (12 sites) with those in closed-canopy forests (13 sites). All sampling was conducted in Illinois (U.S.A.). Of the 31 bird species analyzed, 12 were more common in savannas, 14 were not affected by habitat structure, and 5 were more common in forest habitat. The species favored by disturbance and restoration included Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), Mourning Doves ( Zenaida macroura), Red-headed Woodpeckers ( Melanerpes erythrocephalus), Indigo Buntings ( Passerina cyanea), and Baltimore Orioles (Icterus galbula). Those more common in closed-canopy forest included Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Wood Thrushes ( Hylocichla mustelina). Few species were unique to one type of habitat, but overall avian community structure in oak savannas and closed-canopy forests was generally distinctive. Estimates of nesting success (derived from 785 nests) revealed that 6 of the 13 species considered experienced greater productivity in the savanna habitat. Rates of brood parasitism were unaffected by restoration and habitat structure. Within savannas, tract size had little effect on breeding abundances and reproductive success. My results illustrate that restoration techniques can significantly affect the ecology of constituent animal populations and communities and have key implications regarding avian conservation and the management of forest habitat in fragmented landscapes. Small patches of forest habitat that regularly function as population sinks may offer far better prospects for birds if they are subjected to disturbance and ecosystem restoration. © 2006 Society for Conservation Biology.},

Although low-intensity logging treatments had the least noticeable effects, the composition of understorey birds was still markedly different from the composition in undisturbed forest.

abstract={A considerable number of bird species depend on tree cavities availability for nesting in temperate and tropical forests in Mexico. Tree cavity availability is reduced in heavily managed forests, making cavity nesting species particularly vulnerable to the high rates of forest loss and degradation that occur every day in the remaining wilderness areas of the country. We analyzed information about nesting behavior, distribution, and conservation status of resident landbird avifauna from 35 important and protected bird areas of Mexico. The main intention was to determine the proportion of resident bird species that nest in tree cavities and are more sensitive to intensive forest management practices. Our results revealed that 17% (112 species) of the resident landbird avifauna need tree cavities for nesting. Cavity nesters represented a higher proportion of endangered and threatened species than non-cavity nesters. The families Strigidae and Psittacidae represented the highest number of tree cavity nesting species in status. In the 35 avifaunas examined, the mean percentage of cavity nesting species ranged from 17% to 21%. The cloud forest reserve of "El Triunfo" with 43 species, is the area with the highest concentration of cavity nesting species in Mexico. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={1. Peatlands have suffered great losses following drainage for agriculture, forestry, urbanisation, or peat mining, near inhabited areas. We evaluated the faunal and vegetation patterns after restoration of a peatland formerly mined for peat. We assessed whether bog pools created during restoration are similar to natural bog pools in terms of water chemistry, vegetation structure and composition, as well as amphibian and arthropod occurrence patterns. 2. Both avian species richness and peatland vegetation cover at the site increased following restoration. Within bog pools, however, the vegetation composition differed between natural and man-made pools. The cover of low shrubs, Sphagnum moss, submerged, emergent and floating vegetation in man-made pools was lower than in natural pools, whereas pH was higher than in typical bog pools. Dominant plant species also differed between man-made and natural pools. 3. Amphibian tadpoles, juveniles and adults occurred more often in man-made pools than natural bog pools. Although some arthropods, including Coleoptera bog specialists, readily colonised the pools, their abundance was two to 26 times lower than in natural bog pools. Plant introduction in bog pools, at the stocking densities we applied, had no effect on the occurrence of most groups. 4. We conclude that our restoration efforts were partially successful. Peatland-wide vegetation patterns following restoration mimicked those of natural peatlands, but 4 years were not sufficient for man-made pools to fully emulate the characteristics of natural bog pools. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Many studies have examined differences in avian community composition between urban and rural habitats, but few, if any, have looked at nesting success of urban shrubland birds in a replicated fashion while controlling for habitat. We tested factors affecting nest survival, parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), and species abundance in shrubland habitat in rural and urban landscapes. We found no support for our hypothesis that nest survival was lower in urban landscapes, but strong support for the hypothesis that survival increased with nest height. We found strong support for our hypothesis that cowbird parasitism was greater in urban than rural landscapes; parasitism in urban sites was at least twice that of rural sites. We found strong support for an urban landscape effect on abundance for several species; Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Brown-headed Cowbirds were more abundant in urban landscapes, whereas Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla) and Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora pinus) were more abundant in rural sites. There was support for lower abundances of Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea) and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) with increased housing density. For six other species, edge and trail density or vegetation parameters best explained abundance. Lower abundances and greater parasitism in habitat patches in urban landscapes are evidence that, for some species, these urban landscapes do not fulfill the same role as comparable habitats in rural landscapes. Regional bird conservation planning and local habitat management in urban landscapes may need to consider these effects in efforts to sustain bird populations at regional and local scales. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Little is known about factors that structure biodiversity on landscape scales, yet current land management protocols, such as forest certification programs, place an increasing emphasis on managing for sustainable biodiversity at landscape scales. We used a replicated landscape study to evaluate relationships between forest structure and avian diversity at both stand and landscape-levels. We used data on bird communities collected under comparable sampling protocols on four managed forests located across the Southeastern US to develop logistic regression models describing relationships between habitat factors and the distribution of overall richness and richness of selected guilds. Landscape models generated for eight of nine guilds showed a strong relationship between richness and both availability and configuration of landscape features. Diversity of topographic features and heterogeneity of forest structure were primary determinants of avian species richness. Forest heterogeneity, in both age and forest type, were strongly and positively associated with overall avian richness and richness for most guilds. Road density was associated positively but weakly with avian richness. Landscape variables dominated all models generated, but no consistent patterns in metrics or scale were evident. Model fit was strong for neotropical migrants and relatively weak for short-distance migrants and resident species. Our models provide a tool that will allow managers to evaluate and demonstrate quantitatively how management practices affect avian diversity on landscapes.},

abstract={Undergrowth clearing is a widespread forest management technique used in many Mediterranean regions to reduce dense vegetation in order to prevent fire or to facilitate other forest exploitation activities. Here, we analyze the effects of undergrowth clearing on biodiversity by focusing on the variations in bird diversity in Holm oak forests in Catalonia (north-east Iberian Peninsula) under different forest management regimes: (1) coppice Holm oak forests where the undergrowth layer has been completely cleared, (2) partially cleared forests and (3) cleared and tree thinned forests and finally, (4) undisturbed forests. The synchronic comparison approach was used in conjunction with a before-after control impact (BACI) experiment in which the effects of undergrowth clearing were explicitly measured. Complete undergrowth clearing resulted in the almost complete disappearance of three Warbler species (Subalpine Warbler, Sardinian Warbler and Garden Warbler). Partial clearing also led to a marked reduction in the numbers of these three species, but the presence of Sardinian and Garden Warblers was maintained in the treated forests. Complete undergrowth clearing accompanied by tree thinning also led to a decrease in amount of undergrowth species and involved additional negative effects for species such as Wren, Robin, Blackbird and Blackcap. Only one species, the Nightjar, appeared to benefit from undergrowth clearing, while many others increased their numbers only when clearing was applied together with tree thinning: Turtle dove, Mistle thrush and Cirl bunting. Undergrowth clearing brought about a significant simplification in the vertical structure of the forest, which probably reduced foraging opportunities and breeding resources for most undergrowth species. These effects became more pronounced when tree thinning was applied together with undergrowth clearing. To reconcile forest management and bird diversity, undergrowth clearing should be applied selectively to ensure that a certain number of undergrowth patches, preferably corresponding to different shrub species, are not affected by management treatments. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Sudden oak death (SOD), a disease induced by the fungus-like pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, threatens to seriously reduce or eliminate several oak species endemic to the west coast of North America. We investigated how the disappearance of one of these species, coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), may affect populations of five resident oak-affiliated California birds - acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus), Nuttall's woodpecker (Picoides nuttallii), Hutton's vireo (Vireo huttoni), western scrub-jay (Aphelocoma californica), and oak titmouse (Baeolophus inornatus) - using geocoded data from Audubon Christmas Bird Counts, North American Breeding Bird Surveys, and the California Gap Analysis. Capitalizing on observed relationships between the focal bird species and both oak species diversity and areal extent, we modeled relative bird abundance while assuming complete loss of Q. agrifolia and complete, partial, or no loss of oak habitat following a disease sweep. Post-SOD projections of bird populations occurring within the range of coast live oak were on average 25-68% smaller and 13-49% more variable relative to pre-SOD estimates. SOD effects were greatest for habitats with low initial oak species diversity. Climatic SOD models predicted that the disease stands to negatively impact populations of all five focal bird species throughout 20% of California's coast live oak habitats. This study provides the first spatially explicit insights into the potential effects of SOD on avian distribution and abundance. Results may be used to help prioritize conservation plans aimed at minimizing overall community level disturbances resulting from the disease. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The sensitivity of seminatural grasslands to ozone (O3) pollution is not well known, in spite of the important function of these common ecosystems for agriculture and nature conservation. A 5-year field experiment was carried out at a rural, mid-elevation site at Le Mouret (Switzerland) to investigate the effect of elevated O3 on yield and species composition of a permanent, extensively managed, species-rich old pasture. Using a free-air fumigation system, circular plots of 7m diameter were exposed to either ambient air (control plots) or to air containing O3 of approximately 1.5 × ambient concentrations. The resulting accumulated O3 exposure over the threshold of 40 ppb for one season ranged from 13.3 to 59.5 ppm h in the elevated O3 plots, and from 1.0 to 20.7 ppm h in the control plots. Subplots in each ring were harvested three times each year, and harvested biomass was separated into functional groups (FGs) (grasses, legumes, forbs). Productivity in both treatments decreased over time, but the yield of O3-exposed plots decreased faster than that of the control plots, with the reduction being twice as large by the end of the fifth season. Compared with the ambient air control, loss in annual dry matter yield was 23% after 5 years. The change in annual biomass production because of O3 stress was accompanied by a change in the fractions of FGs, with the legume fraction showing a strong negative response. Such long-term effects of O3 stress could have negative implications for the maintenance of biological diversity in rural landscapes across large areas of Europe. The results from this first long-term experiment show that a moderately elevated O3 level reduces the productivity of intact grasslands during a 5-year exposure under real field conditions. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={We determined the effects of fire history and a riparian-upland gradient on the breeding bird community at Fort Bragg Military Installation in North Carolina, one of the largest remnant areas of the endangered longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. Study sites were classified into two treatments: fire-intense (areas experiencing growing-season burns) and fire-suppressed (areas lacking fires). Within each treatment, bird and vegetation data were recorded at point-count stations positioned at three distances from streamhead pocosins to characterize the riparian-upland habitat gradient: 0, 75, and ≥150 m. Total bird abundance and species richness varied significantly along the riparian-upland gradient, with pocosins contributing greatly to avian biodiversity. Our data revealed strong effects of fire history and riparian-upland gradient on bird species, which we described in terms of breeding-bird assemblages. Members of the open longleaf assemblage (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker [Picoides borealis], Bachman's Sparrow [Aimophila aestivalis]) were most common in fire-intense areas and at upland locations. Members of the fire-suppressed assemblage (e.g., Wood Thrush [Hylocichla mustelina], Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapilla]) were confined to pocosins in fire-intense areas, but became more abundant in fire-suppressed areas. Members of the pocosin assemblage (e.g., Eastern Towhee [Pipilo erythropthalamus], Common Yellowthroat [Geothlypis trichas]) were largely confined to pocosins and, in some cases, were most abundant in fire-intense pocosins. Fire suppression increased structural diversity of vegetation and promoted one breeding-bird assemblage (fire-suppressed), but at the expense of two others (open longleaf, pocosin). Continued management of Fort Bragg to promote longleaf pine restoration is essential for supporting conservation of the open-longleaf bird assemblage; in addition, it will benefit the pocosin assemblage. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2006.},

abstract={We used plot-level manipulations and analyses to test the effects of food availability on the behavior and condition of resident dry-forest birds in Jamaica. Two control plots were monitored in each of 2 yr. Food was supplemented on five plots over 2 yr with piles of cut oranges distributed around plots, which served as a direct source of carbohydrates and water, and an indirect source of ground arthropods due to increased above-ground activity. We reduced ants on five plots over 2 yr; however, we found no difference in total ground arthropod biomass between control and reduction treatments, so we pooled these plots for analysis. We selected nine focal resident bird species for study of relative abundance, body condition, and breeding condition. Birds were sampled prior to, and 5 to 6 weeks after the initiation of treatments. Seven of nine species had higher relative abundance following food supplementation. Three species were recaptured more frequently in supplementation plots than in control plots. These abundance and persistence responses did not cause any changes in body condition. In one species, Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), food supplementation resulted in higher concentrations of individuals in breeding condition. These results demonstrate a functional response to dry-season food availability and suggest a limiting mechanism. This study helps explain mechanisms by which bird populations respond to resource availability, and is the first successful plot-level food supplementation experiment for tropical forest birds. © 2005 The Author(s).},

abstract={A comprehensive understanding of variables associated with spatial differences in community composition is essential to explain and predict biodiversity over landscape scales. In this study, spatial patterns of bird diversity in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, were examined and associated with local-scale (habitat structure and heterogeneity) and landscape-scale (logging, slope position and elevation) environmental variables. Within the study area (c. 196 km2) local habitat structure and heterogeneity varied considerably, largely due to logging. In total 9747 individuals of 177 bird species were recorded. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) revealed that the best explanatory models of bird community similarity and species richness included both local- and landscape-scale environmental variables. Important local-scale variables included liana abundance, fern cover, sapling density, tree density, dead wood abundance and tree architecture, while important landscape-scale variables were elevation, logging and slope position. Geographic distance between sampling sites was not significantly associated with spatial variation in either species richness or similarity. These results indicate that deterministic environmental processes, as opposed to dispersal-driven stochastic processes, primarily structure bird assemblages within the spatial scale of this study and confirm that highly variable local habitat measures can be effective means of predicting landscape-scale community patterns. © Springer 2005.},

abstract={The southeastern United States population of the painted bunting (Passerina ciris) has decreased approximately 75% from 1966-1996 based on Breeding Bird Survey trends. Partners in Flight guidelines recommend painted bunting conservation as a high priority with a need for management by state and federal agencies. Basic information on home range and survival of breeding painted buntings will provide managers with required habitat types and estimates of land areas necessary to maintain minimum population sizes for this species. We radiotracked after-second-year male and after-hatching-year female buntings on Sapelo Island, Georgia, during the breeding seasons (late April-early August) of 1997 and 1998. We used the animal movement extension in ArcView to determine fixed-kernel home range in an unmanaged maritime shrub and managed 60-80-year-old pine (Pinus spp.)-oak (Quercus spp.) forest. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we estimated an adult breeding season survival of 1.00 for males (n = 36) and 0.94 (SE = 0.18) for females (n = 27). Painted bunting home ranges were smaller in unmanaged maritime shrub (female: kernel x = 3.5 ha [95% CI: 2.5-4.5]; male: kernel x = 3.1 ha [95% CI: 2.3-3.9]) compared to those in managed pine-oak forests (female: kernel x = 4.7 ha [95% CI: 2.8-6.6]; male: kernel x = 7.0 ha [95% CI: 4.9-9.1]). Buntings nesting in the managed pine-oak forest flew long distances (≥300 m) to forage in salt marshes, freshwater wetlands, and moist forest clearings. In maritime shrub buntings occupied a compact area and rarely moved long distances. The painted bunting population of Sapelo Island requires conservation of maritime shrub as potential optimum nesting habitat and management of nesting habitat in open-canopy pine-oak sawtimber forests by periodic prescribed fire (every 4-6 years) and timber thinning within a landscape that contains salt marsh or freshwater wetland openings within 700 m of those forests.},

abstract={Economic research on biodiversity conservation has focused on the costs of conservation reserves and the benefits of intact ecosystems; however, no study has simultaneously considered the costs and benefits of species diversity, a fundamental component of biodiversity. We quantified the costs and benefits of avian biodiversity at a rainforest reserve in Uganda through a combination of economic surveys of tourists, spatial land-use analyses, and species-area relationships. Our results show that revising entrance fees and redistributing ecotourism revenues would protect 114 of 143 forest bird species (80%) under current market conditions. This total would increase to 131 species (≈90%) if entrance fees were optimized to capture the tourist's willingness to pay for forest visits and the chance of seeing increased numbers of bird species. In contrast, the cost of purchasing agricultural land for ecological rehabilitation of the avian habitat would be economically prohibitive. These results suggest that local biodiversity markets could play a positive role in tropical conservation strategies if the appropriate institutions for redistribution can be developed. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract={Landscape configuration and dispersal characteristics are major determinants of population distribution and persistence in fragmented habitat. An individual-based spatially explicit population model was developed to investigate these factors using the distribution of nuthatches in an area of eastern England as an example. The effects of immigration and increasing the area of breeding quality habitat were explored. Predictions were compared with observed population sizes in the study area. Our model combined a nuthatch population simulator based on individual behaviour with a grid-based representation of the landscape; nuthatch life cycle and immigration parameters were user selectable. A novel aspect of the model is user-selection of habitat perceptual range. Using a realistic set of parameters, the number of breeding pairs predicted by the model matched observed numbers. According to model simulations, the main cause of nuthatch scarcity in the study area was the inability of patches to support viable populations without immigration from elsewhere. Modelled habitat management, which increased breeding quality habitat in existing woods, lowered the threshold above which the study area population became self-sustaining. The existence of a large core habitat area was critical in producing a self-sustaining population in this landscape, the same area in dispersed small woods failed to sustain populations. © Springer 2005.},

abstract={Snags are important components of wildlife habitat, providing nesting and feeding sites for over 75 species of animals in the southwestern United States. Wildfires can increase or decrease the availability of snags to wildlife by killing live trees or incinerating snags. Our objectives were to describe dynamics and spatial patterns of fire-killed snags in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona and predict the probability of snag use by cavity nesters. We established six 1-ha plots following two recent fires that occurred in northern Arizona (Hochderffer fire of 1996 [H96] and Pumpkin fire of 2000 [P00]) to determine ponderosa pine snag availability and use by wildlife as evidenced by presence of excavated cavities. For comparison, six paired 1-ha plots in nearby unburned areas were sampled with burned plots. For the twelve 1 ha plots, field methods included mapping and measuring 15 characteristics for 668 snags (630 in burned and 38 in unburned plots) 4 years post-fire on the H96 fire, and 1010 snags (996 in burned and 14 in unburned plots) 1 year post-fire on the P00 fire. We remeasured characteristics of all snags in 2003. Most burned snags were standing 3 years after fire, but 7 years after fire, 41% had fallen. Snags in burned plots were clumped when initially measured and remeasured. After 7 years, snags in burned plots that were still standing were straight, large diameter trees in denser clumps. Density of excavated cavities was similar between burned (3.0 ha-1) and unburned (2.2 ha-1) plots, even though burned areas produced much higher densities of snags. Snags (both burned and unburned) that were most likely to contain excavated cavities were large diameter with broken tops. This evidence of cavity nester use indicates that in ponderosa pine forests in the southwest, retaining large diameter snags is important to cavity nesters regardless of snag origin. If salvage logging is to occur in severely burned ponderosa pine in the southwest, retaining straight, large diameter snags in clumps will help maintain snags for cavity-excavating species. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Breeding birds (songbirds, shorebirds, and ptarmigan) were surveyed at the Ekati Diamond Mine in Canada's Northwest Territories from 1996 through 2003. Surveys were conducted on permanent, 25 ha mine and control plots. Five metrics (relative density of individual species, relative density of all birds, species richness using rarefaction curves, and species diversity using two indices) were used to assess potential impacts up to a distance of 1 km from the mine. Six species were more common on mine plots, and three were more common on control plots. Species diversity was slightly higher on mine plots when measured with Fisher's alpha index. No other metrics suggested strong impacts. This study suggests that the mine has had a relatively limited impact on the upland breeding bird community within 1 km of the footprint but has provided habitat for at least one synanthropic bird species. Further monitoring of breeding birds on the tundra should include pre-development control data and demographic variables such as reproductive success and survival. © The Arctic Institute of North America.},

abstract={Prescribed burning is often used in wetlands to remove plant litter, decrease woody or invasive species, and increase use by wetland birds. However, little is known about the within-season, short-term response of wetland birds to prescribed burning, especially during spring migration. We surveyed use of 19 burned and 19 unburned (reference) wetlands by migratory birds in the Rainwater Basin region of Nebraska, USA during three spring migrations, 2002-2004. We calculated the change in avian abundance and species richness, as well as generating the Sørenson's similarity index for burned and reference wetlands in the weeks immediately before and after burning. We compared Sørenson's index values and percent change in abundance and species richness between burned and reference wetlands using an analysis of covariance with week and wetland area as covariates to account for migration chronology and differences in the area of experimental units. Following removal of effects due to wetland area and week, burning had no effect on the percent change in avian abundance and species richness. Sørenson's index also did not differ between burned and reference wetlands. Prescribed burning did not improve use of wetlands by migratory birds in the short term. Understanding the immediate and long-term effects of prescribed burning on migratory avian abundance, species richness, and community composition is imperative for management decisions. © 2005, The Society of Wetland Scientists.},

Observations of birds from the interior region add to our knowledge of the distribution and richness of Suriname's avifauna. The Sipaliwini savanna harbors a number of bird species that are not found elsewhere in the Guianas. The savanna itself has a low human population density and is relatively unaffected by the large-scale cattle grazing and frequent fires that have degraded other savanna regions throughout the Neotropics. The Sipaliwini appears to contain healthy populations of several species that require late-successional. post-fire habitats or are otherwise sensitive to human activity, including the Sun Parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis) and Rufous-sided Pygmy-Tyrant (Euscarthmus rufomarginatus).

abstract={Nineteen areas in seven of the nine Azorean islands were evaluated for species diversity and rarity based on soil epigean arthropods. Fifteen out of the 19 study areas are managed as Natural Forest Reserves and the remaining four were included due to their importance as indigenous forest cover. Four of the 19 areas are not included in the European Conservation network, NATURA 2000. Two sampling replicates were run per study area, and a total of 191 species were collected; 43 of those species (23%) are endemic to the archipelago and 12 have yet to be described. To produce an unbiased multiple-criteria index (importance value for conservation, IV-C) incorporating diversity and rarity based indices, an iterative partial multiple regression analysis was performed. In addition, an irreplaceability index and the complementarity method (using both optimisation and heuristic methods) were used for priority-reserves analyses. It was concluded that at least one well-managed reserve per island is absolutely necessary to have a good fraction of the endemic arthropods preserved. We found that for presence/absence data the suboptimal complementarity algorithm provides solutions as good as the optimal algorithm. For abundance data, optimal solutions indicate that most reserves are needed if we want that at least 50% of endemic arthropod populations are represented in a minimum set of reserves. Consistently, two of the four areas not included in the NATURA 2000 framework were considered of high priority, indicating that vascular plants and bird species used to determine NATURA 2000 sites are not good surrogates of arthropod diversity in the Azores. The most irreplaceable reserves are those located in older islands, which indicates that geological history plays an important role in explaining faunal diversity of arthropods in the Azores. Based both on the uniqueness of species composition and high species richness, conservation efforts should be focused on the unmanaged Pico Alto region in the archipelago's oldest island, Santa Maria. © Springer 2005.},

abstract={• Background: There is a compelling need to protect natural plant communities and restore them in degraded landscapes. Activities must be guided by sound scientific principles, practical conservation tools, and clear priorities. With perhaps one-third of the world's flora facing extinction, scientists and conservation managers will need to work rapidly and collaboratively, recognizing each other's strengths and limitations. As a guide to assist managers in maintaining plant diversity, six pragmatic models are introduced that are already available. Although theoretical models continue to receive far more space and headlines in scientific journals, more managers need to understand that pragmatic, rather than theoretical, models have the most promise for yielding results that can be applied immediately to plant communities. • Six Pragmatic Models: For each model, key citations and an array of examples are provided, with particular emphasis on wetlands, since 'wet and wild' was my assigned theme for the Botanical Society of America in 2003. My own work may seem rather prominent, but the application and refinement of these models has been a theme for me and my many students over decades. The following models are reviewed: (1) species-area: larger areas usually contain more species; (2) species-biomass: plant diversity is maximized at intermediate levels of biomass; (3) centrifugal organization: multiple intersecting environmental gradients maintain regional landscape biodiversity; (4) species-frequency: a few species are frequent while most are infrequent; (5) competitive hierarchies: in the absence of constraints, large canopy-forming species dominate patches of landscape, reducing biological diversity; and (6) intermediate disturbance: perturbations such as water level fluctuations, fire and grazing are essential for maintaining plant diversity. • Conclusions: The good news is that managers faced with protecting or restoring landscapes already have this arsenal of tools at their disposal. The bad news is that far too few of these models are appreciated. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Evergreen broad-leaved forest (EBLF) is now recognized as an important natural resource that contributes to both the biodiversity and the sustainable development of the subtropical regions of China. However, the extent of the EBLF has decreased very significantly due to long-term anthropogenic disturbance including deforestation, logging and fire, and much of it is now degraded to plantation, secondary forests and shrub and grassland communities. Therefore, close attention needs to be focused on the characteristics of these degraded communities with a view to the possibilities for restoration of EBLF. Following comprehensive investigation of typical degraded EBLF in the Tiantong and Dongqian lake region of eastern China, the community types and their characteristic species composition were defined at the regional scale. The results raise several issues about degraded EBLF vegetation and its potential for restoration, which require further detailed research in order to facilitate the development of EBLF ecosystem restoration in China. These issues are (1) Given the importance of anthropogenic disturbance and land use change in determining the composition of the degraded communities, more emphasis should be placed on the relationships between them, and this should become a major focus for future research; (2) The degraded communities of EBLF contain a comparatively high plant species richness and are also characterized by a specific species composition, which make a significant contribution to the maintenance of both regional and local biodiversity; (3) The importance of sprouting of both trees and shrubs as a mechanism for species persistence and regrowth has not been given sufficient recognition. Sprouting allows species to persist in a site even after a wide range of disturbances over hundreds of years. Sprouting ability therefore can have major impacts on species turnover, changes in community structure and species composition, maintenance of biological diversity and is vital to understanding of the vegetation dynamics of EBLF; (4) Seed dispersal pattern has long been considered an important influence on the regeneration of vegetation, and it should strongly influence the distribution of tree recruits in the degraded communities. Nonetheless, seed dispersal patterns for such species are poorly known, and processes controlling the fate of seeds in the degraded community of EBLF have been little studied. Attention to these research areas is essential to the future conservation and restoration of EBLF in China.},

abstract={Aims: To evaluate the occurrence of open-habitat and steppe-land bird species in Western Mediterranean burned areas and to assess the role of the extent and location of the fire on species richness and composition. At the species level, the relationship was explored between habitat breadth, distribution extent and the ability to occupy recently burned areas. Location: Iberia and Southern France Methods: Fieldwork and bibliography were assembled to obtain breeding bird inventories for 21 burned areas, mostly large wildfires (135- 23,800 ha). The sampling effort was standardized in relation to the area in the 11 fire locations surveyed using transects. Results: Single burned areas contained 0 to 15 open-habitat species (mean = 7.6), and in all the areas combined there were 22 species, including 17 with an unfavourable conservation status in Europe. The most frequent were Carduelis cannabina, Lullula arborea, Alectoris rufa, Oenanthe hispanica and Emberiza cia, but characteristic steppe-land birds such as O. leucura, Calandrella brachydactyla and C. rufescens also bred in particular burned areas. After controlling for the extent of the species range in the Spanish distribution Atlas, passerine occurrence in burned areas was positively related to the species' habitat breadth in a gradient of unburned habitats. Cluster analysis separated a species-poor group of fire locations from a species-rich group, and showed that some neighbouring areas had a similar species composition. However, there was no spatial autocorrelation between burned areas, and species composition was correlated with the fire extent (Mantel test). Species richness tended to increase with increasing fire area. From the regression equation 5, 9, 12-13 and 16-17 open-habitat species may be expected to occur in burned areas of 100, 1000, 10,000 and 100,000 ha, respectively. Conclusions: This study stresses the importance of biogeographical constraints on colonisation of new habitat patches created by disturbances. The extent of the fire rather than the proximity between burned areas influenced species richness and composition of open-habitat birds in recently burned areas. The best post-fire colonisers were generalists regarding habitat structure. The role of large wildfires in the conservation of threatened open-habitat birds seems to be significant and merits further study.},

abstract={1. Despite covering a relatively small area on a global scale, estuarine tidal flats are vital to many aquatic bird species during much of the yearly cycle. Small-scale features of tidal flats, such as water drainage channels, can influence the carrying capacity of estuarine wetlands, yet their ecological impact is poorly understood. In this study we evaluated the influence of drainage channels on the quality of feeding habitat for waders in the Tagus estuary, Portugal. 2. We measured the abundance of seven wader species at five distance classes from drainage channels, and analysed the variation in peck rates, step rates, turning rates and success rates. In addition we measured the density of macroinvertebrate prey and the sediment physical-chemical characteristics at different distances from the channels. 3. All wader species occurred at higher densities near the channels. In the study area 44% of the birds fed on just 12% of the available surface, less than 5 m away from drainage channels. Wader foraging behaviour also suggests a greater feeding effort near the channels. 4. While the characteristics of the sediments did not change significantly with distance from channels, prey abundance corresponded closely with wader abundance, suggesting that the small scale distribution of birds on the tidal flats may be related to the presence of their prey. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the areas around drainage channels are particularly important feeding sites for waders foraging on tidal flats, Consequently, managers of estuarine wetlands should strive to preserve or improve channel networks. This can be achieved by (i) preserving saltmarshes and saltpans adjacent to tidal flats, (ii) minimizing the reclamation of upshore flats and (iii) avoiding embankments and canalizations of inland water flows that reduce the number of water entry points onto tidal flats. © 2005 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Bird species composition (61 species) of Afromontane forest fragments (n = 19) embedded in a natural grassland matrix or a plantation forestry matrix were compared. Forest bird assemblages in a natural grassland matrix displayed a nested non-random species distribution. Species loss was significantly area-dependent and predictable. Assemblages in the plantation-dominated matrix were also nested but were neither area- nor isolation-dependent and these potential processes had equal influence over bird species composition. Forests patches <50 ha in plantation were more species rich than those in a grassland matrix and visa versa for patches >50 ha. The effect of the matrix is revealed here with arboreal plantation cover promoting dispersal across the landscape, favouring abundant generalist bird species in smaller patches than expected in the plantation matrix, and the loss of some specialists and species living at low densities from large (>50 ha) patches. Because of a significant species-area relationship and possible area-dependent extinction, the largest forest patch in the nested series in a grassland matrix protects most bird species (89%). However, in a plantation matrix the absence of a species-area relationship requires the combination of many larger forest patches to protect most bird species. Plantation forests in the matrix significantly alter forest bird assemblage structure and composition. To avoid the effects of insularisation and to maintain the viability of bird communities in Afromontane forests requires conservation of the larger forests in a natural matrix. However, for forests in a plantation matrix, the management of dispersal processes by manipulation of the matrix may be as important to conserving species and communities as is minimising extinctions. Avoiding placing plantations near large forests, increasing the size of small patches, and where afforestation is unavoidable, placing plantations in the vicinity of small rather than large forest patches, are preferable management practices. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Aim: Two main mechanisms may explain post-disturbance species colonization patterns of early successional habitats such as those originated by wildfires. First, post-disturbance colonization is not limited by the dispersal ability of the species to reach the newly created open areas and, secondly, colonization is limited by dispersal. Under the first hypothesis, we expect, at a regional scale, to find similar post-disturbance communities to develop on recently burned sites. However, colonization limited by dispersal will lead to strong between-site variations in species composition. Location: To test these hypotheses, we studied the post-fire colonization patterns of nine open-habitat bird species in eight distantly located wildfires in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula. Methods: We censused post-fire bird composition by means of field transects and identified potential colonization sources from species-habitat suitability maps derived from atlas data. Results: Our results showed strong significant differences in post-fire species composition between burnt areas. Burnt areas located in areas with low probability of species presence before the fire event showed lower species occurrence and richness after the fire. Main conclusions: These results do not support the idea that early successional stages and open habitats have a homogeneous community structure at regional scales and suggest that dispersal is a key constraint determining bird colonization of post-fire habitats. Further attention should be paid to landscape heterogeneity as a key factor in determining population dynamics of open-habitat species in the light of current and future land-use changes in Mediterranean regions. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={We studied the influence of vegetation structure and tree phenology on bird communities along a gradient of tropical forest degradation in NW Madagascar. Birds were censused by point counts at Ankarafantsika, one of the largest remnants of the severely reduced dry deciduous forest. The original forest was dominated by foliage insectivores. A few years after wildfire, regrowth was dense, most forest bird species were still present and additional understorey species appeared. As a result, species richness and abundance per point count increased. In contrast, when forest was transformed into savanna, the avian assemblage became poor, dominated by granivores and aerial insectivores, with only seven species shared with the original forest. Foliage volume, grass volume and bare ground cover explained most of the bird community variation by means of canonical correspondence analysis. Birds tended to increase their habitat breadth along the forest-savanna gradient. An index of bird conservation value, including abundance, endemism and the threatened status of the species, was highest in burned forests (1.12), intermediate in unburned forests (1) and lowest in savanna (0.44). The results emphasise the urgent need to protect not only the undisturbed fragments, but also the burned dry forests, because of their high value for biodiversity. © 2005 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={As a result of some 500 years of protection, parts of the Białowieża Forest, in Poland, remain in a near-primeval condition. Studies of the breeding birds in the core part of the forest (Białowieża National Park) over 29 years show that the bird community is species-rich but that densities of individual species are usually low, resulting in only moderate overall densities. In some species, low densities are a consequence of large territories and social exclusion, but more often they reflect the undersaturation of habitats by birds, despite superabundant food supply and nest-sites. Low productivity, resulting from high nest predation, may contribute to undersaturation. Species composition and numbers of birds fluctuate within relatively narrow limits, with the populations of closely related species fluctuating either independently of one another or in parallel; interspecific competition for resources plays a minor role. Some attributes of the Białowieża ecosystems resemble conditions in undisturbed tropical forests but contrast sharply with those in fragmented, temperate secondary forests. The present Białowieża avifauna provides a glimpse of that existing in central European forests before their historical transformation by humans. Its present exceptional character arises from preservation of most of its pristine features. The forest constitutes a critical reference point for studies of woodland ecology, and its preservation should be a high priority. Unfortunately, commercial logging continues, gradually changing the forest's structure and affecting the birds, especially those dependent on dead wood and old-growth. The relatively small national park (47.5 km2) is increasingly becoming an 'island', in which the long-term preservation of primeval forest features will be impossible. © British Birds 98.},

abstract={Most insights about the effects of residential development on wildlife are based on research from urban and suburban areas. Yet exurban development is an increasingly prevalent form of human settlement in many parts of the world. Moreover because such development often occurs near the periphery of protected areas, it may have a disproportionate influence on native species. We examined bird community patterns in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado across a gradient of exurban development to determine how avifauna responded to this form of settlement. Using fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed the occurrence and abundance of breeding birds in 11 developed sites and in 6 nearby undeveloped sites, all occurring in a forested matrix. We sampled ground-level habitat features at each survey point and derived digital land-cover maps from aerial photographs to characterize and quantify road development and building density. We found little evidence that land-cover varied with development intensity, yet bird abundance increased significantly with building density. Patterns of species richness were equivocal due to a highly influential observation. Principal components analysis (PCA) distinguished two axes that explained nearly 50% of the variation in the bird community and were strongly associated with road and building density. Weighted average analysis showed a marked decline in the abundance and richness of species that were insectivorous or nested in snags, suggesting that reductions in dead wood may have influenced the bird community. However, no conclusions could be drawn because dead wood was confounded with building density. Logistic regression of species occurrence and building density indicated that the incidence of some generalist species increased with building density, whereas the incidence of specialists decreased. Overall, our results suggest that development at low densities can favor habitat generalists. Similar patterns have been observed in more urbanized areas. If exurban development persists as a popular form of settlement in the Rocky Mountains, a regional plan for protecting avian habitat and limiting development dispersion will be necessary to maintain native bird communities. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Prescribed, biennial burning in forest understory started in Cuivre River State Park, Missouri, USA, in the late 1980s to help restore the forest to conditions that existed prior to European settlement. Bird surveys were started in 1996 on two burned and two unburned sections of the park to determine what effects the burning and subsequent changes in vegetation were having on bird populations. Birds were sampled at 17 60-m radius point counts on each study area; each point was sampled twice per year during the main breeding period from 1996 through 2002. Total abundance and species richness differed among the four areas but no differences could be attributed to burning. Some individual species, however, differed in abundance and frequency of occurrence between burned and unburned areas. For example, Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), and several species of woodpeckers were more abundant on burned areas; Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorous), Wood Thrush (Hylocicla mustelina) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) were among the species more abundant on unburned areas. As a consequence, overall community composition differed significantly between burned and unburned areas of the park, but did not differ between burned areas or between unburned areas. Prescribed burning was instituted to restore vegetation to presettlement conditions and has started to achieve that objective. Restoration also has affected and likely will continue to affect bird populations. Future maintenance of a full complement of bird species, including a number of neotropical migrants, will be dependent on presence of both burned and unburned forest habitat. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={1. Coffee is produced in tropical regions of the world, largely in Latin America. Coffee cultivation techniques range from traditional systems, where coffee grows under a diverse canopy of shade trees (shade-coffee plantations), to modern systems, where coffee grows without any type of shade (sun-coffee plantations). Shade-coffee plantations provide refuge for forest fauna in otherwise deforested landscapes. The conservation value of these agro-ecosystems depends upon their structural and floristic diversity. 2. The way coffee producers manage the vegetation, including the epiphytic component, may profoundly affect the value of plantations for conserving biological diversity. Shade-coffee certification programmes have emerged to verify that coffee advertised as 'shade grown' is actually grown on highly biodiverse plantations. Although these programmes universally encourage epiphyte protection from pruning (a common practice), there has been no experimental evaluation of the importance of epiphytes in supporting faunal diversity. We report the effect of experimentally removing epiphytes on the bird assemblage in a shade-coffee farm near Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico. 3. We established two matching pairs of epiphyte removal and control plots. We compared bird diversity and abundance, based on daily censuses during the breeding and non-breeding season. We used existing information on the way in which birds use epiphytes as foraging and nesting substrates to explain the presence of different species in plots with epiphytes. 4. Plots without epiphytes tended to be less diverse than plots with epiphytes, but rarefaction analysis and ANOVA showed no significant differences in species richness between treatments in any of the seasons. Mean bird abundance was significantly higher in plots with epiphytes during both seasons, and a multidimensional scaling analysis showed that bird community structure differed between the two treatments. 5. Eighteen forest bird species were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. Three non-forest species were more common in plots without epiphytes. Resident bird species that used epiphytes as a nesting substrate were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. 6. When epiphytes are removed, canopy cover, foraging substrates, nest sites and nest materials are eliminated and microclimatic conditions change. This could increase predation on adult birds and nests, increase intra- and interspecific competition, and decrease individual survivorship. 7. Synthesis and applications. This is the first experimental assessment of the importance of epiphytes for birds. Shade-coffee plantations with epiphytes maintain higher abundance and diversity of the inhabitant bird fauna than plantations without epiphytes. This study reinforces the value of positive epiphyte management as an important factor in shade-grown coffee certification, where the goal is to promote biodiversity conservation. © 2005 British Ecological Society.},

Mist-net captures and visual counts were used to assess species richness and bird abundance pre- and post-fire in an approximately 20 ha area. Visual counts along transects were used to survey birds in an approximately 2000 ha area in a nearby area. Results using the same method of ordination analysis (multidimensional scaling) showed significant effects of fire in the 20 ha and 2000 ha areas and strongly suggest direct effects on bird community composition. However, the effects were different at different spatial scales and/or in different years, indicating that the effects of fire vary spatially and/or temporally. Bird community composition pre-fire was significantly different from that found post-fire. Using multiple regression analysis it was found that the numbers of burned and unburned trees were not significantly related to either bird species richness or bird abundance. Two months after the fire, neither bird species richness nor bird abundance was significantly related to the number of flowering trees (Lafoensia pacari) or fruiting trees (Byrsonima crassifolia). Since fire is an annual event in Alter-do-Chão and is becoming frequent in the entire Amazon, bird community composition in affected areas could be constantly changing in time and space.},

abstract={Fire can cause profound changes in the composition and abundance of plant and animal species, but logistics, unpredictability of weather, and inherent danger make it nearly impossible to study high-severity fire effects experimentally. We took advantage of a unique opportunity to use a before-after/control-impact (BACI) approach to analyze changes in bird assemblages after the severe fires of 2000 in the Bitterroot Valley, Montana. Observers surveyed birds using 10-minute point counts and collected vegetation data from 13 burned and 13 unburned transects for five years before fire and three years after fire. We compared changes in vegetation variables and relative bird abundance from before to after fire between the set of points that burned and the set of points that did not burn. The magnitude of change in vegetation variables from before to after fire increased with fire severity. The relative abundances of nine bird species showed significantly greater changes from before to after fire at burned points compared with unburned points. Moreover, when burned points were separated by whether they burned at low, moderate, or high severity, an additional 10 species showed significant changes in relative abundance from before to after fire at one or more severities. Overall, almost twice as many bird species increased as decreased significantly in response to fire. We also found changes in abundance between one year after and two years after fire for most species that responded to fire. Thus, species that have been termed "mixed responders" in the literature appear to be responding differently to different fire severities or different time periods since fire, rather than responding variably to the same fire conditions. These findings underscore the importance of fire severity and time since fire and imply that both factors must be considered to understand the complexities of fire effects on biological communities. Because different bird species responded positively to different fire severities, our results suggest a need to manage public lands for the maintenance of all kinds of fires, not just the low-severity, understory burns that dominate most discussions revolving around the use of fire in forest restoration. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

This study describes a number of structural and compositional parameters in Vaccinium vitis-idaea pine forest over a wide range of stand age and management intensity values. A robust index was developed to describe management intensity: area-weighted sum of anthropogenic activities, based on the forest management database. After the removal of forest age effect, forest management intensity had a negative influence on spruce abundance, number of diameter classes, basal area and number of decay classes of dead wood. Stepwise logistic regression analysis produced the optimal set of indicators for the evaluation of dry boreal forest naturalness: basal area of lying dead wood, structural variation of the tree layer, herb-layer species composition and presence/absence of woodpeckers. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The structure of vegetation in grassland systems, unlike that in forest systems, varies dramatically among years on the same sites, and among regions with similar vegetation. The role of this variation in vegetation structure on bird density and nesting success of grassland birds is poorly understood, primarily because few studies have included sufficiently large temporal and spatial scales to capture the variation in vegetation structure, bird density, or nesting success. To date, no large-scale study on grassland birds has been conducted to investigate whether grassland bird density and nesting success respond similarly to changes in vegetation structure. However, reliable management recommendations require investigations into the distribution and nesting success of grassland birds over larger temporal and spatial scales. In addition, studies need to examine whether bird density and nesting success respond similarly to changing environmental conditions. We investigated the effect of vegetation structure on the density and nesting success of 3 grassland-nesting birds: clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) in 3 regions of the northern tallgrass prairie in 1998-2001. Few vegetation features influenced the densities of our study species, and each species responded differently to those vegetation variables. We could identify only 1 variable that clearly influenced nesting success of 1 species: clay-colored sparrow nesting success increased with increasing percentage of nest cover from the surrounding vegetation. Because responses of avian density and nesting success to vegetation measures varied among regions, years, and species, land managers at all times need to provide grasslands with different types of vegetation structure. Management guidelines developed from small-scale, short-term studies may lead to misrepresentations of the needs of grassland-nesting birds.},

abstract={The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under its Continuous Enrollment Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has actively promoted establishment of conservation buffers. Although these programs are intended to benefit wildlife in addition to protecting soil and water resources, benefits to grassland birds may be compromised by narrow widths, presence of woody vegetation, and high predation pressure. During 2001 and 2002, we surveyed breeding grassland birds and searched for nests in 33 CRP filter strips that varied in planting mixture (cool-season vs. warm-season grasses) and adjacent edge type (non-wooded vs. wooded). The most abundant species in filter strips were red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), dickcissel (Spiza americana), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), and common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas). Relative abundances of birds and nests were similar between cool-season and warm-season planting mixtures. Dickcissels and red-winged blackbirds and their nests were relatively less abundant at wooded than non-wooded sites. Our nest success estimates generally were low in all treatments, and nest success varied little with the variables we studied. Predation was the major cause of nest failure; 62% of all nests were depredated. Although the most common birds using filter strips are generalists, filter strips also have potential to provide breeding habitat for some species of management concern.},

abstract={Pine plantations are an alternative to marginal agriculture in many countries, and are often presented as an option that improves biodiversity. However, these plantations can have adverse environmental effects if improperly managed. To evaluate the effect of forest management practices on biodiversity, the diversity, species richness, dominance and frequency of understory woody plant species in different forests of the Basque Country (northern Spain) were compared. Plantations of exotic conifers (Pinus radiata [D.] Don) of different ages were compared with deciduous forests of Quercus robur L. and Fagus sylvatica L. The effects of different types and intensities of management were taken into account. The differences observed were mainly conditioned by the intensity of forestry management, although the response varied according to forest type and age. In unmanaged pine plantations, the diversity and species richness of the understory increased rapidly after planting (while dominance decreased), remained stable in the intermediate age range, and reached a maximum in plantations more than 25 years of age. Management practices resulted in decreased understory diversity and species richness, as well as greater dominance. This was more pronounced in younger than in older stands. Moderate management, however, favored a greater diversity of the understory in deciduous forests. The species composition of the plantations and deciduous forests were different, the latter having a wider range of characteristic species. Knowledge of how forestry practices influence biodiversity (in terms of diversity, richness, dominance, and species composition) may allow predictions to be made about the diversity achievable with different management systems. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media,Inc.},

abstract={Structure and composition of vegetation and abundance of breeding birds in grasslands seeded to Old World bluestem (Bothriochloa ischmaeum) were compared to native mixed prairie in the southern Great Plains of North America. Abundance of birds was determined using fixed-radius point counts. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to compare plant community composition and canonical correspondence analysis was used to examine the relationships between plant species composition and vegetation structure with the bird community. Plant species composition differed distinctly between seeded grassland and native mixed prairie, but the differences were not reflected in habitat structure, bird community composition, or abundance of bird species. Seeded grassland was inferior to native mixed prairie in terms of diversity of plant species, but that difference did not translate into meaningful differences in structure that drove habitat selection by breeding birds. Conservation programs that promote establishment of seeded grassland and do not allow for suitable disturbance regimes will selectively benefit a narrow suite of birds regardless of plant species composition. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Forty-seven 50 m x 50 m quadrats were sampled systematically for vertebrates at Litchfield National Park, northern Australia, in both 1995-96 and 2001-02. A total of 184 vertebrate species was recorded from this sampling, of which 92 species were recorded from five or more quadrats. There was substantial change in the reported species composition of these quadrats between these two periods: the mean Bray-Curtis index for similarity in species composition from the baseline to subsequent sampling of a quadrat was only 22.1 (for an index that varies from O for complete turnover in species to 100 for unchanged composition). For individual species, correlations across quadrats in the abundance scores from baseline to resampling varied from -0.12 to 0.85. Matched-pairs testing showed that there was significant change in abundance for 18 species from the baseline to repeat sampling, and significant increase in total bird species richness and total native mammal abundance, but significant decrease in reptile species richness. Fire history was recorded biannually for 40 of the 47 quadrats. Fire was very frequent, with quadrats being burnt in an average of 3.65 years of the six years between fauna samples. Three aspects of this fire history (total number of years of fires, number of fires in the late dry season, and interval from the last fire to the date of resampling) were related to change in the fauna composition of quadrats. Neither the similarity in species composition, nor change in richness or total abundance of all vertebrates or of the four taxonomic classes considered (frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals) were significantly correlated with these components of the fire history of sampled quadrats. This lack of association was possibly because the monitoring period was too short to show pronounced directional change, because the system was responding to many factors other than fire, because the variations in abundance were too large and the number of samples too small to detect true associations, or because fire histories preceding baseline sampling were not considered. The apparent instability of fauna species and communities in this system provides a considerable challenge for broad-brush (that is, vertebrate community-wide) monitoring. Power analysis demonstrated that, for most species, more than 1000 sample sites are needed to be 90% certain of detecting a 20% change in abundance, and with a 10% chance of accepting a Type I error. This level of sampling effort is commensurate with the current level of vertebrate sampling in this region. Broad-brush monitoring approaches such as described here are valuable, but need also to be complemented by more targetted monitoring for individual threatened species or species of particular management interest.},

abstract={Protection of high biodiversity in an intensively farmed areas is strongly related to managing the diverse structure of a landscape, for example by planting shelterbelts. The study was aimed at recognition of avifauna dynamics in young (with the age of 1-4 years at the beginning of the study) shelterbelts (N=9) and at estimation of their importance for farmland birds. Bird density was estimated by mapping method in successive years 1996-2001 and the data were combined and analysed in respect to age of shelterbelts. Eighteen breeding species were found (5-8 pairs km-1), among them most abundant were Corn Bunting (Miliaria calandra) (with dominance of 33%), Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla flava) (19%) and Whitethroat (Sylvia communis) (12%). No trend in the changes of species richness and total density was recorded. The density of species preferring building nests and/or feeding in herb layer (like Yellow Wagtail, Skylark Alauda arvensis and Whinchat Saxicola rubetra) decreased during study period while the density of species associated to higher layers of vegetation like Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) increased. According to earlier study, bird species richness and abundance in studied young shelterbelts were lower than in several dozens years old ones. However, in relation to species colonization both classes of shelterbelts (species building their nests on the ground or in low shrubs), young shelterbelts were as important as old ones.},

abstract={Recent losses and fragmentation of tallgrass prairie habitat to agriculture and urban development have led to corresponding declines in diversity and abundance of plants and birds associated with such habitat. Mowing and burning are alternative management strategies for restoring and rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, but their specific, comparative effects are the subjects of ongoing evaluation. We compared the responses of plant and bird communities on four sets of mowed, burned, and untreated sites of small (3-10ha), fragmented tallgrass prairies at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR), Iowa, U.S.A., during May-July in 1998 and 1999. Species richness and diversity of plants, resident grassland birds, and communities of birds associated with grassland edges (edge species) were independent of treatment. Although not affecting species richness and diversity in plant communities, mowed sites ranked lower in total plant coverage and total forb coverage than burned sites or untreated sites. In contrast, untreated sites had more coverage by shrubs, suggesting that mowing and burning did retard shrub encroachment. Overall, abundance and diversity of plants and birds were generally insensitive to management strategies. Small, fragmented sites of rare habitat may not respond in the short term to management treatments and may not be capable of supporting highly diverse communities, no matter how intensively manipulated. It is more probable that diversity of native prairie communities can be enhanced and restored only through long-term efforts, acquisition of large land units capable of supporting stable populations, and deliberate reintroduction of species of high conservation Value. © 2004 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract={Water-level drawdown has long been recognized as an effective approach to enhance habitat conditions for aquatic fauna in lakes and impoundments. Although targeted species such as sport fish may benefit, increasingly there are concerns over non-target species. We assessed the impacts of a drawdown of Lake Kissimmee on Florida apple snails. Prior to the drawdown, we found apple snails at significantly higher densities in sites dominated by sandy substrates and emergent macrophytes; no snails were found in sites with deep layers of unconsolidated organic material and dominated by Nuphar luteum. Following the drawdown, some of the sites containing this unconsolidated organic material were also scraped with heavy equipment (e. g., bulldozers) to remove the organic layer. We monitored the response of 31 snails from one site, most of which were stranded in the dry littoral zone during the 1995-1996 drawdown. Mortality rates of stranded snails were high due to the dry conditions of the littoral zone, but also indirectly due to increased vulnerability to predation by several avian species. The survival data was corroborated by the 1996 and 1997 funnel trap data wherein our catch declined by 80% from 1995 (pre-drawdown) levels. The proportion of juveniles also declined significantly, indicating an impact on recruitment. Snail abundance did increase, albeit marginally, in some sites, indicating potential benefits of drawdown and organic substrate removal in some types of littoral zone habitats. However, the timing of drawdown events appears critical, as evident in poor recruitment and relatively low abundance following completion of lake restoration activity. In order to avoid substantial losses to non-target species such as apple snails, we suggest that natural resource managers give greater consideration to the potential negative impacts of deviating from the natural hydrologic regime in terms of timing, duration, and frequency.},

abstract={I investigated two territories of the White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos situated in Skien and Notodden (Telemark). The territories are situated in the far east in the range of the Norwegian Sørlandet population. One territory (Notodden) was situated in a stand of grey alder. The amount of fallen and standing dead trees was investigated using two census plots. The density of fallen and standing dead trees (mostly grey alder) was 324 and 137 truncs/ha, respectively. A well defined area covering 33 ha of high quality foraging habitats represents an estimate of the home range during the nestling period. The other territory (Skien) was situated in a landscape where decidous forests are heavily fragmented. All suitable foraging habitats (stands of decidous forest with high density of dead and dying trees) were mapped within the area 0-3 km from the nesting site (a circular area of 28 km2). Patches of decidous forests occurs as 1-10 ha patches in a matrix of clearcuts and young stands of spruce. Decidous forest makes up only 4 % of the total area. The area within 1 km from the nest site showed the greatest abundance of suitable foraging habitats (480 ha, 15,4 % of the total area), while the density of suitable foraging habitats declined further away from the nest site. Changes in forest structure leading to reduced amount of suitable foraging habitats on a landscape level is believed to be the main reason for the decline in the population of the White-backed Woodpecker in eastern parts of Norway, as well as in Western Europe as a whole.},

abstract={Increases in the intensity of the management of agricultural grasslands over the past 50 years have reduced plant species diversity in swards and increased uniformity in structure through changes in fertilizer regimes, grazing and mowing practices. These factors, as well as increased disturbance and trampling, have reduced the number and diversity of forbs and thus the diversity and abundance of invertebrates, in particular of foliar species. Associated with these changes in management, there has been a large decline in the abundance of many species of farmland birds in pastoral areas and more local extinctions compared with arable areas. To understand the impact of these management changes on bird populations, and design measures to reverse the declines, it is necessary to identify the key factors influencing bird usage of fields. We review results from five studies, which have related fertilizer and grazing management to bird usage of grass fields. Species that fed on soil invertebrates tended to show a positive response to the amount of nitrogen fertilizer added and increased grazing pressure, although there was a high degree of correlation between these two variables. In summer, many species, including corvids, Common Blackbird Turdus merula, Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris, Pied Wagtail Motacilla alba and Hedge Accentor Prunella modularis, showed a negative relationship with sward height, and in winter more species showed a positive relationship with bare ground. Taller sward heights are associated with a greater abundance and diversity of bird invertebrate food resources, and accessibility of food items or a lower risk of predation (actual or perceived) are likely to be the reasons for birds choosing to forage on shorter swards and in areas with more bare ground. Birds feeding on soil invertebrates were found to be generally tolerant of modern management practices that maintain short swards short, as accessibility to the soil has been increased. Species that feed on foliar invertebrates or forb seeds have been affected negatively by modern grassland agricultural practices.},

abstract={Changes in agricultural policies have favored tree clearing and removal of shrubs to favor intensive farming in the holm oak Quercus ilex dehesas of Iberia. The effect of these changes for bird species wintering in this agricultural landscape has been rarely analyzed. Here the effects are studied of farming changes in traditional holm oak dehesas on population size, social structure and time budget of common cranes Grus grus in eight traditional wintering sites in Spain. The role of acorn availability, the principal winter food of the species, in relation to management is also assessed. The number of cranes in each wintering area was not related to degree of agricultural intensification, nor to the availability of acorns. However, crane flock size decreased, and the relative occurrence of isolated family groups increased in less intensively transformed wintering areas characterized by the predominance of fallow lands. The age composition of crane flocks varied with acorn availability since more juveniles were reported in areas with relatively lower acorn availability. Time budget was also related to acorn availability, since cranes spent relatively more time preening in those wintering areas with higher availability of acorns. Globally evidence suggests the need to maintain the fallow land (posíos) to sustain the wintering populations of cranes in Iberia, since this agro-grazing system maintains most of the juvenile cranes using the western migratory route.},

abstract={Duringthe 19th and early 20th centuries, people moving westward saw the grasslands as a land that could fulfill their dreams of new homes, new opportunities, and new freedoms. The settlement of the grasslands brought many changes that affected wildlife. These changes include conversion of wild habitats to agriculture and urban areas, and the dissecting of the landscape with roads, fences, and rails. This landconversion and dissection have resulted in habitat loss and fragmentation. Another drastic change to the grassland has been the alteration or loss of riparian habitats and wetlands, affecting many wildlife species that use riparian areas or are riparian obligates. Introduction of farm and ranch livestock has imposed another change by subjecting native species to competition pressures that they had not evolved with. Natural predator-prey relationships have been disrupted as many predators were greatly reduced in number or extirpated because they prey on livestock. Conversely, populations of some prey species have been reduced, at times intentionally, because they were and are deemed as a pest and a nuisance. Another change that has altered grassland ecosystems has been fire suppression. Suppression of fire has result in changes in the structure and species composition of the vegetation and, consequently, has influenced the wildlife species of the grasslands. In light of the many, often dramatic, changes people have made to the grassland ecosystems mentioned above and which will be discussed in more detail in the following chapters, it is worth repeating the words of Aldo Leopold (1949: 190): The last word in ignorance is the man who says of an animal or plant: "What good is it?" If the land mechanism as a whole is good, then every part is good, whether we understand it or not. If the biota, in the course of eons, has built something we like but do not understand, then who but a fool would discard seemingly useless parts? To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering. Over time, many of the wheels and cogs (biological diversity, predator-prey relationships, competition, wild habitats, and so forth) in the grassland ecosystem have been changed, broken, or replaced, resulting in a system that does not work as well as it had originally evolved to work. Consequently, it is wise for land managers to work with the components of the system that are present and strive to have them working as well as possible. The information in this volume is intended to help manage the wildlife and fisheries components of the grassland ecosystems.},

abstract={Habitat management for an endangered species may affect nontarget communities. We examined avian community response to pine-grassland restoration for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and traditional United States Forest Service pine sawtimber management at Homochitto National Forest, Mississippi from 1994-1996. Thirteen species were more abundant in pine-grassland restoration stands, whereas 5 species were more abundant in traditionally managed pine sawtimber stands. Mature restored pine-grassland stands had greater avian species richness, total bird abundance, and avian conservation value than traditionally managed pine sawtimber stands. We used logistic regression models in an exploratory analysis to predict occurrence of selected species using stand- and landscape-scale habitat characteristics. Probability of red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus) occurrence increased with increasing hardwood canopy cover, and probability of yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) occurrence increased with increasing grass ground cover. Species richness, total avian abundance, and occurrence of red-eyed vireos and Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) increased with increasing values of Shannon's Habitat Diversity Index. Pine-grassland restoration for red-cockaded woodpeckers created vegetation composition and structure at the stand and landscape scales that may benefit numerous avian species of regional conservation concern.},

The parameters perch diameter and microhabitat/substrate type explained more variation in the data than other parameters, and effectively divided the guild into two groups: (1) 'conventional' - species that excavated frequently, used relatively large perches, and foraged on snags and patches of dead wood, and (2) 'novel' - species that used smaller perches and microhabitats that are available in tropical forests on a year-round basis (e.g. external, arboreal ant/termite nests and bamboo). These novel resources may explain, in part, the maintenance of high woodpecker diversity in tropical rain forests.},

Large amounts of necromass, including snags, were present in 5-y-old logged and unlogged forest, but dead wood was in low abundance in 10-y-old logged forest. The absence or scarcity of large, snag-foraging woodpeckers from older logged stands suggests that this resource may remain in low abundance for a considerable time.},

abstract={In Italy the spread of Castanea sativa is largely dependent upon humans, who first protected and then cultivated it for about 3000 years. Recently, however, chestnut cultivation has steadily declined, due mainly to social and economic factors. In this paper we analysed the dynamics of the bird community in chestnut stands that represent a gradient from woods impacted by domestic firewood collecting to abandoned and derelict coppice interspersed with mature fruiting cultivars. Bird diversity, density, species richness and the abundance of six out of the sixteen commonest species were positively affected by the occurrence of mature fruiting sweet chestnuts in the study stands. These old trees (> 100 years) are rich in cavities and support many dead branches and thus can take the place of dead standing wood for birds, offering food, nesting and roosting sites. We also found a significant trend of increasing bird abundance, species richness and diversity with increasing stand age; heterogeneity in vegetation structure and composition following natural regeneration possibly created more forest-like conditions than uniform younger woods, thus supporting a richer bird community. The present findings are discussed in terms of conservation of bird diversity in old coppiced woods.},

abstract={We compared vegetation structure used by 14 bird species during the 1998 and 1999 breeding seasons to determine what habitat features best accounted for habitat division and community organization in Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands of southwestern Wyoming. Habitat use was quantified by measuring 24 habitat variables in 461 bird-centered quadrats, each 0.04 ha in size. Using discriminant function analysis, we differentiated between habitat used by 14 bird species along 3 habitat dimensions: (1) variation in shrub cover, overstory juniper cover, mature tree density, understory height, and decadent tree density; (2) a gradient composed of elevation and forb cover; and (3) variation in grass cover, tree height, seedling/sapling cover, and bare ground/rock cover. Of 14 species considered, 9 exhibited substantial habitat partitioning: Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura), Bewick's Wren (Thryomanes bewickii), Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides), Plumbeous Vireo (Vireo plumbeus), Green-tailed Towhee (Pipilo chlorurus), Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri), Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis), and Cassin's Finch (Carpodacus cassinii). Our results indicate juniper bird communities of southwestern Wyoming are organized along a 3-dimensional habitat gradient composed of woodland maturity, elevation, and juniper recruitment. Because juniper birds partition habitat along successional and altitudinal gradients, indiscriminate woodland clearing as well as continued fire suppression will alter species composition. Restoration efforts should ensure that all successional stages of juniper woodland are present on the landscape.},

abstract={I investigated the role of habitat structure in explaining bird species richness and abundance in riparian buffer strips of old-growth coniferous forest on western Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Using buffer strips of varying widths and a control from undisturbed riparian forest, I tested the hypothesis that vegetation differs in buffer strips of varying width. I selected 10 summary variables to represent broad-scale vegetation attributes of riparian habitat. Deciduous tree density was higher, and shrub richness was lower in wide buffers compared with narrow buffers. I then used Akaike information criterion to examine whether vegetation structure or buffer width best explained patterns of bird richness and abundance in riparian habitats. Species richness and abundance in several foraging guilds were explained better by buffer width than by vegetation. Abundances of three bird habitat guilds: riparian specialists, forest-interior, and open-edge species, and 6 of 10 species were best explained by specific vegetation features. Differences in vegetation, particularly deciduous tree density and shrub cover, explained part of the variation in abundance of several riparian forest-dwelling species and may be useful in evaluating specific forest management practices. Because deciduous tree density is also positively correlated with buffer width, wide buffers (>100 m) may benefit not only those species associated with coniferous upland forests and forest generalists sensitive to buffer width, but also those species whose abundance is associated with deciduous trees.},

abstract={The Po'ouli (Melamprosops phaeosoma), a Hawaiian honeycreeper endemic to Maui, has a population of only three known individuals; no breeding pair currently exists, and their home ranges are too far apart for breeding to occur. Without timely intervention this monotypic genus will likely go extinct. Conservationists have faced a dilemma: facilitate breeding amongst the known individuals, manage their ecosystem to benefit uncounted Po'ouli, or a combination of both? Po'ouli biology is poorly known - but their remote home ranges are closely monitored. A State and Federal Environmental Assessment in 1999 recommended that one Po'ouli be translocated into the home range of another in an attempt to facilitate breeding. This first manipulative recovery action was achieved in April 2002, and provided valuable new information for future captive management efforts, but upon release, radio telemetry confirmed that the translocated bird returned to its own home range after one day. We describe the recent progress that has been made to recover the Po'ouli, and critically evaluate the Po'ouli case study and the lessons learned from it that can help expedite recovery of other birds of extreme rarity. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={We studied year-round food preferences of the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) from 1994 to 2000 in Berchtesgaden National Park, Germany. We color-banded 52 birds for individual recognition, and we radiomarked 25 adults from this sample. We analyzed 142 feces of 30 adults and 588 feces of 40 nestlings from 15 nests. Additionally, we took samples from 20 trees recently used for foraging in 10 woodpecker territories to estimate local prey availability. Based on relative abundance and relative frequency of food items (i.e., importance value), overall diet composition of adult three-toed woodpeckers was dominated by spiders (Araneidea), larvae of longhorn beetles (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae), and bark beetles (Coleoptera, Scolytidae). Adults ate longhorn beetle larvae primarily during nesting, while imagines (fully developed adults) and larvae of various bark beetles appeared to be the main food resource outside the nesting season. Nestling diet was dominated by spiders and longhorn beetle larvae that were gathered 247 ± 122 m (x̄ ± SD) from the nest. Our results demonstrated that consumption of bark beetles by three-toed woodpeckers varies throughout the year, being lowest during the nesting season, while longhorn beetle larvae are preferred throughout the year. Securing habitat requirements of both bark and wood-boring beetle communities is a critical step to maintaining viable three-toed woodpecker populations.},

abstract={Pale-headed Brush-finch Allapetes pallidiceps is a restricted-range species that is threatened with extinction due to habitat loss. The total population of 60-80 individuals achieved a reproductive output of only 0.74 young per breeding pair in 2002. Brood parasitism by Shiny Cowbird Molothrus bonariensis was a major factor reducing breeding success, affecting 38.5% of broods. Parasitism rates reached 50% in an ungrazed reserve, but only 14% on an adjacent grazed plot. The resulting difference in breeding success was not, however, attributable to vegetation parameters used to describe microhabitat use. Cowbird parasitism rates therefore seem to be influenced largely by factors operating at the landscape level. These may include grazing scheme, topography, humidity and host availability. It is suggested that lower species diversity and bird abundance rendered the grazed site less attractive to cowbirds. Current parasitism rates are of great conservation concern due to the low population size of Pale-headed Brush-finch, and the initiation of controlling measures is pressing. Management options described from intensive cowbird control programmes in North America are reviewed and evaluated for their applicability here. To combine the possibility of further data collection with commencement of immediate conservation action, we consider two alternative approaches. Nest monitoring and cowbird egg removal would enable the study of the distribution of parasitism in relation to landscape and vegetation variables, whereas cowbird shooting and nest monitoring might provide a larger short-term benefit to reproductive output. Habitat management, resumption of some grazing in the reserve and cowbird removal should be considered for the intermediate future. © BirdLife International 2004.},

abstract={The study deals with the influence of the structure, texture and dynamics of a spruce-beech primeval forest on the bird community in Skalna Alpa National Nature Reserve in the Vel'ká Fatra Mts. (West Carpathians, Slovakia) in the years 1982-2002. The abundance of Norway spruce (Picea excelsa LAM.) was highest both in the optimum and decomposition stage. In the growth stage the number of Norway spruce (Picea excelsa LAM.) trees was quite low. The texture of spruce-beech virgin forest was very variable. Percentage ratios of individual stages on the area of 42.16 ha were as follows: growth stage 38.3%, optimum stage 20.1% and decomposition stage 41.6%. Altogether 46 bird species were represented in the bird community during the spring season. Mean total density was 85.8 ind/10 ha. The bird community consisted of 52 species in the summer season, 45 in the autumn migration season, 34 in the winter season, and of 47 in the spring migration season. The highest density was found in the bird community during the autumn migration season (109.8 ind/10 ha), the lowest in the winter season (24.6 ind/10 ha). During the spring migration season, both the spectrum of bird species and total density of bird community increased by the number of migratory species that came back from winter habitats.},

abstract={Comparative studies of riparian and upland bird communities have focused primarily on larger streams (greater than second order). We examined breeding-bird assemblages in relation to their proximity to small headwater streams in northern hardwood forests of the Otter River watershed in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, USA. At 10 study sites, we used fixed-radius point counts to survey bird assemblages and measure forest habitat characteristics along riparian and upland transects. Forest structure and composition differed between riparian and upland areas, with more conifer stems and higher conifer basal area on riparian transects. We detected 46 bird species during 1999 and 2000. During each year, total bird abundance was similar for riparian and upland areas, whereas bird species richness and evenness was higher in riparian areas. When we pooled bird species by foraging guild, we found that foliage-gleaning birds were more abundant in riparian areas. We found 12 bird species exclusively in riparian areas and only 2 species exclusively in the uplands. The northern parula (Parula americana) and Blackburnian warbler (Dendroica fusca) were among 5 species more abundant on riparian transects, whereas the least flycatcher (Empidonax minimus) and red-eyed vireo (Vino olivaceus) were among 5 species more abundant on upland transects. Although the vegetative gradient between riparian and upland habitat was subtle along these first- and second-order streams, breeding-bird assemblages differed between riparian and upland forests. This suggests that individual bird species respond to vegetative features of even narrow riparian areas. Managers working in northern and mixed-hardwood forests therefore should consider maintaining habitat diversity in the form of native conifers, even on the smallest first-order streams.},

abstract={The Białowieza Forest (BF) is an extensive and relatively little changed forest complex on the Polish-Belarussian border. Data on the structure and diversity of its breeding avifauna have mostly been collected in primeval old-growth stands, preserved within the Białowieza National Park (BNP). Mapping censuses repeated in space (plots, replicated in riverine, oak-lime-hornbeam and coniferous stands) and time (permanent plots, 28 years) reveal that the breeding bird assemblages are rich in species (29-52/season in a 25 to 33-ha plot), but of moderate overall density (40-120 pairs/10 ha). The latter is due to low, lower than in man-transformed areas, densities of the majority of particular species. Despite marked changes in vegetation structure, the composition of the breeding bird assemblage does not vary much across different primeval forest types, with a single breeding bird community inhabiting all of them, including treefall gaps. High richness of the BF avifauna stems from the Forest's geographical locality, as well as from a high level of the primeval avifauna retention. Over 95% of the 135-140 pristine species still breed there. Especially species-rich groups are birds of prey, owls, woodpeckers and Sylvinae warblers. Bird communities in the BNP and primeval tropical rain forests share many features, suggesting that natural differences between temperate and tropical forests were less pronounced in the past. The combination of high species richness with low densities of individual species is probably a feature of all pristine forests, independent of climatic zone. The BF avifauna must once have been typical of the ancient European forests and it has become so exceptional chiefly because it has preserved most of its pristine features. The BF thus constitutes an indispensable reference site for future studies of woodland bird biology. To ensure its survival should become a priority. Commercial logging, taking place over 80% of the Polish BF part, severely changes the Forest's structure and strongly affects the birds, especially species which depend on dead wood (Dendrocopos leucotos, Picoides tridactylus) and on old-growth stands. The small area protected as the BNP becomes an increasingly isolated "island", in which preservation of the primeval forest features seems to be impossible. In order to retain them, it is necessary to protect the whole BF area. © Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e. V. 2004.},

abstract={Subspecies are often used in ways that require their evolutionary independence, for example as proxies for units of conservation. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data reveal that 97% of continentally distributed avian subspecies lack the population genetic structure indicative of a distinct evolutionary unit. Subspecies considered threatened or endangered, some of which have been targets of expensive restoration efforts, also generally lack genetic distinctiveness. Although sequence data show that species include 1.9 historically significant units on average, these units are not reflected by current subspecies nomenclature. Yet, it is these unnamed units and not named subspecies that should play a major role in guiding conservation efforts and in identifying biological diversity. Thus, a massive reorganization of classifications is required so that the lowest ranks, be they species or subspecies, reflect evolutionary diversity. Until such reorganization is accomplished, the subspecies rank will continue to hinder progress in taxonomy, evolutionary studies and especially conservation.},

abstract={In this paper we analyse the population trend 1975-2002 of breeding birds in eight wetlands in the canton of Zurich. Ten out of 26 breeding species showed an increase in population size (Little Grebe, Great Crested Grebe, Black-necked Grebe, Little Bittern, Tufted Duck, Common Tern, Rufous Nightingale, Savi's Warbler, Reed Warbler and Yellowhammer), seven a decline (Common Teal, Common Pochard, Northern Lapwing, Common Snipe, Tree Pipit, Willow Warbler, Golden Oriole) and no change was evident in nine species (Water Rail, Spotted Crake, Moorhen, Black-headed Gull, Common Cuckoo, Grasshopper Warbler, Marsh Warbler, Great Reed Warbler, Reed Bunting). Formerly common birds in the wetlands have disappeared or continued breeding only irregularly, for example the Common Snipe or the Tree Pipit. On the other hand, Savi's Warbler and Rufous Nightingale expanded their distribution and population size. The Common Tern started to breed due to specific conservation measures. Considering the critical situation of wetlands within the densely populated canton of Zurich the overall results are encouraging. We conclude that the long-term management measures started in wetlands in the 1970s are successful. These measures include the restoration of deteriorated wetlands, actions against succession processes like constructing ponds, fine tuning of water levels or grazing cattle at specific spots, species conservation measures and the control of recreational activities.},

The impacts of this change were studied in 2001 using a combination of arthropod collecting methods. The ant population excluded larger invertebrates (principally the large ant Odontomachus simillimus and the crabs, principally Ocypode spp.). Cockroaches, however, remained abundant in ant-infested areas and tree-nesting birds (Lesser Noddy Anous tenuirostris) appear to be able to breed successfully in the presence of the crazy ant. The ants are only abundant in areas of deep shade which provide cool nesting areas, yet enabling them to forage in the open when ground temperatures fall. The expansion of the ants was correlated with the regeneration of woodland on the island. Recommendations are made for the management of the woodland which may reduce the impacts of the crazy ant. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={No published data exist on responses of grassland passerines and their habitat to combined grazing and burning treatments in northern mixed-grass prairie. At Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (LNWR) in northwestern North Dakota, we monitored breeding bird occurrence, abundance, and habitat during successive annual grazing treatments (1998-2000) on 5 prescribe-burned, mixed-grass prairie management units (range = 50-534 ha, each burned 3-6 times in the previous 10-20 years). All breeding passerine species characteristic of upland, northern mixed-grass prairie were common (>10% occurrence) during at least 1 of 3 years on burned and grazed units, except Chestnut-collared Longspur (Calcarius ornatus), which was uncommon. Vegetation was generally shorter and sparser than that found on 4 nearby units treated by fire only (1999; density, visual obstruction, and height, all P < 0.01). Regardless, occurrences of individual bird species resembled those previously documented on prairie units at LNWR with similar fire histories but no grazing; however, Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) occurred 2.4 times more frequently on burned and grazed units studied. Our data suggest that species diversity of breeding grassland passerines changes little during initial years of rotation grazing at moderate stocking rates in fire-managed, northern mixed-grass prairie at LNWR.},

abstract={In this study, we used a hierarchical, multifactor ecological classification system to examine how spatial patterns of biodiversity develop in one of the most species-rich ecosystems in North America, the fire-maintained longleaf pine-wiregrass ecosystem and associated depressional wetlands and riparian forests. Our goal was to determine which landscape features are important controls on species richness, to establish how these constraints are expressed at different levels of organization, and to identify hotspots of biological diversity for a particular locality. We examine the following questions: 1) How is the variance in patterns of plant species richness and diversity partitioned at different scales, or classification units, of the hierarchical ecosystem classification developed for the study area? 2) What are the compositional similarities among ecosystem types? 3) For our study area, what are the sites expected to harbour highest species richness? We used a spatially explicit map of biodiversity to project abundance of species-rich communities in the landscape based on a previously developed ecological classification system for a lower Gulf Coastal Plain landscape. The data indicate that high species richness in this ecosystem was found in sites with frequent fire and high soil moisture. Sites in fire-maintained landscapes with lower frequency of fire were associated with geomorphological characteristics, suggesting a dependence of the diversity-disturbance relationship with soil type. With more frequent fire on some sites, high diversity shifts from canopy component to ground flora, with an overall increase in total species richness. Our approach demonstrates how potential species richness can be identified as a restoration goal and that multiple vegetation endpoints may be appropriate vegetation objectives. We identify basic management needs for the maintenance of biodiversity in this ecosystem that can be derived from an understanding of the combination of factors that most strongly predict diverse plant communities.},

Our results indicate that the Cerulean Warbler would not be an effective biodiversity indicator, as its distribution across the studied landscape did not coincide with areas of high avian species richness. However, the Cerulean Warbler may be effective as an umbrella species for the maintenance of populations of other canopy-nesting species that require mature deciduous forest habitats. It is hoped that the conclusions reached in Ontario, while perhaps not directly transferable to all parts of the breeding range, encourage other Cerulean Warbler researchers to ask similar questions in their study areas.},

abstract={I examined how winter flooding of post-harvest rice fields - a management practice used to benefit waterbirds - affects field use by other birds. In addition to waterbirds previously studied, I recorded 56 bird species in rice fields. Of these, five were more abundant in flooded fields, ten were more abundant in unflooded fields, no difference was detected for 19, and the remainder were too rare to draw any conclusions. Species that were more common in unflooded fields were all carnivorous or granivorous in winter, whereas species that were more common in flooded fields were mostly insectivores commonly associated with aquatic habitats. The net effects of the responses by individual species were fewer raptor species in flooded fields, but no difference in the species richness of other landbirds. Winter flooding potentially has negative effects for some birds, but has no discernible effects on most species studied and may benefit some passerines. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The salt marshes of the pampas region of Argentina have experienced an increase in fire use as a management tool to improve cattle forage and to avoid accidental fires. A spring burn of 200 ha of salt marsh in Mar Chiquita Biosphere Reserve, Argentina, in September 1995, allowed us to compare the response of birds associated with two vegetation communities, one dominated by Spartina densiflora (Spartina marsh) and another dominated by Juncus acutus (Juncus marsh) from one month to one year post-burn. We recorded changes in plant species composition and vegetation structure (height and cover) at 40 days after the burn and every season for the subsequent year. Fire reduced total cover of both plant communities. Juncus marsh recovered pre-burn structure and bird community by one year post-fire. However, Spartina marsh recovery was incomplete in that period. Relative abundances of bird species that used unburned Juncus marsh were similar to those in burned Juncus marsh in the spring period one year after the burn. Plant height at the burned Spartina marsh did not reach that of the unburned Spartina in 12 months; red-capped wren-spinetail (Spartonoica maluroides), a rare tall-grass-dependent species, settled burned parcels at lower relative abundances than in unburned habitat. Because species that first use the burned patches are very common and widespread in other habitats, and excessive burning may reduce available habitat for endangered or rare species, prescribed burns should be avoided in this region. © 2004, The Society of Wetland Scientists.},

abstract={Chihuahuan Desert grasslands are important wintering grounds for grassland and shrub-adapted birds. Many species belonging to these assemblages are currently exhibiting population declines. One area recognized for its importance to biological diversity, including grassland birds, is the Janos-Nuevo Casas Grandes black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) complex in north-western Chihuahua, Mexico, an area containing 58 colonies with 30,000 ha of prairie dogs. This is one of the largest remaining prairie dog complexes and the only intact complex in the Chihuahuan Desert. In its current condition, a large percentage of this complex is of reduced value to wildlife. Overgrazing on communal (ejido) lands has resulted in areas being comprised of annual grasses and forbs. The density of active prairie dog burrows and banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis) mounds as well as avian diversity and abundance were lower on ejido lands than an adjacent private ranchland with and without prairie dogs. Few avian species used overgrazed portions of the prairie dog colony. Community similarity among plot types was low due to different management practices and differences on and off colony. To retain, and in many instances restore the biological diversity of this important region it is essential to work with local ejidos on grazing management. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Alligators create disturbance patches within the Everglades, but little is known about spatial and temporal variation in alligator holes throughout this ecosystem. Forty-eight alligator holes in Water Conservation Area 3 of the central Everglades were sampled to assess variation in morphology and vegetation and to identify landscape- and habitat-level features that correlate to alligator-hole variation. Field observations and plant community ordination suggested three distinct categories of alligator holes: holes containing shrub/tree species (shrub holes), holes surrounded by marsh (marsh holes), and holes dominated by cattails (cattail holes). Shrub holes were the most species-rich and diverse of the three types. All alligator holes except for cattail holes contained a greater richness of vascular plants than the surrounding marsh. Cattail holes were deeper than shrub or marsh holes, and all holes were deeper than surrounding marsh. Major landscape features that may influence structure of alligator holes seem to be distance from canals and surrounding marsh vegetation matrix. Alligator holes increase spatial heterogeneity, influence plant community composition and structure, and increase biological diversity. Restoration and management plans for the Everglades ecosystem should ensure that this landscape feature is perpetuated. © 2004, The Society of Wetland Scientists.},

abstract={Food availability during winter may determine habitat use and limit populations of overwintering birds, yet its importance is difficult to judge because few studies have experimentally tested the response of nonbreeding birds to changes in resource abundance. We experimentally examined the link between fruit availability and habitat use by manipulating winter abundance of Myrica cerifera L. (Myricaceae) fruits in managed longleaf (Pinus palustris) and loblolly (P. taeda) pine stands in South Carolina. Myrica cerifera is a common understory shrub in the southeastern United States and provides lipid-rich fruit in late winter (February and March), when insects and other fruits are scarce. On treatment plots, we covered fruiting M. cerifera shrubs with netting in early winter to prevent birds from eating their fruits. In late February, when M. cerifera fruit crops were largely depleted elsewhere on our study site, we uncovered the shrubs and documented the response of the bird community to those patches of high fruit availability. Relative to control plots, total bird abundance (excluding the most common species, Yellow-rumped Warbler [Dendroica coronata]) and species richness did not change after net removal. Yellow-rumped Warblers, however, became significantly more abundant on treatment plots after net removal, which suggests that they track M. cerifera fruit abundance. We suggest that M. cerifera plays a role in determining the local distribution of wintering Yellow-rumped Warblers at our study site. To put these results into a management context, we also examined the effect of prescribed fire frequencies on M. cerifera fruit production. Across pine stands with different fire regimes, M. cerifera fruit abundance increased with the number of years since burning. It takes 4-6 years for individuals to recover sufficiently from a burn to produce large quantities of fruit. Thus, shorter intervals between burns will reduce winter fruit availability. Taken together, these results suggest that within those pine plantations, the local winter distribution of at least one common migratory bird is closely tied to fruit abundance, which in turn is tied to the frequency of prescribed fires.},

abstract={The presence of rotted wood is often noted in descriptions of woodpecker nest and roost sites, and ornithologists have found that certain fungi and species of woodpeckers, such as the red heart fungus (Phellinus pini) and Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) are intimately linked. The relationship assumed is usually one of woodpecker dependence or preference for partially decayed wood in which to excavate cavities, but the woodpecker is also sometimes suggested as a vector for the fungus. In this paper we review such associations and describe patterns evident among woodpecker nest sites that suggest microclimatic and microhabitat characteristics favoring fungal colonization of trees, woodpecker-favorable responses of trees to fungi, and ultimate use of the trees for woodpecker cavity excavation. Factors that favor fungal invasion and tree use by woodpeckers include tree species, growth history, site characteristics such as proximity to water and exposure to sun or shade, nature and position of tree injury, local climate, forest age and species composition, fire frequency, and human management activities. Woodpecker cavity height and entrance orientation may be related to the dispersal dynamics of fungi, which in turn may be related to forest vegetation, thermal, and hydric characteristics.},

abstract={The concept of source and sinks can guide conservation, but empirical studies are needed to demonstrate that this concept applies to the real world. We investigated whether the source-sink concept could help to clarify the influence of habitat potential (scrub ridge characteristics), population density, and fires (shrub heights) on Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) demography and dispersal. We mapped territories and measured survival, recruitment, emigration, immigration, and shrub heights annually for 12 years. We classified territories as oak if they overlapped well-drained ridges, oak-palmetto if they overlapped poorly drained ridges >0.4 ha, and palmetto-oak if they only overlapped poorly drained ridges <0.4 ha. Territory size differed little among these categories but was negatively correlated with the annual number of breeding pairs, which ranged from 12 to 27. Scrub ridge characteristics influenced the locations of sinks and potential sources, whereas population density and fires caused temporal variation in demographic success. Oak territories were usually sources because they were net exporters of individuals and because recruitment exceeded mortality. Oak-palmetto territories sometimes functioned as sources but were often pseudo-sinks because density dependence caused mortality to exceed recruitment. Palmetto-oak territories were true sinks because they were net importers of individuals and mortality exceeded recruitment regardless of population density. All scrub was short (<1.2 m) or medium height (1.2-1.7 m), but the spatial arrangement of these height classes changed regularly because fires occurred every 2-7 years. We observed a quadratic relationship between demographic success and the area of medium-height scrub within territories. Territories that had 0.9-1.2 ha of medium-height scrub had the highest demographic success. Applying source-sink concepts at the territory scale was useful to quantify habitat variation at a spatial scale relevant to population processes, reserve design, and habitat management. Our approach can be applied by using territory maps or geographic information systems to partition heterogeneous landscapes into territories and then by classifying territories into potential sources and sinks using scrub ridge characteristics and shrub heights.},

abstract={We analyzed data on numbers and annual trends of breeding terns and gulls based on censuses of all colonies of the Caspian Tern (Sterna caspia), Forster's Tern (S. forsteri) and California Gull (Larus californicus) in the San Francisco Bay estuary from 1982 to 2003. All species used nesting substrates that were flat, largely non-vegetated, had a wide view in all directions, and were composed of sand, gravel, or earth. The estuary supported 17, 13, and seven colonies of each species, respectively. Nesting terns were primarily on salt evaporation pond islands and tidal islands. The largest colony of California Gulls was on a deactivated salt pond. Total numbers of each species in 2003 were about 2,300, 2,450 and 21,200 breeding birds, respectively. Numbers of Forster's Terns declined significantly during the study, while California Gulls increased, and the number of Caspian Terns was stable. Numbers of each species at each colony site have shown considerable annual variation. We attribute the lack of colony site fidelity of each species, and the decline among Forster's Terns, primarily to mammalian predation, human disturbance, and possibly annual variation in food availability. Flat, minimally vegetated islands, which are few in the estuary, are critical for maintaining nesting terns and California Gulls. Yet, the planned restoration of 65% (9,050 ha) of the salt pond complex of the San Francisco Bay estuary will likely remove some of the salt pond islands and levees where 20% of the Caspian Terns (438 birds), 80% of Forster's Terns (1,958) and 96% of California Gulls (20,210) were nesting in 2003. We recommend that restoration plans should include the creation of sizeable tracts of islands specifically designed to provide nesting habitat for these larids. These replacement sites should be in place soon after the restoration has been implemented; i.e., well before scheduled completion. This is especially important because severe habitat limitation would lead to competition for nesting space among the three species, a situation expected to result in exclusion of the terns by the gull, which nests earlier, are larger, more abundant, and more aggressive.},

abstract={A large database collated by bird watchers was analysed to determine whether birds living in the urban habitats of Sydney, Australia could be characterised as a discrete community differing from those occupying a variety of nearby native habitats. Standardised surveys at fixed distances from nine remnants of one native habitat (woodland/scrub on Hawkesbury sandstone) were then conducted to determine whether size of, and distance to, remnants of native habitat influenced the composition of the surrounding suburban bird community. Non-metric multidimensional scaling did not separate the bird community of urban parks and gardens from those occupying residential areas. However, analysis of similarity showed that these communities were significantly different from the bird communities of each of the native habitats. Suburban habitats could be differentiated by the prevalence of exotic species as well as parrots, large honeyeaters, and large birds incorporating vertebrate foods in their diet, and a relative rarity of small insectivores and honeyeaters. Nearby remnant vegetation had little effect on the bird community inhabiting suburban areas. No significant effects of remnant size or remnant proximity were detected for species richness, individual abundance or community composition. These results suggest that there is little overlap in use of urban and remnant habitats by the majority of species and that in order to increase bird diversity, urban habitats must provide a fuller complement of ecological requirements. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Soil characteristics, disturbance histories, and species richness among distinct groups of plants and animals may be useful predictors of important conservation areas when data are limited. We used multivariate analysis of covariance to test the hypothesis that the species richness of plants, arthropods, herpetofauna, and breeding birds are correlated and increase with soil fertility (silt and clay content in sandy soils), soil variability, and hardwood midstory reduction in subxeric, nutrient-poor longleafpine sandhills at Eglin Air Force Base in northwest Florida. During 1994-1995 and 1998-1999, we sampled 30 81-ha plots with varying fire-exclusion histories and at two spatial scales of resolution (10 x 40m and 81 ha). The relationship between the number of plant species and percent silt and clay and its coefficient of variation was significant and positive at the plot level (81 ha) but not at the subplot level (10 x 40 m). Herpetofaunal species richness was the only faunal variable that increased with silt and clay content, but the coefficient of variation did not. Multivariate effects of hardwood reduction were significant in 1998-1999 but not in 1994-1995, which suggests that the reintroduction of fire increased species richness across taxa. Univariate effects of hardwood reduction were marginally significant for plant species richness at the subplot level and not significant for herpetofaunal species richness at either scale. Plant and arthropod species richness were not correlated. Herpetofaunal species richness was not correlated with that of other taxa (plant and animal). The species richness of plants and arthropods were each significantly positively correlated with the richness of breeding bird species at the subplot level during 1994-1995, whereas only arthropod species richness was positively correlated with bird species richness at the plot level in either year. Our results suggest that the restoration of fire regime may be the most effective tool with which to increase diversity in pyrogenic areas considered for conservation protection.},

abstract={The southern Iberian Peninsula is dominated by a savannah-like ecosystem, the montado, which is a typically Mediterranean cultural adaptation to generally poor productive areas. Montados are exploited for three main uses: forestry, agriculture, and extensive grazing, in proportions that vary according to local conditions (more or less productive land) and historical circumstances. Because these ecosystems occur over a large geographic area (they occupy some 6 million ha), biodiversity would be expected to vary among montados. However, differences in management practices may also influence species distribution. In this paper, we investigate differences in plant and bird species diversity among 60 montados distributed all across southern Portugal. The environmental variables studied included geographical coordinates, climatological data, soil type, and altitude. We also investigated agro-economic variables that could describe human activities at each site: animal husbandry (breeds, stock density, grazing rotation, etc.), agriculture (fallow rotation frequency, use of fertilizers, etc.), and forestry (cork harvesting, thinning, etc.). Finally, land-use type and metrics were assessed from rectified aerial photographs. Species richness among these two groups was not correlated, sites with high or low numbers of plant species not necessarily having high or low numbers of bird species. However, both plant and bird communities exhibited a similar pattern of species composition and turnover. This pattern was ecologically based, rather than a result of biological similarities between groups: direct gradient analyses and variance partitioning revealed strong correlations between species distribution and spatial gradients, namely longitude and latitude. In trying to distinguish anthropogenic from biophysical processes, we found that both were equally important as drivers of montado biodiversity. Plants and birds exhibited a similar ecological pattern, although environmental conditions were slightly more important in the case of plants, and human activities were slightly more important in the case of birds. © 2003 by the author(s).},

abstract={The density and species richness of bird communities in disturbed and undisturbed stands of papyrus Cyperus papyrus were compared. Point counts, corrected for different probabilities of detection in different swamps, suggested that the species richness of bird communities in stands of papyrus disturbed by burning, grazing or pollution was higher than in nearby stands that were not disturbed. However, there were fewer species and individuals of highly specialized birds or species characteristic of papyrus, in disturbed stands than in undisturbed swamps. At &lt; i ha-1, the density of Papyrus Gonolek Laniarius mufumbiri in Ugandan swamps was, for example, significantly lower in polluted and burnt sites than in undisturbed papyrus where up to 13 ha-1 were recorded in the centre of swamps. White-winged Swamp Warbler Bradypterus carpalis was only recorded in undisturbed papyrus. In the papyrus that fringes Lake Naivasha in Kenya, outside the geographical range of species restricted to papyrus, disturbance in the form of grazing selects against species classified as swamp-reliant. Species classified as generalist users of papyrus were much less sensitive to disturbance than specialists. The density of swamp specialists was also lower near the edge of swamps, where total species richness was higher. These results are discussed in relation to conservation management of papyrus swamps in East Africa.},

abstract={The effect of food supply on the Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus breeding density and productivity was investigated by comparing the pattern of annual changes in prey abundance in habitats with declining vs. stable woodpecker populations. In a bumt area of eastern Finland, where the woodpecker breeding population has been continuously diminishing, following a major increase the first year after fire, only the abundance of spruce bark beetles (Col., Scolytidae) (the woodpecker autumnspring main insect prey) decreased through the years. Conversely, the abundance of longhorn beetles (Col., Cerambycidae) (the nestling main food supply) increased dramatically. On the other hand, in neighbouring old-growth patches where one pair was breeding annually, abundance of spruce bark and longhorn beetles did not change significantly between years, although the abundance level ofthe bark beetles differed among patches. Hence, my results suggest the woodpecker breeding population to be limited by food supply available outside the breeding season, as shown for other forest bird species. The finding, however, that woodpeckers breeding 6-7 years after the fire reared larger broods than earlier pairs, while brood size did not change annually under old-growth conditions, suggests longhorn beetle availability to be critical to reproductive success.},

abstract={The primary purpose for developing a plant community classification is to provide information on plant communities useful to conservation planning and ecological management (Grossman et al. 1994). Plant community classifications define groups of plants that share biotic similarities and abiotic, system process, and structural characteristics. This is done by grouping plants by species composition and community structure, overlain on physical features and ecosystem parameters. In Arkansas, the blackland ecosystem includes prairie-savanna, woodland, and forest types (Foti et al., this volume). These plant communities are being classified using the system developed by the Nature Conservancy (Grossman et al. 1998) in cooperation with state, federal, and academic partners (Foti et al. 1994). The Nature Conservancy classifi cation is a modified version of the UNESCO vegetation classification system (UNESCO 1973). This national classification has been developed to present a consistent framework for conserving and stewarding biodiversity. An objective of the Nature Conservancy and many state-based natural heritage programs is identification and conservation of representative examples of all natural plant community types (TNC 1996). Plant communities can also be used as a coarse filter approach in planning the conservation of biological diversity. Plant community descriptions with ecosystem information can be useful in developing management regimes that maintain biodiversity across the landscape by incorporating relatively large-scale ecosystem process models during the planning process. Ecosystem transition models can be used in the restoration of degraded natural communities. The spatial arrangement of plant communities on the landscape can be used to interpret gaps in the landscape picture where plant communities are no longer extant. With this information it may be possible to conserve much of the natural diversity of an area through strategic conservation planning and ecological management. As part of a conservation initiative for Arkansas's blackland ecosystem that includes land acquisition, ecological restoration, and stewardship, plant community descriptions were developed across the range of abiotic variation. The plant community descriptions include spatial models of community relationship to other plant communities, soil, moisture, topography, and fire regimes. A model of ecosystem dynamics was also developed. © 2003 by University of Alabama Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The suite of birds associated with naturally occurring shrublands and early successional forests in the northeastern US accounts for about 15% of the total species diversity of the breeding avifauna of the region. Most of the species in this habitat suite are common to abundant in occurrence with moderate to high relative abundance in the region. The shrubland suite of birds contributes a relatively large number of individuals but a relatively small proportion (15%) of the total bird species to the avian diversity of the region. The primary risks to long-term persistence of this suite of birds in the northeastern US include long-term population declines associated with long-term declines in amounts of early successional forest and naturally occurring shrubland habitats in the region (currently <15% of the land area). Many shrubland birds also have relatively high proportions of their total breeding populations occurring in the region, indicating the importance of the northeastern US to maintaining source populations of these species. Partners in Flight (PIF), a cooperative bird conservation organization seeking to maintain populations of North American landbirds has developed bird conservation plans for 12 geographic planning units, called physiographic areas, in the northeastern US. In 10 of these 12 physiographic areas, the shrubland suite of birds is considered either a high or moderate priority for conservation action. Most shrubland birds can be considered species of conservation responsibility rather than species of immediate concern. Species of conservation responsibility require long-term conservation planning and population monitoring to ensure that adequate habitat will be maintained and long-term threats eliminated. Fifteen shrubland bird species (45% of the habitat suite) were identified as species of conservation responsibility in the region. In comparison, 40% of the grassland suite and 34% of the forest suite of birds were identified through the PIF plans as species of conservation responsibility in the region. Therefore, the PIF plans indicate that the suite of shrubland birds should receive a high degree of conservation attention within the northeastern US. Using the concept of historic range of variation, managing 10-15% of the landscape for early successional habitat might provide adequate habitat for maintaining minimal populations of shrubland birds in the region, but a greater percentage will be needed if population increases are desired for birds associated with early successional habitats.},

abstract={We studied bird density and nesting success on utility rights-of-way (ROW) managed primarily by selective herbicide application in New York, Massachusetts and Maine. For comparison, we also estimated bird density in ROW managed by cutting in New Hampshire and New York and in shrublands managed by fire in the Finger Lakes National Forest (FLNF), New York. On herbicide-managed ROW, we detected a mean of 14.3 individuals and 12.2 species per point count, including many species of early-succession habitat that are declining throughout northeastern United States. Nesting success in forested landscapes of New York, Maine, and Massachusetts was 55% on the ROW, 69% in forests within 20 m of the ROW, and 63% in forests more than 20 m from the ROW. Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitized 5.3% of the nests and reduced host recruitment by even less. This suggests that ROW in forested areas support high production of shrubland birds and do not exert a measurably harmful effect on forest-nesting birds. Selective herbicide application on ROW sustained shrubland vegetation and supported high densities and high nesting success. Mechanical cutting lowered the structural diversity of vegetation the following spring and was associated with fewer individual birds and species. Cool burns in early spring produced a high structural diversity of herbs, shrubs and trees and supported a high density of birds and bird species. Long-term maintenance of shrublands by burning will require Supplemental cutting to remove saplings. As reforestation continues to reduce shrubland habitat, probably below pre-colonial levels, active management for early-succession habitat will be necessary to sustain current population levels of numerous species. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In 1985 new silvicultural prescriptions for managing jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in south-west Western Australia came into operation. The most extreme logging treatment (gap release) involved removal of most of the overstorey from patches no larger than 10 ha, followed by a regeneration fire. In the other logging treatment (shelterwood), less wood was removed from a larger area, also followed by a fire. This study examined the impact of these disturbances on the avifauna by monitoring species richness and abundance of birds one year before logging, one year before burning, and for five years after burning. Although 68 bird species were recorded during the seven years of the study, 29 of these were detected fewer than 15 times. Of the other 39 bird species recorded, only two (Gerygone fusca and Acanthiza apicalis) showed a statistically significant treatment effect over time on their abundance. The abundance of G. fusca initially declined in the disturbed treatments and by Year 7 of the study (5 years post-fire) in the gap-release treatment had not recovered its original abundance. A. apicalis increased its abundance in both shelterwood and gap-release treatments. By Year 7, both species in the logged treatments had abundances similar to those in the unlogged treatments. Total abundance of all species varied little across treatments. Species richness was highest by Year 7 in the shelterwood and lowest in the gap-release treatment. In some years community structure varied more at the external-reference sites (not recently logged or burnt) than at the gap-release sites. In particular, there was little overlap in community structure in the external-reference treatment between the first and final years, whereas the pre-logging and final year in the gap-release treatment showed a high degree of overlap. These differences are suggestive of overriding short-term annual variation in broad-scale factors rather than local factors. Yearly variation in rainfall and temperature was documented; during low rainfall periods, populations of foliage arthropods may have been reduced.},

abstract={In 1992, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry adopted a new forest management practice known as even-aged reproduction with reservation (EAR), which replaces clearcutting on state forestlands. The EAR guidelines mandate the retention of at least 12 trees/ha and 24-36 m 2/ha of basal area, representing a diversity of overstory and understory species. During summer 1998, we compared the temporal (breeding season vs. midsummer) and spatial (edge versus interior) use of EAR stands by birds. In addition, we compared observed vs. expected use of overstory trees in EAR stands. In each often representative EAR stands, we sampled birds twice per season along two-edge and two-interior transects. Total species richness and abundance (all species combined), species richness and abundance of ground-shrub foragers, and species richness of canopy-sallier foragers were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the breeding season than in mid-summer. Eight of 20 common bird species analyzed also were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more abundant during the breeding season (e.g., black-and-white warbler and chestnut-sided warbler), and one species was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more abundant during mid-summer. Total species richness, total abundance, and abundance of ground-shrub foragers were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in interiors compared to edges of EAR stands. Five species also were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more abundant in interiors of EAR stands, whereas no species was more common in edges. All species combined and three foraging guilds showed differential use (P &lt; 0.05) of overstory tree species; eight species also differed significantly in their use of abundant tree species. Based on our findings, we believe that EAR stands are excellent substitutes for clearcuts on state forestlands, although we caution that our findings were based only on one yr of data. We recommend the continued retention of a diversity of overstory trees, especially snags and rough-barked trees, in both edges and interiors of EAR stands for use by a variety of bird species during both the breeding season and mid-summer.},

One area had been unintentionally burned 4 years prior and selectively harvested (DIS) 1 year prior to sampling. A second area had been selectively harvested 1 year prior to sampling and had no recent history of fire (HAR). Species richness, as assessed by species-time curves and rarefaction, was higher in both altered areas than in undisturbed forest (INT). In general, frugivores and omnivores were more abundant in both altered areas compared to intact forest. Canopy frugivores, understory omnivores and multiple-strata omnivores were most abundant in HAR. Canopy frugivores, near-ground insectivores, understory and multiple-strata omnivores were least abundant in INT, although INT had the highest abundances of canopy insectivores and near-ground omnivores. Richness and abundance of widespread species with low habitat specificity was higher in both areas that experienced disturbance compared to intact forest. Differences in bird community structure between disturbed and intact forest at this site are attributed primarily to the addition of widespread species with less narrow habitat requirements, and possibly to changes in the distribution of different food types.},

This paper summarizes the results of a 5-year study on the annual composition, richness, diversity and population density of the bird community at Oussudu. A GIS database was developed on the basis of field surveys and allied studies. 3. The study reveals a declining trend in the number and diversity of the birds found at Oussudu with the exception of herons, egrets, plovers and lapwings. A relationship appears to exist between this decline in bird diversity and an increase in illegal fishing, cattle grazing, encroachments and pollution. These factors may have contributed to the decline of food and shelter for the birds. 4.

abstract={1. In the deserts of the south-western United States of America, as in many ecoregions around the world, invasion of non-native plants is modifying the structure and composition of riparian vegetation. 2. Restoration of native plant species frequently proves to be ecologically and economically difficult. In the Muddy River drainage in the Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA), eradication of one the most aggressive invasive plants, Tamarix ramosissima (salt-cedar), often reduces the structural and compositional diversity of the remaining vegetation. This can have negative effects on native animals, including birds. 3. The objectives of our work were (i) to examine relationships between avian diversity and measures of vegetational diversity (species richness, dominance of non-native plants and vegetation structure [total vegetation volume]), (ii) to explore the extent to which avian community composition was associated with vegetation composition (floristics) or vegetation structure (physiognomy), and (iii) to consider the potential effects of alternative land management and ecological restoration strategies on the biodiversity of birds and other native fauna in watersheds in the arid south-western USA. 4. Species richness of all birds and of breeding birds was best modelled by total vegetation volume alone. Neither species richness of plants nor dominance of non-native plants had a statistically significant effect on species richness, abundance or evenness of birds. 5. Species composition of birds between sites was more similar when floristics was more similar, and vice versa. Species composition of birds was not correlated with physiognomy. 6. Species richness of native birds in the Muddy River drainage appears not to suffer from invasion of non-native plants, provided that the vegetational community retains sufficient structural diversity. 7. The composition of the bird community is closely related to floristics, and other taxonomic groups may exhibit different responses to vegetation structure and composition. Therefore, explicit strategies for landscape-scale management, restoration and maximization of native faunal diversity should consider how removal of invasive plants may affect physiognomy and floristics of the vegetational community as a whole.},

abstract={The longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem of the southeastern United States is among the most heavily degraded of all ecosystems. Less than 1% of the original longleaf pine forests remain as old-growth stands. Eglin Air Force Base (Eglin) in northwest Florida contains the largest remaining extent of longleaf pine, but much of this habitat has been degraded through fire suppression, selective logging, and planting off-site species of pines. We examined the distribution of bird species among habitats during spring and fall 1994-1995 to assess the influence of large-scale habitat restoration on bird communities across the landscape. During both spring and fall, species richness and relative abundance of neotropical migrants were greatest in oak hammocks and riparian habitats. During spring, the abundance of resident species was greatest in barrier island scrub and flatwoods, but species richness of residents also was high in oak hammocks. During fall, both species richness and abundance of residents were greatest in oak hammocks and flatwoods. Analyses of abundance for individual species (both neotropical migrants and residents) suggested that each habitat examined was important for ≥1 species. An analysis examining the importance of habitats for conservation found that oak hammocks and riparian habitats were important for species of high management concern, but burned sandhills along with oak hammocks and riparian habitats were very important for species of the greatest management concern. Our results suggest that habitat modifications resulting from restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem will benefit many species of management concern. Bird species negatively affected by habitat modifications for longleaf pine restoration were abundant in other habitats.},

abstract={The occurrence of large burnt areas has increased considerably in southern Europe in recent years. In order to design management plans to prevent large wildfires while preserving biodiversity, understanding of the ways in which birds respond to these fires is required. We investigated the spatial variability of both avifauna and habitat structure in three zones: unburnt, burnt in 1982, and burnt in 1994. The habitat structure of the unburnt zone was the most variable spatially. However, bird species composition between sampling points was very homogeneous in space. In contrast, the bird communities inhabiting burnt zones were more spatially heterogeneous. This pattern was caused by distinct specific responses to variations in habitat structure. Open-space species responded to small changes in habitat structure with large changes in local abundance, whereas the response of forest species to these structural variations was much less. We suggest that land managers should select specific zones with limited vegetation recovery within large burnt areas and maintain them as open space to keep combustibility low and provide an appropriate habitat for several open space species that are of conservation concern.},

abstract={Karakelang, largest of the Talaud Islands, Indonesia, was visited in 1999 with the aim of producing population estimates of globally threatened and Restricted-range bird species. Density estimates were calculated from primary forest and secondary habitats using the variable circular plot method. Eight of the nine restricted-range or threatened species resident on Karakelang were recorded and density estimates calculated for five of these. Two species of rail are endemic to Karakelang, Talaud Bush-hen Amaurornis magnirostris and Talaud Rail Gymnocrex talaudensis. The bush-hen was encountered in secondary habitat but occurred at higher densities in primary forest and the estimated population was 2,350-9,560 birds. The less vocal, cryptic G. talaudensis was noted just twice, in primary forest close to rivers. Both have small populations, are threatened by habitat degradation, hunting, and possibly predation by introduced rats and should be classified as threatened. Population densities of the Endangered, endemic Red-and-blue Lory Eos histrio had remained stable since the last survey in 1997. They occurred at higher densities in primary forest, but were also common in human-made habitats. The estimated population was 8,230-21,400 birds, threatened by habitat loss and trapping for the wild bird trade. Although more commonly encountered in forest, the Near Threatened Blue-naped Parrot Tanygnathus lucionensis was found at higher densities in secondary habitats, and the population was estimated at 8,130-20,700 birds. The Restricted-range Blue-tailed Imperial Pigeon D. concinna was very common on Karakelang (14,500-27,700 birds), whilst the Vulnerable Grey Imperial Pigeon D. pickeringii was recorded rarely; both species were more frequently recorded in primary forest. The endemic Talaud Kingfisher Halcyon enigma occurred at low densities (5,290-8,690 birds), in primary forest and adjacent disturbed areas. It is heavily dependent on primary forest and threatened by habitat loss, and should be classified as Vulnerable. Approximately 350 km2 of primary forest on Karakelang is protected, 250 km2 as a wildlife reserve. However, at present, management is absent and forest is threatened by agricultural encroachment, illegal logging, and fire. Given that all endemic and threatened species were encountered more frequently or occurred at higher densities in primary forests, future conservation efforts should target these protected areas. Management of reserves should involve local stakeholders from government and representatives of island communities. Wildlife trade is a major threat to Eos histrio and strict enforcement of the species' protected status should include monitoring of roost sites, patrols of harbours and markets in Talaud, Sulawesi and the Philippines, and the control of Philippine fishing boats involved in the wild bird trade. Further species-specific research and monitoring is also required.},

abstract={We examined response of breeding bird communities to timber harvest in riparian areas using two harvest techniques (full tree harvest and cut-to-length (CTL)) along first to third order streams in northern Minnesota, USA. Although many studies have quantified bird response to riparian buffer harvest, we are unaware of any study that examined the response of breeding birds to riparian forest harvest using different cutting practices. We compared community composition, total abundance and species richness, as well as abundance of six individual species on plots within four treatments (three plots/treatment) completed within 30 m on both sides of the stream. Treatments in the riparian area (30 m on both sides of the stream) were: (1) riparian control (no harvest); (2) reduction of basal area to an average of 7-10 m2/ha with full tree harvest system; (3) reduction of basal area to an average of 7-10 m2/ha with CTL harvest system; and (4) control (no harvest in riparian area or upland). For treatments 1, 2, and 3, adjacent upland forests on the plots were clearcut. Bird surveys were completed 1 year prior to, and 3 years after harvest and revealed a significant response of the bird community to timber harvest in the riparian area. Bird communities were most affected by tree removal with both harvest methods, but harvest type also affected bird communities. Early-successional species, e.g. song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), mourning warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), and chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica) were associated with harvested plots, whereas forest species, e.g. scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea) and black-throated green warbler (Dendroica virens) were associated with riparian control and control plots. Of six individual species tested for response to riparian harvest treatment over time, only the ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) showed a significant time by treatment interaction. Ovenbird numbers decreased in both the CTL and full tree harvest plots through 2000, when no individuals were observed. Two other forest-dependent species, black-throated green warbler and hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus), showed similar responses to treatment as the ovenbird. The winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) responded positively to the greater amount of slash that was left on-plot with the CTL harvest system. However, with the exception of the winter wren, we found that bird species and communities did not differ in their response to harvest system. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The conservation of biological diversity (biodiversity) is becoming an integral part of the sustainable management of forest- and agro-ecosystems. A vital part of these systems is weed control, or vegetation management, to enhance crop production. Because of its widespread use and environmental compatibility, this review was designed to evaluate glyphosate herbicide in terms of: (i) its role as a disturbance agent and (ii) a measure of its impact on species diversity of terrestrial plants and animals. Our analyses were based on 60 published studies of terrestrial plants and animals in temperate zone forest- and agro-ecosystems. Species richness and diversity of vascular plants was either unaffected or increased, particularly herbaceous species, in response to glyphosate. Responses of plant species in forest ecosystems differ from those in agro-ecosystems where glyphosate is used to repeatedly reduce non-crop vegetation in most situations. Richness and diversity of songbirds appeared little affected by glyphosate-induced habitat alteration. In studies on small mammal communities and glyphosate use, none found significant reductions in species richness or diversity. As for avian responses, some small mammal species declined temporarily whereas others increased in abundance. The impact of glyphosate on large mammalian herbivores was measured by abundance of animals and food plants and by habitat use. Hares (Lepus spp. L.) and deer (Odocoileus spp. Rafinesque and Capreolus capreolus L.) were little affected, whereas reductions in plant biomass and related moose (Alces alces L.) forage and habitat use generally occur for 1-5 years after treatment. Studies on terrestrial invertebrates covered a wide range of taxa with variable responses in abundance to glyphosate treatments. The magnitude of observed changes in mean species richness and diversity of vascular plants, birds, and small mammals, from the effects of herbicide treatment, were within the mean values of natural fluctuations of these variables. The biological significance of this impact is limited to shifts in species composition based on changes in floral composition and structure of habitats. Management for a mosaic of habitats within forest and agricultural landscapes, which provide a range of conditions for plant and animal species, should help ameliorate the short-term changes in species composition accompanying vegetation management with glyphosate.},

abstract={Identifying areas with relevant features of biodiversity is useful to rank priorities for strengthening the design of well-sited natural protected areas and to optimize resource investment in conservation. This study provides decision makers critical tools for highlighting pieces of land worthy of conservation in Spain. We studied four taxa - amphibians, reptiles, nesting birds and mammals - in a 50 x 50 km grid (n = 259 cells). We used five criteria for identifying areas of high-value diversity: species richness, rarity, vulnerability, a combined index of biodiversity, and a Standardized Biodiversity Index that measured all four taxa together. As far as we know, the combined index of biodiversity and the Standardized Biodiversity Index are original. Areas of high-value diversity were defined as those cells within the 15% top segment of ranked values for the different criteria. Congruence of areas of high-value diversity for taxa pairs was moderate to low, and averaged 38.5% for areas of high-value diversity based on the combined index of biodiversity. The performance based on the average proportion of threatened species excluded from areas of high-value diversity followed the rank combined index of biodiversity = rarity (0.3%) &gt; vulnerability (9.9%) &gt; species richness (13.8%). The areas of high-value diversity identified according to the Standardized Biodiversity Index included all amphibian and mammal species, all but one reptile species (categorized as rare) and all but six bird species (three of which were categorized as threatened). About 70% of the areas of high-value diversity identified based on the Standardized Biodiversity Index included natural protected areas. However, they average only 274.6 km 2, thus occupying a small fraction of the areas of high-value diversity, and there is no guarantee that the species found in an area of high-value diversity site will be present in its protected fraction. Consequently, we urge managers of natural protected areas to conduct diversity surveys. We also urge that additional natural protected areas be established to include the gap of 30% of areas of high-value diversity not currently protected. We took an step for biodiversity conservation planning in the studied region, and discuss the usefulness of maps of areas of high-value diversity for conservation, ecological restoration, and environmental impact assessment and mitigation. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The maintenance of grasslands as distinct habitats depends on regular management, usually through grazing or mowing, but their species diversity is known to decline with increasing management intensity. The reduction of management intensity can be a useful tool for the long-term conservation of the biological diversity of grasslands. We analyzed floral and faunal diversity on intensively and extensively (unintensively) grazed pastures and on 5- to 10-year-old ungrazed grasslands in northern Germany. Each of the three grassland habitats differing in grazing intensity was replicated six times. We related diverse taxa such as grasshoppers, butterfly adults and lepidopteran larvae, and trap-nesting solitary bees and wasps to vegetation structure. There was an increase of species richness and abundance from pastures to ungrazed grasslands. The percentage of parasitism of the most abundant trap-nesting species, the digger-wasp (Trypoxylon figulus), was also higher on ungrazed grasslands. Decreased grazing on pastures enhanced species richness for adult butterflies only, whereas the abundance of adult butterflies, solitary bees and wasps, and their natural enemies increased. Although the differences in insect diversity between pastures and ungrazed grassland could be attributed to a greater vegetation height and heterogeneity (bottom-up effects) on ungrazed areas, the differences between intensively and extensively grazed pastures could not be explained by changes in vegetation characteristics. Hence, intensive grazing appeared to affect the insect communities through the disruption of plant-insect interactions. A mosaic of extensively grazed grassland and grassland left ungrazed for a few years may be a good means by which to maintain biodiversity and the strength of trophic interactions.},

abstract={We investigated the composition and distribution of bird assemblages in the continuous Pilliga woodlands of northwest New South Wales in relation to floristic assemblages and disturbance (logging, fire and grazing) patterns. Box-ironbark woodlands contained high densities of White Cypress Pine Callitris glaucophylla and Narrow-leaved Ironbark Eucalyptus crebra, had a sparse, depauperate understorey, and were associated with frequent, intense logging and infrequent fires (due to fire exclusion and the use of grazing for fuel reduction). Box-ironbark woodlands were characterized by high frequencies of 12 bird species that occurred throughout the Pilliga and low frequencies of many other species. Blakely's Red Gum E. blakelyi woodlands typical of creeks and Broad-leaved Ironbark E. fibrosa woodlands typical of poor soils contained lower densities or smaller trees of C. glaucophylla and E. crebra, had a moderately dense, diverse understorey, and were associated with infrequent low-intensity logging and moderately frequent wildfire. Bird species assemblages of Broad-leaved Ironbark woodlands were similar to those of box-ironbark woodlands. Blakely's Red Gum woodlands were characterized by 36 bird species that were virtually absent from box-ironbark and Broad-leaved Ironbark woodlands, including 10 threatened and declining species. The 10 are among 48 woodland species that are known or thought to be declining and that are dependent on woodlands with mature trees and grassy or patchy grass/shrub understorey. We conclude that these species have declined in the Pilliga and will continue to decline under existing disturbance regimes, particularly in box-ironbark woodlands. We suggest adaptive management strategies for maintaining and rehabilitating their habitats.},

abstract={Ecological relationships between wildlife conservation and farm management provide common ground for the enhancement of bird habitat and the natural suppression of pests on farmland. We compared bird populations in 15 paired organic and nonorganic sites (cornfields plus edges, 30 sites total) that were similar in environment and edge habitat but that differed in use of fertilizers, herbicides, cultivation, and crop rotations. At each site, we used one strip transect to sample birds and vegetation in the bordering edge and cornfield perimeter (0-25 m from the edge) and another to sample in the cornfield (50-150 m from the edge). During the 1995 and 1996 growing seasons, we recorded 54 bird species, 51 in organic and 39 in nonorganic sites. On average, bird abundance on organic sites was 2.6 times higher than on nonorganic sites, and mean species richness per visit was 2.0 times greater. When analyzed separately, organic edge, perimeter, and field transects supported higher bird abundance and greater richness than did their nonorganic counterparts. Abundance and richness were higher on organic sites for insectivores, omnivores, and granivores, and for each of three migratory groups. Twelve species were individually more abundant on organic sites, and one regularly observed species was observed only on organic sites. No species had greater abundance on nonorganic sites. More non-crop vegetation on organic cornfields, most likely a result of no herbicide use, may have provided better foraging opportunities for birds. The plant food, cover, and invertebrate prey in organic cornfields appeared to augment birds not only in the field but also in the uncropped edges. Organic fields appear to benefit birds, but reproductive success needs further study. Modifying farm-management practices, especially near field edges where bird activity is concentrated, may enhance the conservation of birds and their potential predation on crop pests.},

abstract={We examined the impact of single-tree selective logging and fuel reduction burns on the abundance of hollow-nesting bird species at a regional scale in southeastern Queensland, Australia. Data were collected on species abundance and habitat structure of dry sclerophyll production forest at 36 sites with known logging and fire histories. Sixteen bird species were recorded with most being resident, territorial, obligate hollow nesters that used hollows that were either small (<10 cm diameter) or very large (>18 cm diameter). Species densities were typically low, but combinations of two forest management and three habitat structural variables influenced the abundances of eight bird species in different and sometimes conflicting ways. The results suggest that habitat tree management for biodiversity in production forests cannot depend upon habitat structural characteristics alone. Management histories appear to have independent influence (on some bird species) that are distinguishable from their impacts on habitat structure per se. Rather than managing to maximize species abundances to maintain biodiversity, we may be better off managing to avoid extinctions of populations by identifying thresholds of acceptable fluctuations in populations of not only hollow-nesting birds but other forest dependent wild-life relative to scientifically valid forest management and habitat structural surrogates.},

abstract={1. The maintenance or modification of grazing regimes is frequently advocated to deliver conservation targets in pastoral landscapes, but there are few quantitative studies of the effects of grazing on upland birds. This is particularly true with respect to grazing management in agri-environment schemes. 2. Numbers of black grouse Tetrao tetrix and their breeding success were therefore monitored at 20 sites in the north of England from 1996 to 2000. Ten treatment sites included areas where grazing was reduced before and during the study to &lt; 1·1 sheep ha-1 in summer and &lt; 0·5 sheep ha-1 in winter. Each was paired with a reference site that held sheep at two (summer) to three times (winter) the density on the experimental sites. The reduced grazing sites ranged from 0·4 to 3·2 km2 in size and most were part of existing agreements within agri-environment schemes that had been in place for 1-5 years before 1996. 3. Numbers of black grouse males displaying increased by an average of 4·6% (SE = 2·1) year-1 at the 10 sites with reduced grazing. Displaying male trends differed significantly between treatment and normally grazed reference sites, where numbers declined annually on average by 1·7% (SE = 1·4). 4. Summer black grouse hen densities showed the greatest rate of increase where grazing was restricted on smaller areas of ground (0·4 km2). Declines occurred at sites where the area of restricted grazing exceeded about 1 km2. The rates of change in population density, as indicated by numbers of displaying males, peaked in the early years of grazing reduction and then declined after c. 5-7 years. 5. The proportion of females that retained broods during the late chick-rearing period was 54% (SE = 0·06) at sites with reduced grazing, significantly greater than the 32% (SE = 0·06) at normally grazed reference sites. There was no difference in the size of broods between grazing treatments. 6. This study demonstrates that agri-environment schemes, which encourage extensive management of grazing land, can benefit at least some organisms of conservation importance and lead to some recovery of populations. There is a need, however, for further understanding of how such benefits can be maintained at a landscape scale and over the greater time scales involved in vegetation dynamics and bird population processes.},

abstract={Common reed is increasingly harvested from the Mediterranean region to provide thatching material to north European countries. The impact of these management practices on the fauna is poorly known. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of reed cutting in the Mediterranean region through a comparative analysis of water regime, vegetation structure, arthropod distribution and passerine assemblage at cut and uncut reedbeds in southern France. Cut reedbeds were characterised by a lower salinity, higher water level in spring, and higher reed biomass than uncut reedbeds. Arthropod distribution differed consistently between cut and uncut sites, leading to a higher index of food available to passerines in cut reedbeds. Cut reedbeds had a similar bird species richness but a lower bird abundance, due to the significant decrease in Moustached Warblers and Bearded Tits at cut sites. The mild Mediterranean winter favoured early growth of reed in spring, making harvested reedbeds suitable for breeding of long-distance migrants such as the Great Reed Warbler and Reed Warbler. However, for the resident species that breed earlier in the season, cut reedbeds presumably lack sufficient vegetation cover to provide adequate nesting and feeding sites. Although biennial cutting (double wale) is considered as a good compromise between conservation and commercial interests in the UK, the juxtaposition of annually cut and never cut reed patches appears as the only sustainable alternative for the Mediterranean region. We further hypothesise that an optimal mosaic design of cut/uncut reed patches could provide as high a conservation value as unmanaged reedbeds.},

abstract={Wildfires play a key role in shaping the boreal forest landscape, yet the response of wildlife to the patchy mosaics they create is poorly understood. We studied songbirds 5-6 years post-fire in a large burn (9600 ha) in the boreal mixedwood forest of north-eastern Alberta. In the spring of 1995 and 1996 we estimated abundance of songbirds in four areas, each with four replicate sites: unburned patches within the fire (Isolates); burned patches (Burns); patches that had been clear-cut prior to burning by wildfire (Cut-Burns); and the unburned, continuous forest adjacent to the burn (Peripherals). We also sampled shrub-based arthropods with sweep-nets at each site. To investigate the role of Isolates, we compared them to Peripherals and to Burns. We compared Cut-Burns to Burns to examine the effect of logging prior to burning. In general, Isolates supported higher numbers of species and individuals than Peripherals, mainly due to higher numbers of aerial-foraging birds. Isolates and Burns had similar species richness and abundance, but Burns supported more aerial foragers while Isolates had more foliage gleaners. Cut-Burns generally supported fewer individuals than Burns, in particular fewer shrub-nesters, aerial foragers, and neotropical migrants. More bird species reached their highest densities in Burns than in any other area. Songbird species richness and abundance were positively related to dry arthropod biomass, with Burns and Isolates having the highest arthropod biomass. These patterns indicated that, 5-6 years post-burn, the patchy mosaic created by this wildfire supported more species than the mature forest surrounding the fire. Clear-cut logging prior to burning resulted in a diminished songbird community compared to that found in burned stands.},

abstract={We studied the populations of breeding birds in five reference stands of natural mixedwood forest and 11 conifer plantations up to 21-years old in southern New Brunswick, Canada. Variations of the distribution and abundance of birds were related to changes in the plant-species composition and structural attributes of their habitat. Bird species occurred in plantations in levels of abundance and diversity similar to that of reference forest, although community composition was highly dissimilar. Species of reference stands were typical of mature, mixedwood forest. Species of younger plantations were typical of open, early successional, upland habitats. Once the plantations became older than 13 years and the tree height exceeded about 5 m, birds typical of conifer forest began to invade the habitat, resulting in a mixed-species composition. Although cavity-containing snags were rare in the plantations, if they did occur in them or near their edge they were used by hole-nesting birds. Although we could not study a complete rotation, the field data and habitat trajectory suggest that the plantations will not support some elements of the avian biodiversity of the natural forest in the study area. The mature plantations will be highly depauperate in coarse-woody debris, snags, and cavities, and will not support species dependent on these critical habitat elements. In addition, birds requiring habitat containing trees of larger size and of various species, including hardwoods, will not find the mature plantations to be suitable. To accommodate the needs of species potentially at risk from the extensive development of plantations, the following changes in forestry management practices should be instituted: (1) retention of natural cavity-trees, snags, coarse-woody debris, and hardwood trees and shrubs in residual non-harvested "islands" within clear-cuts and plantations; (b) retention of a patchy angiosperm component by leaving some areas untreated during herbicide applications; and (c) setting aside large areas of natural forest as non-harvested protected areas. Although we believe that these mitigations would help sustain elements of indigenous biodiversity that are at risk in an extensive industrial forest, we stress that these predictions would have to be tested through additional research and monitoring.},

abstract={I examined the lingering effects of past timber management practices on the vegetation structure and bird community of Kibale National Park, Uganda. I compared four forest treatments: unlogged native forest (UL), two that were selectively logged at low (LL) and high (HL) intensities in the 1960s, and a conifer plantation (PL). Forest-dependent birds were best represented at UL. LL was similar to UL in both vegetation structure and bird community composition, although some forest-dependent bird species were missing from the former. HL had significantly less canopy closure and lower tree density than other plots as a result of the combination of extensive secondary damage and natural disturbance patterns that prevented the reclosure of the forest canopy. Thirty-one percent of the forest-dependent bird species observed during the study were not detected at HL. At PL, bird species richness and bird abundance were about a third of those observed in other plots. There were significant correlations between heterogeneity of tree distribution (horizontal heterogeneity) and abundance and species richness of birds across plots. Abundance and species richness of all, forest-dependent, and forest generalist birds were highest in plots with intermediate measures of horizontal heterogeneity, which were mostly unlogged or lightly logged. If reduced-impact logging practices are not implemented during selective logging operations in tropical forests, consequent long-term changes in vegetation structure may result in significant declines in the populations of some forest-dependent species, as was observed in Kibale National Park. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Probability of detection was positively correlated with area for 11 bird species and negatively correlated with area for 8 species. Thus, along Big and Little Darby creeks, woodland area appeared to better predict bird-species presence than woodland width. The proposed Little Darby National Wildlife Refuge located within the study area includes restoration of riparian forest habitat along the two creeks. If the riparian habitat zones are not sufficient in area, already common species, rather than declining Neotropical migrants, may be the only species to benefit from restoration efforts.},

In each of four blocks, we established four experimental units: (1) DCWD removed, (2) snags and DCWD removed, and (3) and (4) unmodified control plots. We quantified vegetation layers to determine their effects on the experimental outcome. Total breeding bird abundance, abundance of resident species, breeding bird diversity, breeding species richness, and abundance of Great Crested Flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus) were reduced by the removal of DCWD and snags. Total woodpecker and Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) breeding territories were reduced by snag removal Weak excavating and secondary cavity-nesting species, Neotropical migrants, and Eastern Towhees (Pipilio erythrophthalmus) had fewer breeding territories on plots where DCWD was removed. Red-headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) and midstory and canopy-nesting species were at lowest densities on plots where all CWD had been removed. The CWD removal had no effect on the nonbreeding bird community. Most breeding and nonbreeding species used habitats with sparse midstory and well-developed understory, whereas sparse canopy cover and dense midstory were important to some nonbreeding species. Snag and DCWD retention, and practices that maintain a dense understory and sparse midstory and canopy, will create favorable breeding habitat for many bird species of loblolly pine forests.},

abstract={Palaeoecological methods were used to study forest dynamics at stand and landscape scales in the Pechoro-Ilych Zapovednik in the Komi Republic in Russia. A survey of charcoal bands in peat deposits at 36 sites on a 160 km2 area showed that the greater part of the landscape has burnt regularly. Here the landscape is dominated by Scots pine on dry soil. There are, however, Norway spruce sites, with a high permanent water table and with tall herb vegetation without traces of fire. Stand-scale, high-resolution pollen studies at one pine and one spruce site were consistent with the landscape results. Charcoal bands and fire-driven succession were observed at the pine site, whilst the spruce site had no evidence of fire during at least the last 2600 years. This study shows that the main part of this natural landscape has been regularly affected by fire, but also that there are networks of stands at a landscape scale that form stable fire-free refuge with a continuous forest cover. The presence of such a strong contrast in disturbance regimes within one landscape has important implications for the management of biological diversity in forestry. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={The Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota are characterized by a complex history of both natural and human disturbance regimes. Historically, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities were characterized by frequent, cool ground fires. Intensive fire suppression and timber harvest throughout the past century have drastically altered the structure of existing forests. Today, much of the area has been harvested using shelterwood logging resulting in open even-aged stands. The goal of this study was to compare bird communities in treated (areas that have recently been harvested) and untreated (areas receiving minimal silvicultural treatment) in the past 40 yr. Of the 20 commonly observed bird species, 3 species [red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta Canadensis), brown creeper (Certhia Americana), and ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus)] were conspicuously less abundant in treated than in untreated stands. Eleven other species were more abundant in treated stands, while six species showed no response to treatment. Although bird species diversity and the abundance of birds were highest in treated stands, this does not imply that logging is beneficial to the entire bird community. The abundance of particular bird species may appear to have increased, but the composition of the bird community has been altered. As more of the forested areas are harvested, the bird community will shift from one with birds typical of both open pine and dense pine forest to one dominated by ground foraging species.},

Twelve of 13 bird species foraged selectively with respect to tree species. The Yellow-throated Warbler (Dendroica dominica) and Cerulean Warbler (D. cerulea) were the most selective species, whereas the Yellow-throated Vireo, Red-eyed Vireo, and Eastern Tufted Titmouse (Vireo flavifrons, V. olivaceus, and Baeolophus bicolor, respectively) were the least selective. Three tree species were strongly preferred by most of the bird community: kingnut hickory, bitternut hickory, and silver maple (Carya laciniosa, C. cordiformis, and Acer saccharinum, respectively). Less common bird species tended to be more selective foragers than the more abundant bird species. The four most preferred trees were relatively uncommon where we sampled. Heavy-seeded hickories are slow to recolonize forests traditionally restored with common oak species (Quercus spp.). Therefore, restoring floristically diverse floodplain forests by planting preferred heavy-seeded and uncommon trees will enhance habitat quality for birds in these forests.},

abstract={Fire is a key mechanism creating and maintaining habitat heterogeneity in Mediterranean landscapes by turning continuous woody landscapes into mosaics of forests and shrublands. Due to the long historical role of fires in the Mediterranean, we hypothesised a moderate negative effect of this type of perturbation on forest bird distribution at a landscape level. We conducted point bird censuses in Aleppo pine forest patches surrounded by burnt shrublands and studied the relationships between three ecological groups of bird species (forest canopy species, forest understorey species, and ubiquitous species) and the features of local habitat, whole patch and surrounding landscape. We used a multi-scale approach to assess the effects of landscape variables at increasing spatial scales on point bird richness. Regarding local habitat components, canopy species were positively associated with tall pines while understorey species with the cover of shrubs and plants from holm-oak forests. Forest birds were positively related to patch size and irregular forest shapes, that is, with high perimeter/size ratios. Thus, these species did not seem to perceive edges as low quality but rather favourable microhabitats. We did not detect any negative effect of isolation or cover of woodlands in the landscape on the presence of forest species after local habitat factors had been accounted for. Finally, only local habitat factors entered the model for ubiquitous species. We suggest that mosaic-like landscapes shaped by fires in the Mediterranean basin are not strongly associated with negative effects fragmentation on forest birds other than those related with habitat loss.},

abstract={Many farmland bird populations have exhibited marked declines in the last 20-30 years and there is growing evidence to link these declines to agricultural intensification. Field margin management is frequently proposed as a way of enhancing bird populations but there have been few attempts to assess the relative value of different management options. This paper aims to provide a preliminary assessment of the relative value of six different cereal field margin management practices in providing foraging habitats for farmland birds. It also briefly compares these with the benefits afforded by field and whole farm approaches such as set-aside and organic farming, to wildlife conservation on arable land. The field margins considered are: grass margins (separated into grass-only strips and grass/wildflower strips), naturally regenerated set-aside margins, uncropped wildlife strips, game cover crops and conservation headlands. Sympathetically managed field margins can provide a range of plant and invertebrate food resources for birds both in summer and winter. In general, the best winter food supplies (mainly seeds) will be provided by game cover crops and naturally regenerated rotational set-aside strips. The most abundant summer food supplies (invertebrates and seeds) will be provided by a diverse sward; grass/wildflower strips, uncropped wildlife strips and naturally regenerated rotational set-aside strips followed by conservation headlands. Field margin swards that are less diverse in terms of species composition and structural heterogeneity and that consequently support fewer invertebrates, can, nonetheless, provide higher quality foraging habitats for birds than an intensively managed crop up to the hedge base. A number of bird species such as yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) and tree sparrow (Passer montanus), prefer to forage in margins in winter and summer and many of the benefits of whole field approaches such as set-aside, overwinter stubbles and undersown cereals, could be gained from margins under the same management. Whole-field approaches are, however, required for boundary-avoiding species such as skylark (Alauda arvensis) and lapwing (Vanellus vanellus). Less is known about the use other birds make of margins, relative to their use of field centres in winter. Whole farm approaches such as organic farming, whilst being highly beneficial to birds, are likely to remain rather localised in the UK, whereas field margin management can be relatively easily incorporated into the farmed landscape on an extensive scale. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The farming landscape of eastern Canada is dotted with three main types of hedgerows: (1) natural woody, (2) planted woody and (3) herbaceous. The objective of this study was to compare the value of these habitats as a repository of plant biodiversity in agricultural areas of southern Quebec. The overall plant diversity was higher in natural hedgerows and they contained more plant species of conservation values than other hedgerow types. Plant species richness per quadrat was, however, higher in planted woody hedgerows, and together with the species composition, lead to the conclusion that planted hedgerows in their entirety consisted of an ecotone type of vegetation such as is found in field edges which usually support high plant diversity and productivity but where transient plant species predominate. Consequently, this study indicated that natural hedgerows fare better than planted hedgerows in terms of diversity of plants of conservation interest. In spite of that, planted woody hedgerows contained plant (and bird) species of some interest and should be favoured over more desolate herbaceous hedgerows. In areas where hedgerows were removed and are not re-establishing naturally, a mixture of deciduous trees and conifers should be encouraged in further windbreak planting programs so as to conciliate both the conservation and agronomic objectives. Furthermore, management practices should optimise the growth of establishing plants of conservation values.},

abstract={Riparian vegetation in western North America provides important habitat for breeding birds and valuable forage for grazing livestock. Whereas a number of studies have documented the response of riparian vegetation to the removal of cattle, few have experimentally evaluated specific grazing systems. We evaluated the responses of vegetation and breeding birds to two cycles of late-season (August-September) grazing followed by 34 months of rest on the Arapaho National Wildlife Refuge, Colorado. We used a before-and-after control-impact (BACI) design, with two control (ungrazed) and two treatment (grazed) pastures composing the experimental units. Vegetation characteristics and bird densities were quantified on sample plots prior to and following two cycles of the treatment. We found no statistical differences in vegetation change and few differences in bird-density change among pastures. Inspection of means for pastures, however, suggests that changes in shrub vigor and spatial pattern differed among ungrazed and grazed pastures and that changes in population density for three of the nine bird species and three guilds studied differed among pastures. Our results suggest that habitat for grazing-sensitive birds may be restored while still allowing late-season grazing, although the rate at which species are recovered will be slower than if all cattle are removed.},

abstract={The longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem is one of the most endangered ecosystems in the United States. Recent incentives have led to increased interest in longleaf pine restoration. These restoration efforts often emphasize reestablishing native groundcovers, yet there have been no studies that address the role of native groundcover on breeding bird communities within longleaf pine forests. Therefore, we studied breeding bird communities in mature longleaf pine stands with either native or disturbed groundcovers to determine the likely effects of groundcover reestablishment associated with longleaf pine reforestation. Avian species richness and diversity did not differ (P=0.823, P=0.571, respectively), and avian community similarity was high (Morisita's index=0.98) between native and disturbed groundcover. However, pine warblers (Dendroica pinus), gray catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis), eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) were more abundant (P≤0.10) in areas with native groundcover, whereas indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) were more abundant (P=0.058) in areas with disturbed groundcover. Although groundcover restoration may benefit some avian populations, overall avian species richness, diversity, and community composition may be unaffected. Restoration of native groundcover may be best justified for aesthetic values and as a tool to facilitate long-term stand management using prescribed fire.},

abstract={Coastal birch forests in northern Norway have over the last 50 years gradually been replaced with non-native spruce plantations. To investigate possible changes in bird communities, we compared species richness and composition in six forest types (mature spruce plantations, ecotones, mixed forests, and three birch forest types) in two regions over two years. In the southern region, birch forests tended to host a higher number of species than spruce plantations, but species composition differed between forest types. The species composition in rich birch forests was particularly distinguished from spruce plantations, but also from the less productive birch habitats. Furthermore, there were dissimilarities in species richness and composition between regions. Ground nesters and species nesting on their northern margins occurred most frequently in the southern region, whereas cavity-nesters were most abundant in the northern region. Some species declined in abundance from 1998 to 1999, whereas three species shifted their main distribution from birch forests to mixed forest/ecotones. Possible factors underlying these results are discussed. We recommend that researchers and managers pay attention to habitat qualities within forest types (i.e., other than tree species composition in overstory) as well as to regional variations in species assemblages when addressing outcomes of management practices.},

abstract={Are breeding bird communities beyond the Swiss border more diverse than those in Switzerland? We tested this hypothesis with data compiled for the second atlas project on the distribution of breeding birds in Switzerland. Based on 243 Swiss and 183 foreign 1-km squares laying within maximally 15 km on each side of the border at similar altitude, we compared species composition, distribution and density in the 1-km squares for 125 «widespread» species. Overall, we found (1) a smaller average number of bird species, but the same territory density, and (2) fewer species of the Swiss Red List as well as a smaller territory density of Red List species in the Swiss border squares compared to those abroad. These differences hold for the borderland of western Switzerland and France and northern Switzerland and Germany, respectively. In contrast, no differences at all were found between southern Switzerland and Italy, whereas eastern Switzerland differed from Austria only in having a higher territory density. Species composition of domestic and foreign 1-km squares, measured with the Sørensen index, were highly similar and ranged from 90.1 to 99.5%. We conclude that the differences noted above are not due to basically different types of habitats along the border, but that they rather reflect dissimilarities in land use and management practices of these habitats. This is further corroborated by a comparison of the distribution and abundance of selected habitat specialists, indicating more favourable conditions for species of open and semi-open habitats in German and French than in Swiss border 1-km squares.},

abstract={In the midwestern United States, less than 1% of the original tallgrass prairie ecosystem remains. State and federal agencies have responded to this habitat loss with programs and land acquisition that have increased the amount of grassland on the landscape by restoring grassland from other land-use practices. We assessed the effects of habitat restoration and the relative contribution of local habitat and landscape factors on breeding grassland birds in northern Iowa. During the 1999 and 2000 breeding seasons, we surveyed grassland birds in 10 tallgrass prairies and 10 restored grasslands that contained a wide diversity of habitat and landscape conditions. Densities of common bird species were similar between habitat types, except for grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), which were 4 and 9 times more dense in restored grasslands, respectively. Species richness of breeding birds was similar between habitat types. Habitat structure was different in prairies and restored grasslands; restored grasslands had 7% less total vegetation cover and 3% more bare ground. A nested, multiscale analysis indicated that habitat structure explained some variation in species richness and bird density of all common species, yet addition of landscape structure improved models for species richness and for density of 4 of 8 species considered, explaining an additional 10-29% of the variation. Edge-density metrics were the most common variables entering into landscape models; most species had lower densities in landscapes with high edge density. Our results indicate that restored grassland habitats contain bird communities generally similar to those in native prairie habitats in northern Iowa, suggesting that restored grasslands may provide similar habitat suitability for most grassland birds. In addition, both local habitat and landscape factors can be important for managing breeding grassland birds.},

abstract={In this study, we explored the habitat associations of the five most abundant passerine species nesting in the Ebro Delta reedbeds (NE Spain). Habitat characteristics (water depth, vegetation height and density, and plant-species composition) and abundance of all passerine species were measured at each of the 68 sampling points. The sampled area included most of the reedbeds in the Ebro Delta. Sampling points were classified according to the habitat parameters measured using cluster analysis. The resulting four habitat types differed in the composition and attributes of their passerine communities. The abundance of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) was greatest in tall, permanently inundated and almost monospecific Phragmites reedbeds. In contrast, the numbers of the reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and Savi's warbler (Locustella luscinioides) were greatest in areas of drier soils and a denser basal stratum. Finally, the fan-tailed warbler (Cisticola juncidis) showed no clear habitat association. In the Ebro Delta, reedbed management includes freshwater inputs and burning of standing reeds. These practices promote tall, permanently inundated reedbeds with minimal detrital accumulation. Bird species richness and diversity were greater in less intensely-managed habitats, but only diversity was significant (p < 0.001). We conclude that, since reedbeds are important habitats for several scarce bird species, and the abundance of these species seem to be influenced by vegetation structure, bird conservation considerations should be incorporated into future reedbed management practices. © 2002, The Society of Wetland Scientists.},

Using the point-count method we assessed bird species composition and abundance in three zones (unburnt, burnt in 1982, and burnt in 1994) during the breeding and wintering seasons of 1997 and 1998. From the breeding to the wintering seasons, burnt zones showed an increase in forest species, whereas the bird community of the unburnt zone remained stable in the gradient open-forest species. Moreover, the seasonal turnover of communities was higher in burnt zones than in the unburnt ones, although this did not imply that the former varied in richness through the year. The pattern of bird abundance in the unburnt zone was similar during the two study years, in contrast with that of burnt zones, suggesting higher annual cyclicity in resource availability in unburnt areas. These findings suggest that fire increases the seasonal variability of bird communities.},

abstract={Plantations of single tree species which are usually set up to reafforest cleared lands in the tropics, have often been criticized for being associated with a low level of diversity in the ecosystems. However, our study of understorey plant species in various plantations of single exotic or indigenous species has shown that more plant species grew within stands near a natural forest than within grasslands in Sakaerat, northeastern Thailand. These forests contribute to the acceleration of the secondary succession from grassland, which before reafforestation was achieved by recurrent fires. In the natural regeneration of understorey tree species in planted forests, large tree species in the natural forest seem to be the major common seed source among the stands studied. The small leaf biomass in these planted forests generated enough shade to prevent the invasion of 2 fire-adapted competitive grasses and to provide a suitable light environment for seedling establishment at an early stage of forest development. These factors facilitated the establishment of other species within the plantations of single tree species. Faster-growing exotic species accumulated larger amounts of understorey biomass than indigenous species. The most suitable species was Acacia mangium. The association of forests planted with single tree species with a high species richness in the ecosystems may enable to achieve a high biological diversity at the landscape level, which could bring various benefits to the forests of Sakaerat.},

abstract={Undisturbed plant communities dominated by shrubs or trees are often left isolated within landscapes otherwise devoid of woody vegetation following large-scale disturbances such as wildfires. We discuss potential ecological benefits associated with these terrestrial vegetation "islands", giving special attention to islands in disturbed shrub systems dominated by big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.). Shrub habitat islands provide important refugia for plant and animal species that are associates of shrubs - from those that generally require shrub cover to those that have evolved obligate symbioses with a particular shrub species. Even if islands are not able to support breeding populations, they may provide essential temporary habitat for maintaining a plant or animal metapopulation or for dispersing animals. Habitat islands are likely to enhance local biological diversity of plants and animals, because they harbor species that are lacking in disturbed areas, and because abrupt structural changes from disturbed to undisturbed vegetation provide a habitat mosaic that facilitates high levels of species turnover. A previous study confirmed that small mammal species richness in sagebrush islands is intermediate to the high species richness in undisturbed sagebrush "mainlands" and the low richness associated with burned sagebrush habitats. In re-analyzing some of the data from the latter study, we found that small mammal richness in sagebrush islands increases with time since the surrounding habitat burned. Finally, habitat islands provide more evenly dispersed seed sources for re-establishment of decimated vegetation within disturbed areas, and they may harbor animal species that provide seed dispersal services. Thus, they should accelerate vegetation recovery after disturbance. Managers, fire crews, and others who may influence how disturbance patterns affect habitat heterogeneity should be aware of these ecological benefits of habitat islands.},

abstract={We examined short-term trends in relative abundance and species richness of breeding and wintering grassland birds before (1996) and after (1997, 1998) a prescribed burn in a mesquite-invaded, desert grassland at Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona. We surveyed birds and sampled vegetation along 1-km line transects bisecting 14 (7 control, 7 burn) 25-ha plots located randomly within a burn and adjacent control unit. Following a spring burn that was moderate in intensity and patchy in areal extent, we observed that ground cover was affected more strongly by burning than mesquite (Prosopis) cover, smaller mesquite were affected more strongly by burning than larger mesquite, and mortality of mesquite was low. No change in total abundance of birds was detected on the burn unit following fire for either wintering or breeding birds; however, species richness of breeding birds decreased in the first year post-burn. During the breeding season, mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) increased, whereas Botteri's sparrows (Aimophila botterii), Cassin's sparrows (Aimophila cassinii), and cactus wrens (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus) decreased in relative abundance following fire. During the wintering season, ladder-backed woodpeckers (Picoides scalaris) and vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) increased and cactus wrens decreased in relative abundance following fire. Beyond species-level trends, we found stronger evidence of trends and greater magnitudes of relative change for breeding species associated with open grasslands compared to those associated with shrubs. The use of spring burns on the Refuge will likely improve conditions for open-grassland species that were historically more abundant by killing smaller mesquite and reducing mesquite recruitment. However, more intense and extensive fires will be required to reduce the presence of larger mesquite. Such fires would likely have a greater impact on birds associated with shrubs, and consequently, a greater impact on the avian community as a whole.},

abstract={To evaluate the efficacy of forest management to emulate natural disturbance, we compared bird abundances among burned and clear-cut, former black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) sites, after 5, 14, and 27 years of succession. Total bird density was lower in clear-cut sites resulting from fewer hermit thrushes, yellow warblers, Swainson's thrushes, and fox sparrows. Hermit thrushes were positively correlated with snag density while yellow warblers and Swainson's thrushes were positively associated with deciduous tree cover and negatively correlated with conifer cover. Only yellow-rumped warblers had higher densities on clear-cut sites, likely due to greater conifer cover. Bird densities and species richness peaked in the 14-year-old burns and exceeded that of mature forests reported for Labrador. This demonstrates the importance of natural early successional forests for birds. Although logged areas support several species found in natural young burns, logging does not precisely mimic fire. This suggests that forest managers should allow some forests to burn naturally.},

abstract={Reversing decades of fire exclusion by hardwood midstory reduction is now used to recover populations of the federally endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest ecosystems. The effects of Red-cockaded Woodpecker management on winter birds in longleaf pine sandhill forests are largely unknown. Examining habitat use of winter migrants, some of which are declining, may influence the selection of habitat management techniques used for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers to benefit overwintering migrants. During the winters (December-February) of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999, we tested experimentally the effects of hardwood reduction treatments applied in 1995 on winter birds at Eglin Air Force Base in fire-excluded northwest Florida longleaf pine sandhills. Treatments were (1) prescribed spring burning, (2) herbicide application, (3) mechanical felling and girdling, and (4) a control where decades of fire exclusion was maintained. We also sampled winter bird flocks in frequently burned, nonexperimental reference plots to measure management success. Hardwood reduction techniques had no effect on flock species richness, which averaged 7.9 and 7.2, respectively, during 1997-1998 and 1998-1999. Larger flocks in felling and girdling and in herbicide plots were primarily due to significantly higher numbers of overwintering Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina), as well as resident Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and an influx of temperate migrant Pine Warblers (Dendroica pinus). In contrast, flocks in control plots were smaller (flock size and species composition in spring burn plots were intermediate) and composed of hardwood-associated species, such as Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) and Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). The relative uses of longleaf pines and hardwoods by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, Pine Warblers, and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) during both winters best explained that winter birds present in herbicide, felling and girdling, and reference plots were more likely to forage on the same tree species and substrates than birds in spring-burned plots, and least likely to forage on the same species and substrates as birds in the control plots. Those differences corresponded to the following increasing order of hardwood stem mortality among treatments: control, spring burn (41%), felling and girdling (62%), and herbicide (92%). Repeated burning is recommended to restore the reference foraging condition because it was eight times less expensive than other techniques, which favored mostly Chipping Sparrows.},

abstract={Pastures provide substantial habitat for grassland birds of management concern in the Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin. The rolling topography in this region is characterized by lowland valleys surrounded by relatively steep and often wooded slopes which are set apart from more expansive treeless uplands. We hypothesized that there would be lower densities of area sensitive grassland passerines in lowland grasslands compared to upland grasslands because of their preference for larger more open grasslands. To test this hypothesis and assess how well pasture area and vegetation structure predicted grassland passerine density compared to upland/lowland status, we conducted point counts of birds in 60 pastures in May-June 1997 and 1998. Upland pastures generally supported greater densities of grassland passerines than lowland pastures. Densities of Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) were significantly higher in upland pastures than in lowland pastures. Grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) density was significantly higher on uplands in one of the study years. The density of eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), western meadowlark (S. neglecta) and sedge wren (Cistothorus platensis) did not differ significandy between uplands and lowlands. Grassland passerine density was also predicted by pasture size and vegetation structure. Densities of bobolink and grasshopper sparrow were higher in larger pastures. Bobolink and Savannah sparrow occurred on pastures with greater vegetation height-density and less bare ground; bobolink also preferred shallower litter depths. Lowland pastures supported grassland bird species of management concern and should not be neglected. However, we recommend that pasture management for grassland passerines in areas of variable topography favor relatively large upland pastures that will contain higher densities of species of management concern.},

abstract={The river valley of the French upper Meuse and its floodplain, constitutes a relatively natural ecosystem which still contains many endangered species of high conservation value. For example, several birds (Crex crex, Numenius arquata) as well as plant species (Gratiola officinalis, Inula britannica, Teucrium scordium, Ranunculus lingua and Mentha pulegium) which have declined seriously in France in recent times are found in the upper Meuse floodplain. Phytosociological studies and water level measurements have shown that the floristic diversity is mainly influenced by hydrological fluctuations and agricultural practices. The plant communities are structured along a topographical gradient in the high water bed reflecting the duration of floods and the ground water table depth. Agricultural practices have influenced the vegetation changes by selecting species adapted to particular management practices (e.g., fertiliser use, grazing, cutting regime). The data collected in this study from the upper Meuse as enabled 13 grassland and wetland ecotopes to be defined which are correlated with different environmental factors. Fertiliser use, grazing and reduction in the frequency of the cutting lead to a lower species richness because they encourage competitive species. However, it is also demonstrated, that maximum biodiversity is not always synonymous with high conservation value because some impoverished ecosystems, e.g., sedges and tall forb formations, may contain endangered plant and bird species. Knowledge of the boundaries between the different plant communities enables likely changes in floristic composition after modification of one or more site factors to be forecasted. Such factors include, water table depth and flood frequency, cutting regime, fertiliser use and grazing pressure. Thus, the definition of these ecotopes, corresponding to correlations between water regime, agricultural practice and vegetation composition, could lead to the establishment of guidelines for water and agricultural managements that could be involved in restoration projects.},

Middle Spotted Woodpecker tends to dominate Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) in oak forest managed for the production of quality timber for a long time. At the mature timber forest stage, trees with large trunks dominate: oaks with a trunk diameter of 45 cm represent over 80% of all trees. These mature plots guaranty the presence of high-density Middle Spotted Woodpecker population nucleus, and this despite all standing dead wood being removed. As for the study species other cavity-nesting birds are found in densities much than those recorded in primary forest in Poland. Starlings are especially numerous with the breeding population supplemented by a large number on non-breeding birds, this does not affect Middle Spotted Woodpeckers nor Nuthatches (Sitta europaea) which can be found at densities higher than 7 territories per 10 ha. We still need to asses the actual breeding population and monitor breeding success in this modified forest.},

abstract={To improve our understanding of how management affects the composition and structure of northern hardwood forests, we compared managed with unmanaged sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) dominated forests. Unmanaged old-growth and unmanaged second-growth forests provided baselines for comparing the effects of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on selected aspects of biological diversity. Three replications of each condition were located on the Winegar Moraine in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Old-growth forests were multistoried, dominated by a few, large trees with well-developed crowns extending over a subcanopy stratum 10-15 m in height and an abundance of woody vegetation (mostly sugar maple seedlings) at 2-3 m. This complex stand structure contrasts with the relatively uniform structure of unmanaged second-growth forests with a closed overstory canopy and limited understory development. Forest management, both even- and unevenaged, created forest structures that were more complex than their unmanaged second-growth baselines, yet managed forests lacked some of the structural complexity characteristic of old-growth. Managed forests had fewer large trees (stem diameter at 1.37 m > 50 cm) and considerably less basal area in dead trees when compared with old-growth. There were fewer tree species in managed forests because commercially important tree species were favored for retention and, when present, early successional species (e.g., Populus grandidentata Michx., Populus tremuloides Michx.) were harvested. A subcanopy comprised of large shrubs and small trees characteristic of old growth was absent in managed forests, but this structural element may develop with time under management. As expected, thinning the overstory and disturbing the forest floor through tree harvesting promoted understory development in managed forests. Most of the added species, however, were common in the landscape and thus added little to overall species richness.},

abstract={Foraging observations (1 observation/bird) of tits and associated species were recorded during four winter months in two natural old-growth and two managed forests. The number of daily foraging observations was used as an index of bird abundance. The daily mean number of foraging observations for Parus major, P. caeruleus, P. palustris, Sitta europea, Certhia familiaris and Dendrocopos major was significantly higher in natural old-growth vs managed forest (ratio 4.8: 1 for all six species pooled and 3.1 : 1, 3.2 : 1, 4.7 : 1, 5.7 : 1, 7.4 : 1 and 4.7: 1 for the above-mentioned species, respectively). As the larger dominant species has an advantage in competition for nest holes, we would expect these to exhibit the smallest abundance ratio skews. This was not, however, the case and consequently, the results of this study do not support the hypothesis that a lack of nest holes should be the primary limiting factor for hole nesting species in managed forests. It was found that the species showing the strongest preference for foraging on dead wood were the same that had the most pronounced density skew between forest types. This could indicate that the lack of food resulting from silvicultural practice could be very important as a limiting factor in managed forests. Analyses of the use of dead wood of different diameter and from different tree species indicate that forest birds exploit diverse types of dead wood. Partially decayed standing dead wood was the most important substrate for the majority of species.},

abstract={The abundance and distribution of breeding waterfowl in the Great Clay Belt of northern Ontario was determined through helicopter surveys of 117 fixed plots (2 x 2 km each) during the nest initiation periods from 1988 to 1990. This area has higher fertility, flat topography, high water table and better access than the surrounding Boreal Forest, and therefore has greater potential for increased waterfowl production through habitat management. Overall breeding density averaged 112.5 indicated breeding pairs per 100 km2, 68% being of the four most common species [Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Ringnecked Duck (Aythya collaris), American Black Duck (Anas rubripes), and Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula)]; 13 other species were encountered. The average total of breeding waterfowl for the region was estimated at 59330 pairs. Distributions of the species were related to ecodistrict and to surficial geology. The more northerly of the two main ecodistricts had higher densities of American Black Ducks, Ring-necked Ducks, Common Goldeneyes, and Canada Geese (Branta canadensis). Mallard and Hooded Merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus) distributions correlated with presence of surficial clay and moraines, respectively. Less common species including Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca) and American Wigeon (Anas americana) appeared to be concentrated in smaller-scaled habitat features (beaver pond sequences and estuarine marshes, respectively). Results generally agreed with those of earlier Clay Belt surveys. Total breeding density of waterfowl is slightly higher than that of surrounding regions.},

abstract={Providing adequate habitat for the pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) is a key component of federal forest management plans in the Pacific Northwest, yet information is extremely limited on characteristics of trees selected by this species for nesting or roosting in coastal forests. We investigated selection by pileated woodpeckers of both individual tree and site characteristics for nesting and roosting in coastal forests, and evaluated the efficacy of current management prescriptions for these woodpeckers on federal lands. From 1990 to 1995, we used call surveys, ground searches, and radiotelemetry to locate 25 nest and 144 roost trees used by 31 adult pileated woodpeckers (16 females, 15 males) in western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) forests located about 20 km east of the Pacific coast in Washington, USA. Nesting pairs typically excavated nest cavities in different trees each year, and individual birds used an average of 7 different roost trees during the nonbreeding season. Pileated woodpeckers used decadent live trees as often as snags for both nesting and roosting. They selected Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis) for nesting and western redcedar (Thuja plicata) for roosting, and selected against western hemlock for both activities. For nesting, pileated woodpeckers used only trees 65-154 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) but were not selective within this range; for roosting, they selected trees 155-309 cm dbh and selected against trees <125 cm dbh. For both nesting and roosting, pileated woodpeckers selected trees ≥27.5 m tall and selected against trees <17.5 m tall. Decay characteristics of trees used by pileated woodpeckers for nesting differed su'ongly from those used for roosting. Site characteristics also influenced selection of nest and roost trees by pileated woodpeckers; 0.4-ha plots around nest and roost trees contained a higher diversity of tree species and higher densities of decadent trees ≥20 cm dbh and snags ≥50 cm dbh than availability plots. The Northwest Forest Plan specifies the retention of 1 large, hard snag per 17 ha of harvested forest to provide nest trees for pileated woodpeckers. Our results indicate that providing adequate habitat for pileated woodpeckers in coastal forests of the Pacific Northwest may require a more comprehensive management strategy that also includes provisions for roost trees and that emphasizes retention of both snags and decadent trees, especially those infected with heart-rot decay fungi.},

abstract={We compared northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) abundance and habitat characteristics in unmanaged mixed shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)-hardwood stands and restored pine-grassland stands managed for the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) on the Ouachita National Forest, Arkansas, USA. To determine northern bobwhite (hereafter, bobwhite) population response in untreated control, thinned, and thinned and burned stands either 1, 2, or 3 growing seasons (Mar to mid-Oct) post-burn, we used whistling-male counts and covey-call counts as indices of population abundance. We estimated woody stem density, understory and overstory canopy cover, conifer and hardwood basal area, and the disc of vulnerability to characterize habitat response. Relative abundance of whistling males in the spring was greatest in thinned stands 3 growing seasons post-burn and in thinned but unburned stands. These stands had the smallest disc of vulnerability and the greatest understory shrub cover <2 m in height compared with other treatments. A threshold-like increase in bobwhite abundance was observed as a function of woody structure <2 m. Pine-grassland restoration provided suitable structure for bobwhites in spring, summer, and fall, but may not be adequate in winter. Further, data suggested that bobwhite density within a stand also was related to the amount of suitable habitat surrounding the stand. Bobwhite management efforts in similar shortleaf pine forests should include thinning to reduce midstory and overstory cover and frequent fire to maintain open woodland conditions - i.e., low basal area stands with limited midstory.},

abstract={The study of species-area relationships in protected natural areas (PNAs) is an effective tool for designing nature reserves and managing biological diversity. Ten North Central Texas PNAs were studied to understand how plant species richness is related to PNA size. The species-area model was applied to total plant species, native plant species, selected native speciose plant families and invasive plant species. Results indicate that area is a significant predictor of species richness (r2 = ≥ 0.60) for both total species and native species in North Central Texas PNAs. Habitat diversity as measured by topographic relief and topographic abruptness is also shown to be a significant predictor of plant species richness in North Central Texas PNAs. Introduced species richness could not be predicted from area alone but was explained by perimeter and perimeter/area ratio and one proxy measure of habitat diversity. The estimates of z values range from 0.15 to 0.30, while c ranges from 0.60 to 1.42 for species-area relationships, both of which fall within the range of values estimated by previous research. Such estimates allowed us to evaluate effective management schemes for North Central Texas PNAs plant diversity. The results of this research permit us to examine the invasion of exotic flora in Texas PNAs and to predict how such invasions will reduce native species richness if conservation management practices are not implemented.},

abstract={1998 and 1999 the occurence, spatial distribution and breeding success of meadow birds were investigated in the area of the research and development project "Osterfeiner Moor" (North West Germany). This area is of great importance for breeding meadow birds like Curlew (Numenius arquata), Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) and Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa). This investigation focuses on characteristic species like Lapwing and Black-tailed Godwit. Populations of these species, showing high densities, are relative constant since many years. Nevertheless an increased fledging success is necessary for a stable development of the populations. Detailed reasons for the low fledging success are unknown. Within the context of these investigation the present status is described. The water regime as a main environmental factor was changed in winter 2000/2001. An important aim of changes in the project area must be the improvement of existing populations, particularly Lapwings and Black-teailed Godwits, at least until the fledging success is high enough to replace annual adult losses. Beyond this long-term objective is to produce further fledglings to support the populations outside the project area. Special treatments for habitat management regarding a higher fledging success to maintain stable bird populations are suggested as follows: (1) flooding of selected areas in winter time; (2) increasing of species diversity of pasture and flowering vegetation as basis for invertebrates; (3) seperation from farming or tourist activities during the hedging period on selected areas reduce the loss of nests and juvenile birds.},

abstract={Evolving agricultural policies have influenced management practices within agroecosystems, impacting available habitats for many species of wildlife. Enhancing wildlife habitat has become an explicit objective of existing agricultural policy. Thus, there is renewed focus on field borders and the use of shelterbelt agroforestry systems to achieve conservation goals in the Midwest. Two Representative Farms - a 283-ha dryland and 510-ha irrigated farm were created in Saunders County, Nebraska. The Habitat Analysis and Modeling System (HAMS) was used to describe the composition and spatial pattern of the existing farms and surrounding landscape, as well as for the landscapes surrounding selected Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. Simulated land use changes resulting from the implementation of two shelterbelt scenarios, Agricultural and Wildlife, were incorporated on each Representative Farm and surrounding landscape. Landscape variables which influence breeding bird species richness and community composition as determined from BBS routes were measured on simulated farm landscapes. A more heterogeneous landscape results from implementing either scenario. The percent total woods was a significant determinant of bird species richness on the BBS routes and was important in influencing bird communities at the farm- and landscape-level. Other landscape metrics which influenced the bird community composition on BBS routes were woody edge percentages and edge density values. Policies promoting shelterbelts create edge habitats which ultimately favor birds within the Forest-edge/generalist guild while bird species in need of conservation such as grassland-field species would potentially be negatively affected.},

The biodiversity of this type of woodland is affected by lengthy management in contrast to present emphasis on the fragmentation of more or less pristine forests. The woodlands derive from old deciduous forests but were a source of agricultural commodities from medieval time to end of the 19th century. Vascular plants and birds were censused during spring - summer for four years. Total number of plant species, species of field layer forbs, breeding birds and migrant birds were more numerous at simulated original management with mowing of small interior grasslands than at mechanical clearing or abandonment. Summer grazing led to intermediate numbers. Exotic plants were more common at long-time abandonment. Species richness of trees and shrubs, graminoids, all spring birds, resident birds and non-passerine birds did not exhibit any difference between treatments. Inter-site variation in species richness was usually smaller at abandonment than at true management. Species richness of plants and birds showed positive correlation in the particularly large sites examined. The general findings were in accordance with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Original management would secure most potential plant and bird species but extensive cattle grazing would also retain many species.},

abstract={1. Variable retention harvests or 'green-tree retention systems' are important to the management of coniferous forests in the temperate zone. Green-tree retention leaves large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand and provide mature forest habitat that develops sooner than in typical even-aged management by clear-cutting. The seed-tree system is one method of harvesting that leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally. Green-tree retention may increase biological diversity and help to enhance functional links among forest structures or ecological processes. 2. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the abundance (e.g. basal area and density of residual trees and amount of vegetation) and diversity (e.g. species diversity and structural diversity of the herb, shrub and tree layers) of various aspects of stand structure will decline with lower levels of tree retention. In particular, abundance and diversity should be greater in sites with green-tree retention than in clear-cut sites. 3. Stand structure attributes were measured from 1996 (immediately after harvesting) to 1999 in replicated clear-cut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada. 4. In terms of abundance, clear-cut, single seed-tree and group seed-tree sites had similar mean basal areas of residual trees, ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 m2 ha-1, with significantly higher levels on patch-cut (23.4 m2 ha-1) and uncut forest (39.0 m2 ha-1) sites. Mean densities of residual trees also followed this pattern, ranging from 0.7 to 16.3 stems ha-1 on the clear-cut to group seed-tree sites, to 769.4 and 2050.0 stems ha-1 on the patch-cut and uncut forest sites, respectively. However, mean volume (m3 ha-1) of fallen wood (i.e. dead wood or woody debris) was similar among sites, ranging from 116.7 in the single seed-tree to 210.2 in the patch-cut sites. Contrary to our hypothesis, the mean index of total crown volume of herbs, shrubs, mosses and lichens was similar among sites. 5. Mean species richness of herbs, shrubs and total plants was similar among sites. Mean richness of trees in seed-tree sites was similar to that in uncut forest in three of four post-harvest years. The mean species diversity of herbs was similar among sites, but that of shrubs and trees was generally lowest in the patch-cut sites and similar among the other sites. 6. The mean structural richness and diversity of herbs was lowest in the uncut forest and similar at the other sites 3 and 4 years post-harvest. The mean structural richness of trees and total plants in the patch-cut and uncut forest sites had more vegetation layers than the other sites. 7. Our hypothesis was partly supported in terms of basal area and density of residual trees and structural richness of total vegetation layers across a gradient of tree retention from uncut forest to clear-cut sites. However, this pattern was not supported for abundance or diversity of understorey vegetation. Thus, the structural attributes of residual trees and layers of vegetation, but not the abundance, species richness or species diversity of understorey vegetation, lend support to the aims of variable retention harvesting, at least up to 4 years post-harvest.},

abstract={We review species richness in major organism groups, mainly using examples from northern Europe. A high proportion of these species is forest living, and large numbers are dependent on decaying wood. Biodiversity can be assessed at various scales using two different principles. One is to use features, such as ancient and dead trees, known to be important for a large number of species. The other method is to choose species or groups of species known to indicate high biodiversity or presence of many red-listed species. We argue that any serious biodiversity assessment method should include the most species rich organism groups, for example insects. In the present paper we point out the most important features for high biodiversity (old trees and large dead trees), and review the quantities of these features in near-virgin forests. The natural disturbance regime of a region should be the basis for defining a suitable scale and the appropriate features for biodiversity assessment. Possible indicator species for high biodiversity in northern Europe are suggested, based on previous investigations. Among epiphytic lichens and wood-living beetles there are many potentially useful species in addition to vascular plants in the nemoral forest. Among vertebrates, woodpeckers and grouses seem to be the most useful. Validation tests for indicator structures and species are largely lacking but urgently needed. The implications of possible delayed local extinctions are important to bear in mind when managing for sustainable forestry. The knowledge of forest history is useful when developing cost-efficient measures. © 2001 Taylor & Francis.},

Snag surveys were used to describe habitat, and both breeding bird surveys and nest surveys were used to characterize the bird community. Stands with the medium snag density treatment had the highest abundance, species richness, and nesting population of cavity nesters. The reasons for this may be: 1) snags were not evenly distributed within a stand such that both clumped and dispersed snag density habitats were interspersed in this treatment, and 2) a greater proportion of ponderosa pine snags in medium density treatments may have attracted species that prefer ponderosa pine for nesting and foraging. Ponderosa pine was preferred for nest sites and large snags (> 48 cm dbh) provided nesting habitat for more species than smaller snags. However, smaller snags were used for nesting and foraging by some species.},

abstract={Fire is being experimentally reintroduced to the forests of southern Ohio to determine its effectiveness in restoring and maintaining mixed-oak (Quercus spp.) forest communities. We studied the effects of repeated burning (1-4 years of annual burning) and recovery (1 year after burning) on the breeding bird community. Burning resulted in incremental but temporary reductions in the availability of leaf litter, shrubs, and saplings, but it did not affect trees, snags, or understory vegetation cover. Of 30 bird species monitored, 4 were affected negatively and 2 were affected positively by burning. Population densities of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus), and Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina) declined incrementally in response to repeated burning and did not recover within I year after burning, suggesting a lag time in response to the changes in habitat conditions. Densities of Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) fluctuated among years in the control units, but remained low in the burned units. Densities of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and Eastern Wood-Pewees (Contopus virens) increased in response to burning, but these increases were apparent only after several years of repeated burning. In general, burning resulted in short-term reductions in the suitability of habitat for ground- and low-shrub-nesting birds, but it improved habitat for ground- and aerial-foraging birds. Overall, there were no changes in the composition of the breeding-bird community. Total breeding bird population levels were also unaffected by burning. Our results suggest that prescribed burning applied on a long-term basis or across large spatial scales is likely to have adverse effects on ground- and low-shrub-nesting bird species, but other changes in the composition of the breeding-bird community are likely to be minimal as long as the closed-canopy forest structure is maintained within the context of prescribed burning.},

abstract={Population declines of farmland birds over recent decades in Europe, Canada and the USA have been attributed to more intensive agricultural management. We counted birds during the 1990 breeding season on 72 field sites in southern Ontario, Canada, paired between 10 organic and 10 conventional farms for local habitat to enhance our ability to detect effects of agricultural practices. Of 68 species recorded, 58 were on organic sites, 59 on conventional. Species richness and total abundance were significantly greater on organic than conventional sites based on log-linear regression. Of 43 species analyzed with log-linear regression, eight (18.6%) were significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant on organic than conventional sites and four (9.3%) approached significance (0.05 < P < 0.10). Eight of these 12 species had negative population trends for 1967-1998 Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS) in this region. Two of the 43 species analyzed (4.7%) were significantly more abundant on conventional than organic sites and three (7.0%) approached significance. Two of these five species had negative BBS population trends. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of 13 practices and 13 habitat variables explained 44% of total variation (TV) accounted for in a detrended correspondence analysis of bird species composition and abundance. Practices contributed 23.7% of TV, habitat 26%; habitat and practices shared 5.7% with each other and 12% with farm ownership (i.e. clustering of field sites within farms). CCA ordinations indicated considerable mixing of organic and conventional sites across a gradient from sites with many birds species associated with greater habitat heterogeneity and more pasture, winter grain, farmstead and other non-crop habitats (hedgerow, woodland) to sites with few bird species associated with larger fields, more rowcrop and spring grain, more passes and tilling, and use of herbicides and chemical fertilizers. Our results re-emphasize the importance of non-crop habitats, more permanent crop cover, and less intensive management practices to the conservation of avian biodiversity on farmland.

abstract={Transect bird surveys were conducted at 43 tallgrass prairies in southwestern Missouri, U.S.A. in mid-June each year from 1992 to 1999. Litter volume on and near the ground was estimated on a nine-point scale during 1994 to 1999. The relative importance of management type (rotational burning, rotational haying, or a combination of both) and litter volume on relative abundance was analysed for three declining grassland songbirds: Henslow's Sparrow Ammodramus henslowii, Grasshopper Sparrow A. savannarum, and Dickcissel Spiza americana. Haying resulted in significantly higher abundance than burning for all species except Dickcissel, for which few significant management effects were detected. Henslow's Sparrow increased in abundance from light to heavy litter, Grasshopper Sparrow peaked in low to intermediate litter, and Dickcissel showed little pattern relative to litter. Litter scores recorded in each management type increased with number of years since last treatment. Although litter profoundly affected bird abundance, independent and equally important was whether that litter was obtained via haying or burning. Greater consistency among years in hayed vegetation structure may help explain these birds' preference for haying over burning or haying + burning. Rotational haying should be employed more than burning in the management of these declining birds, especially for the sharply declining, fire-sensitive Henslow's and Grasshopper Sparrows.},

abstract={1. The effects of agricultural intensification on biodiversity in arable systems of western Europe have received a great deal of attention. However, the recent transformation of grassland systems has been just as profound. 2. In Britain, the management of grassland has changed substantially in the second half of the 20th century. A high proportion of lowland grassland is managed intensively. The major changes include a doubling in the use of inorganic nitrogen, a switch from hay to silage, and increased stocking densities, particularly of sheep. Structurally diverse and species-rich swards have been largely replaced by relatively dense, fast-growing and structurally uniform swards, dominated by competitive species. 3. Most of these changes have reduced the suitability of grassland as feeding and breeding habitat for birds. 4. The most important direct effects have been deterioration of the sward as nesting and wintering habitat, and loss of seed resources as food. Short uniform swards afford poor shelter and camouflage from predators, whereas increased mowing intensities and trampling by stock will destroy nests and young. Increased frequency of sward defoliation reduces flowering and seed set, and hence food availability for seed-eating birds. 5. The indirect effects of intensification of management on birds relate largely to changes in the abundance and availability of invertebrate prey. The effects of management vary with its type, timing and intensity, and with invertebrate ecology and phenology, but, in general, the abundance and diversity of invertebrates declines with reductions in sward diversity and structural complexity. 6. Low input livestock systems are likely to be central to any future management strategies designed to maintain and restore the ecological diversity of semi-natural lowland grasslands. Low additions of organic fertilizer benefit some invertebrate prey species, and moderate levels of grazing encourage sward heterogeneity. 7. There is now a need to improve understanding of how grassland management affects bird population dynamics. Particularly important areas of research include: (i) the interaction between changes in food abundance, due to changes in fertilizer inputs, and food accessibility, due to changes in sward structure; (ii) the interaction between predation rates and management-related changes in habitat; and (iii) the impact of alternative anti-helminithic treatments for livestock on invertebrates and birds.},

abstract={Bird communities are declining in south-eastern Australia and riparian woodlands are critical habitats for birds in this agricultural region. We investigated how terrestrial bird communities varied with different land management practices (levels of grazing by domestic livestock and extent of clearing) and with habitat quality on the floodplains of the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers. Bird community composition in ungrazed and lightly grazed sites was significantly different to that in more heavily grazed sites, and these differences were related to tree and shrub cover, as well as tree species diversity and abundance of standing dead trees. Grazing appeared to have an effect on bird communities separate from that caused by clearing. Indicator species were identified for the effects of grazing and clearing. Grazing by livestock has had negative impacts on riparian birds through degradation of habitat quality. A combination of lower stocking rates, strategic placement of off-river watering points for stock, and the introduction of rotational grazing practices may be used to restore riparian habitat quality: The grazing-sensitive species we identified could be used as indicator species for the success of rehabilitation efforts. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={We made counts of 42 bird species at 217 points in 44 jack pine Pinus banksiana stands in the boreal region of north-central Saskatchewan, Canada because of concerns about the impact of forestry on avian biodiversity. Using multivariate analyses we describe the main patterns of bird species abundance and composition in relation to local habitat variables. According to canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), 17 of 43 explanatory variables accounted for significant variation in the bird species matrix: stand age, tamarack Larix laricina canopy cover, percentage shrub Alnus glutinosa, canopy closure (6-30%), percentage herbs, maximum canopy height, percentage shrub Alnus viridis, percentage moss, percentage shrub Betula nana, minimum and mean shrub height, percentage litter, white birch Betula papyrifera canopy cover, white spruce Picea glauca canopy cover, mean canopy height, canopy closure (71-100%), and zero shrub canopy closure. Habitat and stand identity (clustering of sites within stands) explained 55.5% of the total variation; 16.3% was unique to habitat alone (29.4% of the total variance explained - TVE) and 17.2% (31.0% TVE) was shared with stand identity. Stand identity accounted for 22.0% (39.6% TVE) of the variation. Neotropical migrants associated with "overmature" mixed-wood stands included Cape May Dendroica tigrina, bay-breasted D. castanea and Tennessee Vermivora peregrina warblers. Conversely, orange-crowned V celata, palm D. palmarum, and Nashville V. ruficapilla warblers were found in young stands. The presence of several Neotropical migrants was associated with mixed-wood attributes (ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus with aspen, red-eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus with shrub alder, and Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus with canopy white birch). Jack pine stands older than commercial rotation age must be maintained in a managed landscape because their bird communities differ from younger stands. Because of the limited avian diversity in pure jack pine stands, sufficient mixed-wood stands must be regenerated to sustain populations of characteristic bird species. We recommend that jack pine mixed-woods be managed using shelterwood or selective cuts, and that rotation age of some stands be increased. Without the extensive fires necessary for regeneration, cutting patterns at the landscape level should approximate natural disturbance patches both in size and frequency of disturbance. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={In southcentral Florida, where agricultural lands are being converted rapidly to urban development, much of the remaining nonurban habitat occurs on privately owned cattle ranches. We studied the Crested Caracara (Caracara cheriway), a threatened bird of prey, to learn the role of private lands in sustaining the population. We investigated patterns of distribution and reproductive activity of breeding pairs of caracaras in relation to patterns of land ownership and use. Eighty-two percent of 73 active nest sites found were on privately owned cattle ranches. We rarely found breeding pairs on publicly owned lands, most of which are managed as natural areas (no agricultural production and limited livestock grazing) to support native plant and animal communities. In 46 breeding areas with 4 years of known histories of occupancy and reproduction, pairs nesting on lands where the major land use was cattle ranching exhibited higher rates of breeding-area occupancy, attempted breeding during more years, initiated egg laying earlier, exhibited higher nesting success, and attempted a second brood after successfully fledging a first brood more often than pairs nesting on lands managed as natural areas. Compositional analysis suggested nonrandom selection of habitats by breeding pairs of caracaras in their establishment of a home range in the current landscape of southcentral Florida. Compared with random areas and available habitat in the overall study area, caracara home ranges had higher proportions of improved pasture and lower proportions of forest, woodland, oak scrub, and marsh. Which management activities favor and do not favor caracaras is uncertain, and hypotheses should be formulated and tested to guide future conservation applications. Particular grazing and fire management practices on privately and publicly owned lands may affect the structure of vegetation and prey communities in ways that influence caracaras. Or, replacement of native by exotic grasses may retain structurally suitable plant communities, whereas fertilization and grazing may increase productivity and nutrient cycling in ways that favor caracaras. Given continued conversion of natural habitats and agricultural lands to urban development, it is important to recognize that cattle ranches may provide important resources for wildlife conservation. Although cattle ranching is not likely to benefit all species historically associated with the native prairie ecosystem in Florida, finding ways to retain this land use may be important for the conservation of Florida's population of Crested Caracaras and other organisms of Florida's dry prairies.},

abstract={This study investigated the effects of habitat clearance and fragmentation on birds of coastal heathlands in subtropical eastern Australia. Abundance and species composition were compared among two types of cleared habitat (residential suburbs and sugar cane cropland) and four sizes of heathland remnant (1-2 ha, 5-10 ha, 20-50 ha and >500 ha) in summer and winter. Cleared land contained a distinctly different bird species assemblage from heathland remnants. Residential sites contained a distinct suite of species consistent with that described for 'open/ developed land' habitat elsewhere in the region. In contrast, cane cropland supported very few species. Heathland remnants >500 ha contained high densities of 'natural-vegetation-dependent' species, whereas species of open/ developed land were absent. Remnants of 1-2 ha had lowered densities of many natural-vegetation-dependent species, and a relatively high abundance of open/developed land species. Some of the avifaunal differences in the >500-ha remnants and 5-50-ha range are probably due to confounding of remnant size with habitat, resulting from selective clearing of the landscape. Most of the heathland birds were intolerant of the matrix habitat (residential and cane cropland), but tolerant of decreased remnant area, down to a threshold of about 5 ha. However, the distinctive floristic associations of heathland vegetation are dependent on an environmental regime (low nutrient, low pH, fire, in some cases inundation) that is unlikely to persist in remnants tens of hectares in size, and longer-term declines in heathland birds, are predicted.},

abstract={Fire is a major driving force of landscape change in the Mediterranean region. The objectives of this paper were to explore the implications of landscape change and wildfires in a region of northwestern Portugal for the diversity of breeding birds. Land use cover for the years 1958, 1968, 1983 and 1995 was obtained from aerial photography for a study area of 3700 ha. Breeding bird assemblages in each of six land use categories were characterized in 1998 using point counts. The main landscape changes in the study area across the 40 years were a decrease in the area of agricultural land and low shrublands (respectively 29% and 48%) and an increase in forests and tall shrublands (both over 95%). Bird assemblages showed increased richness and diversity across the gradient: Low shrublands → tall shrublands → conifer → mixed → deciduous → agricultural areas. Many of the species with narrow niche breadth (specialists) were associated with agricultural areas and deciduous forests. In spite of the low diversity of burned areas (mostly shrublands) a few specialist species depend on this habitat. Thus, the current fire regime probably contributes to maintaining bird diversity at the landscape level. There was an inverse relationship between landscape diversity and estimated bird diversity across the last 40 years. Landscape management actions to preserve bird diversity should focus on the maintenance of agricultural land and deciduous forests. In parallel, a wider use of prescribed burning and grazing is suggested. This would contribute to maintaining low shrublands in the landscape, useful both as an habitat for some bird species and as fuel breaks for preventing the occurrence of large wildfires.},

abstract={1. The abundance of meadow pipits appears to be a good indicator of the breeding density of hen harriers on moorland managed for red grouse in Scotland. High densities of hen harriers can limit grouse populations at low density and reduce shooting bags, with repercussions for grouse moor management and conservation. We therefore examined the habitat characteristics of managed grouse moors, asking whether changes in vegetation could alter the ratio of pipits, and thus harriers, to grouse. 2. We examined grouse abundance and habitat on 69 sites of 1 km2 in upland Britain, of which pipit abundance was studied on 36. Similar data were collected on 73 sites of 25 ha within the Langholm estate in south-west Scotland, in order to make a within-estate and among-moor comparison. 3. The distribution of pipit abundance on the Langholm estate was similar to that seen in the extensive among-moor study. Pipit and grouse abundance were related to habitat in similar ways in the two data sets. 4. Pipits were the most frequent passerine, but their abundance was not related to grouse abundance. Pipit abundance declined with increasing muirburn and heather, but increased with grass cover. In a linear regression model Calluna, Sphagnum and muirburn cover accounted for 42% of the variation in pipit abundance across Britain. 5. Grouse abundance was influenced by the regional location of the grouse moor and to a lesser extent by its altitude. There were more grouse on English moors with less patchy habitats. Bird species declined with increasing Calluna and Sphagnum cover and habitat patchiness. Bird species diversity increased from west to east and on moors with more muirburn. 6. This study provides evidence that meadow pipits are influenced by habitat characteristics on moorland managed for grouse. This work also illustrates how habitat management may be able to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts: long-term increases in heather cover and management of this habitat by muirburn on grouse moors may reduce pipit numbers and thus reduce the ratio of hen harriers to grouse. However, the effects of such vegetation change on other components of the upland bird assemblage requires further investigation.},

abstract={1. Breeding birds, vegetation and moorland management were surveyed in 320 1-km squares on 122 estates in upland areas of eastern Scotland and northern England where red grouse shooting is a widespread land use. We assessed whether population densities of 11 species of breeding birds differed between heather-dominated moorland managed for red grouse shooting and other moorland with similar vegetation. 2. We classified estates that had a full-time equivalent moorland gamekeeper as grouse moors. The mean density of red grouse shot per year was four times higher and the mean density of gamekeepers was three times higher on grouse moors than on other moors. Rotational burning of ground vegetation covered a 34% larger area on grouse moors than on other moors. 3. Selection of heather-dominated squares resulted in similar composition of vegetation on grouse moors and other moors (about 76% heath, 12% grass, 8% bog, 2% flush and < 1% bracken on both types). However, grouse moors tended to have less tall vegetation than other moors and differed significantly in some other characteristics of the vegetation, topography and soil type. 4. Densities of breeding golden plover and lapwing were five times higher and those of red grouse and curlew twice as high on grouse moors as on other moors, while meadow pipit, skylark, whinchat and carrion/hooded crow were 1-5, 2·3, 3·9 and 3·1 times less abundant, respectively, on grouse moors. The differences in density between moorland types remained significant (P < 0·001) for golden plover and crow and approached significance (P < 0·10) for lapwing and meadow pipit after allowing for variation among regions. 5. We used Poisson regression models to relate bird density to vegetation cover, topography, climate and soil type. After adjusting for significant effects of these habitat variables, significant differences in bird density between the two moorland types remained for six species, although their magnitude was reduced. 6. Correlations of adjusted bird density with measures of different aspects of grouse moor management provided evidence of a possible positive influence of predator control (assessed using crow density) on red grouse, golden plover and lapwing. The control of crows by gamekeepers is the most probable cause of the low densities of crows on grouse moors. There was evidence of a positive effect of heather burning on the density of red grouse and golden plover and a negative effect on meadow pipit. Multiple Poisson regression indicated that predator control and heather burning had significant separate effects on red grouse density. Significant relationships between adjusted breeding bird densities and the abundance of raptors and ravens were few and predominantly positive. 7. The results provide correlative evidence that moorland management benefits some breeding bird species and disbenefits others in ways that cannot readily be explained as effects of differences in vegetation type or topography. However, experimental manipulations of numbers of some predators and heather burning are required to test these findings.},

abstract={This paper presents the results of the BTO/RSPB survey of breeding Northern Lapwings Vanellus vanellus in England and Wales carried out in 1998. Numbers of breeding Lapwings and land-use types were recorded by volunteers in 1312 randomly selected tetrads using identical methods to those adopted in a previous survey in 1987. The results suggest a population of 62 923 breeding pairs (95% confidence intervals 55 268 to 74 499), representing a 49% decline in 11 years. The declines were greatest in southwest England and Wales, resulting in a marked contraction in range. Both arable and pastoral farmland was found to be important for Lapwings, highlighting their vulnerability to changes in a range of agricultural systems. Recent major changes in land management practices, including the switch from spring to autumn sowing and the conversion of rough to intensively managed, improved grassland is likely to have reduced both the area and the suitability of these habitats for Lapwings. Grassland within arable areas is known to provide important chick rearing habitat, and spring tillage with adjacent grassland was significantly more likely to hold Lapwings than spring tillage that did not abut grass fields. The prevalence of grass and spring tillage fields in close proximity has declined in recent years with the loss of traditional mixed farming and the polarization of pastoral systems in the west of Britain and arable in the east. The implications of these results for the conservation of Lapwings are discussed and it is recommended that, in the light of the scale of the decline recorded, Lapwings should be afforded much higher conservation priority in Britain than they are at present. The range contraction has resulted in high numbers being concentrated on reserves, highlighting the importance of sensitive management of these areas for this species. However, wider countryside measures should also be considered, such as specific options within agri-environment schemes, designed to enhance farmland habitats for Lapwings. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Throughout the eastern USA many Spartina alterniflora salt-marsh systems are being altered through the invasion of Phragmites australis. As a result, substantial declines in the areal distribution of S. alterniflora-dominated habitat have occurred in contrast to increases in P. australis dominated habitat. While information is scarce on nekton use of P. australis marsh, increases in the areal distribution of this species have concerned resource managers. Managers typically view the shift of S. alterniflora to P. australis marsh as a shift from a biologically diverse and productive marsh to one less biologically diverse and productive. We examined nekton use of P. australis marsh relative to S. alterniflora marsh with similar geographic location and physical conditions. We found no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the utilization of P. australis and S. alterniflora marsh by nekton in terms of abundance or biomass. Further, no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the total number of nekton species was evident between P. australis and S. alterniflora marsh. We postulate that under similar environmental and physical conditions these marsh types are equivalent in terms of nekton use. It may be necessary to reevaluate current wetland management practices which involve the elimination of P. australis in favor of S. alterniflora marsh in order to increase nekton use.},

abstract={Rotational grazing has been proposed as a Best Management Practice (BMP) for minimizing runoff in Wisconsin agricultural riparian areas. The influence of this land management practice on grassland birds has not been evaluated in relation to more traditional agricultural land management systems in Midwestern riparian areas. This study compared the grassland bird community in riparian areas in Wisconsin that were rotationally grazed to 2 common land use practices along streams in Wisconsin: continuously grazed pastures and rowcrop fields with 10-m-wide ungrazed buffer strips located along the stream. We calculated total number of birds, the Berger-Parker Index of Dominance, and number of birds ha-1 for each site. Vegetation variables used were height-density, litter depth, and percent bare ground. Bird species richness, species dominance, and density did not differ among land use types. In contrast, grassland bird species of management concern [Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis Gmelin), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna L.), and Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus L.)] were found on continuous and rotational pastures but very rarely or never occurred on buffer strips. Contrary to previous research, however, rotationally grazed pastures did not support more of these species than continuously grazed pastures. Bird density was related to vegetation structure, with higher densities found on sites with deeper litter. Within the pasture land use types, there were no consistent differences between species richness and density near the stream (&lt;10 m) and away (&gt;10 m).},

abstract={Coastal wetlands in the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain commonly are managed intensively by fall or winter burning and constructing impoundments to improve habitat for wintering waterfowl, reduce wetland loss, and create emergent wetlands. However, little information is available on effects of these management practices on plant or bird communities during summer. We conducted experimental burns in 4 types of impounded and unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Louisiana. We recorded vegetation characteristics and species composition and relative abundance of plants and birds during April-June 1996-1998. We found that vegetation characteristics in burned marshes did not differ from those of unburned marshes by the first summer post-burn and that winter burning did not affect bird species richness or species composition. Birds/survey for all species combined and for sparrows (primarily seaside sparrows [Ammodramus maritimus]) did not differ between burned and unburned marshes during the first or third summers post-burn, but were 2 times greater in burned than in unburned marshes during the second summer post-burn. Our results indicate that winter burning for waterfowl is compatible with management for other marsh birds, provided that measures ensuring sufficient winter cover for passerines are included in management plans. Number of icterids/survey was greatest and sparrows/survey was least in intermediate impounded marshes compared to other marsh-management types. Sparrows generally were most abundant in brackish and saline unimpounded marshes, indicating that continued loss of unimpounded marsh habitat could impact coastal sparrow populations.},

abstract={Preferences for foraging in particular tree species have been well documented in a variety of bird species, but underlying reasons remain little investigated. Understanding the causal bases for such patterns of habitat use can help to elucidate mechanisms of habitat selection and, therefore, community organization and structure. I experimentally tested the hypothesis that fine-scale foliage structure of two deciduous tree species influences the foraging behavior of three small, insectivorous bird species. On sugar maple (Acer saccharum), with its orbicular leaves elevated above the branch, Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens) and American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) captured prey predominantly from lower leaf surfaces, whereas Black-throated Green Warblers (Dendroica virens) captured prey predominantly from upper leaf surfaces. In contrast, on yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), with its oblong-ovate leaves held within the plane of the supporting branch, all three bird species captured prey disproportionately from upper leaf surfaces. Overall, aerial maneuvers were used more frequently to capture prey from upper than from lower leaf surfaces on sugar maple, but the opposite occurred on yellow birch, where non-aerial maneuvers were used more frequently to capture prey from upper than from lower leaf surfaces. Those results indicate that the leaf surface from which prey are more easily captured (with less energetically costly non-aerial maneuvers) differs between those tree species. Experimental manipulation of leaf dispersion and distance to prey demonstrated that leaf dispersion is the chief determinant of prey capture location (upper vs. lower leaf surfaces), and that distance to prey is the chief determinant of prey capture maneuver (aerial vs. non-aerial). When foraging on artificial branches in which vertical distance between branches was systematically increased experimentally, Black-throated Green Warblers captured a significantly smaller proportion of prey from lower surfaces of leaves on the upper branch than did Black-throated Blue Warblers. Taken together, these results indicate that different tree species, as well as different locations within tree species, present insectivorous birds with distinct foraging environments and, therefore, constitute distinct foraging microhabitats. Furthermore, even closely related bird species that are generally similar morphologically respond in behaviorally unique ways to differences in foliage structure. For those reasons, forest management practices that enhance tree species diversity could concomitantly enhance foraging opportunities (niche diversity) for forest insectivores and may thus help to promote high bird species diversity and maintain abundant populations.},

abstract={Intuitively, biological diversity would apparently seem the most unambiguous and easily studied of ecological concepts. However, when we look for a suitable numerical definition, we find that no single diversity index adequately summarizes community structure. One reason for this drawback is that different diversity indices confound the qualities of species richness and dominance concentration in a single number. Consequendy, the characterization of community diversity can be substantially improved by substituting a parametric index family for traditional diversity indices. While traditional diversity indices supply point descriptions of community structure, according to parametric diversity indices, there is a continuum of possible diversity measures, which differ only in their sensitivity to the presence of rare species in the formulation of the indices. In this paper we first summarize the role of Rényi’s generalized information for parametric biodiversity characterization. Then, we show that Rényi’s generalized information can be expressed as a simple linear combination of the information associated to species richness and dominance concentration. Raunkiaer’s life-form spectra of a Mediterranean garrigue in southern France one year and five years after fire are used to clarify the ideas discussed. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Riparian habitats typically support high diversity and density of both plants and animals. With the dramatic loss of riparian habitats, restoring them has become a priority among conservation practitioners. Diversity and density of avian species tend to increase following riparian restoration, but little is known about how restored habitats function to meet particular species' needs. Habitat structure is an important factor affecting species diversity and density and can influence nest-site selection and reproductive success. To evaluate habitat restoration, we examined interactions between habitat structure, nest-site selection, and nesting success in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) nesting in restored, mature, and young naturally regenerating stands of riparian forest. We found that stand types differed markedly in structure, and that habitat structure influenced both nest-site selection and rates of nest loss to predation. Comparison of habitat structure among the three stand types indicated that restored stands offered fewer acceptable nest sites and poorer protection from nest predation. Concordant with those differences in habitat structure, Song Sparrows showed trends toward less density in restored stands than in mature forest, and had poorer nesting success as a result of predation.},

abstract={In Morvan, one of the regions of France with the most numerous introduced Douglas-fir plantations, birds settle in the stands as early as the first preliminary clearcutting. The bird community then changes progressively during the cutting cycle, according to an ecological succession roughly similar to those observed in other analogous plantations (e.g. pines, beech). Schematically, this ecological succession goes through three main stages: (1) a pioneer phase (during the first ten years) when spontaneous vegetation develops vigorously among young Douglas-firs: open-space and low vegetation birds such as pipits, Stonechat, Yellowhammer, then Dunnock, Bullfinch and warblers, enter such places; (2) an intermediate phase defined by Douglas-fir very strongly dominant over all other vegetation and pioneer species disappearing; at that stage (which lasts several dozens of years) the bird community is reduced both in species and individual numbers and is mainly based on generalist (e.g. Song Thrush, Robin) or conifer-specialist (e.g. Gold- and Firecrests, Coal and Crested Tits) forest birds; (3) in old stands (rare), the bird community becomes rich again because Douglas-firs are well grown and allow grasses and bushes to recover. The ornithological poverty of the intermediate stages (which is also observed in other similar types of even-aged plantations) seems best explained by the sylvicultural treatment (i.e. almost single-cohort stands) than by Douglas-fir per se. The phenomenon is however more pronounced with Douglas-fir because of its very important domination over grassy and bushy vegetation. Moreover one observes that in these dense stands of intermediate age the smallest edge effect (either on edges or in gaps) goes with an increase in bird species richness. These observations allow one to expect better conditions for birds in Douglas-fir plantations if they were harvested in less dense, mixed-species or uneven-aged stands.},

abstract={The non-apoid flower-visiting fauna of Everglades National Park (ENP), Florida, was surveyed during 1995-1997 as part of a community pollinator survey. One hundred and thirty one sampling trips were made to four areas of Everglades National Park (Shark Valley, Chekika, Long Pine Key (LPK), and Flamingo). Species-month curves indicate that the sampling effort resulted in capture of most of the flower-visiting animal species in the park. A total of 143 insects and 1 bird species were recorded. Diptera were the most diverse group (55 spp.), followed by Lepidoptera (42 spp.) and non-apoid Hymenoptera (34 spp.). The majority of species were rare (56% of species were found on fewer than five trips). The highest diversity of species was found from January to May during the peak flowering period in some plant communities. The greatest total diversity was found in Long Pine Key and Shark Valley had the lowest diversity. Chekika and Flamingo were intermediate in diversity. Animals visited 178 plant species, ∼26% of the potentially animal pollinated Angiosperm diversity of the park. Twenty-five species of plants had only non-apoid flower visitors; the majority of these species had only visits by Lepidoptera. Potentially important pollinator species include members of the Syrphidae, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. However, many of the flower-visiting species may not be effective pollinators. This study will be useful for designing sampling protocols for including invertebrates in assessments of ecological restoration underway in the Everglades ecosystem and for more detailed studies of the importance of non-apoid flower-visitors as effective pollinators.},

abstract={In the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, flood control has led to a drastic reduction in the area of forest habitat and altered the patchwork of forest cover types. Silvicultural management of the remaining fragmented forests has changed to reflect the altered hydrology of the forests, current economic conditions of the area, and demand for forest products. Because forest type and silvicultural management impact forest birds, differences in avian productivity within these forests directly impact bird conservation. To assist in conservation planning, we evaluated daily nest survival, nest predation rates, and brood parasitism rates of forest birds in relation to different forest cover types and silvicultural management strategies within this floodplain. Within bottomland hardwood forests, nest success of blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea, 13%), eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus, 28%), indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea, 18%), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis, 22%), and yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus, 18%) did not differ from that within intensively managed cottonwood plantations. However, average daily survival of 542 open-cup nests of 19 bird species in bottomland hardwoods (0.9516 ± 0.0028, ∼27% nest success) was greater than that of 543 nests of 18 species in cottonwood plantations (0.9298 ± 0.0035, ∼15% nest success). Differences in daily nest survival rates likely resulted from a combination of differences in the predator community - particularly fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) - and a marked difference in species composition of birds breeding within these 2 forest types. At least 39% of nests in bottomland hardwood forests and 65% of nests in cottonwood plantations were depredated. Rates of parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were greater in managed cottonwoods (24%) than in bottomland hardwoods (9%). Nest success in planted cottonwood plantations for 18 species combined (∼14%), and for yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens, 7%), eastern towhee (14%), indigo bunting (14%), and northern cardinal (17%) did not differ from nest success in cottonwood plantations that were coppiced from root sprouts following pulpwood harvest. Within bottomland hardwood forests, uneven-aged group-selection timber harvest reduced the combined daily nest survival of all species from 0.958 to 0.938, which reduced nest success by about 14%. Specifically, timber harvest reduced nest success of species that nest in the forest midstory and canopy, such as Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) - from 32% before harvest to 14% after harvest. Conversely, those species that nest primarily in the shrubby understory - such as northern cardinal - were not affected by timber harvest and maintained an overall nest success of about 33%. Thus, birds nesting in the understory of bottomland hardwood forests are not adversely impacted by selective timber harvest, but there is a short-term reduction in nest success for birds that nest in the canopy and midstory.},

abstract={The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) is well adapted to fire-maintained pine ecosystems of the southeastern United States. Management practices vary greatly among land ownerships. In some wilderness areas and state parks, a "no management" policy has eliminated use of prescribed fire, artificial cavities, and woodpecker translocation, tools that have proved effective elsewhere in recovering woodpecker populations. We compared forests with essentially "no management" to actively managed forests of similar tree ages and similar red-cockaded woodpecker population demographics. We also compared sites that had received no management in the past to the same sites after management. In every case, populations in forests that did not use state-of-the-art management for woodpeckers declined severely compared to those in managed forests. Because managed forests typically used all available management techniques concurrently, it was not possible to separate and rank effectiveness of specific management activities. One exception was the Wade Tract in Georgia, where prescribed fire was the primary activity for herbaceous layer and hardwood management in a high-density, stable woodpecker population. Wilderness areas, which are intended to be pristine places that preserve biodiversity, are losing red-cockaded woodpeckers, a keystone species in the ecosystem, at an alarming rate. Collectively, 9 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers were present in 4 wilderness areas in Texas national forests in 1983. At the close of the millennium, only one woodpecker group remained and its continued existence is unlikely without management. The very fragmented features of present-day landscapes and intervention by humans impair the effectiveness of natural disturbance processes, primarily growing-season fire, that historically produced and maintained open pine savannas with grass-forb herbaceous layers in the pre-Columbian forests of the southeastern U.S.; therefore, active management must be used if the red-cockaded woodpecker is to persist.},

abstract={A population of Little Owls breeding in nestboxes in farmland in southwestern Germany near Basel/Switzerland (280 m a.s.l.) was monitored. The number of breeding pairs increased in the seventies, when a conservation programme started and more and more nestboxes were provided in the study area. After a maximum of 24 breeding pairs in 1978, the population collapsed, with 5 to 7 breeding pairs left in the late eighties and only 1 to 3 in the early nineties. Fledglings disappeared rapidly from the study area, and many females were lost after breeding only once. One male reached the age of 10 years and probably spent its whole life in the same local area. Reasons for the decline of the small population are discussed. Losses to House Martens Martes foina were substantial. It is likely that the dense vegetation cover impairs hunting on the ground, especially in years when the hay is not harvested due to prolonged periods of rainy weather. It is suggested that management programmes should be coordinated over large areas. They must focus on habitat quality, favouring pastures. Only specially designed nestboxes (Furrington 1979) should be used to keep martens out.},

abstract={We reveiw some key features of scientific inquiry and experimental design and apply them to studies of the effects of forest management on songbirds. We use examples from contemporary studies in eastern deciduous forests. Scientific methods, observational versus experimental studies, replication and randomization, choice of factors and models, and response variables are important elements in designing research approaches that address effects of forest management. There are significant gaps in our knowledge on the effects of forest management on birds. Many studies have addressed effects of management on species abundance, but we can make only limited inferences from most of these. The design of studies is complicated because of the range of forest management practices, variation in bird species responses, differences among forest types, and the effects of confounding factors such as landscape effects. Few studies have addressed effects of forest management on the reproductive success of forest songbirds. We believe the reliability of our knowledge in this area will be improved most quickly if we use current knowledge to generate hypotheses, use a mix of well-designed observational and manipulative experiments to test them, and more frequently measure reproductive success in addition to bird abundance.},

Field observations were conducted at three forested locations on coastal cheniers for three years (1993-95) in the spring and at one location for three years (1996-98) in autumn to determine species presence and diet. One hundred and twenty-eight species were present during the spring and 103 species in autumn. The majority of these species were migrants (103 species in spring and 89 species in autumn) and the majority of these were Nearctic/Neotropical species (73 species in spring and 66 species in autumn). The diet of these migrants was more variable than expected. Many insectivorous species were observed to consume seeds, fruit and nectar as well as insects. Because of these varied diets, many species serve as seed dispersers, occasional pollinators and important predators of herbivorus insects. Wooded areas were found to be important in providing food, cover and water for migrating species. A review of historical changes in the landscape of this area is presented and management practices designed to restore wooded habitat to this area are proposed.},

abstract={It is becoming increasingly clear that the spatial structure of landscapes affects the habitat choices and abundance of wildlife. In contrast to wildlife management based on preservation of critical habitat features such as nest sites on a beach or mast trees, it has not been obvious how to incorporate spatial structure into management plans. We present techniques to accomplish this goal. We used multiscale logistic regression models developed previously for neotropical migrant bird species habitat use in South Carolina (USA) as a basis for these techniques. Based on these models we used a spatial optimization technique to generate optimal maps (probability of occurrence, P = 1.0) for each of seven species. To emulate management of a forest for maximum species diversity, we defined the objective function of the algorithm as the sum of probabilities over the seven species, resulting in a complex map that allowed all seven species to coexist. The map that allowed for coexistence is not obvious, must be computed algorithmically, and would be difficult to realize using rules of thumb for habitat management. To assess how management of a forest for a single species of interest might affect other species, we analyzed tradeoffs by gradually increasing the weighting on a single species in the objective function over a series of simulations. We found that as habitat was increasingly modified to favor that species, the probability of presence for two of the other species was driven to zero. This shows that whereas it is not possible to simultaneously maximize the likelihood of presence for multiple species with divergent habitat preferences, compromise solutions are possible at less than maximal likelihood in many cases. Our approach suggests that efficiency of habitat management for species diversity can by maximized for even small landscapes by incorporating spatial context. The methods we present are suitable for wildlife management, endangered species conservation, and nature reserve design.},

abstract={Prescribed fires have been used as a forest vegetation management tool in the eastern United States during the past decade, but concerns have been raised about direct or indirect adverse effects on Neotropical migrant bird species that nest in forest interior habitats. Prescribed fires were set in 1993 and 1995 in a mature hardwood forest in southern Indiana, USA, to reduce shade-tolerant understory woody vegetation and thereby increase the abundance and diversity of ground layer vegetation and seedlings of tree species that require moderate light levels (e.g., Quercus L. spp.). The objective of this study was to determine if prescribed fires reduced the abundance or reproductive success of ground- and shrub-nesting Neotropical migrant bird species. The burned area and an adjacent unburned area were studied during the summers of 1996 and 1997. An unlimited-radius point count method was used to determine relative abundance. Nests were monitored to determine fledging success. Vegetation structure was quantified at nest sites and at random points to assess fire effects and bird nest-site selection. Abundance of birds in this nesting guild was greater in the unburned area during both years. The greatest difference in abundance was for ovenbird (Seiurus aurocappilus Linnaeus). The probability of nest success for all bird species in this nesting guild combined, determined by the Mayfield method, was significantly lower in the burned area (0.125) than in the unburned area (0.291). Abundance of the brood parasite brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater Boddaert) did not differ between burned and unburned areas. However, the probability of nest success for parasitized nests (0.140) was lower than that of unparasitized nests (0.735). The mean number of host young fledged from successful nests was significantly lower in parasitized nests (1.3) than from unparasitized nests (3.0). Prescribed fires significantly reduced vegetative cover in the burned area. Nest sites in the burned area had higher vegetative cover than random points, indicating that birds may have selected nest sites that were less affected by the fire. While prescribed fires that burn in a 'natural' hit-or-miss pattern may retain nesting habitat for bird species in this nesting guild, lower nest success in the burned area indicates that management for desirable vegetation and for this nesting guild may not be compatible within the same forest stand at the same time. This argues for planning at a landscape level to attain objectives for both vegetation composition and maintenance of bird species diversity.},

abstract={Timber harvest projections for aspen-dominated forests in the prairie region of Canada include a truncation of the current age distribution, whereby old stands of fire origin will become rarer on the landscape, while young, post-harvest stands will increase in abundance. To determine the effects this harvesting strategy might have on communities of breeding forest birds, we conducted point counts in young forests regenerated from clear-cutting (15-25 years), and mature (50-60 years), and old (80-110 years) forests regenerated from fire. Avian species richness was highest in old stands at the point-count station, forest stand, and landscape level. Increased species richness with forest age was associated with increases in the relative abundance of canopy- and cavity-nesting species. At local scales (station and stand), species richness of ground- and shrub-nesting birds was similar among forest age-classes. However, as determined by rarefaction analyses appropriate at the landscape scale, ground-nesting species were more common in young and old forests, while shrub-nesting species were more common in young and mature forests. Density of deciduous shrubs was an important factor influencing the abundance of species like American redstart, Canada warbler, and chestnut-sided warbler. An increase in conifer in old stands resulted in greater use by conifer- or mixedwood associated species such as bay-breasted warbler, magnolia warbler, and ruby-crowned kinglet. Our data indicate that vegetation and structural characteristics such as shrub density should be considered when prescribing sustainable forestry objectives. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The conservation of biological diversity has become one of the important goals of managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. Ecologists and forest resource managers need measures to judge the success or failure of management regimes designed to sustain biological diversity. The relationships between potential indicator species and total biodiversity are not well established. Carefully designed studies are required to test relationships between the presence and abundance of potential indicator species and other taxa and the maintenance of critical ecosystem processes in forests. Other indicators of biological diversity in forests, in addition or as alternatives to indicator species, include what we call structure-based indicators. These are stand-level and landscape-level (spatial) features of forests such as stand structural complexity and plant species composition, connectivity, and heterogeneity. Although the adoption of practices to sustain (or recreate) key characteristics of forest ecosystems appear intuitively sensible and broadly consistent with current knowledge, information is lacking to determine whether such stand- and landscape-level features of forests will serve as successful indices of (and help conserve) biodiversity. Given our limited knowledge of both indicator species and structure-based indicators, we advocate the following four approaches to enhance biodiversity conservation in forests: (1) establish biodiversity priority areas (e.g., reserves) managed primarily for the conservation of biological diversity; (2) within production forests, apply structure-based indicators including structural complexity, connectivity, and heterogeneity; (3) using multiple conservation strategies at multiple spatial scales, spread out risk in wood production forests; and (4) adopt an adaptive management approach to test the validity of structure-based indices of biological diversity by treating management practices as experiments. These approaches would aim to provide new knowledge to managers and improve the effectiveness of current management strategies.},

abstract={The impact of logging operations on bird species abundance and diversity was studied over an eight-year period using a variable-circular plot bird survey procedure and a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design in karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forest in south-western Australia. The magnitude and spatial extent of impact was assessed from sample points in five bands parallel to the edge between clearfelled areas and mature forest (unburnt-forest, burnt-forest, forest-edge, gap-edge and gap). A total of 24 748 birds of 53 species were detected within 30 m of the observer during the study. Bird species abundance, and diversity, were similar in the five bands prior to treatment, and observed differences could be attributed to spatial patterns of flowering in the overstorey. Following logging, 19 of the 40 species that were detected more than five times showed changes in relative abundance (including both, increases and decreases) in one or more bands. Gaps showed the greatest number of significant changes (15) and these were typically of the greatest magnitude over the four years studied post-treatment. Gap-edges showed fewer changes (six), while both, the burnt-forest (three) and forest-edge (nil) bands showed few changes in relative abundance. Both, the number of species detected (for a given sampling effort), and species diversity declined in gap and gap-edge bands following logging. Nevertheless, variation in bird counts between successive seasons and years necessitates considerable replication before changes can be reliably assigned to disturbance impacts. In addition, the long period before maturation of the overstorey suggests that the local impact of logging and burning is likely to extend well beyond the life of experimental studies. Our results support the implementation of a well-dispersed system of retained mature forest along road, river and stream zones within the regeneration mosaic. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Monitoring of nests of the Visayan Tarictic Hornbill Penelopides panini panini on the Philippine island of Panay revealed thus far undescribed information on the breeding biology of this species. Females occupied nest holes in March-April, after which two or three eggs are laid. Although cooperative breeding is suspected for the genus, at two nests no helpers were recorded. Nest-concealment behaviour was observed in the adult male. After a nestling period of 55-58 days, the adult female and one juvenile left the nest simultaneously. Immature birds resemble their respective sex. Nest site characteristics of 24 nests of the Tarictic Hornbill and two of the Writhed-billed Hornbill Aceros waldeni, respectively, were recorded on Mt Balabag, Panay Mountain Range. Tarictic Hornbill nests were situated in living as well as dead trees, at an average height of 11 m. Cavity compass direction was uniformly distributed around the circle. Nests are aggregated within the habitat, with a mean nearest-neighbour distance of 190 m. Writhed-billed Hornbills may require larger trees for nesting than Tarictic Hornbills. Nest density was calculated to be around three Tarictic Hornbill nests and 0.2-0.3 Writhed-billed Hornbill nests per square kilometre. Given a total amount of suitable hornbill habitat on Panay of 225-450 km2, about 750-1,000 Tarictic Hornbill breeding pairs and 60-100 Writhed-billed Hornbill breeding pairs may remain on Panay.},

abstract={Structural differences between centres and edges of ancient oak-hazel woodlands within a conifer forest matrix were established and significant differences were related to the occurrence and abundance of vascular plants and birds. The edges did not demonstrate any higher abundance of dead trees, fallen limbs or branches or stumps. However, edges kept a higher proportion of young deciduous trees. The frequencies of invading plant species from the conifer forest were negatively, and of total bird species positively, related to the proportion of large old trees in the edges. Total number of plant species, woodland plants, or breeding pairs of birds were not clearly related to the proportion of old trees. Light-excluding bushes and young trees may favour conifer forest plants adapted to a similar dark environment. Old trees may provide more niches for temporary exploitation by mobile birds. Thus, the more rapid tree regeneration at forest edges should be circumvented by selection of large reserves, suitable juxtaposition of similar habitat types or by management particularly directed against excessive tree regeneration.},

abstract={Recovering predator populations may present problems for conservationists if their prey are of economic or conservation value. We address this issue by examining the conflict between raptor conservation and management of Red Grouse (Lagopus 1. scoticus) in Britain. Heather moorland is a distinctive habitat that supports an important assemblage of breeding birds. Large areas of moorland are managed by private landowners for shooting grouse. Although grouse shooting benefits conservation by retaining heather moorland, it is currently unclear whether grouse management directly benefits other upland birds. Human persecution has greatly restricted the range and abundance of most raptor species in Britain. Following the introduction of bird protection laws, the decline in gamekeeping, and the restriction of organochlorine pesticides, raptor populations have started to recover. Persecution of raptors on grouse moors is widespread and limits the range and abundance of Hen Harriers (Circus cyaneus), Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus), and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). In some circumstances, raptor predation can reduce both the breeding density and productivity of Red Grouse. Limitation of grouse populations through raptor predation is most likely to occur where raptors are at high density because of the abundance of alternative prey, and grouse are at low density either because of poor management or the cyclic nature of some grouse populations. In the long term, habitat management may reduce densities of alternative prey, leading to reductions in raptor densities and their predation on grouse. More active intervention may be required, however, if grouse moors are to remain viable in the short-term. Current research is focused on manipulating harrier diet through diversionary feeding. Complementary research is needed to investigate methods to reduce raptor numbers locally while ensuring their national status.},

abstract={Since 1975 the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers has managed and irrigated 440 ha along the lower Snake River in Washington as mitigation for four dams constructed 1962-1975. We investigated avian use of irrigated Habitat Management Units (HMUs), compared to non-irrigated sites and streams that entered the fiver. We conducted bird surveys at 25 sites in summer and fall 1997 and in spring 1998. We compared avian abundance, species richness, and species diversity among habitats and seasons. We detected an average of 169 birds and 33 species at HMUs, 120 birds and 28 species at non-irrigated sites, and 63 birds and 23 species along streams in all three seasons. We detected an average of 29 species/site in summer, 31 in fall, and 22 in spring. Species diversity, as measured by the Shannon-Wiener function, was higher in summer, indicating that large flocks of a few species were common in fall and spring. These data demonstrated that the lower Snake River is an important stopover site for migrating birds. We detected an average of 30 more bird species than a study conducted on the same area in 1974. The increase in species richness is attributed to the development of HMUs and to natural succession of palustrine vegetation since dam construction. Future potential changes in reservoir levels, such as breaching of dams, will undoubtedly affect bird communities along the lower Snake River in all seasons. However, our data demonstrated that habitat perturbations can be partially mitigated by habitat enhancement and management.},

abstract={Comparisons are made between a virgin forest remnant (primeval forest) and a lightly managed (near-to-nature) forest with regard to horizontal forest structures, the structure of forest stands, and the diversity of plant and bird species. In the virgin forest remnant the proportion of canopy gaps is smaller, there are no stands in the developmental phase of a pole stand (10 < cm d.b.h. < 30 cm), and both the growing stock and the proportion of less vigorous trees are considerably greater. In addition, there is a higher percentage of dead trees, a smaller proportion of minor tree species and a considerably lower diversity of plants. The diversity of bird species is similar for each forest type, but rare bird species are confined to the virgin forest remnant. The biological differences between the two types of forest have led to changes in the physical site conditions. The results of the research are valuable in assessing the consequences of near-to-nature forest management.},

abstract={Retention of residual trees in even-aged harvested stands is an alternative to traditional clearcutting, seed-tree, and shelterwood systems, but little is known about effects of new even-aged retention methods on bird communities. Clearcutting on Pennsylvania state forests recently has been replaced by a new forest-management practice termed even-aged reproduction stands with reservation guidelines (hereafter, EAR stands), in which high densities of trees in multiple crown and size classes (101 live trees/ha ±28 SE on study sites) of both commercially and non-commercially important tree species are permanently reserved to maintain species and structural diversity. We compared habitat structure and breeding-bird communities between EAR stands (harvested) and reference stands (unharvested) in 2 state forests of Pennsylvania in 1997-98 and related bird abundance within harvested stands to differences in habitat characteristics among EAR stands and the surrounding landscapes. Total abundance of all bird species combined, abundances of early-successional and edge-habitat guilds, and abundances of many early-successional bird species were significantly higher in EAR stands than in reference stands, but abundances of the forest habitat guild and of 8 forest-associated species were lower in EAR stands. Although EAR stands provide suitable habitat for bird species associated with early-successional forests, abundances of species associated with mature forests were lower in EAR stands than in reference stands despite retention of residual trees. However, some species of forest birds (e.g., red-eyed vireos [Vireo olivaceus]), which usually are absent from recent clearcut stands until 12-20 years post-harvest, were often detected in EAR stands. Thus, residual trees in EAR stands provide to forest birds habitat components that are generally lacking in clearcut stands. Because abundances of both forest habitat and forest-canopy nesting guilds declined and abundance of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) increased with size of EAR stands (especially when >20 ha), managers should consider limiting the size of EAR stands.},

abstract={Records of bird species observed by F.L. Whitlock near Wilson Inlet in the period 1905-19 (mostly 1907, 1909 and 1910), hitherto unpublished, were collated from museum specimens and archives. Whitlock noted 94 species comprising 65 landbirds, 10 waterbirds, 7 seabirds, and 12 non-breeding waders. Records of bird species made by other ornithologists from 1889 to 1913 indicate that the original avifauna of this region comprised 81 landbird species. In the past century four of these species (Burhinus grallarius, Pezoporus wallicus, Atrichornis clamosus and Dasyornis longirostris), as well as the waterbird Ixobrychus flavicollis, appear to have become locally extinct. Deforestation for agricultural development, with the subsequent creation of parkland and pasture, has allowed 10 landbird and 8 waterbird species to colonize the area. Whitlock's records of the seabird species Eudyptula minor and Pterodroma macroptera nesting on islands in Wilson Inlet are otherwise unreported in the literature. A comprehensive synthesis of eyewitness accounts of Aboriginal burning practices in the period 1791-1840 indicates that anthropogenic fire was frequent, prevalent in summer, and spatially extensive but in patches varying in area from c. 10-2000 ha, with a tendency for riparian vegetation to be burnt less often than uplands. Such fires could be set at the hottest part of the day, with multiple ignitions on the one day, and under windy conditions. Three bird species that are sensitive to frequent fire and now considered to be extinct locally are presumed to have had patchy distributions confined to those limited parts of the landscape naturally protected from frequent burning (vegetation along higher order streams, on steep south-facing slopes, or surrounded by expanses of granite). In addition, some of these sites may have had totemic significance to Aborigines and were thus protected from more intense or frequent fire by periodic burning using low intensity fire in spring, late autumn or early winter. The vulnerability of naturally insularized populations to inappropriate intensity or frequency of fire may explain the early demise of these species following European settlement. Few other parts of Western Australia have an avifauna so well documented at a time when agricultural development had only recently commenced. The Denmark area would therefore provide an appropriate focal region for documenting ongoing environmental change as indicated by the avifauna.},

abstract={Effective conservation and habitat restoration strategies in human-dominated landscapes must be based on an understanding of the ways that habitat loss and fragmentation affect native species. We studied avian foraging behavior and patterns of occurrence in the highly fragmented agricultural landscape of the Kellerberrin district of Western Australia to better understand the factors underlying species declines and losses. We conducted three surveys of 30 wandoo woodland patches that ranged in size from 1.3 to 101.3 ha. Some patches were part of larger remnants of native vegetation, ranging in size from 3.5 to 1204.8 ha and including other habitat types. We examined the extent to which patterns of species richness, the occurrence and composition of foraging guilds, and the occurrence of individual species varied with features of woodland patches, remnants, and the surrounding landscape. Using multiple regression analyses, the best model for species richness included terms for the log of remnant area, the patch diversity of each remnant, and woodland patch condition. We delineated eight foraging guilds based on similarities in the substrate/method dimension and also using multidimensional scaling analyses. The best model for the number of foraging guilds present in a patch included a single variable representing shrub density. Analyses of nestedness based on guilds and on individual species were both significant; and for the latter, 11 of 13 species made a significant contribution to the overall pattern. We derived separate models for the occurrence of each of eight species and one guild using multiple logistic regression. Significant models included, either separately or in combination, the following variables: the log of remnant area, patch area, the total area of woodland in a remnant, and the distance to other woodland patches. For four species that had sufficient records to examine shifts in foraging behavior, we observed significant differences in both foraging methods and substrates with changes in remnant size and/or the presence of other species or guilds. Our analyses indicated that remnant area was the best single variable for measures of community structure, in part because it was strongly correlated with other variables, such as total woodland area, patch area, remnant patch diversity, number of corridor connections, and measures of isolation. For foraging guilds and for individual species, variables other than remnant area assumed greater importance. The strong patterns of nestedness for foraging guilds by remnant area may reflect the diminished availability of certain prey items in small, degraded remnants. This notion is reinforced by the relatively high species and guild richness recorded in small patches that were either fenced from grazing or embedded in large remnants. The nested pattern of species within some foraging guilds, however, indicates the importance of additional aspects of their ecology. A focus on richness alone may mask the unique responses of bird species to fragmentation and may divert attention from important considerations in the development of land-use policy and reserve acquisition.},

Bird communities varied among patch sizes, forest ages, and disturbance types. Immediately post-disturbance, bird communities from large patches (>100 residual trees) were more similar to those from old forest than were communities from small patches (≤10 residual trees). Birds that nest or forage in open or riparian habitats had highest densities in small patches 2 years post-harvest, whereas birds that nest in large snags had highest densities in small patches 2 years post-fire. Throughout the chronosequence following both disturbance types, birds from small patches became more similar to those from old forest. Birds that nest and forage in small trees and shrubs were common 15 and 30 years post-disturbance, and generalist forest birds were common 60 years post-disturbance.

abstract={Ecological communities are spatially and temporally variable in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic forces. It is not always clear, however, if spatial and temporal variability leads to instability in communities. Instability may result from strong biotic interactions or from stochastic processes acting on small populations. 1 used 10-15 yr of annual data from the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research site to examine whether plant, breeding bird, grasshopper, and small mammal communities in tallgrass prairie exhibit stability or directional change in response to different experimentally induced fire frequencies. Based on ordination and ANOVA, plant and grasshopper communities on annually burned sites differed significantly from plant and grasshopper communities on less frequently burned sites. Breeding birds and small mammals differed among sites as well, but these differences were not clearly related to disturbance frequency. A modified time series analysis indicated that plant communities were undergoing directional change (unstable) on all watersheds, regardless of fire frequency. Contrary to expectations, directional change was greatest on the annually burned sites and lowest on the infrequently burned sites. Unlike the plant communities, breeding bird, grasshopper, and small mammal communities were temporally stable, despite high-compositional variability from 1 yr to the next. Stability among the consumer communities within these dynamic plant communities occurs because three-dimensional vegetation structure does not change over time, despite changes in plant species composition. Evidence suggests that instability in the plant community results from strong biotic interactions among temporally persistent core species and stochastic dynamics among infrequent satellite species. Overall, community stability cannot be assessed if the pattern of temporal dynamics is unknown. Long-term empirical studies of different taxa under different disturbance regimes are needed to determine over what time frames and spatial scales communities may be stable. Such studies are essential for the development of generalities regarding the relationship between disturbance frequency and community stability in terrestrial and aquatic systems.},

abstract={Siren (1955) studied understorey species composition, tree stand properties and humus-layer thickness in 64 unlogged forest stands on topographically and pedologically comparable sites. The stands were of even age (6 - 300 yr), stocked with the first or second tree generation after wildfire. The view of Siren and several authors after him, that the vegetation of old-growth boreal Picea forests is homogeneous on a broad scale, was examined by applying, in parallel, the partial variants of two ordination methods (DCA and PCA) to Siren's vegetation data. Two main vegetation gradients were found: a major gradient running from recently burnt plots with prominence of pioneer species to plots with stand age > 100 yr, a well stocked tree layer and a thick humus layer, dominance of feather-mosses and ample occurrence of shade-tolerant as well as light-preferring vascular plant species, and a second gradient along which first- and second-generation plots segregate. The more prominent element of Betula trees in first- than in second-generation stands < 100 yr contributed to the latter. A minor third gradient related to humus-layer thickness was recovered by partial DCA only. The main vegetation gradient reappeared in separate ordinations of data from 47 mature forest stands (> 100 yr), but without being correlated with forest age. Variation among mature-forest stands in the importance of pioneer species is considered mainly to be brought about by fine-scale disturbance processes such as tree uprooting. Increasing importance of factors operating on withinstand scales [development of a varied gap structure and stronger gradients in tree influence (radiation at ground level), soil moisture, soil depth and nutrient availability] with time is also reflected in the second and third mature-forest ordination axes. Possible implications of the results for conservation of biological diversity and monitoring of changes in boreal forests are discussed.},

abstract={Loss and alteration of breeding habitat have been proposed as causes of declines in several Neotropical migrant bird populations. We conducted a 4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning and forest thinning on breeding wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR) in Georgia. We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates, and apparent annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry, and mist netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities (P = 0.25); wood thrush density, ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/10 ha. No radiomarked male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4 years, but female weekly survival was 0.981 ± 0.014 (SE) for females (n = 63) and 0.976 = 0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual adult survival was 0.579 (SE = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed burning did not reduce adult or juvenile survival during the breeding season or apparent annual adult survival. Annual population growth (γ) at PNWR was 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32-1.63), and the considerable uncertainty in this prediction underscores the need for long-term monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants. Population growth increased on experimental compartments after the burn and thin (95% CI before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05), while control compartment γ declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after = 0.87-0.92). We found no evidence that the current management regime at PNWR, designed to improve red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat, negatively affected wood thrushes.},

abstract={The avifauna (land and waterbirds) of the forests of southwest Western Australia is circumscribed by reference to information recorded in the period 1840 to 1998. A database was assembled from 272 published and unpublished bird lists, and this was supplemented with records extracted from a systematic search of the primary ornithological literature. In excess of 7 000 records were located. The original forest avifauna (just before the impact of European settlers became pronounced) consisted of 112 breeding species (81 land, 31 water). Salient characteristics of this avifauna include: only 1 species is confined (as a breeding species) to the primaeval forest ecosystem; 53 species occur throughout the forests; 32 and 13 species are restricted to its eastern or southern portions respectively; most species occur extensively outside of the forests (66 species to the west, north, east and south; 33 species to the west, north and east); 52 per cent of landbird species are insectivores; about 20 per cent of the landbird fauna migrates from the forest in varying degrees in winter; 67 per cent of landbird species nest in the overstorey or understorey; and landbirds in streamside forests occur at higher densities than in upland forests. The distribution of 5 species - Leipoa ocellata (Malleefowl), Cacatua pastinator (Western long-billed corella), Atrichornis clamosus (Noisy scrub-bird), Falcunculus frontatus (Crested shrike-tit) and Rallus pectoralis (Lewin's rail) - is discussed in detail, with new or neglected information being provided. The landbird fauna of the primaeval forest is impoverished relative to elsewhere in the South West Land Division, particularly the region now known as the wheatbelt. The forests of south-west Western Australia have only about half of the number of bird species present in a similar-sized, comparable area in south-east Australia. The south-west forest avifauna is more similar to that present in the Mount Lofty Ranges (South Australia) than to the forest avifaunas of New South Wales or Tasmania. At local scales (1-100 ha), however, the number of landbird species present is similar in all forests in southern mainland Australia (20-25 breeding species). Overall density of bird populations in jarrah and karri forests is about one half of that in comparable forests in south-east Australia. Disturbances caused by European settlement have resulted in 4 species present in the primal forests contracting in geographical range, 2 species becoming extinct, and more than 90 species benefiting from provision of new habitats. Forest management has had limited impact on biodiversity and total abundance of birds. Prescribed burning under moist soil conditions has no impact on bird species richness in jarrah forest, but increases bird species richness in karri forest for 3-6 years. Total abundance of birds increases in both types of forest after prescribed burning. Planned burning under dry soil conditions increases both bird species richness and total abundance of birds. Wildfire reduces bird species richness. All of these changes are temporary. Thinning of jarrah forest does not change bird species richness, whereas cutting to gaps increases bird species richness. Clearfelling of karri forest initially reduces bird species richness; 12 years later about 85 per cent of the avifauna in mature stands is present in regrowth karri forest. Those species dependent on large hollows for nesting are unlikely to nest in unthinned regrowth forest younger than about 120 years. Open-cut mining for bauxite has a severe initial impact on bird species richness, but following rehabilitation there is a rapid return of bird species, with 85 per cent of species present before mining being recorded after 5 years. Species requiring large hollows for nesting cannot, however, nest in rehabilitated sites for many decades. The most severe, long term reduction in local bird species richness and total abundance is caused by dieback disease and by permanent removal of forest as in agriculture, urbanization, damming of rivers, and plantations of pine. However, an additional 75 species (51 land, 24 water) have been recorded within the forests following clearing for farming and towns. Of these species, 23 (17 land, 6 water) now breed, but only two of them (Aquila morphnoides Little eagle, Dacelo novaeguineae Laughing kookaburra) breed in forest. The policies and procedures in place to mitigate the impact of humans on the forest bird fauna and to promote the conservation of bird species are summarized. These include an extensive mosaic of protected areas (national parks, nature reserves, forest along roads, rivers and streams), a structural goal of 40 per cent of the forest being maintained at the mature or senescent stage, the retention of habitat trees for species dependent on hollows for nesting, and spatially and temporally diversified use of fire.},

abstract={In 1994 we began a study of the habitat relations and breeding biology of grassland birds in western New York. Most fields contained fewer than four grassland species, with Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorous) and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) being the two most common species. Species of management concern in the Northeast, such as Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) and Upland Sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda), were absent from the study area. Bird-habitat models generated through Principal Components Analysis and stepwise multiple regression indicated that field area, or variables correlated with area, explained most of the variation in overall grassland bird species richness (partial r2 = 0.43) and abundance (partial r2 = 0.60) and in the abundance of Bobolinks and Savannah Sparrows. Grassland birds were generally absent from fields smaller than 5 hectares. Areas with few shrubs and low horizontal heterogeneity supported more grassland bird species than did fields with more shrubs and high horizontal heterogeneity, and fields with shorter, less dense vegetation had more individuals than did fields with taller, dense vegetation. Few grassland birds occurred in fields planted in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) monocultures. More than 90 percent of all known nesting pairs fledged young by the end of the first week in July. Nest success was generally high; the proportion of nests fledging one or more young was 0.76 for Savannah Sparrows, 0.54 for Bobolinks, and 0.67 for Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna). Grassland bird populations in this study may benefit from management practices that increase field area, control shrub invasion, and encourage the growth of grasses other than switchgrass. The current low levels of grazing at Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge, with cattle allowed in pastures only after 15 July, do not appear to be harmful to grassland bird populations.},

abstract={In 1995 and 1996, two pairs of the white-backed woodpecker (WBW) were found nesting within a 63 ha mature thermophilic oak forest in S Slovakia. The WBW's home ranges were situated mostly in a sessile oak forest (proportion of sessile oaks > 80%) growing on steep slopes (> 40°) with a higher proportion of dead trees (> 6%) and with a lower crown cover of an upper tree layer (60-80%). Mean home-range size during breeding was 8.5 ha (6.3-9.9 ha). Nestlings appeared between 25-30 April and fledglings between 20-25 May, i.e. about 2-3 weeks sooner compared to other Dendrocopos species within the study plot. During the incubation and the nestling period the adults were extremely inconspicuous, so that only two nest holes were found. Both cavities were excavated into trunks of living sessile oaks with crown defoliation less than 10% at a height of 7 and 15 m. The food of adults during the growing season consisted mostly of the Scolytidae and Cerambycidae larvae (59.7% of foraging records), that of nestlings mostly of Geometridae, Noctuidae, and Tortricidae larvae (60.5% of foraging bouts, 70.4% of prey items). Food was taken only from oaks in the upper tree layer (100% of records) from the surface of the bark and leaves (47% of records) or excavated from trunks and branches of dying and dead oaks (51% of records).

abstract={Between 1990 and 1996, we monitored all natural tree holes and recorded their occupation by hole-nesting birds in a 156 ha woodland dominated by beech trees Fagus sylvatica on the Swiss Plateau. Each year. 347-363 tree holes were available, equivalent to a mean density of 2.3 tree holes/ha and 1.4 trees containing natural cavities/ha, 10 % of the tree holes were presumably excavated by Black Woodpeckers Dryocopus martius, most of the rest by Woodpeckers of the genus Dendrocopos and Picus. Black Woodpecker cavities were concentrated in only few trees, which made them especially vulnerable to forest management. Overall, the number of new cavities was roughly in balance with the number of losses. On average, 6 % of the tree holes were lost annually: without new holes, the stock of tree holes would have been reduced by 50 % in 11 years. Two thirds of losses were due to natural causes. Tree holes in dead wood were lost more frequently than those in live parts of trees. However, holes in live parts of trees have been lost more frequently to forest management measures than tree holes in dead wood. Population size of cavity-nesting birds did not seem to be limited by the availability of tree holes. Annually, 17-51 % of cavities of woodpeckers from the genus Dendrocopos and Picus were occupied by hole-nesting birds and 18-71 % of cavities of Black Woodpeckers, respectively. These rates refer to a subset of tree holes that have been occupied at least once during the time they were under control. The following implications for the protection of natural tree holes were formulated: (1) Protection of Black Woodpecker cavities, which are used by endangered secondary cavity-nesters (Stock Dove Columba oenas and Jackdaw Corvus monedula) should have first priority, (2) conservation measures should focus on cavities in live trees because such holes are most vulnerable to forest management measures and are less likely to be lost to natural causes, (3) conservation measures should focus on areas where tree hole availability limits the population of secondary cavity-nesters. In central Europe, this applies most likely to forests where population density of breeding Starlings Sturnus vulgaris is high, i.e. to areas below 800 m a.s.l., to forest edges and to orchards and hedges.},

abstract={Fallow fields represent a large proportion of cereal steppes in southern Portugal. A study of the bird populations using fallows in the Castro Verde region during the breeding season was made during spring 1996, with the objective of characterizing the bird community and describing relationships between bird density and vegetation structure, for selected species. For each of 50 transects, birds were counted once and variables related to vegetation structure were measured. Multivariate analyses were used to explore the relationships between bird density and habitat characteristics. The bird community of fallows was characterized by the numerical abundance of two species ? Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra (8.5 birds/km) and Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax (4.5 birds/km) ? which represented 60% of the total number of birds detected. Of the 28 bird species observed, only four others reached average relative densities greater than 1 bird/km: Great Bustard Otis tarda, Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis, Corn Bunting Miliaria calandra and Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla. The variables influencing bird density were related mainly to vegetation height, cover by bare ground and presence of shrubs. The results suggest that agricultural management practices which promote the simultaneous presence of fallows with different habitat characteristics will increase species diversity at the local level. The models built were also used to predict changes in bird populations as a consequence of changes in grazing intensity and land abandonment. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={To more effectively manage remaining native grasslands and declining populations of prairie passerine birds, linkages between disturbance regimes, vegetation, and bird abundance need to be more fully understood. Therefore, we examined bird-habitat relationships on mixed-grass prairie at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in northwestern North Dakota, where prescribed fire has been used as a habitat management tool since the 1970s. We sampled bird abundance on upland prairie at 310 point count locations during 1993 and 1994 breeding seasons. We also measured vegetation structure and composition at each location. Complete fire histories were available for each point, with over 80% having been burned one to four times in the previous 15 years Post-fire succession generally transformed vegetation structure from short, sparse, and grassy with few forbs and low litter immediately after fire, to increasing and moderate amounts of forbs, litter, and shrubs two to eight years postfire, to tall, dense, shrubby prairie with little forb, grass, or litter understory when fire was absent (> 80 years). Most grassland birds (six of nine species examined) at Lostwood NWR were absent from prairie untreated with fire. Species richness and abundances of Baird's Sparrows (Ammodramus bairdii), Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum), Le Conte's Sparrows (A. leconteii), Sprague's Pipits (Anthus spragueii), and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) were positively related to an index of amount of fire, and these species were absent from unburned units. In contrast, Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) and Clay-colored Sparrows (Spizella pallida) both reached highest abundance on unburned prairie. To provide maximum grassland bird diversity, managers of mesic, mixed-grass prairie generally should provide areas with short (2-4 year), moderate (5-7 year), and long (8-10 year, or more) fire return intervals. Because long-term rest may create habitat unfavorable for most species of grassland passerines in mesic, northern mixed prairie, periodic defoliations by disturbances such as fire should be considered essential to restore and maintain native biodiversity.},

abstract={Fire is an important disturbance that stimulates aspen regeneration and expansion in the western United States. We investigated the impacts of burning aspen-dominated habitats on landbird community structure in the western foothills of the Wind River Range, Wyoming. Habitat structure, breeding bird species composition, richness, and relative abundance were compared in 1994 and 1995 between six independent pairs of sites, each pair consisting of a recently burned aspen site and a control site. Burned sites typically had lower canopy cover and depth, greater snag densities and aspen regeneration, and less shrub growth. We observed 45 diurnal woodland bird species overall. Western Wood-Pewees (Contopus sordidulus) and Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus) were detected significantly less often in the burned sites, while Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) and Pine Siskins (Carduelis pinus) were detected significantly more often in the burned sites. Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivora celata), Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), and chickadees (Poecile spp.) were significantly less abundant in the burned aspen when burn size or year was factored into the analysis. For many other commonly detected species, we had relatively low power to detect meaningful differences in abundance between recently burned and unburned aspen stands. Bird species richness was similar between treatments. Bird species composition differed consistently among burned-control pairs, but our data suggested that intersite variability in species composition in aspen is the norm in the absence of burning.},

abstract={Semi-natural dry grasslands have almost disappeared in the modern farmland of southwestern and central Europe. In the northern and eastern parts of Europe, however, this species-rich habitat is still relatively common, albeit in a phase of rapid loss. To halt this decline the Swedish government started a large-scale subsidy scheme for the management and restoration of semi-natural pastures mainly aimed at increasing botanical values. We compared and contrasted the current management prescriptions with habitat preferences of 23 farmland bird species breeding in 88 dry semi-natural pastures in south-central Sweden. Semi-natural pastures showed very high breeding densities of several farmland birds underlining the importance of this habitat to the conservation of farmland birds. A TWINSPAN classification of all birds identified two groups of pastures with different bird communities. Eleven (48%) of the bird species were significantly more common in a group of pastures situated in open farmland, while only five (22%) species occurred in higher densities in pastures characterised by a high proportion of forest along the borders. Fifteen (83%) of the 18 species occurring in both pasture groups showed significant habitat-abundance relationships related to the management of semi-natural pastures, although in different directions and to different extents. Our results suggest that many farmland bird species require two important factors for their choice of breeding habitat, namely safe nest sites close to good foraging areas. Both factors are partly under the control of farmers and should be invoked in conservation strategies since many farmland birds are declining across Europe. To benefit the conservation of farmland birds in Sweden one should, in contrast to the present botanical-based subsidy scheme, retain ≥ 10% cover of shrubs within pastures and preferentially select pastures in open farmland (i.e. potentially safer nesting sites with better food conditions) for restoration and management plans.},

abstract={Within the range of the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), the only bird species endemic to Florida, there was a need for a population risk assessment that considered the impacts of declining habitat availability and declining fire frequency associated with rapid human population expansion. We developed a population risk model to examine influence of population size, catastrophes (epidemics and hurricanes), and habitat management scenarios on Florida scrub-jay populations. Extinction risk declined rapidly when initial population sizes increased from 20 to 100 breeding pairs. Hurricanes increased extinction risk for coastal populations by 10-30% compared to inland populations. Our results suggested that habitat in poor condition was unlikely support a population for more than a few decades. Poor habitat quality conditions were common throughout the species' range because of fire suppression or inadequate fire management. Habitat management was more effective than habitat restoration because population recovery occurred slowly after restoration and only if habitat was restored to optimal conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed that fecundity and survival of experienced breeders without helpers (adult nonbreeders) were the most important model parameters. Slow recovery rates occurred because helpers were the only rapid source of colonists in restored habitat and because an absence of helpers reduced breeder survival and fecundity. Small population sizes and habitat degradation make the Florida scrub-jay vulnerable to rangewide decline and extinction unless habitat is protected, restored, and managed to maintain optimal conditions.},

abstract={In this study we developed a decision support system for evaluating the effects of forest management on stand structure and wildlife species. The elements of the decision support system are an ecological simulation model and a data management system. In boreal forests, decaying wood is important from the standpoint of biological diversity. Many organisms, such as saproxylic beetles and polypores, live in decaying wood. The structure of a forest determines which species select it as a habitat, because the habitat requirements vary between species. In this study, the stand structure includes living and dead trees, their diameter distribution by tree species and the stage of decay. Forest management strongly modifies stand structure. We used the simulation model to investigate the stand structure and databases on the habitat requirements of beetle and polypore species to assess the number of species in a stand. We tested our system with four management examples and compared the results to experimental results. Both our study and the experimental results showed that intensive forest management decreases the number of large deciduous trees in boreal forests and therefore reduces the number of beetle and polypore species.},

abstract={We studied the abundance and productivity of songbirds in prescribed burned and unburned mature (>60 yr) pine forests at Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge, Georgia, during 1993-1995. We estimated species abundance, richness, and evenness using data from 312 point counts in 18 burned sites and six unburned sites. We measured gross habitat features in 0.04-ha circles centered on each point count station. We calculated productivity estimates at nests of seven of the most common nesting species. Habitat components we measured in 1-, 2-, and 3-yr post-burn sites were similar, but most components differed between burned and unburned sites. Although 98 species were detected during point counts, we report only on the 46 species that nested in the area and were detected ≥10% of the counts in either habitat class. Twenty-one species preferred burned sites and six preferred unburned sites. Avian species richness and evenness were similar for burned and unburned sites. Burned sites were preferred for nesting over unburned sites. Only nine nests of six species were found in unburned sites. Productivity estimates were low in burned sites. One or more eggs hatched in only 59 of 187 nests monitored, and an average of only 0.82 chicks per nest were estimated to have fledged. Predation was the most common probable cause for nest failure, ranging from 45% in the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) to 64% in the Summer Tanager (Piranga rubra). Because the sources of predation at the refuge are unknown, future research should address this issue.},

abstract={We optimize the trade-off between economic and ecological concerns in conservation biology by using a novel method to link a spatially explicit individual-based model to a dynamic programming model. To date, few optimality models have been presented to optimize this trade-off, especially when the common currency cannot be easily measured in dollars. We use a population simulation model (e.g. spatially explicit individual-based model) to model a hypothetical forest bird population's response to different cutting and planting regimes. We then link these results to a dynamic programming model to determine the optimal choice a manager should make at each time step to minimize revenue foregone by not harvesting timber while maintaining a given population of birds. Our results show that if optimal management choices are made further back in time, future (terminal) reward may be greater. As the end of the management period approaches, past management practices influence the terminal reward more than future practices can. Thus if past revenue lost is high, the future reward will be low as compared to when past revenue lost is low. The general strategy of setting some minimum viable population size and then using a population simulator linked to a dynamic programming model to ask how to maintain such a population size with minimum economic loss should have nearly universal applicability in conservation biology.},

abstract={Plans exist to restore the fire-dependent pine (Pinus spp.)-grassland community in Ouachita National Forest and potentially throughout the southeastern United States to benefit the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Restoration and management techniques include wildlife stand improvement (WSI; thinning of midstory and codominant trees) and prescribed fire. [The authors] evaluated how habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected other breeding bird species. [They] compared avian species frequency of occurrence and abundance during 2 breeding seasons in untreated pine-hardwood stands with that in treated stands after WSI and in 3 growing seasons following WSI and prescribed fire. Total bird densities were highest (P = 0.037) in the second growing season following WSI and fire and lowest in the control, whereas species richness did not differ (P = 0.399) among treatments. Densities of ground/shrub-foraging and shrub-nesting species increased (P = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively) the most following WSI and fire. Only ground-nesting species were more abundant (P < 0.001) in untreated stands than in treated stands. Restoration efforts may be beneficial to neotropical migrant species such as eastern woodpewee (Contopus virens) and prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), in addition to declining species of regional interest such as red-cockaded woodpecker, Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) that depend upon pine-grassland habitats.},

abstract={Any patch of woodland, no matter how small, can be made more attractive to a greater variety of birds by following management practices that promote greater vegetative diversity, that retain cavities for nesting and roosting, and that provide for the needs of forest-interior specialists. Monocultures attract only a small number of bird species, and uneven-age management provides more habitat niches than even-age management. Generally, the greater the diversity of trees, shrubs, and vines, the greater the diversity in forest structure, the greater the resulting bird diversity. Retention of cavities is necessary for many of the hole-nesting species, and fallen logs provide food resources. Providing the maximum contiguous forest interior (excluding the outer 100 m as being minimal value to forest interior birds) will optimize the opportunity for attracting neotropical migrants such as warblers, thrushes, tanagers, and vireos.},

abstract={Forest management plans typically have emphasized single species or indicator species. [The authors] give an overview of how common management practices in the Central Hardwoods region influence habitat structure and diversity of forested wetland wildlife. Tree age and species composition are important components in determining stand vegetation structure, which often influences vertebrate diversity and abundance. Tree species diversity and age also influence invertebrate distribution, soft and hard mast production, and cavity availability in snags and live trees; mast and cavity production rates are highest for mature stands (>80 yrs.). Forest wildlife diversity increases as stand size increases and fragmentation decreases. Nest predation and parasitism rates for interior forest avian species tend to increase as forest cover decreases at the landscape scale (severe effects are likely when forest cover is <30% within a 5-km-radius area). Although more research is needed to improve our knowledge of the varied management effects at large spatial scales, [the authors] believe management recommendations for small land holdings and larger commercial forests, as well as state and federal management units, should consider what habitat types are needed in the landscape beyond individual land-ownership boundaries.},

Plantations in the youngest age class are dominated by 2 super-abundant species (red-winged blackbird [Agelaius phoeniceus] and dickcissel [Spiza americana]), but nevertheless provide temporary habitat for regionally declining grassland bird species (i.e., dickcissel and northern bobwhite [Colinus virginianus]).

abstract={The purpose of this study was to relate patterns of bird occurrence to patterns of habitat variation. The author hoped to learn whether the bird community is more or less tightly structured, and whether the birds seem to be responding more or less independently of one another and to factors such as habitat variation. He established eight plots, each ranging in area from seven to nine hectares, in the southeastern Massachusetts pine barrens. These sites represented an array of post-fire successional stages, having been burned from fewer than five to more than thirty years previous to the onset of this study. The author mapped territories of breeding birds and surveyed vegetation on each plot for three years. He then performed several complex statistical analyses on the data collected. When the statistically compared bird abundances with the major patterns in vegetation, approximately two-thirds of the species exhibited statistically significant habitat associations, although some were difficult to interpret, probably due to small population sizes of certain species. The results suggested that the pine barrens bird community did, indeed, exhibit some patterns, but nonetheless, the two most widespread and abundant species (rufous-sided towhees and common yellowthroats), among others, exhibited no or just a few weak associations. Comparisons were made with results from previous shrub-steppe bird community studies, which were marked by an extreme lack of pattern.},

Three forest interior migrants had lower (P < 0.06) mean densities on CCM sites than NOHVST sites; 3 had greater (P < 0.03) densities on CCM sites; and densities of 3 others did not differ (P > 0.40) between treatments. All early successional migrants had greater (P < 0.01) densities on CCM sites. Numbers of 2 avian nest predators and a brood parasite did not differ (P > 0.20) on CCM and NOHVST sites. Densities of 9 species differed (P < 0.10) among regeneration, sapling, and pole-sawtimber habitats on CCM sites. While clearcutting reduced numbers of forest interior birds that were dependent on mature forest habitats, other forest interior species made extensive use of early and mid-successional even-aged stands and occurred in greater numbers on CCM sites.},

The percent occurrence of 7- to 15-year-old hardwood regeneration was the only habitat correlated with grouse density. Structural characteristics the influenced the quality of this habitat for grouse were basal area and percent canopy closure. Basal area exhibited a positive linear relationship, whereas percent canopy closure exhibited a curvilinear relationship with grouse density. Highest grouse densities occurred where 7- to 15-year-old hardwood regeneration habitat comprised greater than 14% of the area; basal area was greater than 16.9 m2ha-1 and canopy closure was between 70 and 89% in this habitat. Management strategies for enhancing habitat for grouse should include maintaining more than 14% of forest in 7- to 15-year-old hardwood regeneration and maintaining a balance between partial canopy closure and high basal area within this habitat. Hardwood regeneration stands occurring on the most productive or highest quality sites probably have the greatest potential to provide habitat for grouse.},

abstract={The population of male Kirtland's warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii) in the breeding season has averaged 206 from 1971 to 1987. The Kirtland's warbler occupies dense jack pine (Pinus banksiana) barrens from 5 to 23 years old and from 1.4 to 5.0 m high, formerly of wildfire origin. In 1984, 73% of the males censused were found in habitat naturally regenerated from wildfire or prescribed burning. The rest were in plantations (11%) or in harvested, unburned jack pine stands stocked by natural regeneration (16%). Twenty-two percent (630 of 2,886) of the Kirtland's warbler males counted in the annual censuses from 1971 through 1984 were found in 26 stands that were unburned and naturally regenerated following harvest. From 1982 to 1987, suitable regenerating areas were barely sufficient to replace currently occupied maturing stands, so population growth was impeded. Ecosystems of suitable size and regeneration characteristics (wildfire and plantation) doubled in area by 1989. In response, the population of Kirtland's warblers increased from 167 to 398 males between 1987 and 1992, but they withdrew almost entirely from the unburned, uplanted barrens by 1989 when the area of more suitable regeneration types increased. Minimum (368 males) and maximum (542 males) population estimates for 1996 were calculated based on 1984 average density (1.9 males per 40 ha) and peak population in burns (2.8 males per 40 ha).},

abstract={The Francis Marion National Forest (FMNF) once supported the second largest and only documented naturally increasing population of red-cockaded woodpeckers (RCW). Prior to Hurricane Hugo, an estimated 477 RCW groups existed on the FMNF. Hugo destroyed 87% of the active red-cockaded woodpecker cavity trees on the Forest and killed 63% of the woodpeckers. In addition, 59% of the birds' foraging habitat, nesting habitat, and potential cavity trees were destroyed. By the nesting season of 1990, 537 artificial cavities had been installed and there were 249 groups. Forty-five percent of RCW nests were in artificial cavities and 302 young were fledged. In the 1991 breeding season, there were 306 groups, 483 young were fledged and 60% of the nests were in artificial cavities. In 1992, there were 332 groups, 500 young were fledged and 61% of the nests were in artificial cavities. Following the catastrophic loss of woodpeckers and their habitat in 1989 from Hugo, the number of adult RCWs and the number of groups had increased 33% by 1992. This remarkable increase, despite the severe losses of nesting and foraging habitat, cavity trees, and individual birds, resulted primarily from installation of artificial cavities.},

abstract={Effects of prescribed fire and roller chopping applied in 2 seasons on woody vegetation and the associated avian community of a southwestern Florida former dry prairie were studied. There were 5 vegetation treatments with 2 replications of each; treatments were control, winter burn, winter chop, summer burn, and summer chop. Percent shrub cover was sampled with line intercept transects. Birds were censused 25 times using the variable circular plot method. Burning in either season reduced shrub cover temporarily; chopping in either season reduced shrub cover significantly and it remained reduced throughout the 15 months of this study. Bird species richness and abundance were similar in control and burn plots. Birds were not seen in summer chop plots up to 5 months posttreatment. Bird species richness and abundance remained low in both winter and summer chop plots. Bird species that were observed in chop plots were mostly open country, grassland inhabitants, indicating a trend toward prairie restoration.},

abstract={It is hypothesized that similar bird assemblages will occur in like-structured habitat that results from both clear-cutting and high-intensity wildfire followed by salvage logging. To test this, bird communities of sand pine scrub in mature forest and three disturbance treatments were compared, namely (1) high-intensity wildfire, salvage logged, and naturally regenerated, (2) clearcut, roller chopped, and broadcast seeded, and (3) clearcut and bracke-seeded. Communities were analyzed based on residency status and nesting guilds. Silvicultural disturbance appears to mimic the natural high-intensity disturbance regime by creating habitat structural features required by open scrub species and may be an important habitat management tool where the use of wildfire is impractical. However, long-term effects, unsalvaged burns, and landscape patterns created by clearcutting were not addressed and may also be important in structuring bird communities of sand pine scrub.},

abstract={Aspen (Populus spp.) woodland is increasing within native grasslands in north-central North Dakota, and this increase concerns land managers. We examined avian associations in aspen groves of various sizes on and near J. Clark Salyer National Wildlife Refuge in 1995-96 to predict how bird communities change as woody plant cover increases within a grassland-dominated landscape. Avian species richness increased as aspen grove size increased, particularly for bird species classified as forest interior, neotropical migrant, ground nesting, or insectivorous. Large (i.e., >100-ha) aspen groves provided suitable habitat for 12 area-sensitive species while also meeting the requirements of more ubiquitous habitat generalists. Conversely, small aspen groves did not support the number or diversity of avian species and were occupied by edge-associated species. None of 53 species recorded in the study were restricted to small aspen groves. We conclude that limiting the spread of aspen woodland into native grassland and eliminating small (i.e., <5-ha) aspen groves where feasible will not adversely impact woodland breeding bird communities. Many avian species occur with greater frequency in aspen woodlands than in eastern deciduous forest. Large woodlands contribute to local avian diversity and may provide habitat for forest species that have shown regional or continental population declines.},

We obtained historical and present land use, vegetation cover types, and landscape structure of both landscapes from high-resolution aerial photography. Avian community composition in the low density rural population landscape was primarily related to the amount of land in deciduous forest and land treated with fire or herbicides. In contrast, avian community composition in the high density rural population landscape was primarily related to the amount of land in deciduous forest, native grassland, and roads. Changes in vegetation cover type were related to changes in the avian community composition by increasing prairie habitat associated species in the low density rural population and generalist habitat associated species in the high density rural population landscapes. Loss of neotropical migrants and increased number of generalist species in the high density rural population landscape was related to decreased native vegetation, road development, and increased landscape fragmentation.

abstract={Small mammal and bird assemblages were compared across fence-lines between one communal and three adjacent commercial range-lands in Namaqualand, South Africa. The communal area has twice the recommended stocking rate of sheep and goats, and has less perennial plant cover and more annual plants than neighbouring commercial rangelands. Commercial rangelands supported a larger and more diverse assemblage of small mammals and birds. Small mammal species composition on communal lands was a subset of that on adjacent commercial rangelands, with only one species equally abundant in both treatments. Diurnal mammals were scarce in communal rangelands, apparently due to the lack of cover for predator avoidance and herbivory. Management to maintain a diversity of small mammals requires a minimum level of effective cover. Bird richness and diversity was also reduced on communal rangelands, with many species, especially insectivores, less abundant. A few bird species, notably granivores, were more abundant on communal rangelands, probably because of the increase in annual plant cover. The absence of some large bird species regularly found in Namaqualand, but absent from both treatments (e.g., bustards), suggests that neither management practice is optimal.},

abstract={Public agencies are required to manage for threatened and endangered species and for biodiversity. However, at times, management for threatened and endangered species precludes consideration of other species. We investigated how managing for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and biodiversity at the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, affected communities of bird species that use early-successional scrub habitat (hereafter, scrub-successional species). Management for red-cockaded woodpeckers at the SRS involved both (1) manipulating mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-wiregrass (Andropogon spp.) stands via canopy thinning, removal of midstory trees, and prescribed burning; and (2) even-aged timber harvesting. The former management practice encouraged red-cockaded woodpeckers to establish new colonies in previously unoccupied stands (hereafter, 'recruitment' stands). The latter management practice is used to remove off-site planted pines and replant with preferred longleaf pines. We conducted a constant-effort mist net study in recruitment and regenerating stands (stands clearcut and planted with longleaf pine) during the breeding seasons of 1995-96. We hypothesized that the scrub-successional bird community in recruitment stands would have greater species richness and higher survival and reproductive rates per species than in regenerating stands. However, recruitment stands always had fewer scrub-successional species (1995: 36 species; 1996: 31 species) than regenerating stands (1995: 54 species; 1996: 55 species), and all species that occurred in recruitment stands also occurred in regenerating stands. Species which commonly occurred in both recruitment and regenerating stands had similar adult:juvenile ratios (P > 0.15) and relative proportion of adults in breeding condition (P > 0.05). We detected no difference in survival rates of Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis), indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), and of 'combined' scrub-successional birds between stand types (P > 0.05). We found that even-aged forestry is an important management practice for maintaining and increasing avian biodiversity on public lands, as well as an acceptable management practice for red-cockaded woodpeckers.},

abstract={Marshes in the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain provide important winter habitats for many species of birds. Many of these marshes are managed intensively through a combination of fall/winter burning and construction of impoundments to improve wintering waterfowl habitat, reduce wetland loss, and create emergent wetlands. Little information is available on effects of this management on wintering birds, particularly passerines. We conducted experimental burns in impounded and unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwest Louisiana and recorded species composition and abundance of birds during the 1996 and 1997 winters. We found that burning and impoundment influenced vegetation structure, which in turn influenced bird abundance and species composition. Blackbirds (Icteridae) preferred recently burned plots. Sparrows (Emberizidae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) avoided recently burned plots but recolonized these plots after one year of vegetation recovery. Sparrows and wrens present in burned plots during the first winter following burning generally were observed in scattered patches of unburned vegetation. Suitability of Chenier Plain marshes as winter habitat for several bird species was reduced during the winter in which burning was conducted, particularly if a high proportion of the plot was burned. We recommend that patchy burns be used, at both the landscape level and within specific burned areas, to achieve management objectives and still provide suitable winter habitat for non-target species. Although many groups of birds depend on Chenier Plain marshes for winter habitat, these groups differ in their specific habitat requirements. We recommend that a diverse wetland complex (e.g., impoundments managed for waterfowl foraging habitat interpersed with those managed for passerine winter cover) be maintained.},

abstract={We have investigated the effects of landscape traversed and roadside structure on the use of highway verges by birds. Three contrasted landscapes were chosen in terms of human land use and vegetation structure: an intensive farmland, a pine plantation, and a matoral. The roadside sections varied in vegetation structure, width and profile. We recorded birds present in roadsides and adjacent habitats by transect counts over all seasons. Roadside bird species appeared for a great part similar to those of adjacent habitats. However, diversity and abundance in verges did not depend on that of adjacent habitats. Woody roadsides were compararable to hedges, as trees (and shrubs) in verges enhanced species richness and abundance of birds in the farmland and woodland sites. Width and profile of verges had less influence. In all sites, typical species of the habitat traversed partly avoided roadsides. On the contrary, numerous species associated with 'rare' habitats in one site preferred roadsides, provided that verge vegetation contrasted with the dominant habitat. It is concluded that birds responses to highways can vary greatly with landscape traversed and verge vegetation. Highway verges could be favorable to birds, if they constitute a complementary habitat to the dominant habitat within a landscape.},

abstract={The goals of current management practices in riparian areas in the Pacific Northwest include protecting and maintaining habitat for terrestrial wildlife. However, little is known about the use of riparian buffers by terrestrial wildlife, particularly how buffer width may affect abundance and species composition of wildlife communities. In this study, I compared bird assemblages in logged and unlogged riparian areas along headwater streams and assessed the relations between bird abundance and riparian buffer width. The abundances of 4 species of forest-associated birds that were more abundant in unlogged than in logged headwater riparian stands (Pacific-slope flycatcher [Empidonax difficilis], brown creeper [Certhia americana], chestnut-backed chickadee [Poecile rufescens], winter wren [Troglodytes troglodytes]) increased with increasing width of riparian buffers. However, 4 other species that also were more abundant in unlogged than logged riparian stands (Hammond's flycatcher [Empidonax hammondii], golden-crowned kinglet [Regulus satrapa], varied thrush [Ixoreus naevius], hermit warbler [Dendroica occidentalis]) were rarely observed in even the widest buffers sampled (40-70 m on 1 side of the stream). Although riparian buffers along headwater streams are not expected to support all bird species found in unlogged riparian areas, they are likely to provide the most benefit for forest-associated bird species if they are >40 m wide, and density of large trees within buffers is not reduced by harvesting.},

Artificial drumming structures and logs for grouse were placed on the plots post-treatment in 1981. Vegetative successional changes are discussed relative to these populations. Whole-tree harvesting reduced breeding bird abundance and diversity, but pre-treatment levels were exhibited within 10 years. Bird species-vegetation associations differed among treatment and control plots throughout the study. Small mammal population fluctuations obscured treatment effects.

abstract={Silvicultural alternatives to clear-cutting have been suggested to promote development, retention, or creation of late-successional features such as large trees, multilayered canopies, snags, and logs. We assessed bird response to three silvicultural alternatives to clear-cutting that retained structural features found in old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests and that imitated natural disturbance regimes more closely than did traditional clear-cutting: (1) small-patch group selection treatment representing a low-intensity disturbance; (2) two-story treatment, representing a moderate to high-intensity disturbance; and (3) modified clear-cut treatment, representing a high-intensity disturbance. We counted diurnal breeding birds 1 yr prior to and 2 yr after harvest to estimate effects of the silvicultural treatments on bird communities compared with uncut controls. The small-patch group selection treatment was most similar in species composition to control stands. The two-story treatment was more similar to the modified clear-cut treatment. Ten bird species remained abundant following the small-patch group selection treatment. They declined in abundance in modified clearcuts and two-story stands. These species included four neotropical migratory species and five species with restricted geographic ranges and habitat associations. Nine species increased in response to moderate and/or high-intensity disturbances. This group included a larger proportion of species that were habitat generalists. Silvicultural treatments imitating low-intensity disturbances were most effective in retaining bird communities associated with mature forest; high-intensity disturbances such as the two-story and modified clear-cut treatments greatly altered bird community composition. Bird responses to the silvicultural treatments that we studied indicate that a variety of stand types is needed to meet needs of all species.},

abstract={A current paradigm in conservation biology is that forest harvest practices that better approximate natural disturbance processes are more likely to conserve biodiversity. We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having ≥95% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with 1-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfire than on postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), Black-and-White Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Red-start (Setophaga ruticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of standing dead trees on the landscape.},

abstract={Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) is one of several grassland bird species that has declined during the last several decades. Although several studies have characterized the habitat requirements of breeding Henslow's Sparrows, winter habitat requirements for the species remain poorly known. The purpose of our study was to identify habitat variables associated with occupancy by Henslow's Sparrow on silvicultural lands in the core of its winter range in the Gulf Coastal Plain. Forty-one study sites were chosen on lands managed for timber production in Baldwin County, Alabama. Henslow's Sparrows selected moist sites that occurred as pitcher plant bogs or as transition areas between wet pitcher plant bogs and drier upland areas. A multiple logistic regression model identified the density of the grass Panicum verrucosum and the density of pitcher plants as the variables best able to explain the presence of Henslow's Sparrows. Sites occupied by Henslow's Sparrows had higher herbaceous vegetation densities and had been disturbed by timber harvest and/or fire more recently than unoccupied sites. Within occupied sites, Henslow's Sparrows chose areas with higher densities of herbaceous vegetation, especially P. verrucosum.},

abstract={Comparisons of the effects of logging and fire as disturbance agents on the composition of bird assemblages in boreal ecosystems are stall lacking or are limited to the short-term impacts of clear-cutting. In Quebec, where the boreal forest is largely dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B S.P) stands, we surveyed 140 point-count stations in 3 postlogging and 4 postfire development stages determined according to the height of the regenerating spruce trees. Species richness did not vary among forest development stages, but bird abundance was higher in recent clearcuts. Recently disturbed areas were characterized by open-land bird assemblages dominated by Neotropical migrants, which reached their highest abundance in clearcuts. Moreover, logged stands were distinguished from burned sites by the absence of cavity-nesting birds Forest-bird assemblages reestablished themselves as soon as young spruces reached the sapling stage. However, the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), and Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) were restricted to mature stands or recent burns and are thus likely to be negatively affected by modern forestry, which revolves fire suppression and short logging rotations. We suggest that retention of larger areas of continuous mature forest might be essential to maintain these species in managed regions.},

abstract={Current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service habitat management guidelines for the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) (RCW) mandate management units of 1/2 -mile radius from the center of each cavity tree cluster. These areas may overestimate or underestimate habitat required by RCW groups. A study to estimate RCW home range and habitat requirements was conducted in 1994 and 1995 in the North Carolina Sandhills. Home range areas (HRA) were calculated for 248 RCW groups from location data collected since 1980, and mapped using ATLAS geographic information system. Demographic and location data were used in nearest neighbor analysis of site quality. Between March 1994 and March 1995, foraging and location data were collected by following 8 groups on Fort Bragg to determine current home ranges and reliability of historical data. Habitat types were assessed in a stratified random design for habitat selection analysis. The data suggest that cavity cluster position was unimportant to the HRA configuration defended by RCW groups. Where home ranges were adjacent, RCW groups delineated HRAs along minor landscape features and ignored features as major as paved roads. HRAs varied in size from <100 acres to >700 acres, dependent on position within the population distribution and habitat quality. Where suitable habitat remains, HRAs are clustered in proximity to each other. The smallest biologically appropriate unit for RCW conservation is likely the metapopulation. As RCW populations decline, habitat corridors between metapopulations should be managed to prevent genetic isolation.},

abstract={The USDA Forest Service red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) recovery strategy is based on conservation biology principles and implements an ecological approach to recovery. It implements landscape-scale management by identifying habitat management areas (HMAs). These HMAs represent the desired future RCW population configuration. Within HMAs, longer timber rotations will be established. Management intensity levels (MILs) are established that restrict timber harvest levels and methods. These MILs are based on population size, with the smallest populations having the most restrictions and the most intensive direct habitat improvements for RCWs. The combination of HMAs, longer timber rotation and MILs should allow RCW populations to overcome the effects of past habitat fragmentation, and should preclude future fragmentation and demographic isolation. The recovery strategy implements a prescribed burning regime on a three-to-five-year cycle and includes growing season burning. This burning regime should closely mimic the natural fire regimes of southern pine ecosystems. A full range of vegetative management techniques will be used, ranging from thinning, prescribed burning and single tree selection, to clearcutting. Clearcutting will be used primarily for restoring the naturally occurring pine type to areas that have undergone previous forest type conversions. Artificial cavities and translocations are intensive management techniques that will be used together. Implementation of the RCW recovery strategy should benefit threatened, endangered or sensitive species, as well as overall biological diversity. Over time, habitat conditions should develop that would allow for a biological diversity more similar to that which existed historically.},

abstract={Bird densities within coastal scrub and slash pine flatwoods were compared time since fire, mean shrub height, number of snags and percent burn. Most shrub-dwelling birds preferred older stands (>10 yr since last fire) with taller shrubs, or intermediate stands (4 yr since last fire) than recently burned stands (1-2 yr since last fire). Five species were negatively correlated with percent burn in stands burned 1-2 yr previously. The downy woodpecker was most abundant in recently burned areas. Densities of three species of woodpeckers and the northern bobwhite were positively correlated with snag density. The results suggest that extensive burns occurring every 4 yr or less are likely to have a negative influence on shrub-dwelling birds that are a natural component of these coastal communities.},

abstract={New initiatives in wildlife management have come from the realization that birds can be used as indicators of ecosystem health. Conceptually, biological diversity includes processes working at all scales in biological hierarchies that compose the natural world. Recent advances in the understanding of ecological systems suggest they are nonequilibrium systems, and must be managed as such. In a practical sense, biological diversity must be managed by devising indicators of ecosystem integrity and health. Ecological integrity, although there are difficulties in defining criteria for its measurement, provides a conceptual focus for management decisions that are intended to preserve biodiversity. More importantly, tools for devising objective measures of the ecological integrity of a community are readily available. Management of bird communities can be based on indices of ecological integrity that incorporate presence and relative abundances of neotropical migrants. Neotropical migratory birds provide an ideal focus for such management tools, since they have been shown to be highly sensitive to changes in landscapes that compromise the spatial continuity and integrity of natural ecosystems. In order to accommodate new concerns for preservation of biodiversity, wildlife managers must acquaint themselves with new tools and approaches. In particular, an expanded geographic scale perspective should permeate management activities.},

abstract={A conflict exists in managed forests between the maintenance of snags (standing dead trees) for biological diversity and the requirement to remove snags for worker safety. This conflict could be mitigated by the identification of safe classes of snags, those with low rates of fall, that can be easily identified and retained in forest operations. I outline an approach to estimating rates of fall of identifiable decay classes of snags based on static life-table analysis of the current age distribution and relative abundance of classes of snags in a stand, applying the analysis to subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) snags. The two most recent classes of snags, identified by the presence of fine branches and intact bark, showed fall rates of 0.17-0.20%/yr, similar to or lower than live subalpine fir trees. Fall rates increased to 0.70%/yr for the third class of snags, identified by loss of fine branches and cracking of bark, and to 3.79% and 6.16%/yr for the fourth and fifth classes, respectively, identified by increasing loss of bark and incipient softening of outer wood. Snags in the two earliest classes could be retained during forest operations without substantial increase in risk to workers. The static life-table approach to estimating fall rates of snags can complement long-term monitoring of snags in older forests where the assumption of a stationary age distribution is met.},

abstract={A census of four species of syntopic parrots was carried out using distance sampling methods on Sao Sebastiao island, SE Brazil. Most of the 33 593 ha island is covered by mature and secondary Atlantic rainforest. Almost 80% of these forests are within the Ilhabela Park. Although the species counted have marked differences in size and weight, density (individuals/km2) and estimated population size in 23 500 ha of well-preserved forests were similar: Amazona farinosa (13.82 ± 5.94; 3247 ± 1395), Pionus maximiliani (15.79 ± 7.04; 3712 ± 1654), Brotogeris tirica (15.05 ± 4.87; 3537 ± 1143) and Pyrrhura frontalis (13.06 ± 5.53; 3068 ± 1298). Encounter rates of Forpus crassirostris and Pionopsitta pileata were very low, which suggests that there is only a small population of these species on the island. The Sao Sebastiao forests still support healthy populations of parrots. Although woodpecker population estimates on the island are large enough to provide nesting sites for parrots, competition for holes with other secondary cavity nesters such as toucans, flycatchers and tytiras, and the selective cutting of dead trees for canoe construction, which is a common practice on the island, may limit hole availability for parrots.},

abstract={Most early accounts of pre-Colonial southern forests present a picture of a diverse forest with a variety of tree ages, interspersed with openings. There were many old and decayed trees, down logs, and abundant mast. The forests were dynamic, changing with plant succession and influenced by numerous other factors such as fire, insects, diseases, ice and wind storms, flooding, and activities of native Americans. Most early accounts describe a plethora of wildlife in the diverse forests. Bird communities were abundant and diverse, probably with numerous cavity nesters and species associated with mature forests. The passenger pigeon and Carolina parakeet, once abundant and widely distributed in these forest, are extinct today. Early records reveal that the eastern wild turkey was abundant enough to be a food staple for early settlers. The red-cockaded woodpecker was probably abundant in the frequently burned longleaf pine forests of the Southeast. Squirrels and white-tailed deer were abundant in the diverse forests. Deer were a diet staple of native Americans and the hides became a major item of commerce. Large carnivores, such as black bears and cougars, were relatively abundant.},

abstract={A search of 4600 ha of the McCurtain County Wilderness Area (MCWA), Oklahoma, in 1989-1990 yielded 15 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis). The number of groups and number of individuals in a 3795-ha area that was surveyed in 1977 and 1989-1990 declined by 62% and 75%, respectively. The productivity of the population was low during 1989-1990; 0.69 young were fledged per nesting attempt. To assess the adequacy of foraging habitat, forest structure was measured in an area with a high density of groups (1.95/km2) in 1990 and in an area where the group density had declined from 2.92 groups/km2 in 1977 to 0.74 groups/km2 in 1990. Forest structure in both areas was adequate but approached the limits recommended in the Red-cockaded Woodpecker Recovery Plan. To determine if isolation of groups was related to population decline, [the authors] estimated nearest neighbor distances from cluster locations (a cluster is the cavity trees used by a group of woodpeckers) in 1977 and 1990. Cluster sites had longer nearest neighbor distances in 1977 than in 1990, which may indicate that isolation by distance reduces the influx of dispersing breeders from elsewhere in the population. Periodic fires occur naturally in the MCWA but have been suppressed since 1926. Re-establishment of a fire regime is important in maintaining the integrity of the MCWA and may be beneficial to its red-cockaded woodpecker population.},

abstract={Lake Hula and its surrounding wetland in northern Israel were drained in the late 1950s and the dried wetlands were transformed into a diverse agricultural region with a 0.3 km2 nature reserve. A portion of the extinct Hula wetland was re-flooded in April 1994 by constructing a small lake, Agmon, and 90 km of canals. The purposes of this study were (a) to document the re-population and colonization of the new Agmon wetland by birds after its flooding, (b) to evaluate bird species richness in this new wetland in comparison to that in a nearby mature Hula Nature Reserve, and, (c) to investigate if the species originally present in the Hula Valley before the drainage had been re-established. The new lake has succeeded in attracting a large variety of water birds to the newly formed habitats, especially ducks, egrets and herons, plovers, waders and snipes. The distribution of bird species among the different habitats was not random. The northern section of the lake, which is shallow and has an open shore, had the largest number of species during 1995 and 1996 and was preferred by plovers, waders and snipes. A large roosting and breeding colony of thousands of egrets and herons was formed in the dense cattails (Typha domingensis) in the southern section of the lake. Unlike the nearby Hula Nature Reserve, the new wetland lacks a large seasonally flooded area and is less attractive for feeding and breeding plovers, waders and stilts. The new wetland also has very little muddy area without vegetation and attracts few of the species that regularly feed in this habitat in the reserve. The new wetland enlarges the area of only a few of the habitats found in the nearby reserve and therefore attracts fewer species than it might otherwise. Recommendations for management of the new wetland include increased diversity of habitats, restriction of human activities and optimization of conflicts that have arisen between the needs of the wetland and those of nearby agriculture.},

abstract={Land degradation is widely regarded as an increasingly significant global environmental problem, most particularly in arid, semi-arid and sub-humid environments where the process has often been referred to by the term desertification. In Mediterranean-climate regions, the seasonality of precipitation and intensity of land use has led to suggestions that such conditions are especially favourable to various forms of land degradation. An assessment of the nature, historical development, extent, degree and significance of land degradation in the Mediterranean-climate region of South Africa, the southwestern Cape, is overdue. The distinctive environment of the region is one of generally high relief, strong rainfall seasonality and moderate precipitation intensities, which, coupled with a long history of human occupation, lead to the hypothesis that land degradation is likely to be a significant blight on its landscapes. The region is characterized by a species-rich and fire prone suite of vegetation communities, typified by shrublands of the so-called fynbos, and represents a major biodiversity hot-spot. - The major forms of land degradation apparent are: 1) vegetation clearance for agriculture and urbanisation, processes which account for the loss of at least 30% of the natural plant communities. This form of degradation has been particularly severe in the Swartland and most renosterveld communities have been completely replaced by a wheat monoculture. Urbanisation has accounted for almost one half of the coastal strandveld vegetation as well as significant proportions of other communities. 2) invasion of alien tree species, in particular those from Australia, has proved especially problematic and accounts for the degradation of large areas of natural vegetation over and above those cleared for agriculture and urbanisation. Soil erosion, which elsewhere in Mediterranean-climate regions is regarded as a major form of degradation, is of only local significance in the southwestern Cape, where effective soil conservation legislation and practice was applied following the gloomy assessments of the situation in the 1940s. Salinisation is also not widespread, although there is increasing concern as to this problem in the Sandveld around the west coast due to the utilisation of solute-rich irrigation waters. - Despite the relatively favourable evaluation as to the extent and degree of land degradation, the implications of the various forms of transformation are especially severe, principally because the natural vegetation communities consumed in the process are repositories of such biological diversity. The impact of alien vegetation infestation on this aspect of the physical environment of the southwestern Cape is also marked, and is augmented by the consequent reduction in runoff in a region already experiencing heavy human pressure on limited water supplies. Although land degradation here does not meet the emotive descriptions of 'desertification', the inexorable loss of species diversity from what is clearly one of the world's real biodiversity hotspots may be considered an environmental problem of global significance.},

abstract={Birds were studied at 57 sites in Mountain Ash forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia in spring and summer 1995/96. The sites represented 41 patches of old-growth forest (up to 390 ha in size) in a matrix of regrowth mostly from severe fires in 1939 (57 years previously), with multiple sites in the four largest patches of old-growth and eight sites in 1939 regrowth. Relative bird abundance was assessed by an area-search technique. Generalized linear modelling was used to develop predictive models by regressing abundance of groups of bird species against patch size, isolation and some basic habitat and context variables. Total bird abundance (of all species combined) tended to be higher in old-growth patches than in 1939 regrowth, but not significantly. There was no trend in total abundance with patch size or isolation. Fruit-eating birds tended to be commonest in small patches. Bark-foragers and uncommon birds favoured large patches, though the latter were most common in 1939 regrowth. More variation was explained by habitat and context variables such as aspect, altitude and forest structure. Unevenaged forest structure was often associated with small patches. It was concluded that old-growth forest patches can have similar values per hectare for forest birds whether they are large or small. The regrowth forest matrix appears to protect small patches from factors which reduce densities of forest birds in small forest patches in farmland. The data support the current policy of retaining all old-growth ash forest patches. A range of factors should be considered in selecting regrowth stands of various sizes to regrow as old forest of the future, including their intrinsic potential to develop particular habitats and produce a mix of forest structures in the landscape.},

We analyzed existing annual survey data for the White-faced Ibis breeding in the Great Basin and surrounding area for 1985-1997. Methods varied among colonies and included flight-line counts and fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter surveys. The number of White-faced Ibis breeding pairs in the Great Basin area has nearly tripled since 1985, despite years of severe flooding and drought at major breeding areas. This growth is reflected in both peripheral (i.e., Oregon, California, Idaho) and core (i.e., Nevada and Utah) components of the population. Our data on colony dynamics in Oregon and Nevada illustrate the ability of the highly nomadic White-faced Ibis to compensate for poor conditions at traditional colony sites by moving among colonies and rapidly colonizing newly available wetlands. We suggest that the White-faced Ibis would benefit from a landscape mosaic of well-distributed peripheral wetlands and persistent colony sites. The nomadic nature of the White-faced Ibis and the dynamic nature of their breeding habitat necessitates that wetland management decisions and population monitoring be conducted in a regional context.},

abstract={The information in this update draws heavily on Icelandic Scandinavian, Finnish, and Russian sources (>100 citations), as well as on recent American and Canadian publications. Since 1980 research on the Gyrfalcon in the western Palearctic has increased greatly, especially in Iceland (O K Nielsen), Norway (P J Tommeraas and associates), Sweden (U Falkdalen and associates in Projekt Jaktfalk), and Finland (P Koskimies). Much new work has also been accomplished in the Nearctic, but unfortunately fresh data from Greenland and Russia lag far behind. The main recent findings and interpretations follow: field characters have been clarified to emphasize differences in appearance and flight behaviour between Gyrfalcons and other similar species. In most parts of the range, habitat associations are closely tied to the occurrence of Willow Grouse Lagopus lagopus and Ptarmigan L. mutus, the chief prey species of this predominantly resident arctic raptor. Its overall distribution has not changed significantly in the 20th century. Much new information on Gyrfalcon populations, especially in Iceland and Fennoscandia, indicates that although, in many parts of the range, breeding pairs fluctuate markedly in number in 4- or 10-year cycles-or sometimes irregularly-there has been little long-term change in overall population size in the last >50 years; however, there is evidence from Lapland that breeding density was much reduced around the turn of the last century, probably owing mainly to habitat changes and consequent reduction in Lagopus populations, secondarily to human persecution. Conservation should emphasize habitat restoration for grouse and other prey species, preservation of traditional eyries, and protection from human disturbance and persecution. Most Gyrfalcons specialize on Lagopus spp. for food summer and winter (60-90% of diet), but some, especially in the high Arctic, specialize on other prey such as Little Auks Alle alle, lemmings Lemmus and Dicrostonyx, and Arctic Hare Lepus arcticus. Gyrfalcons show both functional and numerical responses to changes in grouse density. Gyrfalcons more often use the stick nest of Ravens Corvus corax on cliffs or trees than any other nesting sites; tree-nesting Gyrfalcons in the Russian Arctic have been reported to refurbish old stick nests of other species for their own use. Breeding success depends more on spring weather than on food supply. Survival statistics are still meagre, and much research is needed. Body mass (weight) normally varies in individuals by as much as 250-500 g depending on sex and state of nutrition; males usually fall between 1000 and 1400 g, females between 1250 and 2000 g. The term 'morph' has been incorrectly applied to the Gyrfalcon's continuous variation in plumage from the whitest to darkest individuals. DNA and cross-breeding experiments show that the Gyrfalcon is most closely related to the Saker Falco cherrug and likely conspecific with it.},

abstract={Large areas of the world's tropical forests are being degraded, with a consequent loss of species diversity. Only some of these are able to recover unaided. Where attempts are being made to restore such forests, the scale of the attempts is usually small. Timber plantations are one of the few means by which large areas of cleared or degraded landscape can be reforested. These usually restore the productive capacity of the landscape but do little to recover biological diversity. But a number of approaches might be used to redesign such plantations so that they would both yield the timber needed to justify the investment and also contain some proportion of their former biodiversity. These approaches include using indigenous species rather than exotic species, creating species mosaics by matching species to particular sites, embedding the plantation monocultures in a matrix of intact or restored vegetation, using species mixtures rather than monocultures, or encouraging the diverse plant understories that can often develop beneath plantations. The degree of ecological restoration possible using these alternatives ranges from modest to significant, although none is likely to achieve complete restoration. Any improvements in regional biodiversity brought about by these changes might be seen as being at the expense of plantation productivity. But many of these approaches have advantages other than just restoring former biodiversity. I discuss some of the trade-offs and implications for plantation managers and restorationists.},

abstract={Tidal marshes have been actively restored in ]Connecticut for nearly 20 years, but evaluations of these projects are typically based solely on observations of vegetation change. A formerly impounded valley marsh at the Barn Island Wildlife Management Area is a notable exception; previous research at this site has also included assessments of primary productivity, macroinvertebrates, and use by fishes. To determine the effects of marsh restoration on higher trophic levels, we monitored bird use at five sites within the Barn Island complex, including both restoration and reference marshes. Use by summer bird populations within fixed plots was monitored over two years at all sites. Our principal focus was Impoundment One, a previously impounded valley marsh reopened to full tidal exchange in 1982. This restoration site supported a greater abundance of wetland birds than our other sites, indicating that it is at least equivalent to reference marshes within the same system for this ecological function. Moreover, the species richness of birds and their frequency of occurrence at Impoundment One was greater than at 11 other estuarine marshes in southeastern Connecticut surveyed in a related investigation. A second marsh, under restoration for approximately ten years, appears to be developing in a similar fashion. These results complement previous studies on vegetation, macroinvertebrates, and fish use in this system to show that, over time, the reintroduction of tidal flooding can effectively restore important ecological functions to previously impounded tidal marshes.},

abstract={We studied indicators of rangeland health on benchmark sites with long, well documented records of protection from stress by domestic livestock or histories of environmental stress and vegetation change. We measured ecosystem properties (metrics) that were clearly linked to ecosystem processes. We focused on conservation of soil and water as key processes in healthy ecosystems, and on maintenance of biodiversity and productivity as important functions of healthy ecosystems. Measurements from which indicators of rangeland health were derived included: sizes of unvegetated patches, cover and species composition of perennial grasses, cover and species composition of shrubs and herbaceous perennials, soil slaking, and abundance and species composition of the bird fauna. Indicators that provided an interpretable range of values over the gradient from irreversibly degraded sites to healthy sites included: hare patch index, cover of long-lived grasses, palatability index, and weighted soil surface stability index. Indicators for which values above a threshold may serve as an indicator of rangeland health include: cover of plant species toxic to livestock, cover of exotic species, and cover of increaser species. Several other indicator metrics were judged not sensitive nor interpretable. Examples of application of rangeland health indicators to evaluate the success of various restoration efforts supported the contention that a suite of indicators are required to assess rangeland health. Bird species diversity and ant species diversity were not related to the status of the sample site and were judged inadequate as indicators of maintenance of biodiversity.},

We review literature pertaining to effects of fire-insect interactions on ecological succession, use of prescribed fire for insect pest control, and effects of fire on insect diversity from northern and boreal forests in North America. Fire suppression policies implemented in the early 1900s have resulted in profound changes in forest species composition and structure. Associated with these changes was an increased vulnerability of forest stands to damage during outbreaks of defoliating insects. Information about the roles that both fire and insects play in many northern forests is needed to increase our understanding of the ecology of these systems and to develop sound management policies.},

abstract={The U.S. Forest Service plans to restore >40,000 ha of the fire-dependent shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)-grassland community on the Ouachita National Forest and potentially >780,000 ha of the pine-grassland community throughout the Southeast to benefit the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Concern has arisen over impacts of large-scale conversion of closed-canopy forests to open pine-grassland woodlands. We evaluated how an ecosystem approach to habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected small mammals. During 2 winters we compared small mammal occurrence and abundance in untreated pine-hardwood stands to stands following wildlife stand improvement (WSI; midstory removal), and with WSI-treated stands in the first, second, and third dormant seasons following prescribed fire. Total abundance of small mammals was highest in WSI stands and was a more direct response to WSI (change in stand structure) than to fire. Increased species richness and diversity in the second year of this study was strongly related to both WSI and fire. No species was adversely affected by WSI or by fire. Rather, WSI and fire-reduced midstory, increased dead debris in the understory, promoted herbaceous production, and increased woody sprouting. Total community abundance, richness, and diversity were lowest in untreated stands. White-footed mice (Peromyscus spp.; primarily white-looted mouse [P. leucopus]) were the dominant species, accounting for 68% of the 611 individuals collected. Restoration efforts may be particularly beneficial to generalist species such as P. leucopus as well as to more specialized species, such as golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli) and fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens) that historically may have depended upon pine-grassland habitats. Restoration of pine-grassland communities may enhance small mammal communities by reestablishing a landscape element that was present during presettlement times.},

abstract={The native wildlife of Mauritius is highly threatened by a variety of influences other than habitat destruction. Protection from habitat destruction alone cannot guarantee its conservation and the damage already sustained is not fully reversible. Therefore, the ideal for conservation - maintenance or restoration of self-sustaining populations of all species in native ecosystems - is presently unattainable. We assessed three long-term strategies for maintaining and increasing populations of threatened native birds on the mainland and offshore islets of Mauritius, with respect to efficacy, sustainability, and side-effects. Rehabilitation of native vegetation on the mainland is likely to improve food availability over limited areas, but it can only form the basis of a long-term bird conservation strategy when population density of introduced animals, especially predators, can be reduced sustainably, at low financial cost, and without adversely affecting native wildlife. Marooning bird populations on ecologically rehabilitated islets can eliminate the predator problem, but they would be vulnerable to catastrophes (especially cyclones) and possibly disease, and much habitat management work is still needed. A third, novel strategy - enhancement of mainland habitat using exotic plants - allows creation of source habitats, greatly reducing the predator threat. It also permits longer areas to be managed, and at lower cost, than is the case with intensive rehabilitation. Habitat management regimes for conservation of threatened species or communities must be designed specifically to alleviate population-limiting factors. In altered environments certain exotic plants can be essential to the survival of native animal species. The most effective conservation measure must not be assumed always to be the rehabilitation of native vegetation.},

abstract={We reviewed the literature to assess the impact of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) on bird populations in the central USA. The CRP replaced production agriculture fields with grassland habitat used by more than 90 species of birds. At least 42 bird species nested in CRP habitats. Bird species richness in CRP fields was similar to that in rowcrop fields, but relative abundance was 1.4 to 10.5 times higher in CRP plantings. Nest abundance was 13.5 times higher in CRP than crop fields, although eating success of songbirds was only slightly higher in CRP fields (40) vs. 36% in crops). Limited evidence suggests that the CRP has positively affected the population growth rates of several nongame grassland bird species. Waterfowl nest densities and nesting success in CRP fields were similar to those occurring in grassland habitats managed specifically for waterfowl. The presence of CRP grassland has been postulated to have improved the quality of existing duck nest habitat by dispersing nests over a larger area. Ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus L.) populations seemingly increased substantially with CRP acres. Little evidence of positive population response by northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus L.) to the CRP is available. Overall, grassland birds known to be declining throughout North America were seemingly the most benefitted by the CRP.},

abstract={To evaluate the potential of bog ecosystems to recover following peat mining, we compared bird species richness, abundance, and assemblages and vegetation among naturally revegetated and undisturbed bog sites in southeastern Quebec. Based on mining history, we selected 28 sites (12 natural, 9 abandoned after blockcut extraction, and 7 abandoned after vacuum extraction) in 15 bogs. We estimated percent cover for six vegetation strata in 106 plots with 100 m radius, on which bird point counts were conducted in 1993 and 1996. Vegetation structure differed significantly between natural, post-blockcut and post-vacuum sites. While vegetation cover was almost complete in natural sites, abandoned sites, especially post vacuum, were less vegetated, even after 20 years. Bird species richness and abundance were similar in natural and post-blockcut sites and both were higher than in post-vacuum sites. Ten of the 28 species studied in detail responded to site perturbation. Among them, the Palm Warbler was most closely associated with natural sites. Bird communities were closely associated with vegetation structure. Communities of post-blockcut sites were more similar to those of natural bogs than were bird communities of post-vacuum sites. Since the blockcut method of peat mining is no longer economically feasible, we conclude that bog habitat restoration should be accompanied by a preservation 'safety net' area to counteract the lasting effect of vacuum peat mining on bird species assemblages.},

abstract={Species composition reflects a combination of environmental and historical events at a site; hence, changes in species composition can provide a sensitive measure of ecologically relevant changes in the environment. Here, we consider the analysis of species composition when multiple sites are followed through time. Analyses of temporal trends in species composition either summarize species composition into a few metrics (indices or axis scores) or analyze the similarity among sites. We develop and illustrate the similarity approach. Each pair of samples represents a pair of replicates, a pair from the same site at different times, a pair from different sites at the same time, or an unrelated pair. Differences among times can be estimated by comparing average temporal dissimilarity to average replicate dissimilarity. Temporal trends can be described by one of three statistics that measure progressive change, the correlation of temporal dissimilarity with the length of time between samples. These methods are illustrated using data on changes in a South Carolina zooplankton assemblage following disturbance, and changes in bird species composition on Skokholm Island, Wales. It is difficult to define and interpret temporal trends. Some definitions of interesting trends, like increasing divergence from another set of sample plots, place additional requirements on the sampling design. Including replicate samples or clustering sample plots and including 'control' plots for comparison with sentinel sites would contribute to an understanding of changes in species composition.},

abstract={Because logging has replaced fire as the most extensive and frequent disturbance regime in northeastern Minnesota, monitoring bird populations and their habitats has become increasingly important. We surveyed early-successional forests created by fire or logging for birds and their habitat during the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons. We found that overall bird species richness and number of individuals (territorial males/ha) were higher (P < 0.05) in burned forests than in logged forests. The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), house wren (Troglodytes aedon), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), Lincoln's sparrow (M. lincolnii), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were more abundant in burned areas. The Nashville warbler (Vermivora ruficapilla), chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica), black-throated green warbler (D. virens), and mourning warbler (Oporornis agilis) were present in greater numbers in the logged areas. We related these differences in bird presence and abundance to vegetation differences in the burned and logged habitat types. Burned areas had higher densities of dead trees, wider size ranges of dead trees, and greater heterogeneity in the shrub layer. Logged areas had higher densities of live trees, more live tree species, and wider size ranges of live trees. Red maple (Acer rubrum) was the live tree species found in greatest abundance in logged areas. If management goals include simulating natural disturbances like fire and maintaining bird populations, more dead trees should be left within logged habitats and the variability among logged areas should be increased.},

abstract={Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) is widely distributed in the Southwestern United States, where it frequently occurs in association with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Fire suppression and fuelwood harvest likely have reduced oak abundance within the pine-oak type. Gambel oak occurs in multiple age-related growth forms, from small shrubs to large, old trees, and may provide important foraging and nesting habitat for breeding birds. I compared attributes of breeding bird communities in 16 northern Arizona ponderosa pine stands from 1993-1995, that were structurally similar except for the presence or absence of Gambel oak. Overlap in bird species composition was high; pine and pine-oak stands had a mean Jaccard similarity value of 0.67. Five species were unique to pine stands, whereas 10 species were largely restricted to or only found in pine-oak stands. Overall bird diversity was significantly higher in pine-oak stands, which also had more species of Neotropical migrants, ground nesters, primary cavity excavators, and secondary cavity users than did pine stands. Pine and pine-oak stands had similar species evenness and similar rates of annual species turnover. Total bird abundance did not differ between cover types; however, primary cavity excavators were more abundant in pine-oak stands. Because of the apparent positive influence of oak on breeding birds, forest managers are encouraged to use treatments that retain and enhance the various growth forms of Gambel oak found in pine-oak stands.},

abstract={Many studies have examined differences in bird communities between shade and sun coffee plantations but less is known about how different management practices within shade coffee plantations affect bird populations. This study compares diversity and abundance of resident and migrant birds in two shade coffee plantations located in Palajunoj, Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, that differ in their farming practices (e.g. purning schedules and fertilizer regimes) and consequently, in vegetation structure. One plantation represents a traditional, polyculture shade system whereas the second represent a more modernized, monoculture shade system. Both plantations supported many resident and migrant birds. Bird abundance and diversity were significantly greater during both wet and dry seasons on the traditional farm, due largely to the vegetation structure resulting from the different management practices. All plantations typically classified as 'shade coffee' are not equivalent, much of their conservation value coming from the more diverse and structurally complex traditional polycultures rather than from the newer, monocultural systems. Coffee production techniques that affect the structural and floristic diversity of the vegetation (e.g. pruning, application of chemicals) have important consequences for birds.},

abstract={Degradation of Great Plains rangelands can be linked to past management practices that reduced native species diversity and accelerated establishment and expansion of exotic weeds and less desirable native species. Leafy spurge is an exotic perennial weed that infests more than 1 million ha in the northern Great Plains and reduces rangeland carrying capacity by competing with desirable forages and causing infested areas to be undesirable to cattle and wildlife. Research was conducted to determine the feasibility of using herbicides to suppress leafy spurge and other resident vegetation, which facilitated planting and establishment of native tallgrasses. Four experiments were conducted where 0.28, 0.56, and 0.84 kg/ha imazapyr and 0.1 kg ai/ha sulfometuron were applied alone and in combination and 0.84 kg ai/ha glyphosate was applied to leafy spurge-infested range sites in fall 1991 near Ainsworth, NE, and in fall 1991, 1992, and 1993 near Ansley, NE. Research areas were burned about 200 d after herbicide application to reduce plant residue. Monoculture stands of big bluestem and switchgrass were then no-till planted in each experiment and indiangrass was no-till planted in experiments initiated at Ansley in 1992 and 1993. Yields of the planted grasses, leafy spurge, and other vegetation were measured in August at each location starting the year after planting. Imazapyr was an essential component of treatments applied before planting to facilitate establishment of highly productive stands of the tallgrasses. Generally, yields were maximized by fall treatments of 0.28 kg/ha imazapyr + 0.1 kg/ha sulfometuron for big bluestem, 0.84 kg/ha imazapyr for indiangrass, and 0.84 kg/ha imazapyr + 0.1 kg/ha sulfometuron for switchgrass. Yields of the planted grasses were frequently four times greater where these herbicides were applied compared to where glyphosate or no herbicide were applied. Leafy spurge yields were usually reduced in areas where tallgrass yields were greatest. The sequential combination of suppressing vegetation with fall-applied herbicides, burning standing dead plant residue, then no-till planting desirable native tallgrasses in the spring increased productivity of these leafy spurge-infested range sites.},

abstract={Empirical studies of the effects of forestry on cavity-nesting birds largely neglect weak cavity excavators and instead focus on large, strong cavity excavators such as woodpeckers (Picidae). Weak cavity nesters tend to be smaller and may be less limited by the availability of large trees but more dependent on suitably softened wood. In this paper, we describe availability, use, and preference for nesting habitat of a small cavity-nesting bird, the red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadeasis), in mature coniferous forest in southeastern British Columbia. We describe nesting habitat at 3 spatial scales: (1) the level of forest stands proposed for logging (cutblocks), which ranged from 8.1 to 18.4 ha in size; (2) the level of 0.04-ha patches of forest centered on nest trees (nest plots); and (3) the level of individual nest trees. In addition to considering basic structural habitat features, we analyzed the relation between nesting use and several factors related to forest health, including Armillaria root disease (Armillaria ostoyae), stemwood decay, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestation, and dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.). Red-breasted nuthatches nested at higher densities on cutblocks with more dead trees (snags) and higher levels of root disease. Within nest plots, we also detected a preference for nesting in Armillaria-infected trees. Cavity nesting of nuthatches was influenced by both forest structure and the disease agents that contribute to it. We recommend that standing diseased and dead trees be retained in patches during logging operations. Retention of such trees in distinct patches more likely satisfies requirements for worker safety and for limiting the spread of diseases than does retention of single dead and diseased trees throughout cutblocks. Wildlife values not only should be incorporated into timber harvesting regulations but also should be considered when planning activities designed to improve forest health for timber production.},

abstract={Restoration of drained wetlands may contribute significantly to conservation of habitats for wetland birds, and state and federal agencies throughout the country rely on restoration and creation of wetlands to mitigate habitat losses to development. However, it is unclear if restored systems replace the habitat functions of natural wetlands, and few direct comparisons of multiple sites have been made. Three years after restoration, we compared the relative abundance and density of birds using 18 restored wetlands and 8 natural wetlands located in northern New York. Birds were classified as wetland dependent, wetland associated, or nonwetland. Abundances of species and of individuals in all 3 groups did not differ (P > 0.05) between restored and natural wetlands in any year. Densities of species in all 3 groups were consistently but not significantly lower at restored sites. Densities of individuals in the wetland-associated category and nonwetland category were significantly lower at restored sites for the first 2 years following restoration. Bird communities were significantly less similar between restored and natural sites than among restored sites. However, many of these differences may not persist following natural successional development of the restored sites. The long-term persistence of appropriate plant communities will determine whether or not restored sites provide bird habitat comparable to natural wetlands. The restoration program successfully increased the amount of bird habitat available in the region. However, hectare-for-hectare, the restored wetland sites did not replace the habitat functions of natural wetlands during the time period of this study.},

abstract={Throughout its geographic range, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is rare and appears very similar in its foraging ecology to 2 broadly sympatric congeners, the three-toed (P. tridactylus) and hairy woodpecker (P. villosus). The purposes of our study were to test for differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek fire near Fairbanks. Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2 years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ha. Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts, woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986. Our results suggest the black-backed woodpecker is extremely specialized in its foraging niche, exploiting outbreaks of wood-boring beetles in dying conifers for only 2-3 years after fires. Consequently, this species may be particularly vulnerable to local and regional extinction as fire suppression intensifies and programs of intensive salvage logging are pursued following fires.},

abstract={I examined the long-term dynamics of wintering and breeding bird communities at the Barrens Grouse Habitat Management Area (HAM) in central Pennsylvania. I compared community structure (species richness and population abundances) among three forested sectors that varied in extent of clearcutting and among forested plot types of different age since clearcutting from 1993-95 (termed period 2). These results, which were obtained six-eight years subsequent to a third cutting cycle, were then contrasted to those from a previous study (1988-90, termed period 1). The Barrens Grouse HMA consisted of three distinct sectors: a contiguous uncut stand, a series of uncut strip corridors, and a mosaic of small (1 ha) forest patches (plots). I observed 12 wintering bird species in period 2; most species (67%) were trunk-bark foragers. Uncut plots were used more often (P < 0.05) by wintering birds than clearcut plots, perhaps because uncut plots contained rough-barked trees as foraging substrate and more favorable microclimatic conditions. Of the 40 breeding bird species noted in period 2, most were ground-shrub foragers occurring principally in forested corridor and patch sectors. Abundances of six ground-shrub foraging species were higher (P < 0.05) in the forested patch than in other sectors in period 2; these species were found primarily in recent clearcut plots. Abundances of sallier-canopy foragers were higher (P < 0.05) than expected in contiguous forest and forested corridor sectors in period 2. Species richness, abundances of all wintering species combined, and abundances of two foraging guilds (trunk-bark and ground-shrub foragers) were similar among sectors in periods 1 and 2 in both winter and the breeding season. Abundances of three wintering species, however, were greater (P < 0.05) in period 2 than in period 1. In contrast to winter, abundances of all breeding species combined, sallier-canopy foragers, and five species increased (P < 0.05) between periods, whereas abundance of three species declined. Significant changes in abundances of wintering and breeding birds between periods at the Barrens Grouse HMA may be explained partially by plant succession or regional trends in population abundances.},

abstract={Major landscape changes in Götaland (southernmost Sweden) during the last millennium are reviewed, and an attempt to assess concomitant changes in biological diversity is made. 1 000 years ago, forests and mires dominated the landscape, except in some costal areas where open meadows prevailed. The forests were composed of several deciduous trees, especially oak, birch and beech (in the south), and, on poor soils, mainly of pine. Most forests were open grazing forests (pasture woodland), but ancient trees and large dead trees were still common. In some areas, rich deciduous forest dominated by lime and oak still occurred. During the following 700 years the forests were opened up by man, but biologically important structures of the virgin forests, viz. ancient trees, large dead trees and wetlands, remained abundant. During this period, biodiversity increased until the coverage of old-growth forest decreased to about 20 % of the surface area. The period 1800-1995 was a period of declining biodiversity, mainly due to local and regional extinction of species dependent on ancient trees and large dead trees. On the other hand, biodiversity among vascular plants and vertebrates changed comparatively little. However, these latter groups only comprise less than 5 % of the total biodiversity among macroorganisms. The very high biodiversity connected with decomposing wood, the fauna and flora of which has been affected most by the activities of man during the last 200 years, is stressed. In Sweden, the total species diversity connected with dead wood amounts to several thousand species, mainly fungi and insects. Restorations of old-fashioned cultural landscapes are now carried out in several places, unfortunately using the landscape of the 19th century as a model. During that period the biodiversity was lower than previously, since natural disturbance regimes with windfalls, fire, and natural water level fluctuations were no longer present. Therefore, the use of mediveal landscapes as a model for the restorations is recommended. This will lead to a higher biodiversity, and may be economically beneficial (wood products, meat, tourism). Studies of such landscapes provide insights useful in conservation and when developing sustainable forestry.},

abstract={The south-east Queensland region of subtropical Australia supports a high diversity of landbird species, many of which are migrants which visit lowland areas during winter. However, lowland habitats have been impacted by clearing and fragmentation of native forest types within the past 170 years. This paper considers the implications of loss and fragmentation of lowland eucalypt forests for birds in winter, by comparing the proportionate density of twelve selected species across 49 different cases representing a variety of structural habitat differences. There was little fragmentation effect on forest-dependant winter immigrant species down to about 10 ha. The smallest remnants had reduced proportionate abundances of forest-dependent species together with elevated abundances of two other species: Noisy Miner and Australian Magpie. Similar shifts in species composition occurred in association with a variety of types of change in native eucalypt forest, all involving alteration to physical structure incorporating reduction of foliage cover (at forest edges, in areas without understorey, in regenerating forest, on slopes and ridges, and after fires). We consider the ecological processes that might underlie these patterns, and suggest that: (1) habitat selection, possibly mediated and/or reinforced by interference competition from Noisy Miners, is a key process in the study system in winter; (2) habitat loss, rather than fragmentation, is likely to be the main cause of regional declines in forest-dependent winter migrants; and (3) the management of habitat for winter migrant birds within lowland eucalypt forests of this region should focus on maintaining and improving: (a) the overall percentage of lowland area covered by native forest, and (b) factors associated with the structural integrity (canopy and understorey cover, fire frequency, retention of complete microtopographic gradients) of remnant forest areas irrespective of their size, at least down to about 10 ha.},

abstract={Fragmentation of forested landscapes can reduce the reproductive success of birds occupying residual forest patches. Previous studies, however, have focused primarily on how nest predation can change when landscapes become fragmented by agriculture rather than by logging. To determine if predation on artificial nests in forest patches was influenced by the surrounding landscape, we placed ground and shrub nests along the edge and interior of forest patches located in agricultural, logged, and contiguous forest landscapes within a single region of the southern boreal mixedwood forest of central Canada. Nest predators were identified using remotely triggered cameras and by marks left in plasticine eggs, whereas the relative abundance of nest predators such as corvids and small mammals was estimated by surveys and live-trapping. The percentage of ground nests destroyed at the edge and interior of patches in the logged and contiguous forest landscapes was significantly lower than at the edge or interior of patches in the agricultural landscape. No differences in predation rate were observed for shrub nests among landscapes. We attributed higher rates of predation in the agricultural landscape to higher densities of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in the interior and a greater diversity of predators along edges. The similarity in predation rate between logged and contiguous forest landscapes suggests that fragmentation caused by logging may result in little change in predator communities and in this respect, might be similar to fragmentation caused by natural disturbance regimes such us fire. In contrast, fragmentation by agriculture seems to have more serious consequences for nesting birds. Policy changes that limit the growth of agriculture in the southern boreal mixedwood forest are required to conserve the diverse avifauna of this region.},

abstract={The Ortolan Bunting has recently been declared a directly threatened species in Norway. During the breeding seasons of 1996 and 1997 surveys were undertaken to obtain a reliable national population size estimate and knowledge of current distribution and habitat choice. The largest subpopulation breeds on a 9 km2 forest-fire site in Hedmark county which burned in 1976 and contained 49-52 males in 1996 and 46-50 males in 1997. More than one hundred lowland peat bogs were searched and Ortolan Buntings were found on 19 bogs (15 in Hedmark and 4 in Akershus counties). The number of males on each bog was 1-9 (median 3) and the total number of males recorded was 65 in 1997 when the most comprehensive peat bog search was done. Only 9 (in 1996) and 7 (in 1997) males in 8 mixed farmland localities in Telemark, Akershus and Oppland counties were found, even though mixed farmland traditionally has been the typical breeding habitat of Ortolan Buntings in Norway. The number of males in the whole of Norway was thus about 120 in known localities. A detectability test suggested that this may represent a total population of up to about 150 males. In the forest-fire locality many males remained unmated and the number of breeding pairs in Norway may therefore be &lt;100. The surveys therefore show that the current population size of Ortolan Buntings in Norway is small and the species has a limited geographical distribution, indicating that the status 'directly threatened' is warranted. The species' vulnerability is further increased by the fact that &gt;80% of the population is concentrated in only 10 localities.},

The wildfire significantly affected the population size of 13 species for a period of up to six years following the fire. Survival and recruitment were the least sensitive measures of impact and indicated a significant response to fire for only 2 of 10 species. We detected measurable effects of the fire for 17 of the 20 species studied. Many of these species had returned to prefire levels within three years, but for nine species the effects were still apparent six years later. Mark-recapture methodology provides an effective way of measuring the impact of fire regimes in forest environments. Long-term monitoring programmes should be established in fire-prone forest environments to contribute toward our understanding of fire, and its effect on avian populations. Such programmes have resource implications and researchers are urged to encourage the participation of the amateur bird banding community to contribute to such projects.},

abstract={Probability of occurrence of selected avian species was modeled as a function of modeled changes in landscape cover types in two landscapes to test whether (1) exotic and generalist avian species will continue to increase in an high density rural population landscape; and, (2) native grassland avian species will continue to increase in a low density rural population landscape. Landscape cover types were modeled with logistic regression based on temporal changes between 1966 and 1990. Demographic-economic regression models also were used to predict landscape cover types in year 2014 based on selected independent variables. Logistic regressions were used to model probability of occurrence of selected avian species based on predicted area of landscape cover types in year 2014. Model output of vegetation cover types suggests the continued use of intensive agriculture management practices in the high density rural population landscape while extensive agriculture management practices will maintain the native vegetation component in the low density rural population landscape. Our models suggest continued intensive agriculture practices associated with the high density rural population landscapes will adversely affect native grassland bird species to a greater magnitude than extensive ranching practices in the low density rural population landscapes.},

abstract={Fire history and stand structure was examined in twelve virgin forest stands situated within forest reserves in northern Sweden. The selected stands represented fire refuges as well as different successional stages after fire. Six of the stands were dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.), three were dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and three were dominated by hairy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) or aspen (Populus tremula L.). In 3 of the southernmost stands, the average fire interval was 34 to 65 years during the late 1600s to late 1800s, but since 1888 no fires had occurred in any of the stands. The absence of fire disturbance since 1888 is probably caused by the fire suppression in the overall landscape. The standing volume of living trees ranged between 87 and 511 m3 ha-1 while the volume of dead trees, including both snags and logs, ranged between 27 and 201 m3 ha-1. The volume of dead trees constituted ca. 30% of the total stem volume. In the conifer dominated stands, there was a statistically significant relationship between total stem volume, including both living and dead trees, and site productivity. A comparison between the amount of dead and living trees indicated substantial changes in tree species composition in several stands. It is suggested that data on the amount of dead trees, especially logs, and its distribution over decay classes could be used to examine the continuity of certain tree species. All stands had a multi-sized tree diameter distribution which in most cases was similar to a reversed J-shaped distribution. In general spruce was numerous in the seedling cohort and in small diameter classes, indicating that its proportion in the stands was stable, or was increasing at the expense of pioneer tree species such as pine, aspen and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.). The most numerous species in the seedling cohort, rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.), was almost totally missing in the tree layer, indicating a high browsing pressure preventing rowan seedlings from growing into trees. The general increase of spruce and the sparse regeneration of pioneer species, in the stands previously affected by fire, are discussed in relation to natural disturbance regimes, biological diversity and nature conservation policies. It is proposed that reintroduction of fire disturbance is a necessity for future management plans of forest reserves. Other management practices to increase species diversity within forest reserves are also discussed.},

abstract={Bird communities of the West Gulf Coastal Plain are strongly influenced by the stage of forest succession, species composition of understory and overstory vegetation, and forest structure. Alteration of plant communities through forest management and natural disturbances typically does not eliminate birds as a faunal group from the area affected, but will replace some species with others and cause changes in the abundance and species composition of bird communities. Upland, fire disclimax pine savannah communities composed of primarily longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) provide mature pines for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) while simultaneously providing grassland ground cover for Bachman's Sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) and Henslow's Sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii). On the mesic mid-slopes where there is an increasing presence of loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus echinata) pine and hardwood species, Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and White-eyed Vireos (Vireo griseus) find habitat in the understory and midstory vegetation, whereas canopy hardwoods and pines provide habitat for Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) and Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra). Transition into the wet bottomland hardwood forests increases the abundance of bird species associated with deciduous wetlands such as Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) and Swainsoh's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii), whereas species associated with conifers and grassland savannahs are lost. Anthropogenic or natural disturbances that set back mature stages of forest succession can dramatically alter the species composition of bird communities. Depending on patch size, forest removal can initiate forest succession and provide habitat for early succession bird species such as Blue Grosbeaks (Guiraca caerulea), Field Sparrows (Spizella pusilla), Prairie Warblers (Dendroica discolor), Painted Buntings (Passerina ciris), Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), and Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens). Although current data are inconclusive, patch size, forest fragmentation, edge effect, and landscape use patterns appear to influence bird communities by affecting area-sensitive species. Of greatest concern are forest-interior bird species that appear to be area sensitive such as the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea), Northern Parula (Parula americana), Louisiana Waterthrush (Seiurus motacilla), American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus).},

However, studies examining the impact of management practices on the conservation of migratory species often use song rate techniques to census populations. We examined song rates in three species of forest birds in northwestern Virginia, and found that Wood Thrushes and Ovenbirds sang more often in blocks of continuous forest, while Northern Cardinals sang more often in forest patches. Individuals >50 m from the observer sang more often than closer birds, and individuals in higher density populations sang more often than individuals at low density sites. The spatial variability in song rate was not severe enough to significantly change species-detection rates for 5-min song counts, but did significantly affect our population density estimates for those species. A key assumption of song count censuses, that all individuals of a species sing at comparable rates and thus have an equal probability of being detected, regardless of habitat structure, may not be valid.},

abstract={By late 1985, the population of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, had declined to a low of four individuals. Because of extensive timber harvesting prior to the 1950s, the older live pine trees that Red-cockaded Woodpeckers require for cavity construction were limited. We monitored the response of the population to intensive habitat enhancement that included construction of artificial cavities, control of cavity competitors, and removal of the hardwood mid-story to improve nesting habitat quality. Translocations of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers from on-site and donor populations were undertaken to enhance the number of breeding pairs, the overall population size, and to minimize potential adverse genetic consequences of a small population size. From 1986-1995, we carried out 54 translocations, installed 305 artificial cavities, and removed 2304 southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) (a cavity competitor). Concomitant intensive population monitoring revealed that the number of breeding pairs of woodpeckers increased from 1 to 19 and the overall population size grew from 4 to 99 individuals, reflecting the highly focused habitat restoration effort. Intensive management has been successful in rehabilitating this critically small population of endangered birds.},

abstract={Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa nebulosa) populations in North America have likely been stable over the past 10-100+ yr. Local populations fluctuate in response to food supply and/or nestsite availability. Breeding Great Gray Owls require preexisting nest structures in forest stands that are adjacent to open foraging habitat, preferably with hunting perches. Current forestry practices have the potential to affect about 75% of the Great Gray Owls' breeding range in North America. Intensive timber management typically removes large diameter and deformed nest trees, leaning trees used by juveniles for roosting before they can fly and stands with dense canopy closure used by juveniles and adults for cover and protection. Modified forest management can, however, create new foraging habitat by opening up large, dense forest stands. Specific recommended guidelines include restriction of harvest unit size (≤5-10 ha), but within a mosaic of multi-sized units, retention of forest stands within 300 m of known or potential nest trees/sites, provision of hunting perches in cut-over areas, ensuring irregularly shaped harvest units and maintenance of forested travel corridors between cut-over areas. Because Great Gray Owls can breed on home ranges up to 800 km apart in successive years, integration of local management regimes at a landscape scale is recommended. Ideally, spatio-temporal patterns of natural disturbance (e.g., fire) should be emulated in a management plan to sustain the region's natural biological diversity, including Great Gray Owls when appropriate.},

abstract={We studied the avifauna of sun and shade coffee plantations and associated mid-elevation habitats during the dry season of 1995. The three plantation types (Inga, Gliricidia, and sun) showed high faunistic similarities with each other and were both distinct and depauperate compared to matorral and forest patch habitats. Of all the coffee plantation habitats, Inga shade had the highest diversity. Species associated with wooded vegetation were more common in shade plantations, particularly in Inga. A second census showed a decline in bird numbers that was more pronounced in sun and Gliricidia than in Inga plantations. Overall, differences between the plantation types were small and all coffee plantations were less diverse than traditional coffee farms previously studied in nearby Chiapas, Mexico. The relatively low bird diversity was probably due to the low stature, low tree species diversity, and heavy pruning of the canopy. These features reflect management practices that are common throughout Latin America. The most common species of birds in all coffee plantation habitats were common second-growth or edge species; more specialized forest species were almost completely absent from plantations. Furthermore, many common matorral species were rare or absent from coffee plantations, even sun plantations with which matorral shares a similar superficial structure. Coffee plantations probably will only be important for avian diversity if a tall, taxonomically and structurally diverse canopy is maintained. We suggest this is most likely to occur on farms that are managed for a variety of products rather than those designated entirely for the production of coffee.},

abstract={In 1989 a wildfire destroyed 300 ha of natural pine forest and Mediterranean woodland on Mt. Carmel, Israel. Consequently an interdisciplinary scientific effort in fire ecology was initiated in order to propose recommendations to the management authorities. Field data gathered on soil erosion in the Mt. Carmel site implied that erosion is severe only during the first winter after fire, but it does not seem to present a significant threat to longterm ecosystem recovery. The recovery of the natural vegetation mitigates erosion, and there is no special need for any precautions to be taken immediatly following fire. Salvage cutting of burned trees had no effect on pine seedling recruitment, on vegetation development and on plant species diversity. Salvage cutting did affect passerine bird community by slowing down succession rate. For successful regeneration of the pine forest the burned site need not to be planted, since the number of natural pine seedlings is safficiently great, and there is a need to conserve the genetic and spatial variability of the forest. Although thinning has a positive effect on short-term pine survival and growth, such action is not recommended since pine seedlings are susceptible to pine bast scale (Matsococcus josephi) up to seven years, and to severe damage by porcupines. Selection caused by this bast scale might improve the resistance of the new pine forest stand. Pine seedling growing in the microsites of the old burned pine trees should be treated carefully, since some of them, due to their fast development, appear to be the next generation of the forest. Thinning of these groups can be considered after seven years, accompanied by removal of Cistus dwarf shrubs. However, where porcupine damage is observed, thinning should be done at low rates and with no pruning of side twigs. Since animal succession is a consequence of the change and progress in vegetation structure, there is no need for animal resettlement. The concept of "fuel breaks", combining a single massive thinning of the woody vegetation and an annual short but heavy grazing, is a management option for decreasing fire danger and future fire damage.},

abstract={1. Beavers create habitat diversity across catchment landscapes by impounding small streams. This increased habitat diversity leads to increased species richness of plants and animals in small streams. As managers work to balance conflicting management goals (e.g. protection of timber and human structures versus maintenance of biological diversity) the influence of beaver population management practices on habitat availability needs to be assessed. Two questions of initial concern are: (i) how do different levels of management influence that availability of beaver created habitats and (ii) do relationships developed in one region apply to other regions? 2. To address these questions, historical aerial photography was used to determine the extent and rate of impoundment of streams by beavers Castor canadensis over a 77 000 ha south-eastern North American landscape during a 40-year period of beaver population recovery. Between 1950 and 1983, beaver populations were protected from trapping and hunting. From 1983 to the present, beaver numbers were reduced by fatal trapping, to protect roads, railroads and timber. Trapped beavers were assigned to specific colonies associated with beaver-created patches in the landscape, and growth rates and size after management of individual patches receiving different levels of management were compared. Results from this study were also compared with previous studies conducted in Minnesota, USA. 3. Growth rate, patch size following management and the composition of habitat types within patches were not related to management activity, suggesting that the levels of management used in this study did not influence the temporal dynamics of beaver-created patches. The extent and rate of beaver impoundment on the south-eastern Upper Coastal Plain of North America was less than that reported from central North American landscapes over comparable periods. 4. These results have the following implications for management: (i) management activities should be monitored on a regional basis; (ii) conflicting beaver population management goals should be addressed, evaluated and balanced; (iii) beavers do not present a threat to flowing-water species in south-eastern North America and need not be controlled for this reason.},

abstract={In wildlife considerations in planning and managing road corridors little attention has been given to the effects of disturbance by traffic on populations of breeding birds. Recent studies, however, show evidence of strongly reduced densities of many species of woodland and open habitat in broad zones adjacent to busy roads. The density reduction is related to a reduced habitat quality, and traffic noise is probably the most critical factor. Because density can underestimate the habitat quality, the effects on breeding populations are probably larger than have been established. In consequence, species that did not show an effect on the density might still be affected by traffic noise. On the basis of this recent knowledge, methods have been developed that can be used in spatial planning procedures related to main roads, and in road management practice, and some practical points are discussed. An example of application shows that the effects are probably very important in The Netherlands with a dense network of extremely crowded main roads. For 'meadow birds', which are of international importance, the decrease in population in the West of The Netherlands may amount to 16%. Because breeding birds suffer from many other environmental influences there is also a great risk of an important cumulation of effects.},

abstract={Mechanisms which prevent gene how will maintain differentiation between species, and therefore contribute to biological diversity. We describe an experimental study of such mechanisms in a hybrid zone between the fire-bellied toad Bombina bombina and the yellow-bellied toad B. variegata. In this system, preference for different breeding habitats reduces the frequency of hybridization. A comparison of habitat ecology shows that the semi-permanent ponds in which B. bombina usually breeds have higher densities of aquatic predators than the temporary puddles typically used by B. variegata. We test for behavioural adaptations in tadpoles to these different levels of predation. B. bombina tadpoles are significantly less active than B. variegata, both before and after the introduction of a predator to an experimental arena; this reduces their vulnerability as many predators detect prey through movement. Behavioural differences translate into differential survival: B. variegata suffer higher predation rates in laboratory experiments with three main predator types (Triturus sp., Dytiscus larvae, Aeshna nymphs). This differential adaptation to predation will help maintain preference for alternative breeding habitats, and thus mechanism maintaining the distinctions between the two species.},

abstract={An annotated compendium of all those bird species known to have occurred in the lowland "Man and Biosphere" Beni Biological Station (B.B.S.) reserve is provided. Previous checklists are reviewed, together with sightings accumulated over the 1992-1995 period during which approximately 70 new species have been added to the reserve inventory, bringing the total to 478. Occurrence across the 12 delineated habitats, relative abundance and sighting documentation are given for each species. The avifauna of the B.B.S. is mixed biogeographically; in addition to a substantial component of lowland birds widespread throughout South America, it is composed of Amazonian, cerrado and chaco elements also. Representation from the Bolivian Yungas is minimal. Significantly, no less than four threatened and 15 near-threatened species have occurred, including the little known Bolivian endemic Unicoloured Thrush Turdus haplochrous, and the enigmatic White-winged Nightjar Caprimulgus candicans, known until recently only from Emas National Park (Brazil). Short accounts are provided detailing records of all of these species. Birds of the reserve core, consisting largely of humid tropical forest formations inundated during the austral summer, appear not to be subjected currently to any serious environmental degradation, although some subsistence clearance by Chimane Indians in the northern reaches of the reserve gives some cause for concern. Of much greater import, however, are changes occurring outside the confines of the B.B.S. These include increasing urbanization immediately to the west (and associated road upgrading) and forest fragmentation to the south brought about by logging. The latter is especially worrying because linkage of the B.B.S. forest block to surrounding forest is already physically tenuous, and therefore it is imperative that future logging activities be geared to minimize isolation occurring and the damaging restriction of gene flow. Monitoring in rainforest immediately south of the reserve should become routine to warn of putative avifaunal impoverishments. Extensive surveying of the 2,500-ha El Porvenir éstancia (savanna and related forest islands) due to be assimilated shortly into the B.B.S., which constitutes less than 2% of the area under consideration, has shown that it is used by no less than three threatened and up to nine near-threatened species. In the absence of data relating to other savanna areas (c. 15%) at present, the exact status of each species at the B.B.S. remains imprecise and begs for further research to be undertaken. Unfortunately, present management of the El Porvenir savanna is not conducive to the long-term maximization of populations of these species, several of which have local strongholds in this part of Beni. We recommend that the current policy of cattle ranching adopted by this éstancia should cease or be reduced dramatically, to minimize grazing and trampling damage, and that measures should be taken to reduce incursions of fires started wilfully in neighbouring properties. The Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Bolivia, which administers the reserve, should be encouraged to safeguard and enhance the savanna complement further by ensuring that the impending ratification of El Porvenir proceeds as quickly as possible, and by purchasing additional tracts of land to the south of the present southern reserve boundary, where feasible. Such actions should not only secure the future of the biota of the savanna habitat within the B.B.S. but also should ameliorate the degree of isolation which has occurred already by preserving the "curiches" (former river beds) and forest islands which act as access corridors for forest-dwelling and other birds.},

abstract={1. Skylark numbers declined by 51% between 1968 and 1995 on UK lowland farmland; a loss of approximately 3 million breeding birds. This study examined whether distribution and breeding success of skylarks varied with the cropping of organically and intensively managed fields in southern England in accordance with the hypothesis that changes in agricultural land-use and intensity of management have contributed to this decline. 2. Density was lowest on fields surrounded by tall boundary structures or unsuitable habitat, and those with tail, dense vegetation cover. After controlling for these effects, set-aside and organically-cropped fields supported significantly higher skylark densities throughout the breeding season than intensively cropped fields or grazed pasture. Nests were usually built in crops between 20 and 50 cm tall. In fast-growing broad-leaved crops (e.g. oilseed rape, legumes), skylarks held territories, but no nesting activity was observed. Rapid crop growth probably allows too little time for nesting to begin. 3. Breeding success was higher on set-aside than on intensively managed cereals. Predation caused most nest failures, but did not vary in frequency with crop type. Silage cutting and trampling caused many failures on grass fields, and all cases of apparent brood starvation occurred in cereal fields. These breeding success data, together with published estimates of survival rates, suggest that skylark pairs must make 2-3 nesting attempts per season in order for populations to be self-sustaining. A single crop type rarely provides a suitable vegetation structure for nesting throughout the breeding season. Skylarks therefore require structurally diverse crop mosaics in order to make multiple nesting attempts without territory enlargement or abandonment. Mixed farms are more likely to fulfil these requirements than those dominated by winter cereals and broad-leaved crops. 4. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that loss of mixed farming and rotational cropping, and concomitant increases in autumn sowing of crops, agrochemical inputs, multiple silage cuts and grazing intensities since the 1950s have reduced the breeding productivity and population density of skylarks on lowland farmland in southern England. 5. The following recommendations are made for changes in farming systems that would assist the conservation of breeding skylark populations on lowland farmland. Organic farming systems, set-aside and habitat management for gamebirds are all likely to improve nesting and feeding conditions for skylarks. More generally, breeding skylark populations are only likely to increase on farms that reduce agrochemical inputs, reduce grazing intensity and frequency of silage cutting, and increase the structural diversity of field vegetation by adopting mixed rotations of winter and spring cereals, root crops and grass. Traditional mixed farming systems of this kind are now rarely economically desirable. Only agricultural policy reforms motivated in part by environmental concerns rather than solely by production control are likely to direct subsidy support to reduced-intensity, mixed farming enterprises of this kind, and thus help to restore populations of breeding skylarks on lowland farmland.},

abstract={The results of the monitoring of woodpecker abundance on the island of Aasla (Finnish Baltic coast) during 1979-1995 are presented and analysed. Population fluctuations on Aasla were similar to those in mainland Finland in the case of the Grey-headed Woodpecker Picus canus and the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius. Breeding abundance of Black Woodpeckers was negatively correlated with snow depth and positively correlated with temperature in February. Also, breeding densities of Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major and Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor correlated positively with mean January and February temperatures. We suggest that several mild winters in the second part of the study period (1988-1995), are the primary reasons for the continuously high population densities of Grey-headed and Black Woodpeckers. We did not find any evidence indicating competition between Grey-headed and Black Woodpeckers. We stress the need for creating foraging substrates (e.g. standing dead wood) as food sources for woodpecker species in boreal forests under severe winter conditions.},

abstract={Very little is known about some key variables that would be involved in any sound program to conserve biodiversity in temperate forests. For example, the distributions of both species and population diversity are almost totally unexplored. How well species diversity in different groups is correlated at a local scale is unknown; as a result it is unclear whether there are any 'indicator groups' that can serve as surrogates for overall species diversity when designing specific conservation projects. Equally, the areal extent of both Mendelian populations and demographic units in forests of various types is essentially unknown, as is the frequency of occurrence of metapopulations. There is thus a need for a geographically and ecologically stratified sample of studies evaluating patterns of both species and population diversity. That sample should also provide information in other areas where much more understanding is required for the formulation of sound policies. These include issues of: time-scale (maintenance of appropriate successional stages and disturbance regimes, the long-term viability of heavily harvested forests or plantations, and rates of evolutionary response to global change); edge effects and their penetration into forest; 'vulnerability', including interactions between climatic stress and insect infestation, susceptibility to invasions or to extinction cascades, and other subtle effects such as habitat dilution. Such information is essential to judge how easily management practices may be adapted to different forests. It can be used to improve 'internal' conservation strategies: those based on knowledge of the systems to be conserved. There are, however, internal strategies whose adoption requires no more scientific information than is available now. These include a ban on further timber harvesting in old-growth or riparian zones; limited harvests in mature second growth with careful monitoring; concentration of exploitation in present plantations; and restoration of degraded lands to conservation or plantation status. 'External' strategies are designed to limit and then to reduce the scale of human enterprise to make the internal strategies feasible. While what needs to be done there is very clear, how to accomplish it is not. In the face of all this ignorance, some priorities are suggested for research, and some 'common sense' strategies of conservation that can be used faute de mieux while awaiting more thorough understanding of temperate forest ecosystems. The most important is that conservation biologists spend much more time on external strategies.},

abstract={A survey of birds and mammals in Paspalum quadrifarium grasslands managed with fire, located in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, was performed. Relative abundance of birds and micromammals, their habitat relations and fire effects, were studied with the aim of providing information for a sustainable management of this ecosystem. The study area had a patchy structure, constituted by three principal habitats: tall-grass (mostly P. quadrifarium), short-grass (Distichlis sp., Botriochloa sp., Stenotaphrum sp., Stipa sp. y Mentha sp.) and marsh (Solanum sp.). Thirty five of the 39 bird species registered in these grasslands, mainly were found in habitats where P. quadrifarium was predominant. Thirteen of these species showed a strong dependence on P. quadrifarium for food, refuge and nesting requirements mainly, (Spartonoica maluroides, Asthenes hudsoni, Cranioleuca sulphurifera y Cistothorus platensis). Fifteen mammal species were registered. Among micromammals, 3 rodents (Oxymycterus rutilans, Oryzomys flavescens, Akodon azarae) and the small opossum Monodelphis dimidiata were the more strongly related to the P. quadrifarium grassland. A preliminary account of the effects of grazing after fire, in an experimentally burned area, showed an absence of micromammal captures and a replacement of bird species linked to P. quadrifarium by species that prefer short grasslands (Vanellus chilensis, Milvago chimango, Anthus correndera). Finally, we emphasize the importance of considering the fauna in the management of this agroecosystem.},

abstract={Bird use of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and row-crop fields was studied in central Iowa from May through July 1991-1993. Thirty-three bird species were recorded in CRP fields and 34 in row-crop fields. The most abundant species in both habitats was the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), accounting for 35% of all birds in CRP and 24% in row-crop fields. The dickcissel (Spiza americana), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), common yellowthroat (Geothypis trichas), brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) were the next most abundant species in CRP plots. The horned lark (Eremophita alpestris), vesper sparrow (Pooecetesgramineus) and brown-headed cowbird were the next most abundant species in row-crop fields. Nests of 16 bird species were found in CRP fields, with red-winged blackbirds accounting for 48% of all nests found. The vesper sparrow and horned lark were the only species nesting in row-crop fields. The major cause of nest loss for all species was predation, accounting for 52% of all nest loss in CRP fields and 65% in row-crop fields. Mammals accounted for 89, 88 and 85% of the predation on grasshopper sparrow, red-winged blackbird and dickcissel nests, respectively. The Conservation Reserve Program has likely contributed to an increase in the abundance of many bird species in central Iowa, inasmuch as the row-crop habitat that it replaced has lower bird abundance and supports fewer nesting species. The vegetation structure and composition of CRP fields in central Iowa are diverse, resulting in differences in the bird species communities using these fields. The effects of several land-management practices are discussed relative to bird species composition and nesting success.},

abstract={Industrialized agriculture currently substitutes many of the ecological functions of soil micro-organisms, macroinvertebrates, wild plants, and vertebrate animals with high cost inputs of pesticides and fertilizers. Enhanced biological diversity potentially offers agricultural producers a means of reducing the cost of their production. Conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes may be greatly enhanced by the adoption of certain crop management practices, such as reduced pesticide usage or measures to prevent soil erosion. Still, the vast monocultures comprising the crop area in many Canadian agricultural landscapes are often of limited conservation value, thus the inclusion of appropriate wildlife habitat in and around arable lands is a fundamental prerequisite for the integration of wild species within agricultural landscapes. This review of current literature considers the potential for non-crop areas within agricultural landscapes to be reservoirs of agronomically beneficial organisms including plants, invertebrates, and vertebrate species. Non-crop habitats adjacent to crop land have been identified as significant for the maintenance of plant species diversity, for the conservation of beneficial pollinating and predatory insects, and as essential habitat for birds. A key component for enhancement of biodiversity is the reintroduction of landscape heterogeneity by (1) protection and enhancement of key non-crop areas, (2) smaller fields and farms, and (3) a greater mixture of crops, through rotation, intercropping and regional diversification. The benefits of increased biodiversity within arable lands are reviewed for various species groups. In the Canadian context, any serious attempt to derive significant agronomic benefit from increased biodiversity will require considerable changes in the agricultural programs and policies which shape mainstream industrialized agriculture. The problems of crop depredation by vertebrate species, weed and insect competition, which still represent significant impediments to the creation and proper management of wildlife habitat, are also discussed.},

One bird species (Black‐backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing dead forests created by stand‐replacement fires. Bird communities in recently burned forests are different in composition from those that characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including early‐successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding guilds are especially abundant therein: woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters. Standing, fire‐killed trees provided nest sites for nearly two‐thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites. Broken‐top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for cavity‐nesting species significantly more often than expected on the basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the broken‐top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest conditions prior to a fire (especially the presence of snags) may be important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity‐nesting birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or relatively restricted to burned forests, stand‐replacement fires may be necessary for long‐term maintenance of their populations. Unfortunately, the current fire policy of public land‐management agencies does not encourage maintenance of stand‐replacement fire regimes, which may be necessary for the creation of conditions needed by the most fire‐dependent bird species. In addition, salvage cutting may reduce the suitability of burned‐forest habitat for birds by removing the most important element—standing, fire‐killed trees–needed for feeding, nesting, or both by the majority of bird species that used burned forests.

One successfully breeding pair was radio-monitored throughout a year. Additional telemetry data were collected in summer from a male in a pair that failed breeding. In summer the birds almost exclusively preyed upon ant colonies in soil and rotten stumps located in young conifer plantations. In winter, when snow or frost prohibited ground feeding, birds were feeding on bark-dwelling insects in old pine and dead trees. The winter shift in diet and feeding behavior was accompanied by an approximately 100 times enlargement in home range size, increasing from 50-100 ha (n = 3) in summer to 4500-5400 ha (n = 2) in winter. -Authors},

abstract={The concept of ecosystem restoration is gaining momentum in western Europe. This is necessary because in most managed nature reserves one or more of the following processes, which are analogous to those that have led to the dramatic loss of biological diversity in Europe, are still operating: continuing nutrient output, continuing high level of disturbance and fixing the system in some successional stage. This is partly because most management activities have been derived from, or copy, former agricultural practices. The study of natural ecosystems has revealed the key role large herbivores have in maintaining structural diversity in the vegetation and so biological diversity. Because of this they have been used as tools in achieving a variety of conservation goals. Here, various effects large herbivores can have on plant species composition, structural diversity of the vegetation and fauna are briefly reviewed. Attention is given to pasture‐woodlands in southern Europe, which often have a relatively high biological diversity and share some key features with natural ecosystems: very low nutrient input, extensive grazing with large herbivores and the presence of natural tree cover. In a number of European countries attempts are being made to restore normal functioning multi‐(herbivore) species ecosystems. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

A few bird species used all vegetation types at some time, but most were limited by vegetation structure or water presence. Olney's three-square bulrush (Scirpus olneyi), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and mudflats were especially favored feeding and resting areas in response to periodic flooding and had the greatest frequency of use as well as species richness.

abstract={The book is divided into four sections. The first section, chapters two and three, deals with the raw material for the study of biological diversity. Chapter two discusses the variety of diversity patterns, and environmental conditions, found in ecosystems at spatial scales ranging from the entire globe to soil particles. Chapter three addresses issues related to the measurement and quantification of diversity. The second section, chapters four and five, reviews the historical development of theories of species diversity, focusing on the importance of equilibrium versus non-equilibrium processes in regulating species diversity. The third section (chapters six-ten) addresses mechanisms of intra- and inter-specific competition, particularly among plants. Chapter six deals with the regulation of diversity within populations of single species. Chapter seven extends the effect of interactions from the population to the community and ecosystem level. Chapters eight, nine and ten discuss the spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution of organisms on landscapes. The fourth section (chapters 11-14) applies the concepts developed in parts two and three. Endemism and invasions are discussed in chapter 11, while chapter 12 looks at marine systems. Chapter 13 deals with terrestrial plant ecosystems in which diversity is regulated by fire and chapter 14 deals with rainforests. A discussion of some of the economic and conservation implications of the counterintuitive regulation of global diversity gradients, concludes the book. -from Author},

abstract={The urgent need to integrate evolutionary theory into applied habitat management and land-use planning endeavors has become a focus for much conservation and biodiversity related research. Only recently have scientists begun to incorporate a holistic ecosystem approach, focusing on relationships among plant and animal resources rather than on individual species, into their management philosophies. Swept up in these emerging efforts to sustain biological diversity and functional ecosystems, genetic concepts have been incorporated into habitat management with an alarming mixture of excellence, generalization, and unfortunately even misconception. This does not imply that evolutionary theory has no bearing on the applied sciences but rather that more attention must be given to the interface between theoretical and applied research. The need to integrate genetic theory into ongoing conservation and management efforts is clear; however, much controversy remains as to how this integration may be accomplished for individual management situations. For vertebrates, the transfer of genetic information between generations or within and among various breeding components of populations is inextricably linked to the ecosystem in which they exist. Changes in the structure of an ecosystem can and must influence the ecology of its component species to some extent. However, genetic consequences resulting from changes in the ecology of species or species complexes are not clearly understood. Undoubtedly, alterations in the transfer and conservation of genetic information occur concomitantly with large-scale changes in the landscape. It is likely that these small undetected changes at the genetic level impact species to a similar extent as larger more obvious landscape level factors. In this work we will discuss concepts that are integral to the long-term existence of organisms in managed landscapes and to maintenance of gene diversity in general. Specifically, we will focus on the concept of effective population size, confusion associated with this concept, and its applicability to the maintenance of biologically diverse and sustainable landscapes. © 1994.},

abstract={The area of salt marshes does no longer increase. The recent erosion coincides with a rise in MHT-level in the last 25 years. Despite the decrease in area, sedimentation continues, especially in the lower salt marsh, which acts as a sink of nitrogen. Assimilation and mineralization of nitrogen are in balance in most plant communities along the gradient from lower to higher salt marshes. Mineralization of nitrogen increases towards the higher salt marsh, whereas the above-ground production and the mean nitrogen content of plants decrease. There is a positive correlation between quality of food plants in salt marshes and breeding success of Brent geese in the arctic tundra. Sedimentation on mainland salt marshes can compensate for the expected sea level rise. This is not the case for island salt marshes, if the relative sea level rise is more than 0.5-1.0 cm yr-1. The natural succession on salt marshes results in an accumulation of organic material, which is related to the dominance of single plant species. It is not clear to which extent this process is enhanced by eutrophication from acid deposition and seawater. Human exploitation of unprotected salt marshes is old and heavy in the system of mound settlements. Reclamation rates by dikes in the last centuries were higher than the rate of area increase. Grazing by cattle as a management practice results in both a higher plant species-richness and community diversity than abandoning; hay-making is intermediate, but shows less structural diversity than grazing with low stocking density. The invertebrate fauna is favoured by a short period of abandoning, but eventually characteristic salt marsh invertebrates are replaced by inland species. Many bird species prefer grazed salt marshes. The final section gives some perspectives. Provided that no further embankments take place the optimal nature management option for plants and animals is a vegetation pattern, which includes areas with a low canopy (grazed) and areas with a tall canopy. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={The bird species composition of 88 patches of monsoon rainforest in the Kakadu National Park area of the Northern Territory was examined in the period AprilNovember 1987. The monsoon rainforest avifauna is a ‘cut- and-paste’ community, comprising species derived from wet tropical rainforests, from Eucalyptus open forests, from mangroves, from paperbark woodlands and habitat generalist species. Its composition may be seasonally unstable, and is re-arranged between monsoon rainforests of differing floristics or environment. For most bird species considered, the distribution was well associated with a division of monsoon rainforests into six groups:coastal, subcoastal, lowland springs, sandstone springs, escarpment and rock outcrop. Escarpment and rock outcrop rainforests were relatively depauperate. Monsoon rainforests are fragmented into small patches. The distribution of many characteristic rainforest birds (e.g. Orange-footed Scrub-fowl, Rainbow Pitta, Grey Whistler), bird species diversity and a Conservation Index were correlated with patch size. Bird species more typical of Eucalyptus open forests were abundant in patches most disturbed by buffalo, pigs, weeds and fire. No species were particularly associated with the edges of monsoon rainforests, but several open forest species occurred more commonly at edges than in the interior of monsoon rainforests (e.g. Barshouldered Dove, White-throated Honeyeater and Doublebarred Finch). Birds occurring in monsoon rainforests are probably highly vagile, a response mainly to the marked seasonality of the environment and the fragmented nature of monsoon rainforests. © 1993 CSIRO.

abstract={Breeding of hollow-nesting birds and the distribution and availability of tree hollows were investigated in an area of sclerophyll forest in north-eastern Tasmania. The occurrence of potential tree hollows was assessed from the ground and used as an index of actual hollows. Entrance size was categorized as small, medium or large corresponding to the differing requirements of the birds present on the site. Smaller hollows were more abundant than larger hollows. The distribution of hollows amongst trees was highly clumped. Diameter at breast height and the presence of a fire scar explained one-third of the variation in numbers of hollows per tree. Streamside and non-streamside areas did not differ in the number of hollows/tree or the sizes of hollows present. Thirty trees were found that were utilized as nest sites by striated pardalotes Pardalotus striatus, laughing kookaburras Dacelo novae-gaineae, green rosellas Platycercus caledonicus and yellow-tailed black cockatoo Calyptorhynchus funereus. In comparison with a representative sample of trees, nest trees were larger, had a greater number of potential hollows, a greater proportion of larger hollows and a greater proportion were fire scarred. Eucalyptus viminalis was used as a nest tree to a greater extent than expected from its relative abundance. Hollows appeared to be far in excess of the requirements of the birds present. Trees remaining in streamside reserves after logging would probably provide enough hollows to support the number of hollow-nesting birds present before logging. However, only 13% of striated pardalotes and none of the other species utilized streamside areas for nesting in the undisturbed forest. © 1993 Taylor & Francis, Ltd.},

abstract={Plantations of multi-purpose tree species can play an important role in restoring productivity, ecosystem stability, and biological diversity to degraded tropical lands. The present study, conducted at a degraded coastal pasture site in Puerto Rico, compares 4.5-year-old Albizia lebbek (L.) Benth. plantation stands and adjacent control areas with respect to biomass production, understorey species diversity and nutrient storage patterns within vegetation, forest floor organic matter, and mineral soil compartments. Mineral soil (0-20 cm depth) organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) were both significantly higher in plantation plots (1.70% OC, 0.095% TN) than in control plots (1.44% OC, 0.074% TN), while available phosphate and exchageable cations were similar between treatments. Standing crop biomass of understorey vegetation, forest floor organic matter and fine (less than 2 mm) roots averaged 160 g m-2, 349 g m-2, and 362 g m-2 in the plantation plots and 420 g m-2, 311 g m-2, and 105 g m-2 in the control plots. Nitrogen concentrations within each of these biomass components were, however, consistently higher in the plantation plots. Plantation understorey species appear to be efficient 'scavengers' of biologically fixed nitrogen, and appear to help buffer the system against leaching losses. Species richness was considerably greater in plantation than control plots for grasses, vines, and forbs. Seedlings of several secondary forest species were abundant in the plantation understorey but absent in control plots, suggesting an important role for such plantations in accelerating natural regeneration of native forest species on certain sites. © 1992.},

abstract={A spatially explicit hydroecological landscape model of water, carbon and energy balances (Topog-IRM) is described. The landscape is envisaged as a catchment forested with a single stratum comprising Eucalyptus maculata trees. The model was used to imulate the direct effects of a 2× elevation in atmospheric carbon dioxide at two levels of nitrogen on catchment water yield, soil moisture status and tree growth. Experimental results used to parameterise the model are detailed. Key features of the model are (1) an ability to scale hydrological processes at the catchment scale in three dimensions, and (2) a means to integrate multiple factors/stresses on plant growth. The effects of CO2 on catchment hydrology (water yield or soil moisture content) and forest growth (expressed as leaf area index, LAI) were modelled for a 2.-year period, and contrasted with the effects of added nitrogen. Results were expressed as totals for the catchment or spatially distributed across the catchment. For the total catchment, water yield increased in the order:high CO2 with low N, high CO2 with high N, ambient CO2 with low N, ambient Co2 with high N. LAI increased from 3.3 to 5.7 in the order:ambient CO2 with low N, ambient CO2 with high N, high CO2 with low N, high Co2 with high N. These results agree with previous data. New findings are:(1) with elevated CO2 a new equilibrium in transpiration is established in which leaf area increases offset decreases in stomatal conductance; (2) the addition of nitrogen increases transpiration without any indication of a new equilibrium being reached during the simulated period; (3) the spatial distribution of soil moisture changes, presenting a new resource base for spatial changes to species composition and growth rates. The major hydroecological responses to elevated CO2 are seen as increased maximum upper canopy leaf area, increased litter inputs, especially at times of drought (hence changed fire regimes), changes in the composition of the understorey (hence litter composition, soil microfauna, and the spatial expression of biological diversity) and a slight increase in water yield. © 1992 CSIRO.

abstract={In the geologic past, natural climate changes have caused large-scale geographical shifts in species' ranges, changes in the species composition of biological communities, and species extinctions. If the widely predicted greenhouse effect occurs, natural ecosystems will respond in similar ways as in the past, but the effects will be more severe because of the extremely rapid rate of the projected change. Moreover, population reduction and habitat destruction due to human activities will prevent many species from colonizing new habitat when their old becomes unsuitable. The synergy between climate change and habitat destruction would threaten many more species than either factor alone. These effects would be pronounced in temperate and arctic forests, where temperature increases are projected to be relatively large. Localized species might face extinction, while widespread forest trees are likely to survive in some parts of their range. New northward habitat will become suitable even as die-offs of tree species occur to the south. However, it may be difficult for many species to take advantage of this new habitat because dispersal rates for tree species are very slow relative to the rate of warming, and therefore ranges of even many widespread species are likely to show a net decrease during the next century. Range retractions will be proximally caused by temperature and precipitation changes, increases in fires, changes in the ranges and severity of pests and pathogens, changes in competitive interactions, and additional effects of non-climatic stress such as acid rain and low-level ozone. Changes in species composition will have large effects on local and regional economies and biological diversity. © 1990.},

Thirty-five bird species were recorded with a total density of 29.9 individuals ha 1 of which 8 species, Goldcrest, Chaffinch, Spotted Flycatcher, Coal Tit, Crested Tit, Siskin, Treecreeper and Redstart, constituted 85% of numbers. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to ordinate vegetation at point count locations from which li groups of bird counts were analysed across the habitat gradients. Two axes, representing increasing openness of canopy (axis I) and decreasing shrubbiness (axis II), were identified. Total bird density declined significantly with openness of canopy and increased significantly with increasing (a) pine density, (b) maximum tree height, (c) frequency of dead wood on the ground and in the candpy. Crested Tit, Goldcrest, and Coal Tit showed species-habitat correlations. Crested Tit density for axis 1 was positively correlated with the frequency of dead wood in the canopy. Only Crested Tit showed a habitat association with vegetation variables from axis II: density declined with an increase in percentage cover of the 0.3-1.0 m shrub layer.

abstract={Of Australia's 1600 species of terrestrial vertebrates, nearly 300 are endangered, and 17 mammals, 3 birds, and 1 species of lizard have become extinct since European settlement in 1788. Extinction rates and the decline in the distribution and abundance of species has been greatest in the drier regions of the continent and where European settlement first occurred. Declines in the terrestrial vertebrate fauna have resulted from a combination of factors including habitat modification and fragmentation, over-exploitation, exotic diseases, pesticides, competition with introduced herbivores, and predation by foreign predators. As well as continued losses of mammal species, it is predicted that there will be an accelerating loss of avian species paralleling the losses in the mammal fauna which occurred in Australia's pastoral and agricultural areas from 1900 onwards. Declines in the abundance of reptiles and amphibians are expected to follow a similar pattern to birds and mammals. While the dedication of reserves which meet the minimum population size requirements of species and the control of feral animals are important in reducing the rate of loss of critical ecosystems and their associated fauna, conservation of Australia's terrestrial vertebrates depends on significant changes in land management practices. Clearing of native vegetation, prescription or hazard reduction burning, and grazing by domestic stock are among the practices which should cease or be better managed. -from Authors},

abstract={We examine the relationship between the number of bird species and environment within 500 000 ha of eucalypt forests in south-eastern New South Wales, Australia. Birds were surveyed at 39 sites within 31 eucalypt communities, which were, in turn, scored by altitude, temperature, rainfall, basal areas of trees and levels of the nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium in the eucalypt foliage. Ninety bird species were recorded. Numbers per site, averaged over the whole sample period, ranged between 20 and 38 over all surveys, 24 and 42 in 'summer' (October to March) when migrant species were present, and 13 and 38 in 'winter' (April to September). A forward stepwise Poisson regression model was used to fit bird species richness to the environmental variables. Over all surveys and in 'summer', foliar magnesium and tree basal area (including the basal area of dead trees) were significantly (positive) correlated with the number of bird species. In 'winter' the correlations were with altitude and temperature (both negative), presumably the result of emigration of species that avoid cold weather, and tree basal area (positive). The positive association of number of species over all surveys and in 'summer' with tree basal area, including dead trees, and foliar magnesium may index the level of forest maturity and productivity. Forest management directed solely to timber production reduces the basal area and the number of dead trees and may thereby reduce bird species richness permanently. A methodology is offered, based on the relationship between the physical environment and the more productive eucalypt communities, for determining forest areas containing the most species of birds. © 1989.},

abstract={The bird community of a forested 13 ha plot was studied for 3 years, during which the plot was burnt by wildfire and was severely drought‐affected. The combined effects of fire and drought were surprisingly limited. Similar numbers of species were recorded in each year and differences in species composition involved only rare visitors to the plot. Colour‐banding indicated population declines in at least six resident species. The greatest decline was that of the Brown Thornbill (Acanthiza pusilla), from 20 pairs to 10 pairs. In general, insectivorous birds were most abundant and widespread on the plot during the first year, before the fire. In contrast, nomadic birds feeding on flowers or fruits were most abundant in the second year, when there was a prolific flowering and fruiting of several important food plants. After the fire, at least ten bird species avoided the burnt ridges and became more concentrated in the unburnt gullies. Most were species associated with dense shrub thickets, the layer of vegetation most affected by the fire. It seems that gullies are major refuge areas in these forests and are the key to the resilience of the bird community to fire and drought. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Using the Lane Cove valley catchment as an example (typical of the North Shore of Sydney), burning was likely to have been more frequent on the shale ridges (at 1–5 year intervals) than on the sandstone slopes (7–15 year intervals). In this area, remaining bushland is predominantly on Hawkesbury sandstone and burning at intervals more, or less, frequent than that under which it evolved leads to reduction in species diversity. Objectives must be established for the management of urban bushland and, if maintenance of biological diversity is one such objective, necessary fire regimes must be determined for individual areas and applied as a biological management tool rather than the present blanket prescription for fire hazard reduction. © 1986, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

abstract={LOYN, R.H. 1985. Bird populations in successional forests of Mountain Ash Eucalyptus regnans in central Victoria. Emu 85: 213-230. Bird populations were estimated from 1977 to 1979 by mapping territories and by an “area search” method in stands of differing age (regenerating after wildfire or harvesting eucalypts) in the Victorian Central Highlands mainly near Toolangi. The aims were to assess effects of harvesting (followed by burning and artificial regeneration) and provide data on populations and ecology of birds inhabiting this distinctive forest type. Mountain Ash forests grow in high rainfall areas and the trees can reach heights of 100 m; they usually grow as even-aged stands and 79% of Mountain Ash forests in the Central Highlands has regenerated after severe fires in 1939. About 65 species of birds were found to be regular inhabitants of Mountain Ash forests and associated plant com­munities. All except the Pink Robin breed also in foothill gullies. Several species that are common in drier foothill forests, were absent from Mountain Ash forests. The commonest species were those that feed in the dense shrub layer or from damp ground below. Some insectivorous birds that were abundant in summer (e.g. Golden Whistler Pachycephala pectoralis, Grey Fantail Rhipidura fuliginosa) left Mountain Ash forests for the winter. Winter food sources were limited and the most important were blossoms of Mountain Correa Correa lawrenciana, invertebrates in damp leaf litter, and invertebrates or carbohydrate exudates from hanging bark of Mountain Ash or branches and trunks of Silver Wattle Acacia dealbata. Habitats and interactions between various bird species are described. Bird population densities were low in the first three years after harvesting but some species were confined to open stands of this age. Other forest birds returned rapidly as eucalypts and understorey species regenerated. Populations were as high in 39-year-old regrowth as in older stands though some species (mainly those that need tree hollows for nesting) were more common in older forest. Implications for management are discussed. © 1985, CSIRO. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Following fire, a number of transient plant species colonize the open ground, while the original vegetation regenerates from stumps, rhizomes or buried seeds. This results in an increase in species richness of the vegetation. The time necessary for the bird communities to reach their pre-fire species composition and population levels differs in Quercus suber and Q. ilex forests. This takes 3 yr in the former, but is much slower in the latter. Bird-species richness is higher in the burned maquis during the 2nd and 3rd years post-fire. The population densities of small mammal species, particularly that of Apodemus sylvaticus, can be higher in all burned areas during the 2nd and 3rd post-fire years, but population structures (age and sex ratios) are different. Changes in the physical structure of the above-ground vegetation following the fire is apparently the major factor influencing the bird community; the small mammal community is more influenced by modification of the litter and subsequent changes in food and shelter availability. -Authors},

abstract={The results from grid mapping of the breeding bird community on 6.25 ha units in the Lauterbacher Wald, Southern Bavaria, in 1980 and 1982 offer possibilities for using bird species as a bioindicator for local changing environments because of variation in their abundance and dispersal patterns. If all species were neglected, which show only small variations or increasing/decreasing abundances due to weather conditions in the survey area or due to changing environments in southern wintering areas, Treecreeper, Coal Tit and Song Thrush remain. They may be indicators for the enrichment of dead trees in the forest respectively for changing tree species composition in an ecological positive way. The influence of different check time during fieldwork by mapping one grid unit in different years must be considered when interpreting the results. Complementing current atlas work (i.e. with a 100 km2 grid) for estimating the population dynamics of rare species an additional census is proposed, which may give quantitative results for all species abundant or widely distributed. For these species until now only unimportant qualitative dispersal patterns can be evaluated. By a time sparing grid mapping every year (one or more areas of 1 km2 in each 100 km2 square of the atlas grid) using 6.25 ha units (10 min per unit), relative abundances or grid frequencies (6.25 ha grid) may be used for the evaluation of population indeces both for local survey areas and for countries. © 1984 Verlag der Deutschen Ornithologen-Gesellschaft.},

abstract={Small isolated forest patches (0.1-7ha) in E New South Wales and S Wisconsin were surveyed regularly for at least 1yr. Area was the best predictor of species richness in islands and control plots. Other habitat variables (except isolation) were relatively uniform among sites and did not contribute consistently to variation in numbers of species. Species common in forest islands also tended to be common in large nearby forests, but bird assemblages in forest islands were statistically different from those in forest control plots. Species assemblages in forest islands generally were more predictable over space and time than were local assemblages in larger forests. Although transients or regular visitors commonly were observed in forest islands, nonresident species occurred even more frequently in control plots. Habitat fragmentation alters the spatial and temporal dynamics of native forest bird communities. This, in turn, may favor some species and leave others at a disadvantage. Differences between species assemblages of forest islands and control plots were most pronounced in Wisconsin. Numbers of forest or forest edge species were much lower in Wisconsin forest islands than in corresponding control plots. Isolation of forest islands was associated negatively with species richness only in Wisconsin.-from Author},

The combined densities of 26 breeding species ranged from 3.9 in the least complex habitat to 8.6 territorial males/ha in the most complex. Chestnut-sided warbler Dendroica pensylvanica, mourning warbler Oporornis philadelphia, white-throated sparrow Zonotrichia albicollis, and song sparrow Melospiza melodia represented an average of 75% of the individuals on the 8 plots. Only the density of chestnut-sided warbler was positively correlated with the habitat gradient, while song sparrow was negatively correlated. Management for greater habitat complexity provides more opportunities for nesting and foraging and results in greater species richness and density of birds breeding in early successional vegetation. -from Authors},

abstract={The ground parrot Pezoporus wallicus has a coastal distribution in Victoria and has declined in range since European colonization. Its habitat consists of two major vegetation communities: coastal heathland and sedgeland. These are further divided into various sub‐communities. These habitats contained high densities of cyperaceous and restionaceous plants, the seeds of which form the bulk of the bird's diet. Seeds and small fruits of some dicotyledonous plants and grasses are also eaten. Seed production by sedges remains fairly constant over time in sedgelands but varies in heathland, depending on time since burning. This variation is reflected by parallel changes in ground parrot population density. Both long unburnt and very frequently burnt heathlands are unsuitable for ground parrots. The birds also require dense vegetation cover. Ground parrots appear to live in territorial breeding pairs with enforced natal dispersal. This is an adaptation to an environment where habitat is patchily distributed in space and variable in quality over time. Copyright © 1984, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={Olive woodpeckers were studied on the Nyika Plateau (Malawi-Zambia). Mean size of the home range of breeding pairs is 4-5 ha. Breeding activities occupy mostly the 2nd half of the dry season, with egg-laying from July-September. After fledging, families stay in the breeding patch or disperse locally. From one year to the next, a few pairs moved into a vacant neighbouring patch to breed. All nests are excavated in dead wood; most of the work is by the male. Incubation lasted 16 + or - 1 days at one nest, and the young left at the age of 26 days. Most of the incubation by day was done by the male. Feeding rates increase with the age of the brood and average 7 feedings/hr for a nestling 20 days old. Females feed 1.5 times more often than males, but the latter bring larger beakfuls. Families consist of 1-2 fledglings. In the first case, the juvenile follows its father and is only occasionally fed by the female. Families of 4 split into 2 units, each parent taking charge of one young. Young become independent c4 wk after leaving the nest but continue to accompany the adults for another month or two. Most if not all failures in this study were the result of parasitism by scaly-throated honeyguide Indicator variegatus, but breeding success was high.-from Author},

abstract={Bird populations in Pinus radiata plantations of different ages and in native eucalypt forests were studied in Gippsland, Victoria. Few species occurred in pine plantations, particularly the young stands (<o years old) and species composition changed so that those with certain characteristics were favoured. The commonest species in pine plantations generally were insectivorous, fed on the ground or in the understorey and built open nests in shrubs or trees; herbivorous species and those that fed in the canopy or on boles of eucalypts were uncommon or absent from pine plantations. The vertical distribution and density of foliage in the lower levels of the forests influenced bird species diversity and composition. The population in pine plantations becomes more similar to that in eucalypt forest as the plantation ages. Subdivision of the areas studied showed that most birds in dense middle-aged pine plantations were restricted to the edges of compartments. In plantations, areas of native forest, firebreaks, dams or clearings added to diversity of the habitat, and provided for more individuals and species of birds. Ecotonal areas between pine and eucalypt forest were especially important, and supported significantly more individuals than did the adjacent pines. Birds will probably be less severely affected by conversion of eucalypt forests to pine plantations if plantations are established as a mosaic of different-aged stands, with interconnecting areas of eucalypt forest retained throughout. © CSIRO 1982.},
