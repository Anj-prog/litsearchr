Barlow, Jos; Mestre, Luiz A.M.; Gardner, Toby A.; Peres, Carlos A.				Biological Conservation	136	2		212-231	April 2007	2007				English	4	106	Secondary forests and exotic tree plantations are rapidly expanding across tropical landscapes, yet we currently have a very poor understanding of the value of these human-dominated forest landscapes for biodiversity conservation. Mist netting, point counts and transect walks were used to compare the bird communities of these habitats and neighboring primary forest in north-east Brazilian Amazonia. The extensive spatial scale of plantations and second-growth in our study area enabled us to implement a robust replicated design, with survey plots approximately two to three orders of magnitude larger than most previous studies of land-use change in the tropics, thus minimising the influence of the surrounding landscape. Species richness was highest in primary forest and lowest in Eucalyptus plantations, and community turnover between habitats was very high whether based upon matrices of relative abundance or species presence-absence data, and for both point count and mist net data. Monthly line-transect censuses conducted over an annual cycle showed an increase in the detection of canopy frugivores and seed predators during the peak of flower and fruit availability in primary forest, but failed to suggest that second-growth or Eucalyptus stands provide suitable foraging habitat at any time of the year. The conservation value of both secondary forest and plantations was low compared to conclusions from previous studies. Our results indicate that while large-scale reforestation of degraded land can increase regional levels of diversity, it is unlikely to conserve most primary forest species, such as understorey insectivores and canopy frugivores.

Yui, Masatoshi				Japanese Journal of Ornithology	56	1		1-8	April 2007	2007				Japanese	0	2	In the Kitakami Plateau of Iwate Prefecture, there is a population of about 30 pairs of Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos, however breeding success has been declining rapidly, with reduction in suitable feeding grounds implicated as a primary cause. Breeding success must be 0.282 or more to maintain the population. The area of feeding grounds required within home ranges (within a radius of 6.4 km) to achieve that breeding rate was calculated using a multiple regression equation. The area was calculated to be 560 ha for young (less than 10 years old) plantations alone, 1,020 ha for pastures/meadows and abandoned areas up to 5 years after cutting alone, and 770 ha for broad-leaved deciduous forests 101 or more years of age alone. Afforestation, at a 76-year interval, will be sufficient to supply the necessary young artificial forests for the eagles' home ranges. Line thinning was also considered effective in ensuring a sufficient supply of food resources and feeding grounds for A. chrysaetos. Furthermore, it is suggested that increases in biological diversity will result from cutting and thinning operations in plantations.

Smith, D. Max; Kelly, Jeffrey F.; Finch, Deborah M.				Journal of Wildlife Management	71	2		411-421	April 2007	2007				English	3	14	Riparian forest communities in the southwestern United States were historically structured by a disturbance regime of annual flooding. In recent decades, however, frequency of flooding has decreased and frequency of wildfires has increased. Riparian forests provide important breeding habitat for a large variety of bird species, and the effects of this altered disturbance regime on birds and their breeding habitat is largely unknown. To evaluate effects of high-intensity spring and summer wildfire on the quality of breeding bird habitat in the Middle Rio Grande valley, we measured vegetation structure and composition, avian nest use, and nest success at 4 unburned plots and 4 wildfire plots over a 3-year period. We measured avian nest use and success at nest boxes located in unburned riparian forest plots and plots recently burned by wildfire. Recent wildfire plots (7 yr after fire) had a much different vegetation structure than unburned plots; an older (>7 yr after fire) wildfire plot more closely resembled its paired unburned plot than did recently burned plots. Ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens) and Bewick's wrens (Thryomanes bewickii; hereafter, flycatchers and wrens, respectively) used nest boxes in most of the plots. A model selection procedure applied to logistic regressions showed that frequency of nest box use by flycatchers was positively associated with wildfire, although flycatchers used boxes in unburned plots as well. Wrens showed a preferential use of nest boxes that were in unburned sites and in close proximity to vegetative cover. Growth rates, feeding rates, and fledging mass of flycatchers were similar in wildfire and unburned plots. Growth rates for wrens were slower in wildfire plots, while feeding rates and fledging mass were similar. Nest predation varied between years, was higher for flycatchers than for wrens, and was not directly influenced by wildfire. Model selection showed that predation increased with grass cover, an indicator of forest openness, and decreased with distance to habitat edge. Recovery of dense vegetation appears important in maintaining populations of Bewick's wrens, whereas ash-throated flycatchers were less sensitive to vegetative structure and composition of postfire succession. Postfire management that maintains nest sites in large forest strips would enhance nesting density and success of these cavity-nesting birds in riparian zones.	Smith, D.

Mason, Jamie; Moorman, Christopher; Hess, George; Sinclair, Kristen				Landscape and Urban Planning	80	1-2		153-164	March 28 2007	2007				English	3	70	Appropriately designed, greenways may provide habitat for neotropical migrants, insectivores, and forest-interior specialist birds that decrease in diversity and abundance as a result of suburban development. We investigated the effects of width of the forested corridor containing a greenway, adjacent land use and cover, and the composition and vegetation structure within the greenway on breeding bird abundance and community composition in suburban greenways in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. Using 50 m fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed breeding bird communities for 2 years at 34 study sites, located at the center of 300-m-long greenway segments. Percent coverage of managed area within the greenway, such as trail and other mowed or maintained surfaces, was a predictor for all development-sensitive bird groupings. Abundance and richness of development-sensitive species were lowest in greenway segments containing more managed area. Richness and abundance of development-sensitive species also decreased as percent cover of pavement and bare earth adjacent to greenways increased. Urban adaptors and edge-dwelling birds, such as Mourning Dove, House Wren, House Finch, and European Starling, were most common in greenways less than 100 m wide. Conversely, forest-interior species were not recorded in greenways narrower than 50 m. Some forest-interior species, such as Acadian Flycatcher, Hairy Woodpecker, and Wood Thrush, were recorded primarily in greenways wider than 100 m. Others, including ground nesters such as Black-and-white Warbler, Louisiana Waterthrush, and Ovenbird, were recorded only in greenways wider than 300 m. Landscape and urban planners can facilitate conservation of development-sensitive birds in greenways by minimizing the width of the trail and associated mowed and landscaped surfaces adjacent to the trail, locating trails near the edge of greenway forest corridors, and giving priority to the protection of greenway corridors at least 100 m wide with low levels of impervious surface (pavement, buildings) and bare earth in the adjacent landscape.

Vepsalainen, Ville; Pakkala, Timo; Piha, Markus; Tiainen, Juha				Annales Zoologici Fennici	44	1		8-19	March 15 2007	2007				English	0	11	We studied the relationships between the occupancy of territory sites and environmental and behaviour-related factors in a declining farmland bird, the ortolan bunting Emberiza hortulana, in southern Finland in 1984-2003. We investigated the dependence of different factors on population density. The surrounding breeding group positively affected the occupation frequency of territory sites before and after the population crash. Bush- or tree-covered ditches and springtime non-vegetated fields also had positive effect on territory site occupancy. We suggest that large breeding groups, and obvious conspecific attraction, give indications of favourable breeding locations. Habitat deterioration may have pronounced consequences for local populations, in which the breeding group tends to be the unit of population dynamics. The results suggest that for conservation of the ortolan bunting, the maintenance and improvement of structurally and biologically diverse habitats is vital, since tendency to breed in groups apparently makes the species more sensitive to habitat changes than many other farmland species.

Maron, Martine; Kennedy, Simon				Forest Ecology and Management	240	1-3		24-31	March 15 2007	2007				English	1	26	Forestry practices such as fuel-reduction burning and maintenance of road networks can negatively impact avian assemblages, both directly by changing habitat structure and indirectly by creating conditions favorable for predators or competitors. The Brigalow Belt forests include some of the largest contiguous areas of native forest in the temperate and sub-humid zones of eastern Australia. Over I million ha of these forests are proposed to be converted from forestry to conservation tenure, yet the impacts on the avifauna of current and potential future forest management practices are not known. We investigated the influence of road edges and habitat type and structure on the avifauna of a 356 000 ha forest. Survey sites were either 50 m or >300 m from a road, and in either cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla forest, spotted gum Corymbia citriodora forest with a regenerating cypress pine/buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii understorey or spotted gum forest with an open understorey due to fuel-reduction burning. The avifauma differed significantly among vegetation types but not with proximity to a road, with the greatest differences between cypress pine and both types of spotted gum forest. The noisy miner Manorina melanocephala, an aggressive avian competitor, appears to be the factor mediating these assemblage-level differences. Noisy miners were rare in cypress pine forest but were three times more numerous than any other species in spotted gum forest. Spotted gum forest with a regenerating understorey had fewer noisy miners. Although total bird abundance was highest in open spotted gum forest, the species richness and abundance of passerines smaller than noisy miners was significantly lower in this forest type. Abundance of small passerines was eight times higher in sites where 3 noisy miners were recorded. Only one species, the eastern yellow robin, was influenced by proximity to a road edge. Cypress pine forest is potentially an important refuge for smaller birds. The results suggest that burning regimes that reduce regeneration of the cypress pine and buloke subcanopy in spotted gum forest potentially are exacerbating the problem of noisy miner domination of the avifauna.

Dhondt, Andre A.; Wrege, Peter H.; Cerretani, Jacqueline; Sydenstricker, Keila V.				Bird Study	54	1		12-22	March 2007	2007				English	0	18	Capsule Species richness and density increase rapidly with coppice age, and are similar to estimates from early successional habitats. Aim To investigate avian species richness, density and breeding success in short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) planted as potential source of renewable bioenergy. Methods We carried out regular bird censuses and systematic nest searches in dense plantations of fast-growing willow and poplar clones coppiced at three- to five-year intervals in New York, USA. Results Thirty-nine species regularly used SRWC plantations; of these at least 21 were confirmed breeding on study plots. A total of 63% of the variation in bird species richness was explained by the number of years since coppicing and plot area together. Both the richness and overall density of avian species in SRWC plots was similar to estimates obtained from the Breeding Bird Census for more typical shrublands and successional habitats (e.g. abandoned fields, second-growth forest, regenerating clearcuts). Nesting success for the most common species was within the range of values from published studies in alternative nesting habitats, although often at the lower end of the range. Brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds Molothrus ater, often an important factor in nesting success, was extremely low on the study plots. Conclusion If planted on a fairly large scale with staggered coppicing schedules, SRWC plantations would help to maintain breeding populations of birds that range from open-habitat species to woodland species. There is no evidence that conversion of substantial land area to SRWC would result in an 'ecological trap' for species common in the farmland-small woodland landscapes of the northeastern USA.

British Columbia Journal of Ecosystems and Management	8	1		75-91	Spring 2007	2007	http://www.forrex.org/jem/default.asp			English	0	1	Breeding birds were surveyed 1 year pre-harvest (1995) and 4 years post-harvest (1996-2001) to measure the response to partial cutting in old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) forests on the Chilcotin Plateau of British Columbia. The irregular group shelterwood and group selection systems recommended to manage northern caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou Gmelin) habitat did not negatively affect the breeding bird community. In some years within the post-harvest period, dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis L.), red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra L.), yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata L.), and gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis L.) showed significant ([alpha] = 0.05) increases in use of the partial-cutting treatments compared with the no-harvest treatment. No species decreased significantly in any of the partial-cutting treatments. The increased observations of mostly common species resulted in significantly ([alpha] = 0.05) higher species richness, and increased frequency of observations for the bird community in some years in the partial cuts. Partial cutting of caribou habitat will maintain bird communities typical of mature to older lodgepole pine forests.	Waterhouse, Michaela J.; Silvicultural Systems Researcher, B.C.

Kotliar, Natasha B.; Kennedy, Patricia L.; Ferree, Kimberly				Ecological Applications	17	2		491-507	March 2007	2007				English	0	31	The effects of burn severity on avian communities are poorly understood, yet this information is crucial to. re management programs. To quantify avian response patterns along a burn severity gradient, we sampled 49 random plots ( 2001 - 2002) at the 17351- ha Cerro Grande Fire ( 2000) in New Mexico, USA. Additionally, pre-. re avian surveys ( 1986 1988, 1990) created a unique opportunity to quantify avifaunal changes in 13 pre-. re transects ( resampled in 2002) and to compare two designs for analyzing the effects of unplanned disturbances: after- only analysis and before - after comparisons. Distance analysis was used to calculate densities. We analyzed after- only densities for 21 species using gradient analysis, which detected a broad range of responses to increasing burn severity: (I) large significant declines, (II) weak, but signi. cant declines, (III) no signi. cant density changes, (IV) peak densities in low- or moderate- severity patches, (V) weak, but signi. cant increases, and (VI) large signi. cant increases. Overall, 71% of the species included in the after- only gradient analysis exhibited either positive or neutral density responses to. re effects across all or portions of the severity gradient ( responses III - VI). We used pre/ post pairs analysis to quantify density changes for 15 species using before - after comparisons; spatiotemporal variation in densities was large and confounded. re effects for most species. Only four species demonstrated signi. cant effects of burn severity, and their densities were all higher in burned compared to unburned forests. Pre- and post-. re community similarity was high except in high- severity areas. Species richness was similar pre- and post-. re across all burn severities. Thus, ecosystem restoration programs based on the assumption that recent severe. res in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have overriding negative ecological effects are not supported by our study of post-. re avian communities. This study illustrates the importance of quantifying burn severity and controlling confounding sources of spatiotemporal variation in studies of. re effects. After- only gradient analysis can be an efficient tool for quantifying. re effects. This analysis can also augment historical data sets that have small samples sizes coupled with high non- process variation, which limits the power of before - after comparisons.

Smith, Paul G.R.				Environmental Management	39	3		338-352	March 2007	2007				English	3	33	Characteristics of urban natural areas and surrounding landscapes were identified that best explain winter bird use for 28 urban natural areas in southern Ontario, Canada. The research confirms for winter birds the importance of area (size) and natural vegetation, rather than managed, horticultural parkland, within urban natural areas as well as percent urban land use and natural habitat in surrounding landscapes. Alien bird density and percent ground feeding species increased with percent surrounding urban land use. Higher percent forest cover was associated with higher percentages of forest, bark feeding, small (20 g) and insectivorous species. Natural area size (ha) was related to higher species richness, lower evenness and higher percentages of insectivorous, forest interior, area-sensitive, upper canopy, bark feeding, and non-resident species. Higher number of habitat types within natural areas and percent natural habitat in surrounding landscapes were also associated with higher species richness. Common, resident bird species dominated small areas (6.5 ha), while less common non-residents increased with area, indicative of a nested distribution. Areas at least 6.5 ha and more generally >20 ha start to support some area-sensitive species. Areas similar to rural forests had >25% insectivores, >25% forest interior species, >25% small species, and 5% alien species. Indicator species separated urban natural areas from rural habitats and ordination placed urban natural areas along a gradient between urban development and undisturbed, rural forests. More attention is needed on issues of winter bird conservation in urban landscapes.

The numbers of forest-dependent bird species breeding in alpine, sub-alpine, pan-mixed, cool-temperate, warm-temperate, and sub-tropical forests in Japan are 14, 86, 100, 110, 95 and 57, respectively. Seventy-six out of 310 forest-dependent "pecies and subspecies"are red-listed (listed in the Red Data Book of Japan), including 58 threatened ones. My comprehensive estimate of number of forest-dependent bird species in Japan is greater than those provided earlier and it will be useful in discussions with collaborating countries, a principal aim of the Montreal Process. The number of forest-dependent bird species recorded in an area, however, cannot be used as a simple indicator for sustainable management, because species numbers may increase with disturbance by the invasion of species preferring such a disturbed habitat, and the regional species pool may be diminished by local extinction of some vulnerable species. Therefore, designatingspecified indicator species sensitive to disturbance, as well as red-listed species, is necessary to evaluate sustainabilityof forest management practices.

Covert-Bratland, Kristin A.; Theimer, Tad C.; Block, William M.

We monitored the use and characteristics of 12 winter roosts used by nine radio-marked Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona that had experienced wildfire in 1996 and 2000. Roost trees were larger in diameter than 95% of non-roost trees and on average 2.5 times larger within burned areas of similar severity. Roost trees were within patches less dense than 95% of measured patches across study sites, which were on average 1.5 times as dense. Two-thirds of roost trees were created by fire and were smaller than those created by other means. Six birds each used one roost and three males each used two roosts. Two-thirds of the roosts were outside or on the edge of estimated home ranges. Maximum straight-line distances traveled, from roost to farthest point of home range, were >1 km for 8 of 9 birds. Woodpeckers have a significant role in providing cavities for secondary cavity nesters. Thus, understanding habitat requirements for winter roosts could provide managers with essential tools to maintain or enhance populations of this species.

Saab, Victoria A.; Russell, Robin E.; Dudley, Jonathan G.				Condor	109	1		97-108	February 2007	2007				English	2	56	We monitored the nest densities and nest survival of seven cavity-nesting bird species, including four open-space foragers (American Kestrel (Falco sparperius), Lewis's Woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis), Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana), and Mountain Bluebird (S. currucoides)) and three wood-foragers (Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides villosus), Black-backed Woodpecker (P. arcticus), and Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus)), after two wildfires (one partially salvage-logged and one unlogged) in western Idaho from 1994-2004. We estimated the relationship between nest density and time since fire, tested for statistical differences in nest densities and nest survival in the partially salvage-logged vs. unlogged wildfires, and tested for differences in nest survival between early (1-4 years after fire) and late (5-12 years after fire) postfire periods. Nest densities of open-space foragers and Northern Flickers generally increased with time since fire, whereas nest densities of Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers peaked 4-5 years postfire. Nest densities of wood-foraging species and Mountain Bluebirds were significantly higher in the unlogged burn, whereas Lewis's Woodpeckers had significantly higher nest densities in the partially logged burn. Kestrels tended to favor the partially logged burn, while Western Bluebird nest densities were nearly equal in both burned areas. For most species, postfire period and treatment (partially logged vs. unlogged) had little influence on nest survival. However, Hairy Woodpecker nest survival was significantly lower in the partially logged burn versus the unlogged wildfire in the early postfire period, and Lewis's Woodpecker nest survival was significantly reduced in the later postfire period versus the early postfire period in the partially logged burn. Importantly, the salvage logging was designed to retain more than half of the snags over 23 cm in diameter, which provided suitable nesting habitat for open-space foragers during the decade following fire.

Verhulst, Jort; Kleijn, David; Berendse, Frank				Journal of Applied Ecology	44	1		70-80	February 2007	2007				English	1	45	1. In the Netherlands, agri-environment schemes are an important tool for halting the ongoing decline of meadow birds and, in particular, waders breeding on wet meadows. The effectiveness of the main scheme, postponed mowing, is heavily debated because it does not result in higher breeding densities. Recently, agri-environmental collectives have become involved in the co-ordination of scheme applications and additional measures have been introduced. One of them is per-clutch payment: farmers are paid per wader clutch without being restricted in their farming practices.2. We evaluated the effectiveness of the combination of the two measures, postponed mowing and per-clutch payment, by determining the number of birds and territories on 12.5-ha plots where both measures (on average 1.6 ha postponed mowing and 10.9 ha per-clutch payment) were being implemented. Conventionally managed grasslands served as controls. Additionally, on a field with postponed mowing and a paired control field, we measured a number of environmental factors that might influence wader distribution.3. On plots operating a combination of postponed mowing and per-clutch payment, more territories of all bird species were found and more redshanks Tringa totanus were observed. The same pattern occurred on fields with per-clutch payment alone. On fields with postponed mowing alone, we found more territories of the most abundant wader species but on conventional fields we observed more lapwings Vanellus vanellus.4. The positive effects of postponed mowing on wader territories were probably caused by small differences in soil moisture and groundwater level between the two field types, as inclusion of these factors in a general linear model rendered all scheme effects insignificant.5. Postponed mowing affected the form and amount of fertilizer applied to the fields as well as available nitrogen, but none of the other environmental factors that were measured. Additional analyses identified groundwater depth, penetration resistance and prey density (earthworms, Lumbricidae, and leatherjackets, Tipulidae larvae) as the main factors determining wader density.6. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that conservation measures consisting of postponed mowing and per-clutch payment implemented by agri-environment collectives do not support a higher abundance of waders but do support marginally higher breeding densities of waders compared to conventional farms. These results are probably due to differences in soil moisture and groundwater depth. The effectiveness of agri-environment schemes directed towards conservation of waders might be enhanced by including raised groundwater levels into scheme prescriptions.

In recent years the limestone region called Kras was forested with Austrian Pine Pinus nigra and became more and more overgrown by bushes and trees due to depopulation and land abandonment, which has made it more vulnerable to fire. The latter patterns in particular are occurring throughout the whole sub-Mediterranean area and are affecting bird diversity drastically. Bird mortality during fires is low. For the first few years after a fire the richness and abundance of bird species decrease, and the species composition turnover rate is very high, from open habitat species to scrubland species. However, birds will colonise the burned area only when there is a neighbouring source population. In addition, larger burned areas are colonised more quickly than smaller ones. It is assumed that many birds will emigrate, while a number of species will adapt their territory size, nesting and foraging behaviour to the changed habitat. The severity of the habitat alteration and the change in food availability affect bird population dynamics. Bird species composition changes in parallel with vegetation succession. The effects of different aspects of fire, such as the size of the burned area, fire intensity, fire frequency and burning season, are reviewed. There are still many gaps in our knowledge of bird responses to fire, such as bird emigration after fires. However the impact of fire on birds is apparently not always detrimental and can even have a positive effect on populations. We therefore emphasize the importance of the continuation of research into the possibilities of fire as a management tool.	de Groot, Maarten; Redelongijeva 26a, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia, Slovenia.	m.degroot@rocketmail.com					Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Reproductive Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Behavioral Sciences	0351-2851		Conservation; Conservation measures; Nutrition; Feeding behaviour; Reproduction; Evolution; Behaviour; Ecology; Habitat utilization; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe	Aves [Habitat management / Burnt areas / Community structural changes & successions significance] [Foraging /  / Adaptation in relation to woodland fires; conservational significance] [Reproduction / Breeding strategy / ] [Evolutionary adaptation /  / Territorial; nesting & foraging behaviour; effect of woodland fires] [Territoriality / Territory size / ] [Community structure /  / Changes; habitat succession & colonization relationships; conservational aspects] [Population dynamics /  / potential use in conservation] [Habitat colonization /  / Community structure relationships; potential conservation use] [Succession in habitats /  / ] [Fire /  / Community structural changes & successions relationships; potential conservational significance] [Slovenia / Kras / ].

Nikolov, Stoyan Ch.				Acrocephalus (Ljubljana)	28	134		95-104	2007	2007				English	0	1	Habitat selection by birds in mature (60-100 years old) and over-mature (>120 years old) Macedonian Pine Pinus peuce forests was studied over 3 years (2004-2006) in Pirin National Park (SW Bulgaria). Overall, 185 study plots were randomly located and at each study plot habitat characteristics were described within a radius of 25 m. Birds were counted twice per year (June-July) within a radius of 50 m using the distance-sampling point-count technique. There was almost no difference in bird diversity between the studied forest age classes. Five species (Wren Troglodytes troglodytes, Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita, Coal Tit Parus ater, Nuthatch Sitta europaea and Treecreeper Certhia familiaris) showed preferences to over-mature Macedonian Pine forests and they had higher breeding densities in over-mature than in mature forests. Only one species (Mistle Thrush Turdus viscivorus) was found to prefer mature forests. The important criteria in habitat selection of these 6 species were analyzed, using a forward stepwise Multiple Regression Analysis. From the species that preferred over-mature forest, 2 species were trunk and bark-feeders and 4 species were hollow nesters. The paper stresses the importance of the amount of dead wood and decaying trees for forest bird communities and suggests that removal of dead wood from old forests, especially those in protected areas, should be minimized.

Species richness, abundance, and diversity of farmland bird communities, as well as abundance of the most frequently observed species were positively related to the number of residual non-cropped elements within farmland, the local mixture of annual crop and grass fields, and the variety of field types. The positive association of the species richness and abundance of the farmland bird community with richness in residual habitats and crops was most prominent in open landscapes. The results suggest that, by simplifying farmland structure and making it more homogenous, EU agricultural policies will have a detrimental effect on farmland bird populations in Eastern Europe. Ways of better targeting of the agri-environment schemes are suggested.	Herzon, Irina; Department of Applied Biology, P.O.

This richness can be explained by the architectural complexity of the studied forest resulting from the specific dynamics of riverside habitats: diversity of woody plant species, high vertical stratification, horizontal heterogeneity, abundance of large vines and vigour of plant growth are the most striking features of this habitat. Bird populations are similar to that of ordinary European Oak forest with three differences: a very high breeding density (50% higher), an abundance of shrubby habitats species in the heart of the forest, and the presence of species whose ecological optimum in Eastern France is cool montane habitat (Black Woodpecker, Dryocopus; martius, Firecrest Regulus atricapillus, Common Tree-creeper Certhia familiaris, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca).

Finally, a critical analysis of absolute population census tools is provided, highlighting weaknesses and suggesting possible alleys of improvement.

Media Luna spring is the biggest and most spatially complex system in the region, with the highest biodiversity levels and tourist use. Areas with the highest bird species richness and abundances showed highest structural heterogeneity and least direct human impact. No differences in species richness of fish were observed between sectors and the most abundant species were found in the sectors least perturbed by human activity. Factors that explained the bird distribution were the species' tolerance to the effects of direct tourism (noise and direct presence of people) and habitat quality, mainly riparian vegetation. Aquatic vegetation condition was very important for fish. Six bird species and two fish species were relevant as indicators of the habitat quality related to human impact. Anthropic disturbance such as tree plantation favoured some bird species, whereas aquatic vegetation removal was favourable for some fish species, such as the endemic Cichlasoma bartoni, however, both types of disturbance were unfavourable for other species; riparian vegetation removal was negative for both groups. Controlled tourism promotes good conditions for C. bartoni establishment. Efficient conservation measures such as limiting touristic distribution are necessary for all species, especially for the fish community, in order to conserve biodiversity in general.

Briggs, S.V.; Seddon, J.A.; Doyle, S.J.				Australian Journal of Zoology	55	1		29-40	2007	2007				English	0	12	The overall aim of this study was to investigate structures of bird communities in remnants of fragmented box/cypress pine woodlands in central New South Wales, Australia, to guide habitat rehabilitation. The aims of the study were to: (1) determine how bird densities and species richness varied with remnant category; (2) determine how ranked densities of bird species varied by feeding group with remnant category; and (3) provide information on structures of bird communities in box/cypress pine woodlands to guide restoration. Structures of bird communities varied with remnant category. Large remnants had the most species whereas medium-sized and small remnants in low condition had the fewest. Bird densities increased with decreasing remnant area although densities did not differ significantly between remnant categories. Ranked bird densities varied between remnant categories, with relatively even distributions in large remnants in high condition, and uneven distributions in small remnants in low condition. Densities of small insectivores were much lower in small, low-condition remnants than in large, high-condition remnants. Densities of generalists such as noisy miner and galah showed the reverse pattern.

Amphibian and bird species diversity, abundance and small scale distributions were investigated along a semi-natural stretch of the Lech river in 1989/90, 1998, and again in 2003 and 2006. The main study site, a 1.5 km2 and 3.5 km long river stretch, comprises a mosaic of dynamic floodplains with vast pioneer gravel sites, riparian-forest and regulated stretches with restricted river dynamics. A river restoration program (i.e. removal of structures stabilizing the banks) took place at the study site between 2003 and 2006 in the course of an EU LIFE-project. Three amphibian species (Rana temporaria, Bufo bufo and Triturus alpestris) form the core community of the investigated flood plains. These species showed high year to year fluctuations in populations sizes, and in the number and locations of spawning sites used. Although population sizes and spawning site densities overall were higher along dynamic river stretches and although river manipulation measures between 1989 and 2006 had some influences, the river dynamic itself is not regarded to be the key factor explaining differences in small scale amphibian densities and population fluctuations. The present data indicate that the width of extensively used habitats along the river (even when outside of the reach of normal peak floods) and the connectivity to the valley edges and lower slope forests may be more important factors. Overall 73 bird species (48 breeding-species) were recorded at the study site. Bird-species turnover rates were moderate from 1989 to 2006. Whereas a few forest-species like the Tree-Pipit and the Cuckoo vanished (due to over-regional populations decreases), some species of waterfowl (Little Grebe, Mute Swan, Coot) newly established themselves at a developing, non- dynamic backwater. Population levels of riparian forest species as well as of species bound to river and gravel banks showed pronounced fluctuations. On a short time-scale, decreases in species densities were dominating from 1998 to 2006, in part as a consequence of habitat loss (forest) and of habitat transformation following the restoration program. However, on the long run, threatened habitat specialists like the Common Sandpiper and the Little Ringed Plover, which showed high flexibility of habitat use along the investigated river stretch over the years, are expected to benefit from the increase of primary flood plain habitat.

Ganzhorn, Joerg U.; Goodman, Steven M.; Vincelette, Manon	Biodiversity, ecology and conservation of littoral ecosystems in southeastern Madagascar, Tolagnaro (Fort Dauphin). [SI/MAB Series 11.]				187-207	2007	2007				English	0	1	The littoral forests of southeastern Madagascar are considered severely threatened by habitat fragmentation and degradation. Herein, the bird communities inhabiting 31 littoral forest fragments and their surrounding areas are described. Processes associated with habitat fragmentation (e.g. patch reduction and isolation) and degradation (e.g. changes in forest structure) are related to bird species abundance and help to explain bird species distribution across the littoral forest system. In total, using a standardized sampling system, 77 bird species were found inhabiting 31 littoral forest fragments. Of these, 61 species were endemic to the island or the western Indian Ocean sub-region, which consisting of Madagascar, the Comoros, and the Mascarenes. In comparison, the matrix habitats surrounding the littoral forests were depauperate of species, with the Erica spp. heathland containing 24 species, and the introduced Eucalyptus and Melaleuca forest patches containing 22 and 23 species, respectively. The geographic location of littoral forest patches was important in determining which bird species occurred within them, with the northern patches having similar bird communities to nearby humid forest, while the most southern patch had a bird community that resembled that of nearby spiny forest habitats. At the patch level, 31 species were found to be edge-sensitive, and nine species were affected by changes in vegetation structure at core or edge point counts. At the landscape level, 20 species were affected by patch size, and four species were affected by patch shape. No species appeared to be affected by any measure of patch isolation. If bird conservation is to become a priority within the littoral forests of southeastern Madagascar, these results indicate that large (> 200 ha) blocks of littoral forest may need to be awarded protected status, and exploitation of forest resources that results in changes in vegetation structure should be minimized, especially in smaller littoral forest fragments.

Kujawa, Krzysztof; Kujawa, Anna				Biota (Race)	8	1-2		35-42	2007	2007				English	0	0	This study aimed to determine the relationship between land-use and species richness and population density of birds on a fenland 50 km east of Berlin. Bird density was determined by mapping in the area of 52 ha divided into four plots with differentiated intensity of mowing and, as a result, with different structure of vegetation cover. The total density of breeding birds was determined to be 1.7 - 6.6 pairs/ha and species number from 5 to 31. The lowest density was recorded on plot B, mowed every three to four years, and highest on plot D, which had not been mowed for the last several years. The most intensively mowed plot (two times per year) was characterized by the highest density (two pairs/ha) and number of species (four) typical of grasslands. The density and species number of grassland birds was positively correlated with the intensity of mowing. On plots C and D (not mowed during the last several years, and partially covered by trees and shrubs) the density of grassland birds was very low and accounted for only several per cent of the whole community. Grassland plant species diversity did not reflect grassland bird diversity. From our observations, we conclude that conservation measures should be carefully designed to fit local demands.

Ma, Zhijun; Gan, Xiaojing; Choi, Chiyeung; Jing, Kai; Tang, Shimin; Li, Bo; Chen, Jiakuan				Ecological Research	22	1		115-124	January 2007	2007				English	3	26	We compared wintering bird communities and their habitats among three shoals at Jiuduansha, a newly-formed wetland in the Yangtze River estuary. The highest species richness and diversity were recorded in Shangsha, which is the highest shoal, and the highest abundance and lowest species diversity were recorded in Xiasha, which is the lowest shoal. Shangsha had the largest abundance of perching birds whereas Xiasha was the most abundant in waterbirds. Bird assemblages showed different associations with the different habitat types-perching birds were favored by reed (Phragmites australis) communities, shallow water foragers and dabbling ducks preferred sea-bulrush (Scirpus mariqueter) communities, and moist-soil foragers and gulls showed a preference for bare intertidal zones. All bird assemblages, however, avoided the smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) communities, which are dominated by an alien invasive plant. The composition of avian communities was related to habitat types at the three shoals. Our results suggest that the newly-formed tidelands can provide suitable habitats for waterbirds and that the lower tidelands can attract more waterfowl than the higher tidelands. Because the shoal with low species diversity could have exclusive bird species, conservation efforts should not concentrate only on the area with high species diversity. The estuarine wetlands should be considered as a whole when conservation strategies are designed. The alien invasive plant should, moreover, be effectively controlled, to provide suitable habitats for birds.

Burbidge, Allan H.; Rolfe, Jim; McNee, Shapelle; Newbey, Brenda; Williams, Matt				Emu	107	2		79-88	2007	2007				English	0	6	Measures of abundance and population trends are necessary for informed management of rare species, but obtaining reliable estimates of sparsely occurring species is an ongoing challenge in conservation biology. It is even more difficult when the species of interest is also cryptic. We censused a population of one such species, the Western Ground Parrot ( Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), over several years to develop a monitoring protocol to assist in future management, extend understanding of its response to fire, and provide a model that could be used with other cryptic bird species. Abundance of Western Ground Parrots, monitored by means of calling frequencies, varied from year to year at a study site in Fitzgerald River National Park, south- western Australia. Frequency of calling increased significantly from 1996 to 2000. During this time, frequency of calling peaked in 1998 in part of the study site that had been unburnt for more than 40 years, and remained high in 2000. Frequency of calling was similar in a more recently burnt part of the study area except in May 1998, when frequency was lower following a fire that burnt part of this area five months previously. Frequency of calling dropped significantly in both the long unburnt and recently burnt areas between 2000 and 2004; exact reasons for this are unknown. Western Ground Parrots can use recently burnt vegetation where it is immediately adjacent to an established population, but do not need fire to create habitat, at least in the timescale of 40 years. The current monitoring protocol, where eight listening posts are counted approximately three times each, is capable of detecting an annual change in frequency of calling of [approximately]13%. The number of listening posts would need to be increased to 14 in order to detect an annual change of 10%, and would need to be increased to 40 in order to detect an annual change of 5%.

Grigera, Dora; Pavic, Carolina				Hornero	22	1		29-37	Jan-Aug 2007	2007				Spanish	0	0	Bird censuses were carried out in an undisturbed site and in a site affected by fire in an area of the Arroyo Challhuaco basin, Nahuel Huapi National Park, Argentina. The density and feeding substrates of each bird species were recorded. Twenty four bird species were recorded, 19 in the undisturbed site and 15 in the burnt site. Some bird species present in the undisturbed site were absent or present at lower densities in the burnt site. These species feed on the foliage, branches and trunks, or inhabit moist sites and sites with high plant cover. They would be at a disadvantage in the burnt site because of the reduction in feeding substrates and the alteration of their habitat due to the effects of fire on the vegetation. Most of the species found in the burnt site but absent or present at lower densities in the undisturbed site are ground feeders. Their positive response to the disturbance could be due to a greater availability of food resources in the ground, and to structural changes in the vegetation that are favourable for food gathering. Species diversity was higher in the burnt site. This may be explained by the fact that fire increased spatial heterogeneity and generated changes in resource availability. Some species inhabiting the burnt site could use other habitats to cover all of their habitat requirements.

Tubelis, D.P.; Lindenmayer, D.B.; Cowling, A.				Journal of Zoology (London)	271	1		11-18	January 2007	2007				English	0	8	The peninsula effect - a decrease in species richness from the base to the tip of a peninsula - has been tested for a diverse range of taxa at continental and regional scales. We investigated the peninsula effect at a local scale by examining bird species occurrence in riparian strips (peninsulas) of native eucalypt forest within a radiata pine plantation in the Tumut region, south-eastern Australia. Peninsulas were elongated but 'blind' extensions of a core area of native eucalypt forest. Birds were surveyed by the area search method, within 1.0-ha quadrats established along peninsulas (n=14), in October and November 2002. Data were analysed using generalized linear mixed models. A significant decrease in bird species richness from the base towards the tip of the peninsulas was observed. The proportion of large bird species recorded per quadrat showed a significant decrease from the base towards the tip of the peninsulas. This pattern was not observed for small birds. Several species were more abundant at the base of the peninsulas than away from the core area of eucalypt forest. The peninsula effect can occur locally in landscape mosaics. Factors leading to the observed patterns of species occurrence may be distinct from those proposed in investigations of the peninsula effect with a biogeographical (macroscale) context. In our microscale study, foraging incursions of individual birds from the core area of native forest through peninsulas were a major factor giving rise to higher bird species richness in the more basal portions of peninsulas.

Northeastern Naturalist	14	3		361-374	2007	2007				English	0	4	Streambank fencing is increasingly used to exclude livestock from riparian corridors and to enhance biological communities. Our study examined vegetative change and avian-community use of recently fenced agricultural habitat. We con-ducted strip-transect surveys to census bird communities, line-transect and plot surveys to assess vegetation, and intensive nest monitoring to gauge use and reproductive success across 12 fenced riparian sites in southwestern Pennsylvania. Selected sites varied in age from 3 to 8 years since fencing and averaged 21 m in width. We found avian use was significantly greater in spring than in fall across our fenced sites. We determined that canopy cover, shrub cover, and herbaceous ground cover could predict various attributes of the avian community present within the fenced riparian areas. Our results also suggest that the avian community has greater species richness within sites containing greater habitat complexity, and that these sites are important breeding and nesting areas. Among the 145 nests monitored, 38% successfully fledged young. We found no differences in distance to corridor edge between successful nests and nests that failed. Our study confirms that riparian renovation efforts do have conservation value for both migratory and resident birds.

Solonen, Tapio				Ornis Svecica	17	1		15-28	2007	2007				English	0	1	A Finnish pilot project of landscaping a landfill is aimed at creating conditions for a diversified and abundant flora and fauna. In 1997-2005, one part, a recent sand heaping mound was managed, while a second part, a former communal waste dump, was left for free vegetation succession. The birds of the open landfill area (45 ha) and surrounding forest (30 ha) were censused by territory mapping during four breeding seasons (1997, 2003-2005). The changes in the avifauna of the landscaped part were compared to those of the unmanaged one and the surrounding forest. In the open habitats, the total abundance of ground-nesting birds remained relatively stable while the species nesting in scrub clearly increased. However, the ground-nesters increased in the recently landscaped heaping mound, but decreased in the unmanaged area. The bird diversity seemed to change in the expected manner, following the rapid early succession of vegetation. Accordingly, continuous management is needed to keep the species of the most open habitats as permanent members of the local avifauna.

Kosinski, Ziemowit; Kempa, Marcin				Polish Journal of Ecology	55	3		519-533	2007	2007				English	1	50	Abundance, distribution and nest-site characteristics of woodpecker species (family Picidae), i.e., Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos major L.), Middle Spotted Woodpecker (D. medius L.), Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (D. minor L.), Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius L.), Grey-faced Woodpecker (Picus canus Gmel.) and Wryneck (Jynx torquilla L.), coexisting in managed forest are described. All species preferred old deciduous forest stands ( >= 81 years old) as nest-sites, however, they differed in most aspects of nest site selection. Great- and Middle Spotted Woodpeckers excavated nest-holes most commonly in oaks (78 and 86% of nests, respectively), but Black- and Grey-faced Woodpeckers in beeches (71 and 100% of nests). However, placement of nest-holes within the same tree species differed among woodpecker species. Great Spotted- and Grey-faced Woodpeckers nested three meters lower (9 m) compared to Middle Spotted and Black Woodpeckers (12 m). Lesser Spotted- Woodpeckers excavated breeding holes relatively the highest in respect to tree height. With the exception of Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers, all specie used live trees as nest sites. Weaker excavators such as Middle Spotted- and Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers, nested more frequently in limbs and branches (31 and 25% of nests, respectively) compared to strong excavators, i.e., Great Spotted-, Black- and Grey-faced Woodpeckers (8% of nests in limbs or branches). Weaker excavators more frequently selected dead tree fragments compared to strong excavators.

Spitzer, Lukas; Tuf, Ivan H.; Tufova, Jana; Tropek, Robert				Prace a Studie Muzea Beskyd Prirodni Vedy	19			71-82	2007	2007				Czech	0	0	Based on their biological diversity, remnants of seminatural fir-beech woodlands are one of the most valuable habitats of the Vsetinske vrchy Hills (Western Carpathians, Czech Republic). Due to intensive forestry, these habitats are declining across Central Europe. So far, few studies have been conducted of the composition of epigeic invertebrates in natural forests of the region. This study covers epigeic invertebrate fauna (isopods, harvestmen, millipedes, centipedes and ground beetles) inhabiting two reserves (capitals denote the locality: HP - the Halvovsky potok Nature Reserve, K - the Kutany Nature Reserve) in the central part of the Vsetinske vrchy Hills. Twelve pitfall traps per reserve were exposed for one month in spring and repeatedly in summer 2005. The traps were localized so as to catch local variability of microhabitat conditions. In total, 759 adult individuals of 51 epigeic invertebrate species were identified (4 isopods, 1 harvestman, 7 centipedes, 25 ground beetles, 9 spiders and 5 millipedes which 1 species of them was identified only to genus level). The majority of species were recorded from the locality HP (42 species), while 37 species were found in K as well. There was a large difference in presence of millipedes and centipedes between two reserves. Higher diversity was found in HP, where almost all species collected were present. There were no differences between the local communities of ground beetles between HP and K. When compared to previous studies, the abundance of some species was lower (especially Carabus obsoletus Sturm, 1815 and Cychrus attenuatus (Fabricius, 1792)). Carabus variolosus Linne, 1787 (protected by European law) occurred in high numbers in both reserves. The spider's diversity was higher in K. There were scree forests species which were surprisingly absent from HP (Harpactea lepida (C. L. Koch, 1838), Tegenaria silvestris L. Koch, 1872). The results highlight to indispensableness of insular remnants of natural fir-beech stands for maintaining regional species diversity.

DeSante, David F.; Ruhlen, Eric D.; Scalf, Rusty			Barclay, John H.; Hunting, Kevin W.; Lincer, Jeffrey L.; Linthicum, Janet; Roberts, Thomas A.	Proceedings of the California Burrowing Owl Symposium, November 2003. [Bird Populations Monographs No 1.].				1-41	2007	2007				English	0	5	Habitat destruction and population declines have contributed to the listing of the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) as endangered in Canada and a "Bird of Conservation Concern" in the United States. Despite the status of the Western Burrowing Owl (Athene c. hypugaea) in California as a "Bird Species of Special Concern" and the fact that a large proportion of its breeding population occurs there, many details of the owl's distribution and relative abundance in California were unknown prior to this work. We conducted a survey of Burrowing Owls during May-July, 1991-1993, throughout most of their breeding range in California and assessed changes in their distribution compared to observations made in the 1980s. Surveys were conducted in 525 randomly selected 25-km2 blocks and in an additional 179 blocks known to contain breeding owls during the 1980s. From the randomly selected blocks, we estimated a total of 9,127 (1,243 SE) breeding pairs of Burrowing Owls in California, exclusive of the Great Basin and desert areas, and the Channel Islands. Including additional information from non-random blocks, we estimated 9,266 breeding pairs of owls. The distribution of breeding owls was exceedingly non-uniform: most of the owls (92%) were estimated to occur in lowland areas and the vast majority was estimated to reside in the Imperial Valley (71%) and the Great Central Valley (24%). Over 90% of the owls counted were located on privately owned lands, although more recent work on large grasslands suggests that the proportion of owls on public lands may be somewhat larger than indicated by our results. Of 165 owl groups (owls within 3 km of one another) known during the 1980s, only 76 (46%) still existed during the survey, although an additional 69 groups were newly discovered during the survey. Population decreases between the 1980s and early 1990s were estimated at 62-77% in all of coastal California, 51-66% in the San Francisco Bay Area Interior, and 1-48% in the Central Valley. We showed that Burrowing Owls were apparently extirpated as a breeding species during the 1980s and early 1990s from Napa, Marin, San Francisco, Santa Cruz, coastal San Luis Obispo, and Ventura counties, and fewer than five breeding pairs appeared to still exist during the 1990s in each of Sonoma, San Mateo, coastal Monterey, Santa Barbara, and Orange counties. We examined North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data on Burrowing Owls in California and found that the significant 6% per year BBS population increase suggested by these data was essentially driven by three routes with very large and increasing populations in the Imperial Valley. We evaluated characteristics of Burrowing Owl breeding sites occupied during 1992 that were associated with the probability of re-occupancy during 1993. Presence of ground squirrels was the single greatest predictor of breeding-site re-occupancy; higher re-occupancy rates were also observed for sites near irrigation canals, sites with more than two pairs of owls, and areas with high densities of owls. The results of our survey indicate that California's Burrowing Owl population is highly fragmented, extremely non-uniform, generally declining, and locally vanishing. Because their distribution places them squarely in conflict with continuing residential and commercial development, and because the great majority of the population is located on privately-owned lands, the long-term persistence of the species in California will require strong conservation efforts and pro-active management actions. Clearly, a comprehensive conservation and management plan for Burrowing Owls in California is urgently needed. Important features of this plan must be inclusion in its development of all major stakeholders that will be impacted by it, including representation by agriculture, water distribution, and real estate development; inclusion of up-to-date survey data on the distribution and abundance of owls; inclusion of recent research on habitat-specific productivity, survival, and dispersal; and the wise combination of habitat protection, habitat restoration, and relocation of owls. Burrowing Owls, however, are charismatic and resilient, respond well to management, and, under proper conditions, can readily co-exist with humans in non-natural habitats, including agricultural lands and protected areas in urban environments. With determined implementation of a comprehensive conservation plan, the long-term persistence of healthy Burrowing Owl populations throughout much of the species' range in California is an achievable goal.

Their numbers appear small, and their status and population trends in this region are unknown. Using plant community and elevation data in this five-county area, we identified a maximum of 10,476 km2 of potential Burrowing Owl habitat, most of which is located within the shrub-steppe habitats of the Modoc Plateau Bioregion. We estimate that this five-county area could support between 103 and 227 Burrowing Owl pairs based on density figures reported elsewhere. Potentially significant threats to Burrowing Owl habitat in this region include water exports and western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) woodland expansion, and to a lesser degree, perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifoliurn) invasion and shrub habitat restoration efforts. Systematic field research is needed to determine the status, distribution, and population trends of Burrowing Owls in northeastern California, as well as to further assess potential range management conflicts with, other shrub-steppe wildlife species.

Sadej, Wojciech; Walerys, Grzegorz; Tworkowski, Jozef				Progress in Plant Protection	47	4		202-211	2007	2007				Polish	1	1	The area of farmland used for growing small-seeded papilionaceous, leguminous and tuber crops is gradually decreasing in our agrocenoses. Cereal monocultures are becoming more popular. Another undesirable factor is the disappearance of groups of trees or brambles and strips of grass between fields. As the number of cultivated crops and wild plants goes down, the biological diversity of a given agricultural system diminishes. The effect of the above changes can be reduced by introducing alternative plants, also known as new crops. In the north-eastern part of Poland, willow (Salix spp.) draws much attention. Another alternative plant, which can gain considerable area of cultivation is oriental goat's rue (Galega orientalis Lam.). There is also some potential for evening primrose (Oenothera paradoxa Hudziok). Our study has shown that assemblages of zoophags in plantations of the above crops vary in terms of their number and species composition. They made up 13% in willow plantations, 14% in oriental goat's rue plantations and 10% in evening primrose plantations of the total entomofauna. In the case of oriental goat's rue and evening primrose plantations, spiders (Araneida) were dominant. In fields overgrown with willow, hymenopterans (Hymenoptera), owing to the numerous presence of Ichneumonidae and Formicidae, were the most frequently occurring order among zoophagous species. Plantations of the alternative crops selected for our investigations possess high natural value because of their rich diversity and a wealth of species of arthropods, which populate such plant habitats. They are a much more suitable ecological niche than cereal plantations, which prevail in agrocenoses today. Cultivation of alternative crops can be considered as an activity which stimulates occurrence of species that make up an important group of animals.

RAP Bulletin of Biological Assessment	45			1-96	2007	2007			Chapters indexed separately.	English	1	22	Papua New Guinea (PNG) is an independent state occupying the eastern half of New Guinea, the world's largest and highest tropical island. In recognition of its extensive remaining forest cover, spectacular biological diversity and low human population density, New Guinea has been recognised as one of the world's five High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas (Mittermeier et al. 2003). In addition to extensive low- and mid-elevation tropical forests, New Guinea has extensive high-montane environments, particularly along the central mountainous spine of the island. This central cordillera, formed by uplift resulting from the collision of the Australian Plate with the Pacific Plate, presents dramatic gradients of topography, elevation, temperature and rainfall that have promoted rapid evolution of an exceptionally diverse biota. Although the montane birds and flora of New Guinea have been moderately well documented (e.g. Royen 1982, Beehler et al. 1986), documentation of most biota at high elevations has been sporadic at best and major gaps in survey effort continue to hinder meaningful discussions about conservation priorities for, and biogeographic relationships among, the New Guinean biota. With an area of 12,800 km2 Enga Province in Papua New Guinea's central highlands region includes a higher proportion of upper montane (>3,000 m) environments than any other province in Papua New Guinea (Loeffler 1977). It is also the site of the Porgera Mine, a major openpit gold mining operation that accounts for 14% of the country's export earnings, making it the world's eighth largest gold producer in terms of 2005 output. Remarkably, despite the substantial infrastructure established by this mining operation, Enga Province appears to have the lowest biological survey effort of any province in the country. Prior to this RAP survey only a handful of collections had been made in the province. The proximity of Porgera Mine to the vast Kaijende Highlands provided the opportunity to redress this paucity of biological information through a RAP biodiversity survey designed and conducted by Conservation International and the PNG Department of Environment and Conservation, and sponsored by the Porgera Joint Venture mining operation. Scope of Project The RAP biodiversity survey reported here was undertaken as part of a long-term commitment by Conservation International (CI) to assist with the establishment of a Conservation Area covering the Kaijende Highlands of Enga Province. Discussions between CI, the PNG Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) and the Porgera Joint Venture partners (PJV) resulted in a consensus that CI would play a lead role in developing the project. To this end CI has established an office at Porgera with funding support from PJV. Locally-based CI staff are working with local landowners and local NGOs to establish the area (see Map) as a Conservation Area under the Conservation Area Act with assistance from the DEC. The Mt. Kaijende Conservation Area will have a management plan and a development plan, rules, a management committee, and the steps towards establishment will allow for participation by the general public and by landowners. Follow-up awareness activities during 2007 have generated substantial support from local landowners, the PNG Mining Department and other stakeholders. The RAP results reported here are the result of a successful partnership between CI, DEC, PJV and a number of local communities. We hope that the information gathered during this survey will play a useful role in informing the development of sustainable management strategies for this spectacular region. RAP SURVEY OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES Conservation International's Rapid Assessment Program(RAP) is an innovative biological inventory program designed to use scientific information to catalyze conservation action. RAP methods are designed to rapidly assess the biodiversity of highly diverse areas and to train local scientists in biodiversity survey techniques. Since 1990, RAP's teams of expert and host-country scientists have conducted 60 terrestrial, freshwater aquatic (AquaRAP), and marine biodiversity surveys and have contributed to building local scientific capacity for scientists in 26 countries. Biological information from previous RAP surveys has resulted in the protection of millions of hectares of tropical forest, including the declaration of protected areas in Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil and the identification of biodiversity priorities in numerous countries. The primary objective of this RAP survey was to document the plant, herpetofauna, bird and mammal diversity of the Kaijende Highlands, a vast region of near-uninhabited montane forest and grasslands in Enga Province. The information we gathered will be used to make recommendations about the conservation significance of, and management options for, the remarkable biodiversity of this area. Survey sites were selected to include the major habitat types contained within the proposed Mt. Kaijende Conservation Area. The specific aims of this RAP survey were to: * Produce an overview of the diversity and conservation significance of selected plant and animal taxa at elevations between 2,000 and 3,300 m. * Evaluate threats to biodiversity of the region, and recommend management strategies for their mitigation that are relevant to local communities, government agencies, and the nearby Porgera Mine. * Provide on-site training in biodiversity inventory techniques for staff from DEC.* Make RAP data available for decision-makers at all levels of Government, and to local communities, NGOs and the general public, with a view to promoting the establishment of a Conservation Area in the Mt. Kaijende Highlands. Study Area The Kaijende Highlands incorporate an extensive area of montane habitats (>2,000 m elevation) adjacent to the Porgera Mine in Enga Province, Papua New Guinea (see Map). Population density in the proposed Conservation Area is extremely low, but trails linking small villages and others used by hunters criss-cross the area. A well-travelled trailthrough the high-montane grasslands of the Kaijende Highlands links Porgera Town with the Mt. Kare goldfields. As in most areas of Melanesia, land ownership in this region is complex and numerous clans lay claim to parts of the Kaijende Highlands. The area behind Mt. Kumbepara, from Omyaka to the Porgera Reservoir, is owned by the Pulumaini, Angalaini, Tieni and Aipakani clans. The Omyaka camp site was on Pulumaini land. The LakeTawa area belongs to people from Kole and Kanzawi villages (Paiela) who also own the Mt. Kare area. The Paiela Road area is owned by the Pulumaini, Angalaini, Tieni and Tuanda clans. Land around Suyan is owned by the Aipakani-Kealo/ Pepe (Suyan Camp), and the Timain and Paiam clans (areas behind Suyan). Site descriptions The climate of the Kaijende Highlands area, extrapolated from rainfall and temperature data collected at the PJV Environment Department offices on the Porgera Mine site at around 2,200 m, is relatively aseasonal. Mean monthly minimum air temperature recorded daily between 2001 and 2004 varied between just 11.3 and 13.0[degree]C and mean monthly maximum temperature varied between 18.8 and21.0[degree]C (Figure 1). Precipitation is high, with a long-term (1974 - 2006) mean annual rainfall of 3,679.6 mm (range 2,505.8 - 4,413.0 mm) but rainfall shows a more pronounced seasonal effect than temperature (Figure 2). The mean monthly rainfall calculated for each month over 33years was 306.6 mm when calculated across all months, but there are distinctly wetter and drier 'seasons' with a maximum mean monthly rainfall of 370 mm in March and a minimum of 246.6 mm in July. Figure 2 shows long-term (1974 - 2006) mean monthly rainfall and the 2005 total rainfall for Porgera Mine to illustrate the period leading up to and including this RAP survey. The RAP survey was conducted during a year when rainfall in September was much higher than the long-term mean. However maximum and minimum monthly rainfall totals at Porgera over the same period do not follow the trend shown by the monthly means illustrated in Figure 2; they show that most months can be extremely wet (> 450 mm) or extremely dry (<150 mm) in any given year. Although the Porgera climate data probably broadly reflect conditions at the lower elevations throughout the KaijendeHighlands, including Lake Tawa, it should be noted that climate in the area varies dramatically with topography and altitude. The highest elevations of the Kaijende Highlands experience climatic conditions that are much more extreme than those reported for Porgera, and air temperatures recorded in the upper-montane grasslands around Omyaka and Waile Creek during this survey regularly dropped to 5[degree]C. Unfortunately, comprehensive rainfall and temperature data for these high-montane sites are unavailable. The survey was conducted around four major 'sites' at elevations between 2,000 m and 3,400 m. These localities provided access to a range of habitats including montane grasslands, upper montane forests, mid-montane forest, and disturbed mid-montane forest regrowth and gardens. Geologically, this highland area is on the New Guinea Fold Belt (Hill and Hall 2003), and lies to the south of the complex system of geological terranes that have accreted to northern New Guinea (Pigram and Davies 1987). The survey schedule and location of major sites are presented in Table 1. The major vegetation formations of the study area are described in detail in Chapter 1 and a gazetteer for, and brief descriptions of vegetation at, each major site and each 'sub-site' are presented in Appendix 1. The general topography of Lake Tawa, and the location of significant collection sites and habitats around this valley are illustrated in Figure 3. SUMMARY Of RAP RESUlTS By TAXONOMIC GROUP vegetation The flora of the Kaijende Highlands occurs in three principal vegetation formations: 1) lower montane forest, 2) upper montane forest, and 3) subalpine grassland. A total of 492 tracheophytic plant species were documented during this survey including 112 ferns and lycophytes, 6 gymnosperms, 69 monocots, and 305 dicots from a total of 262 genera. At least 16 plants are determined as species new to science,including five arborescent taxa, five understory shrubs, two vines, two orchids, and two ferns. Herpetofauna Seventeen frog and two reptile species were documented from montane forests and montane grassland habitats in the Kaijende Highlands. At least eight of the frog species are undescribed and one of these probably warrants recognition as a new genus. This survey documented the second known population of Callulops glandulosus, and a very large species of Albericus found at Lake Tawa may represent only the second known population of A. fafniri. Both of these species were considered Data Deficient by the Global Amphibian Assessment. One other frog, Litoria becki, found only in high-montane grassland habitats, was considered Vulnerable in the recent Global Amphibian Assessment. Although the reptile fauna was depauperate, this reflects the high-elevationfocus of our survey and the low diversity is probably typical of sites at similar elevations elsewhere in New Guinea. One of the two species documented, a skink of the genus Sphenomorphus, may represent an undescribed taxon. Birds Nineteen days of surveys, including a series of 'walkingcensuses' undertaken at key sites, detected 102 species of birds. The Long-bearded Melidectes (Melidectes princeps) was recorded for the first time west of the Mount Hagen massif. The Ribbon-tailed Astrapia (Astrapia mayeri), a spectacular long-tailed species with a severely circumscribed distribution centered on our study area, was common from 2,117 m at Lake Tawa to 3,200 m at Omyaka Camp. Although the Crested Bird of Paradise (Cnemophilus macgregorii) was not encountered on this survey, one local informant at Omyaka Camp stated that it was present and the species was apparently collected in a DEC field survey (Kula 1989). It appears that there is a substantial geographic break in this species' range between the Hagen/Giluwe area and the Star Mountains of Papua (Indonesia). This provides an intermediate-stage example of Diamond's "drop-out" phenomenon(Diamond 1972). The Kaijende Highlands support a rich upland bird fauna that might best be conserved through the creation of a large contiguous community-managed reserve that encompasses uninhabited traditional hunting lands. Mammals This survey confirmed the occurrence of one monotreme, 18 marsupials, nine rodents, two bats, and two non-native placental mammals (wild-living dogs and pigs) in the Kaijende Highlands. Previous surveys in this area had recorded just one marsupial species, three rodent species, and one bat species that were not detected in the current survey. Our survey brings the total number of native marsupials, rodents, and bats recorded in the Kaijende Highlands to 35 and in Enga Province to 39. Significant new records for the Kaijende Highlands include the third vouchered locality for Calaby's Pademelon (Thylogale calabyi) and the first record of the Giluwe Rat (Rattus giluwensis) outside of the immediate vicinity of Mt. Giluwe in Southern Highlands Province. CONSERvATiON RECOMMENDATIONS Protection of important habitats The Cyathea savanna that dominates the Kaijende upper montane zone at elevations between 3,000 m and at least 3,400 m is unique to the island of New Guinea. These upper montane habitats and vegetation formations are not protected by existing conservation initiatives in Papua New Guinea. Because island endemism is higher in Upper Montane Forest and subalpine environments than in the low elevation habitats typically covered by many conservation areas in Papua New Guinea, protection of the Kaijende Highlands will provide security for a number of endemic taxa presently excluded from conservation consideration. This survey has identified a suite of plants, frogs and mammals that appear to be dependent on these subalpine environments. The highaltitude tree fern savanna, tussock grassland, and adjacent upper montane (elfin) forests also support a poorly known assemblage of mammal species that have become rare or disappeared from many other montane sites in New Guinea. Another habitat that may require specific targeting for conservation action is limestone outcrops. Three new plantspecies were associated with karst formations during the 2005 RAP survey and additional surveys are required to determine whether these localized habitats harbor a substantial endemic plant or animal biota. The Kaijende Highlands not only harbor a large number of poorly known and significant species and habitats, but the landscapes of the region are scenic and visually stunning. The aesthetic beauty of the Kaijende Highlands provides afurther compelling argument for protection of these montane habitats. The Cyathea grassland panoramas at Omyaka and Waile Creek and the lakeside vistas at Lake Tawa are among the most spectacular ever encountered by the RAP team, and the dramatic limestone pinnacles emerging fromdense mid-montane forest near Porgera are breathtaking. Our results strongly vindicate the current efforts to establisha Wildlife Conservation Area in the Kaijende Highlands. Conservation International, the PNG Department of Environment and Conservation and PJV are working with local communities to develop a sustainable, long-term conservation plan for the proposed Conservation Area. We hope that the results of our survey will be used to promote interest in the Kaijende Highlands among local communities, and among decision makers in Local, Provincial and National Governments. Particular attention should be placed on educating local landowners about the significance of their unique biota on a global scale, about the importance of adopting sustainable hunting practices to ensure the longterm survival of many bird and larger mammal species that are becoming scarce in the mountains of New Guinea, and about the benefits of protecting their montane forests and about the benefits of protecting their montane forests and grasslands from increasingly frequent fires and other destructive human activities. With the interest and support of the local communities, the Kaijende Highlands could become a model protected area in Papua New Guinea. Species-specific recommendations Studies are needed to assess in greater detail the distribution, abundance, and threats faced by wallabies, tree-kangaroos, and echidnas in the Kaijende Highlands. These large mammals have disappeared from most areas with high human population density throughout New Guinea. Although Zaglossus and at least three different kangaroo species (Dendrolagus dorianus, Dorcopsulus vanheurni, and Thylogale calabyi) still persist in the vicinity of Porgera, the 2005 RAPteam did not encounter living animals of these species. They were documented solely based on information from informants or from trophy jaws. Clearly there is at least some hunting pressure on these animals. Obtaining information about abundance, hunting pressure, and microdistributionof large mammals in the region is a high priority if these species are to be conserved in the long term. These studies will require the assistance and knowledge of local communities, and might prove to be a straightforward and manageable project, perhaps one that can be undertaken by a sponsoredstudent or a PJV Environmental Officer. Future Research The cost and logistical challenges of working in New Guinea's remote high-montane environments are a major impediment to research. As a result, most upper montane habitats on the island remain very poorly documented. The success of our Kaijende survey was due in large part to the logistical support provided by the Porgera mine, and also to the infrastructure, including roads, that has been established in the surrounding district. Few areas in Papua New Guinea offer such advantages for an ongoing program of conservationassessments and biological studies. Long-term monitoring programs The upper montane habitats of the Kaijende Highlands provide an opportunity to monitor long-term floristic change caused by global warming. Upper Montane Forest is acutely responsive to temperature shifts induced by climatic change, as demonstrated by palynological evidence from Holocene sediments. Baseline studies should be established that not only document subsequent shifts in upper montane forest composition and distribution, but also examine concurrent changes in abundance and assemblage structure of animal taxa associated exclusively or primarily with these habitats. Fauna identified as high priorities for monitoring programs include a new genus and species of frog known only from grasslands at Omyaka, and a number of large mammal species that may already be under threat from over-hunting.Biodiversity surveys The results of the short Kaijende Highlands RAP survey were spectacular and it is clear that additional biodiversity surveys targeting habitats and elevations not covered during the 2005 RAP survey will document numerous additional species in the proposed Mt. Kaijende Conservation Area. Additional surveys will also be critical for assessing the distribution and conservation status of a number of threatened or significant species encountered or otherwise documented during the 2005 RAP survey (e.g. Thylogale calabyi, Zaglossus bartoni and Dendrolagus dorianus, three new species of microhylid frogs, several new plant species). Inasmuch as the flora and vertebrate fauna of the Upper Montane Forests are highly significant from a conservation perspective but relatively depauperate in terms of species richness, a series of targeted surveys could provide themost comprehensive biodiversity assessment of Upper Montane Forest and grasslands for any area in New Guinea to date. All participants in the Kaijende RAP survey noted that extending biodiversity survey activities to areas below 2,000 m elevation would dramatically increase the variety of biota documented. With support from PJV a trans-watershed biodiversity survey transect extending from the Kaijende Highlands to the lowlands along the Strickland River would be an ambitious project that would put the Kaijende Highlands fauna and flora in a broad biological and biogeographiccontext. In addition, with community support any future extension of the boundaries of the Conservation Area to accommodate contiguous habitats below 2,000 m elevation would substantially increase the biodiversity values of the Conservation Area. Ecotourism potential Tourism is a small but potentially lucrative business for Papua New Guinea. Few areas in the country can boast the combination of spectacular scenery and established infrastructure of the Kaijende Highlands region. Properly marketed, the Kaijende Highlands could attract visitors from elsewhere in PNG andfrom overseas. Formal designation of the Kaijende Highlands as a Conservation Area will increase the area's attractiveness as a travel destination. However it should be recognized that the tourism market is small. Studies to assess the potential of specialised eco-tours, or the promotion of research-based 'tourism' should be conducted as a matter of priority.

By means of GLM and logistic regression methods, we have constructed three models (habitat level alone, landscape level alone, combined habitat/landscape) for community structure variables (total richness, guild richness) and species composition variables (NMS scores, single species occurrences). Community structure variables seem to be linked mainly with stand-level (habitat) variables. Taking into account species composition variables, some variables (one NMS axis out of three, occurrence of Firecrest and Goldcrest) are mainly linked with habitat features as well, but others (one NMS axis, occurrence of Robin and Blackcap) are mainly linked with landscape factors. A third group of species composition variables (one NMS axis, occurrence of Eurasian Treecreeper, Northern Wren, Song Thrush and Chiff Chaff) are linked with a combination of both groups of variables (habitat and landscape). The structure of the bird community of these fir-plantations is therefore deter-mined by habitat factors, responsible of the number of suitable niches, but different species seem to occupy these niches, according mainly to landscape factors. Management and conservation issues linked with this complex situation are discussed.

The structure of breeding bird assemblages on the two study plots has not markedly changed. Conditions for nesting of some hole-nesters have disappeared, owing to reserve trees removed in recent years. The natural holes and semi-holes has been emerging in the current pole-stage, which conditioned breeding of a relative high number of tits, and the total density of hole-nesters has not changed in comparison with the previous period The canopy-nesters density has increased owing to a considerably higher abundance of Fringilla coelebs.

Anonymous				U S Geological Survey Circular	1307			i-vi, 1-19	2007	2007				English	0	1	The mission of the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is to provide scientifically credible measures of the status and trends of North American bird populations at continental and regional scales to inform biologically sound conservation and management actions. Determining population trends, relative abundance, and distributions of North American avifauna is critical for identifying conservation priorities, determining appropriate conservation actions, and evaluating those actions. The BBS program, jointly coordinated by the U.S. Geological Survey and Environment Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service, provides the U.S. and Canadian Federal governments, state and provincial agencies, other conservation practitioners, and the general public with science-based avian population trend estimates and other information for regional and national species' population assessments.Despite the demonstrated value of the BBS for furthering avian conservation across North America, its importance is often underappreciated, and it is underfunded compared with many other government-supported programs that report on status of the environment. Today, BBS resources, adjusted for inflation, are below the amount allocated in the 1970s and are still only sufficient to support two biologists. Yet the number of routes, participants, data, and data requests has quadrupled. Data and information management and delivery requirements and security concerns, non-existent in 1966, impose further demands on BBS resources. In addition, the Mexican expansion of the BBS offers new hope for a truly continental approach to avian conservation, but also brings additional challenges. Meeting the goals of this plan will take cooperation among myriad stakeholders; yet, even with collaboration, most objectives of this plan will be unattainable if BBS program support is not increased.The BBS developed this strategic plan to help set priorities and identify resources required for the program to continue to meet the evolving needs of the conservation community for information on bird population change. By setting clear goals, strategies, and measures of success, this plan provides a cohesive framework and vision for maintenance and development of the BBS. The plan identifies two major goals for the BBS, with a number of strategies and objectives to achieve these goals. Over the next 5 years, progress made in addressing each long-term goal and its associated 5-year strategies and objectives will gage the plan's success. Specific actions, projected outcomes, and measures of success related to accomplishing these are outlined in Table 1, with a timeline in Table 2. The two main goals for the program, with a summary of the strategies to achieve them, are:Goal 1: Collect scientifically credible measures of the status and trends of North American bird populations at continental and regional scales.The North American Breeding Bird Survey will continue to support North American natural resource conservation through the collection of scientifically credible measures of the status and trends of continental bird populations. While doing this, the BBS will work to improve the science behind the program to better meet its mission and the changing needs of the avian conservation community. In partnership with collaborators, the BBS will address detectionprobability bias and habitat bias, improve analytical methods, and more fully assess and account for observer quality. Moreover, the BBS will improve the quality and breadth of avian population data through strategic increases in route density and the establishment of a Mexican BBS program.Goal 2: Ensure BBS data and analytical results are widely available and easily accessible for use by the avian conservation and management communities.At the heart of the BBS lies a four-million-record database containing more than 40 years of data on more than 600 bird species. These data are of no value if not well maintained, appropriately analyzed, and widely and easily accessible. The USGS has greatly improved data management and accessibility in recent years. Trend estimates were first made available via the Internet in the mid-1990s, followed closely by the raw data with baseline metadata and standard operating procedures. Nevertheless, numerous enhancements to data management and the usability of BBS results will greatly improve the ability of the BBS to serve avian conservation goals. The BBS needs to ensure that BBS data and results presented on the web site use the best data-management practices and statistical methods, with adequate documentation for users to understand them and any differences between different trend estimates. Moreover, the BBS needs to increase communication with BBS partners and stakeholders to ensure that it continues to meet the avian population status and trends needs of the conservation community and to encourage the development of new products. Working with collaborators, the BBS will develop tools for integrating environmental parameters like habitat change into the analyses, and for integrating BBS data with other avian survey results. In addition, the BBS will continue to improve data and database management through the incorporation of additional data and data fields, such as georeferenced stop locations and more complete metadata for the raw data and results, thus enhancing the uses that can be made of the data.

Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias	78	4		629-644	December 2006	2006				English	1	26	Playback of bird songs is a useful technique for species detection; however, this method is usually not standardized. We tested playback efficiency for five Atlantic Forest birds (White-browed Warbler Basileuterus leucoblepharus, Giant Antshrike Batara cinerea, Swallow-tailed Manakin Chiroxiphia caudata, Whiteshouldered Fire-eye Pyriglena leucoptera and Surucua Trogon Trogon surrucura) for different time of the day, season of the year and species abundance at the Morro Grande Forest Reserve (South-eastem Brazil) and at thirteen forest fragments in a nearby landscape. Vocalizations were broadcasted monthly at sunrise, noon and sunset, during one year. For B. leucoblepharus, C. Caudata and T surrucura, sunrise and noon were more efficient than sunset. Batara cinerea presented higher efficiency from July to October. Playback expanded the favourable period for avifaunal surveys in tropical forest, usually restricted to early morning in the breeding season. The playback was efficient in detecting the presence of all species when the abundance was not too low. But only B. leucoblepharus and T surrucura showed abundance values significantly related to this efficiency. The present study provided a precise indication of the best daily and seasonal periods and a confidence interval to maximize the efficiency of playback to detect the occurrence of these forest species.

Luis Telleria, Jose; Luis Venero, Jose; Santos, Tomas				Ardeola	53	2		271-283	Diciembre 2006	2006				English	1	23	Aims: Bogs (locally named "bofedales") constitute a key habitat for conserving birds associated with the wet meadows and ponds on the huge expanses of dry bunch-grass steppes ("puna") of the Andes. Despite this, the factors shaping bird numbers and species richness in this habitat have not been studied. This paper examines the bird communities in a set of bogs distributed in two Peruvian localities during the wet (February) and dry (September) season. It evaluates the effects of bog size and some habitat features (grazing intensity, presence of small watercourses, vegetation cover, etc.) on abundance and species richness of bird communities. Location: Two Peruvian localities above 4,000 in (humid mountains near Cusco, and and uplands near Arequipa). Methods: Given that bogs tended to be long and narrow (mean width: 59 in, range 10 - 200 in), birds were counted along three parallel, simultaneous transects covering the full area of bogs. Independent variables evaluated were the size (ha), altitude (in above sea level), slope (0-90[degree]), presence/absence of small permanent watercourses and cover (%) of water, meadows and cushion-like Yareta shrubs in each study bog. Grazing intensity was estimated by counting the number of faecal pellet groups (of alpacas and other livestock) inside a one-metre-wide band transect. Results: Results support the view that bogs operate as local "hotspots" for birds, as they maintain species associated with different habitats, such as rivers and lakes (Anas flavirostris, Anas specularoides. etc). wet meadows (Vanellus resplendens, Chloephaga melanoptera, Cinclodes fuscus, Lessonia oreas, etc.) or bunch-grass steppes (Metriopelia aymara, Thinocorus orbignyianus, etc.). Bird species richness and numbers were positively correlated with bog size and, after controlling for this effect, species richness increased in those and upland bogs crossed by small watercourses during the dry period. This supports the key role of water availability on the bird communities of these steppes. No effect of grazing intensity and other habitat features were recorded. Conclusions: From a conservation perspective, bog size and the presence of permanent watercourses seem to be two focal criteria for prioritizing relevant bogs for protection and can also be used as key guidelines for evaluating the pervasive effects of the reduction and alteration of bogs by public works (roads), agricultural encroachment or draining.

Holm, Thomas Eske; Clausen, Preben				Biodiversity and Conservation	15	14		4399-4423	December 2006	2006				English	2	44	Many Danish wetlands frequently experience algae blooms and oxygen deficiencies because of eutrophication caused by enhanced nitrogen and phosphorous levels. As a consequence, wetland managers have focused on improving water quality, but often without considering the suitability of wetlands for waterbirds. In this study, managers improved water quality in two Danish lagoons by opening a floodgate to the sea. We studied the responses of autumn staging waterbirds and submerged vegetation, to resultant higher water replacement rates and water levels. A third lagoon with no change in management was studied for comparisons. Lagoons with rise in water levels experienced declines in bird species diversity, a decline in benthivore species abundances and an increase in herbivore species abundances. Macrophyte biomass increased but seagrass diversity was low due to high salinity. The lagoon with no changes in management control had high and stable waterbird diversity and bird-days spent was increasing during the study period. Explanations for this were diverse typography and low water levels. Furthermore, the macrophyte community was more diverse due to low salinity. In order to improve both water quality and to increase waterbird diversity in the managed lagoons, we suggest water levels should be managed actively during peak migration in autumn. This could secure more shallow-water areas to waders and create better congruence between appropriate water levels and timing of peak bird migration in autumn. The rest of the year the floodgate should be left open in order to secure a high water quality.

Slik, J.W.F.; Van Balen, S.				Biodiversity and Conservation	15	14		4425-4451	December 2006	2006				English	2	31	Our current understanding of bird community responses to tropical forest fires is limited and strongly geographically biased towards South America. Here we used the circular plot method to carry out complete bird inventories in undisturbed, once burned (1998) and twice burned forests (1983 and 1998) in East Kalimantan (Indonesia). Additionally, environmental variables were measured within a 25 m radius of each plot. Three years after fire the number of birds and bird species were similar for undisturbed and burned forests, but species diversity and turnover were significantly lower in the burned forests. The bird species composition also differed significantly between undisturbed and burned forests, with a strong decline of closed forest preferring bird species accompanied by a strong increase in degraded forest preferring species in burned forests. These differences were strongly related to differences in environmental conditions such as shifts in vegetation cover and layering and differences in ground and understorey vegetation structure. We also found significant shifts in body mass distribution, foraging height and feeding guilds between the bird communities in unburned and burned forests. Surprisingly, repeated burning did not lead to increasing impoverishment of the avifauna, and both once and twice burned forests still contained most of the bird species that were also present in undisturbed forest, even though their densities were considerably lowered.

The species diversity was estimated (Shannon-Wiener) and the richness, abundance and diversity of both communities were statistically compared; the test of the relation between sets of variables was evaluated with correlation analysis. There was no correlation between the bird community and the vegetation height diversity but the quantitative evidence show relation between the richness and species diversity of vegetation and bird community. This suggests only floristic composition is important for the structure of the bird community in this habitat and on this scale of analysis. We suggested the conservation of patches of vegetation with different phases of natural regeneration since these would be taken by different feeding guilds as well as by species with specific habitats and could be necessary for the survival and reproduction of many birds species in Santa Gertrudis.

In this area with a formerly stable population, of corn buntings, a decline was visible. It was additionally examined if the creation of certain biotope structures would result in an improvement of living conditions for the corn bunting or other bird species of the agricultural area. With only three respectively two males, the population of the corn bunting is nearly extinct in the monitoring area. Nevertheless, broods of the corn bunting could be observed from 2004 to 2006 . The transformation of a field into fallow land with different stages had positive effects on the avifauna of the area. The fallow land was accepted as breeding area e.g. by the endangered species grey partridge (Perdix perdix) and sky lark (Alauda arvensis). The creation of fallow land in the agricultural Boerde landscape is a support for the corn bunting.

Bulluck, Lesley P.; Buehler, David A.				Forest Ecology and Management	236	1		76-84	November 15 2006	2006				English	1	32	The importance of early successional habitats for breeding and post-breeding birds has received recent attention. Common early successional habitats in the eastern United States are regeneration after timber harvests, utility right-of ways and reclaimed surface mines. Few studies, however, have compared the characteristics of these with regard to avian habitat use. We conducted a passive mist-netting study to assess the breeding and post-breeding avian communities associated with these land uses in the Cumberland Mountains of eastern Tennessee. We used analysis of variance to compare the vegetation structure among these habitat types and discriminant function analyses to illustrate differences in vegetation structure and bird abundance among habitats. We banded 1562 individuals of 40 species (1.08 birds/net-hour). The percent cover of saplings, forbs and grass differed among habitat types, but there was no detectable difference in shrub cover. Vegetation structure allowed good discrimination between habitat types (Wilks' [lambda] = 0.16), specifically in differentiating clearcuts from surface mines and right-of-ways. Although the three habitat types had several avian species in common, the abundance of 12 species differed substantially among habitat types, and their species abundance patterns allowed for excellent discrimination between these habitat types (Wilks' [lambda] = 0.08). We conclude that these three early successional habitat types are different with regard to vegetation structure and avian community assemblage. These differences are important for local and landscape-scale conservation planning for both early and late successional avian species. [copyright] 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bracken, Fintan; Bolger, Thomas				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	117	2-3		178-184	November 2006	2006				English	0	19	Farmland birds have suffered a severe decline in recent years throughout Europe including Ireland. Agricultural intensification is believed to be the main cause and this has led to the introduction of agri-environmental schemes, of which set-aside is a part. Bird abundance and diversity were compared between set-aside and adjacent tillage or grassland at 18 locations. The set-aside sites were also assigned to one of four management types: rotational set-aside, non-rotational set-aside, first year set-aside that was productive grassland in the previous year, and long-term set-aside that was grazed by animals in winter. Species diversity and the abundances of skylark, meadow pipit and woodpigeon were significantly greater in set-aside sites. Species diversity was not significantly different between set-aside management types and meadow pipit, skylark, pheasant, house sparrow, magpie, snipe and starling were closely associated with non-rotational set-aside, which also contained significantly larger numbers of these species compared to the other set-aside types. This study shows that set-aside does enhance bird diversity and abundance and that, in Ireland, the most effective form of set-aside is non-rotational. It also shows that the most appropriate form of set-aside will vary from situation to situation and that a one size fits all view should not be taken in the development of agri-environmental schemes.

Biological Conservation	133	2		198-211	November 2006	2006				English	4	50	The combined effects of rapid habitat loss, fragmentation and disturbance on tropical forest avifaunas have not been examined to date. The southern Amazonian 'arc of deforestation' marks the boundary of the most aggressive agricultural frontier in tropical forests worldwide. We sampled 21 disturbed and undisturbed primary forest patches, ranging in size from 1.2 to 14,476 ha, to elucidate the synergistic effects of both forest disturbance and fragmentation on bird community structure, and pinpoint which species were the "winners" and "losers" from this process. A number of forest patch metrics, derived from an independent remote sensing approach, explained much of the resulting presence/absence matrix. The bird community exhibited a highly nested structure, with small patches being most dissimilar from one another. Bird species differed in their response to both forest patch size and forest canopy perforation according to their dependence on closed-canopy primary forest. Forest patch geometry, which clearly modulated the shape of species-area relationships accounted for 83-96% of the variation in species richness, but forest habitat quality resulting from logging and surface-fire disturbance was also a significant predictor of species richness for the most forest-dependent taxa.

Hutto, Richard L.; Gallo, Susan M.				Condor	108	4		817-831	November 2006	2006				English	3	51	We investigated the effects of postfire salvage logging on cavity-nesting birds by comparing nest densities and patterns of nest reuse over a three-year period in seven logged and eight unlogged patches of mixed-conifer forest in the Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife Management Area, Montana. We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots, but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots. Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in the salvage-logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent species in the northern Rocky Mountains-American Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters, which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots, nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially populations of primary cavity-nesting species.

Wildlife Society Bulletin	34	4		944-956	November 2006	2006				English	1	38	Currently over 14.6 million ha of land at an annual cost of US$1.76 billion are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CPP). The habitat benefits of CRP frequently are lauded, but documentation that wildlife is responding as hoped is urgently needed. We evaluated plant and breeding bird responses to 92.4 ha of CPP grasslands at China Farms in northeastern Maryland, USA. In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and facilitate stand establishment. In 6 years cumulative plant species richness increased to 261, 105 of which were species exotic to the region. During the third growing season, we initiated a schedule of prescribed burning on a 3-year rotation to remove accumulated litter and to retard woody succession, and in 2003 we added additional management to control aggressive plant species. Several at-risk bird species colonized the restored grasslands in the first year and established sustainable breeding populations. We implemented a comprehensive observation and banding program, which included mapping male territories for selected bird species and recording nest locations. We marked 1,985 grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; GRSPs) in 7 years. Breeding GRSP populations ranged annually from 70 to 90 socially monogamous pairs with an additional 40 non-territorial males. Annual return rates in the last 5 years were 57% for adult males, 41% for adult females, and 12% for hatch-year individuals. Adults and young birds exhibited high site fidelity, but overgrown fields left unburned for 2-3 years were unpopulated by GRSPs but attracted several shrub-land bird species. Habitat preference for territories was influenced more by vegetation structure than by plant species composition. We recommend the management of grasslands restored for birds include spatial and temporal rotation of prescribed fire and herbicide applications to sustain vegetation physical structure rather than species composition.

Sallabanks, Rex; Haufler, Jonathan B.; Mehl, Carolyn A.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	34	4		1079-1093	November 2006	2006				English	0	31	Locally derived information is needed if management guidelines intended to improve wildlife habitat are to be relevant, reliable, and applicable. Within the Intermountain West, few studies have examined habitat relationships of forest songbirds in mixed-conifer forests. During 1996-1997, we studied breeding bird communities in a mixed-conifer forest in west-central Idaho, USA, to describe how relative avian abundance was related to forest structure. Our study objectives were to 1) describe bird use of 3 distinct forest age-classes, 2) identify groups of species that expressed similar relationships with forest structural attributes, and 3) model species-specific bird-habitat relationships. We sampled 46 study sites (forest stands) classified into 1 of 3 common "vegetation growth stages" (seral stages): 1) shrub/seedling/sapling (n = 15 stands), 2) small tree (n = 16 stands), and 3) old growth (n = 15 stands). In each stand we surveyed breeding birds using fixed-radius point counts and measured forest structure at each point-count location. Of 30 species examined, the relative abundance of 10 differed among vegetation growth stages. Differences in stand structure were reflected by several strong gradients of vegetation structure and composition (e.g., canopy cover, diameter of large trees, snag density, and stump density) across vegetation growth stages. We used cluster analysis to establish novel information about how birds responded to these gradients and identified 3 distinct bird assemblages: forest generalists, early seral specialists, and mid- to late-seral specialists. Habitat models derived from multiple linear regression revealed that canopy cover was the best predictor of variation in abundance for numerous bird species. We conclude that changes in the amount of overstory cover will have the greatest influence on birds. Where canopy cover is reduced below, or increased above, a threshold level of approximately 25-40% cover, we predict that occurrence or density of some breeding birds will change. Our habitat models suggest that Townsend's warbler (Dendroica townsendi), red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), and brown creeper (Certhia americana) would respond negatively to reductions in canopy cover; chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina), dusky flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri), and warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus) would respond positively. This type of information will contribute to regional planning processes by allowing species "trade-offs" to be assessed under different forest management scenarios.

Holzkaemper, Annelie; Lausch, Angela; Seppelt, Ralf				Ecological Modelling	198	3-4		277-292	October 15 2006	2006				English	2	37	Heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes is supposed to be of significant importance for species diversity in agroecosystems. However, land use pattern changes may lead to an increase in suitable habitat for some species, but to habitat deterioration for other species with opposing habitat requirements. To investigate the effects of land use changes on different species' habitat suitabilities and to allow a trade off between management objectives, we applied a spatial optimization model. In this paper we present a new approach that integrates a neighbourhood dependent multi-species evaluation of land use patterns into an optimization framework for generating goal-driven scenarios. It is implemented using a genetic algorithm approach that aims at maximizing habitat suitability of three selected bird species (Middle-Spotted Woodpecker, Wood Lark, Red-Backed Shrike) by identifying optimum agricultural land use patterns. The evaluation of habitat suitability is based on landscape metrics calculated within the species' home ranges to incorporate the effects of species responses to landscape pattern on a territorial scale. The main focus of this study is to explore the potential of this approach for conservation management on the basis of a case study. We investigate where habitat requirements oppose, where they coincide and how a landscape optimized simultaneously for all target species should be characterized. We found that all species would benefit from an increase of deciduous and coniferous forest, a decrease of cropland and grassland in the study area and more heterogeneous land use patterns (smaller patches, more diversity of land use types). Habitat requirements of Red-Backed Shrike contrast most to those of the other two species with respect to landscape composition and configuration.

Allen, Jennifer C.; Krieger, Sharlene M.; Walters, Jeffrey R.; Collazo, Jaime A.				Auk	123	4		1110-1128	October 2006	2006				English	4	54	We determined the effects of fire history and a riparian-upland gradient on the breeding bird community at Fort Bragg Military Installation in North Carolina, one of the largest remnant areas of the endangered longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. Study sites were classified into two treatments: fire-intense (areas experiencing growing-season burns) and fire-suppressed (areas lacking fires). Within each treatment, bird and vegetation data were recorded at point-count stations positioned at three distances from streamhead pocosins to characterize the riparian-upland habitat gradient: 0, 75, and >=150 m. Total bird abundance and species richness varied significantly along the riparian-upland gradient, with pocosins contributing greatly to avian biodiversity. Our data revealed strong effects of fire history and riparian-upland gradient on bird species, which we described in terms of breeding-bird assemblages. Members of the open longleaf assemblage (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis), Bachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis)) were most common in fire-intense areas and at upland locations. Members of the fire-suppressed assemblage (e.g., Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla)) were confined to pocosins in fire-intense areas, but became more abundant in fire-suppressed areas. Members of the pocosin assemblage (e.g., Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythropthalamus), Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas)) were largely confined to pocosins and, in some cases, were most abundant in fire-intense pocosins. Fire suppression increased structural diversity of vegetation and promoted one breeding-bird assemblage (fire-suppressed), but at the expense of two others (open longleaf, pocosin). Continued management of Fort Bragg to promote longleaf pine restoration is essential for supporting conservation of the open-longleaf bird assemblage; in addition, it will benefit the pocosin assemblage.

Paillisson, Jean-Marc; Reeber, Sebastien; Carpentier, Alexandre; Marion, Loic				Biodiversity and Conservation	15	11		3469-3480	October 2006	2006				English	0	13	In this study we investigated the interplay between water level management, floating macrophytic vegetation and nesting whiskered tern (Chlidonias hybridus) during 8 years (1995-2002) at a shallow macrophyte-dominated lake in western France. The specific question was to see if slight increases in the water regime of the lake (three scenarios), as part of a restoration programme, affect the timing of nesting and occupation of colonies by whiskered terns by way of changes in biomass of waterlily (Nymphaea alba) beds where colonies always establish. During the study period, egg-laying dates were progressively delayed up to 40-50 days (mid-May to early July) in relation to late appearance of suitable waterlily biomass (R2 = 0.67, p = 0.01) associated with high spring water levels (1.10-1.25 m vs. 0.95 m). Simultaneously some nesting attempts were observed in sub-optimal habitats (adjacent wet grasslands) in high flooding conditions leading either to poor breeding success or colony desertion. We concluded that there is a need for compromise between the experimental water levels used to control waterlily biomass and the nesting requirements of the whiskered tern population in this lake of international importance (260-510 pairs in 1995-2002, >= 1% Ramsar level).

Buchanan, Graeme M.; Grant, Murray C.; Sanderson, Roy A.; Pearce-Higgins, James W.				Ibis	148	4		615-628	October 2006	2006				English	1	44	We reviewed the literature to determine the importance of invertebrates for moorland-breeding birds and considered our findings with respect to the conservation of such species in the UK. The diets of many moorland birds consist predominantly of invertebrates, with a wide range of taxa recorded in the diets of moorland birds during the breeding season. Relatively few taxa (Arachnida, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Oligochaeta) were widely taken, with Diptera and Coleoptera being the most important. Among these latter two insect orders, Carabidae, Curculionidae, Elateridae and Tipulidae were the most important families. Comparisons of the diets of bird families, treated separately according to whether data were derived from adults or chicks, showed that waders take more interstitial invertebrates than passerines, which themselves take more foliage invertebrates. Although we lack detailed experimental data with which to demonstrate the direct effect of particular moorland management prescriptions on some of these key invertebrate taxa for breeding birds, available data suggest that management regimes that create a mosaic of habitats are likely to be most beneficial. In particular, heterogeneity in vegetation structure and species composition, and the presence of wet flushes associated with the synchronized spring emergence of adults of certain insect species, are likely to increase invertebrate food resources for birds.

MacDonald, M.A.				RSPB Research Report	21			i-xv, 1-204	October 2006	2006				English	1	31	1. The past fifty years have seen declines in a range of bird species, notably those of farmland habitats, in the United Kingdom. 2. These declines have occurred alongside changes in human activities that have increased anthropogenic inputs of nutrients to the environment. 3. The most important anthropogenic sources of nitrogen and phosphorus are agriculture, sewage and domestic waste, while combustion of fossil fuels by industry and transport is a major source of reactive atmospheric nitrogen. 4. Around 60% of human nitrogen production, and about 80% of phosphate use are associated with fertiliser production for agriculture. 5. Both nitrogen and phosphorus are essential nutrients for plant growth and strongly influence the productivity of habitats. The use of inorganic fertilisers has allowed massive increases in agricultural production. 6. While all three major sources of nutrient pollution (fertiliser, fossil fuel combustion and sewage effluent) have declined over the past two decades, they still vastly increase the pool of available nutrients. 7. There is strong evidence that increased anthropogenic inputs of nutrients has altered the vegetation of the United Kingdom over the past century, with species typical of high-nutrient situations favoured. Farmland Vegetation 1. Increased fertiliser use generally reduces plant species richness in farm fields. Management practices associated with or driven by increased fertiliser use, notably silage production and intensive grazing, also reduce plant species richness. 2. Fertiliser application affects sward structure by promoting faster and earlier spring growth, leading to taller, denser swards. In grassland, both cutting for silage and intensive grazing lead to short (although still dense) and heterogeneous swards. 3. Silage production probably has the most radical effects on vegetation of any form of farmland management, and silage production has replaced hay production over much of the UK. Early and frequent cutting affects sward structure, and reduce the amount of seed set by grass swards. 4. The use of inorganic fertilisers has led to changes in landscape configuration by releasing farmers from the need to graze stock for manure production and/or to rotate leguminous crops. There has been a loss of mixed farming landscapes and a polarisation of agriculture in the United Kingdom towards arable farming in the south and east, and pastoral farming in the north and west. Invertebrates 5. Invertebrates, notably earthworms, may be killed by heavy applications of organic and inorganic fertiliser, due to toxic ammonia concentrations, salinity and desiccation. The effects are not usually long-term. 6. Invertebrate species richness is frequently positively related to plant species richness, due to increased opportunities for specialist species. However, the relationship does not always hold, nor is invertebrate abundance necessarily positively related to plant species richness. 7. Plant-eating invertebrates may be favoured by the increased nutritive content of fertilised crops, although there may be shifts in community composition. They are also favoured by the increased shoot growth resulting from fertiliser application. 8. The reduced root:shoot ratio resulting from increased foliar growth can be detrimental to soil invertebrates, although invertebrates feeding on roots may benefit from increased nutritive content. 9. Invertebrates that require specific sward structure, even those that eat plants, will be affected by the changes to sward structure arising from fertiliser application and associated management practices. Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets) are an example of this, as their habitat requirements are poorly met in intensively managed improved grassland. 10. Invertebrates may be affected by disturbance arising from grazing and cutting. Large insects are disproportionately affected, as their longer life cycles and relatively low recolonisation ability mean that they are more likely to disappear from intensively managed farmland. 11. Intensive grazing, and earlier and more frequent cutting associated with silage production directly remove invertebrates, and also remove much of the primary productivity. 12. Changes to sward structure probably have the greatest effects on invertebrate abundance, and these effects are most clearly observed in grassland under intensive grazing and/or cutting regimes. Birds 13. Birds may be affected by fertiliser use via several mechanisms. The strongest effects are seen in pastoral landscapes, because fertiliser use has been the main driver of habitat changes in grassland, while the shift to autumn-sown cereals is a more important cause of habitat changes in arable landscapes. 14. Wintering geese graze preferentially on fertilised grass, and management for these important species includes fertiliser application and grazing. 15. Several species have suffered from reduced abundance and/or availability of surface-dwelling invertebrates. Species reliant on large invertebrates, such as cirl bunting and red-backed shrike, are especially sensitive. Loss of large invertebrates is also suggested as a major cause of reduced productivity of breeding waders in grassland. 16. Species that feed on soil invertebrates may be affected by reduced availability in dense swards. Snipe, starling and chough are examples of these. Although desiccation also reduces the ability of birds to feed on soil invertebrates, increased crop growth can contribute to this. 17. Seed resources are also reduced in intensive agriculture, and this can affect several species of seed-eating passerines. The loss of winter stubbles due to more efficient harvesting and autumn-sown cereals is probably the strongest driver of this. 18. More intensive grazing can lead to increased nest trampling in ground nesting species such as skylark and lapwing. These species may also suffer higher predation rates in intensively managed fields because sward homogeneity may make their nests easier to locate. 19. Nest destruction during silage cutting is a major cause of reduced productivity in ground nesting birds such as whinchat and corncrake. 20. The shift to silage production has probably had the greatest effect on bird populations in farmland, as it operates via three pathways: reduced invertebrate food due to frequent cutting; reduced seed resource as it is cut before setting seed; destruction of nests. 21. Birds may also have been affected by the polarisation of farming landscapes. Species such as starling and lapwing that prefer the juxtaposition of arable fields and pasture will have been disadvantaged by this process. 22. Organic farms are generally better for birds than conventional farms, but the causes of this are complex and cannot be simply ascribed to use of organic rather than inorganic fertiliser. Aquatic habitats Vegetation 1. Shallow freshwater lakes are especially susceptible to eutrophication. They tend to exist in either a clear-water state dominated by large plants (macrophytes), or a turbid-water state dominated by floating microscopic plants (phytoplankton). 2. Lakes shift between the states relatively suddenly. Switching can be triggered by a variety of processes, including changes in fish community and physical disturbance of vegetation, but the likelihood of switching is strongly influenced by nutrient levels. Both states are buffered against switching, so that a clear-water state can persist at high nutrient levels, and a turbid-water state may persist after nutrient levels are reduced. 3. Reedswamp vegetation has declined across areas of western and central Europe. Although there is some coincidence between reed decline and eutrophication, no cause and effect has been proven. In the Norfolk Broads, there was a spatial relationship between water nitrate concentration and the decline of a particular floating form of reed, known as hover. 4. Upland lakes in the UK are mostly oligotrophic in the absence of anthropogenic inputs of nutrients. These lakes can be susceptible to minor increases in nutrient loadings. 5. Estuaries and coastal waters are generally better flushed than freshwater lakes, and so the effects of eutrophication are generally less persistent. However, where eutrophication occurs it typically leads to a decline in rooted plant communities such as seagrass and eelgrass beds, and their replacement by macroalgal mats and phytoplankton blooms. vertebrates and fish 6. In freshwater, large zooplankton such as cladocerans (water fleas) are favoured by a clear-water state, as the presence of submerged macrophytes provides shelter from fish that prey on such zooplankton. 7. Freshwater invertebrate communities are sensitive to nutrient inputs, with shifts in community composition frequently driven by changes to substrate rather than food abundance or availability. Anoxic conditions also affect both invertebrates and fish. Molluscs are especially sensitive to eutrophic conditions, while annelid worms are favoured. 8. Fish communities both respond to the stable state of fresh water bodies and buffer stable states form changes, through processes such as disturbance of sediments and predation of zooplankton. 9. Eutrophication of shallow lakes leads to a reduction of fish diversity, with roach and bream becoming dominant at the expense of perch, rudd and tench. The size structure of fish communities in upland lakes can be altered by nutrient pollution, leading to fewer but larger individuals. 10. Immediately adjacent to point sources of nutrient pollution, invertebrate biomass is reduced by extreme conditions. However, in surrounding areas it can be much higher, although the community is very different from low- nutrient waters. 11. In estuarine and coastal areas, where sewage outfalls are removed, or where treatment is implemented, invertebrate biomass usually falls, although species richness increases and species composition more closely approximates natural conditions. 12. In intertidal mudflats, the presence of macroalgal mats forces invertebrates closer to the surface to evade anoxic conditions. If the mats persist invertebrate biomass may drop severely. 13. The mud-shrimp Corophium volutator and the sandworm Nereis diversicolor are more tolerant of eutrophic conditions and can provide abundant food resources to shorebirds. Birds 14. The indirect effects of eutrophication can be complex and highly localised in aquatic systems, and local changes in bird populations may be affected by changes at larger scales. Increased nutrient loading may be beneficial to birds up to a point at which radical changes to habitat occur. 15. The negative effects of nutrients on birds are most consistent in freshwater lakes, where a shift in stable states results in a decline in food plants for herbivorous and omnivorous waterfowl. 16. Eutrophic conditions also radically change the bottom-dwelling invertebrate fauna, leading to a loss of sensitive elements such as molluscs. Diving birds that feed on these invertebrates suffer from reduced food supply. 17. Roach, a fish species tolerant of eutrophic conditions are thought to compete with tufted duck for food resources in Lough Neagh. 18. Fish-eating birds that chase their prey may be negatively affected by eutrophication, as water transparency tends to be reduced. Nutrient enrichmen may also alter the size class of fish prey, reducing the abundance of suitable (small) individuals. 19. Eutrophication may affect birds reliant on reedbed by accelerating seral succession and by reducing the amount of open water present. Reedbed decline in Europe has been coincident with eutrophication, but no causality has been proven. 20. The red-listed bittern may be affected by reduced food supply. One of its major food items in Britain, rudd, performs poorly in eutrophic conditions. 21. In north-western Europe, marsh tern decline has been linked to eutrophication because its preferred nesting substrate, water soldier, is sensitive to increased nutrient loading. 22. Shorebirds in tidal areas generally benefit from anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Although the invertebrate community composition may shift radically, abundance is increased. Historically, bird populations have risen in estuaries where sewage inputs have increased, although population declines have not been observed in all situations where inputs have been reduced. 23. Species with specific prey requirements or foraging habits, such as shelduck, may not benefit from nutrient inputs. 24. In conditions of extreme eutrophication, where extensive macroalgal mats form, the anoxic conditions may force the mud-dwelling fauna to the surface, providing a short-term flush of food. If the mats persist, the food supply will be reduced in the long term. 25. Diving ducks in coastal waters also benefited from the increased food supplies around sewage outfalls, and their numbers have decline where outfalls have been removed. Upland moor and lowland heath Vegetation 1. There has been a decline in the extent of heather (Calluna vulgaris) cover in both heath and moorland in the United Kingdom in recent years. Causes of the decline include afforestation, conversion to farmland, invasion of grasses, and seral succession. 2. Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen increases the foliar nitrogen content of Calluna and decreases the root:shoot ratio. This increases sensitivity to desiccation, and dieback has been observed especially during winter droughts in upland moor and lowland heath. 3. Heath beetle outbreaks also cause Calluna dieback, and larval growth increases with foliar nitrogen content. It is suggested that nitrogen deposition increases the probability of beetle outbreaks. 4. Calluna is not competitively disadvantaged by increased nitrogen inputs in the absence of disturbance. Dieback resulting from heather beetle attacks or desiccation may cause disturbance sufficient for grasses to invade. Both of these mechanisms may be increased by nitrogen deposition. 5. Grazing disturbance has effects on the cover of heather and grass in moorland independent of the effects of nutrient inputs. Grazing intensity has increased over time in upland areas, although the drivers of this have mostly been agricultural subsidy policies. Nitrogen deposition may have facilitated this by increasing the forage quality of moorland, but this is difficult to determine and is likely to be a minor contributor. 6. These mechanisms are also suggested as causes for the loss of lowland heath in western Europe. However, lack of management is also implicated, so that succession to scrub and lack of burning have also resulted in loss of heath. vertebrates 7. Maintenance of invertebrate communities in moorland requires a mosaic of grass and heather of varying ages. Invertebrate biomass is generally lower in heather moorland than in grass moorland, although wet areas in moorland may support an abundant invertebrate fauna. 8. Plant-eating invertebrates may be favoured by nitrogen deposition and increased nutritive value of Calluna. However, intensive grazing will remove foliage to the detriment of these invertebrates. irds 9. The importance of nitrogen deposition in driving changes to bird populations in the uplands, relative to other causes (such as afforestation, climate change, land management), is difficult to determine. The evidence for links between increased nitrogen deposition (and associated processes) and bird populations is examined. 10. In upland moorland, the shift from heather to grass moorland over a large scale is likely to be the most important indirect effect of nitrogen deposition on birds. For fifteen species there was sufficient evidence of such effects to estimate sensitivity to heather loss. 11. Two species (red grouse and merlin) are classed as sensitive to heather loss, because they are strongly associated with mature heather cover for breeding and foraging. 12. Seven species (black grouse, golden eagle, hen harrier, meadow pipit, stonechat, ring ouzel and twite) are classed as moderately sensitive to heather loss. These species require a mosaic of heather and grass cover, and the effects of heather loss on birds will depend on the extent of initial heather cover and its spatial distribution. 13. Six species (golden plover, curlew, snipe, skylark, whinchat, wheatear) are classed as having low sensitivity to heather loss. Some of these species are likely to benefit from the conversion of heather moorland to either grass or bracken, while for others the structure of moorland vegetation is more important than its floristic composition. 14. For almost all species, an appropriate mosaic of upland habitats is required to supply suitable resources (eg nesting and foraging sites). In many cases, vegetation structure is more important than species composition, and very few bird species benefit from continuous heather cover.

Green, Ken; Sanecki, Glenn				Austral Ecology	31	6		673-681	September 2006	2006				English	1	22	Over 35 days in January-February 2003, wildfires burnt across much of the subalpine/alpine landscape of south-eastern Australia, including about 70% of the land above 1500 in in the Snowy Mountains. At the time of the fire, studies of two subalpine faunal assemblages were being undertaken. The opportunity to resurvey the assemblages was taken in order to examine the immediate impact of fire in an environment where it is uncommon but predicted to occur increasingly with global warming. A study area in the Whites River Valley, where the number of bird species was counted monthly from 1996 to 2003, and weekly in late winter-spring from 2000 to 2003, was burnt in one fire. As well as the expected decrease in the number of individual birds, the fire resulted in an immediate decrease in the number of bird species, unlike in previously studied montane forest, with only the regularly wintering species plus the olive whistler and the ground-feeding flame robin remaining. During the post-winter avian immigration, few regular spring migrants appeared on burnt sites despite their nearby presence on the unburnt side of the valley. Five of six small mammal trapping grid's were burnt. As with fires at lower altitudes, there was an immediate reduction in mammal numbers. on burnt grids following the fire, but in addition, one species, Mastacomys fuscus, declined further in the ensuing 2 months both on burnt and unburnt sites. Numbers of Antechinus swainsonii and Rattus fuscipes stabilized until autumn/winter when there was a further decline due to the unavailability of subnivean space to allow winter foraging, allied with a concentration of fox predation on areas still carrying populations of small mammals.

However, there has been little research on the ecological basis of utilizing bird species as indicators of their respective communities and habitats. We used point counts to survey 72 landbird species, 16 of conservation concern, in the Dadia Nature Reserve, Greece, in order to understand the ecology of bird diversity patterns, analyse community composition, identify species characteristic of major vegetation types, and improve long-term management and monitoring protocols. We sampled 36 sites representing 21 vegetation types. Highly heterogeneous sites were the most species rich and rural mosaics (small fields and pastures of low intensity land use, separated by thick hedgerows and tree lines) were twice as rich as intensified crop monocultures. Using multivariate analysis, we found that vegetation cover and height affected the composition of the avifauna. Twenty-one predefined vegetation categories clustered into eight distinct bird habitat types: field crops, rural mosaics, mosaic sites, poplar trees, broadleaved woods, pinewoods, shrubs, and heaths. Ten bird species were highly characteristic of the main bird habitat types in the study area. Our results emphasize the importance of conserving rural mosaics, hedgerows, and openings within forests for landbird conservation in the Mediterranean countryside. We also provide evidence in support of maintaining horizontal heterogeneity at a local scale. Finally, we suggest that monitoring populations of certain indicator bird species can be a cost-effective and efficient way to monitor the state and habitat quality of the entire landbird community, thereby integrating the knowledge of community structure into conservation decision-making.

Rolando, A.; Dondero, F.; Ciliento, E.; Laiolo, P.				Ibex Journal of Mountain Ecology	8			21-26	Autumn 2006	2006				English	0	2	Alpine meadows are examples of semi-natural habitats largely created and maintained through grazing of domestic livestock. Deterioration of these habitats is widespread in the Alps, due mainly to depopulation of high elevation rural areas and reduction of stocking levels followed by a continue intensification of agricultural practices in valley bottoms. In order to determine the best management practices in terms of bird diversity maintenance and bird species conservation, we examined the effects of pastoral abandonment on the breeding avifauna of Gran Paradiso National Park (north-western Italian Alps). We tested for differences in mean species diversity and overall bird abundance per sampling area among four levels of increasing grazing impact, and examined the associations among 32 bird species and local habitat structure, landscape, grazing pressure and elevation. In general terms, the abandonment of pastures seems to determine a prompt increase of bird diversity and density per plot. However, while pastoral disuse leads to an overall increase in local avian diversity and density, most of woodland species that increase the diversity of abandoned habitats are quite ubiquitous and with a secure conservation status. conversely, several grassland species that here seem to be dependent upon grazing, have an unfavourable conservation status in Europe. It must be stressed that at landscape scale, grazing increases habitat diversity and, in turn, bird diversity. In conclusion, in order to preserve threatened bird species and to maintain a complex habitat mosaic and an high species diversity at large environmental scale, extensive grazing should be maintained in the Alps.

Wang, Yong; Lesak, Adrian A.; Felix, Zachary; Schweitzer, Callie Jo				Integrative Zoology	1	3		126-129	September 2006	2006				English	0	4	We simulated a shelterwood forest regeneration treatment by reducing basal area, and monitored the response of an avian community in oak-hickory forest on the southern Cumberland Plateau, northern Alabama, USA. We used five treatments: control (no removal), clear-cut (100% removal), and 25, 50, and 75% removal of basal area. Territory mapping was used to quantify bird community between mid-April and July of both 2002 and 2003. Microclimate variables were recorded at each plot. The residual basal area and canopy cover showed three distinct conditions after treatment: closed canopy, open forest, and clear-cut. The microclimate varied among treatments: air temperature was highest in clear-cut plots and lowest in control plots, whereas soil moisture had the opposite pattern. A total of 71 bird species were detected, with 36 of them defending territories. Territory density, species richness, and Shannon diversity index differed among the treatments; the relationship between these bird community indices and the level of basal area removal was quadratic, lowest in the clear-cut plots and highest in the intermediate levels. Although species richness was similar among the control, 25, 50, and 75% removal treatments, species composition varied. The richness difference among treatments became smaller in the second year post-treatment (2003) with an increase in bird density and richness occurring in the clear-cut plots.

Bateman, Heather L.; O'Connell, Margaret A.				Northwest Science	80	4		283-291	Autumn 2006	2006				English	1	6	Primary cavity-nesting birds play a critical role in forest ecosystems by excavating cavities later used by other birds and mammals as nesting or roosting sites. Several species of cavity-nesting birds are non-migratory residents and consequently subject to winter conditions. We conducted winter bird counts from 1998 to 2000 to examine the abundance and habitat association of cavity-nesting birds in prescribed burned and unburned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands. Even though bird diversity indices did not differ between burned and unburned stands, species-specific bird abundance was associated with habitat variables in three burned and four unburned stands. Total cavity-nesting bird abundance was greater in burned stands. Most cavity-nesting birds were observed in mixed-species flocks. Individual species of these flocks were associated with different habitat variables within stands. Numbers of woodpeckers were significantly greater in burned stands and numbers of chickadees were significantly greater in unburned stands. Bark foragers such as woodpeckers (Picoides spp.) and pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea) were associated with fewer small trees and recently decayed snags and logs. Foliage gleaners such as the chickadees (Poecile spp.) were associated with small diameter snags. The juxtaposition of burned and unburned stands is important for individual birds reliant upon other members of a mixed-species flock and habitat heterogeneity within stands is important for maintaining a diverse cavity-nesting bird assemblage.

Gardali, Thomas; Holmes, Aaron L.; Small, Stacy L.; Nur, Nadav; Geupel, Geoffrey R.; Golet, Gregory H.				Restoration Ecology	14	3		391-403	September 2006	2006				English	0	22	Riparian vegetation along the Sacramento River-California's largest river-has been almost entirely lost, and several wildlife species have been extirpated or have declined as a result. Large-scale restoration efforts are focusing on revegetating the land with native plants. To evaluate restoration success, we conducted surveys of landbirds on revegetated and remnant riparian plots from 1993 to 2003. Our objectives were to estimate population trends of landbirds, compare abundance patterns over time between revegetated and remnant riparian forests, and evaluate abundance in relation to restoration age. Of the 20 species examined, 11 were increasing, 1 was decreasing (Lazuli Bunting (Passerina amoena)), and 8 showed no trend. The negative trend for Lazuli Bunting is consistent with information on poor reproductive success and with Breeding Bird Survey results. There was no apparent guild association common to species with increasing trends. Nine species were increasing on revegetated and remnant plots, four were increasing on revegetated plots only, three were increasing on remnant plots only, the Lazuli Bunting was decreasing on both, and three species were stable on both. Although many species were increasing at a faster rate on revegetated plots, their abundance did not reach that of the remnant plots. For revegetated plots, "year since planting" was a strong predictor of abundance trends for 13 species: positive for 12, negative for 1. Our study shows that restoration activities along the Sacramento River are successfully providing habitat for a diverse community of landbirds and that results from bird monitoring provide a meaningful way to evaluate restoration success.

Antbirds is a large group of mainly insectivorous Neotropical passerines, usually well represented in bird communities from forested landscapes in Neotropical region. Territory sizes for three Antbirds, Thamnophilus caerulescens (Vieillot, 1816) (Variable Antshrike), Dysithamnus mentalis (Temmink, 1823) (Plain Antvireo) e Pyriglena leucoptera (Vieillot, 1818) (White-shouldered Fire-eye), were mapped and their area estimated by the convex polygon method in a 50 ha forest fragment, in southeastern Brazil. The three species presented small territories of similar sizes (:5 2 ha) both during the non-reproductive and the reproductive seasons of 2000-2001. Territories overlapped considerably among species but not intraspecifically. Territory sizes increased with body mass of the three species studied (P. leucoptera > T. caerulescens > D. mentalis). We failed to find any effect on territory size for the three species associated with forest edge or distance to the dirt road.

Although species richness may temporarily increase in burned areas, this study suggests that multiple wildfires will lead to a decline in diversity over a large scale as birds of open fields replace interior forest specialists.

Hastings, Richard A.; Beattie, Andrew J.				Ecological Management & Restoration	7	2		105-112	August 2006	2006				English	0	3	Noisy Miners (Manorina melanocephala) are aggressive Australian honeyeaters that dominate many areas of remnant vegetation and forest edges from which they competitively exclude small birds. A similar domination can also occur in planted wildlife corridors. The aim of this study was to determine which corridor plantings encouraged the presence of small native birds in regions where Noisy Miners dominate. Six vegetation mixes were investigated in the main study: eucalypts with and without shrubby understorey; acacia with and without shrubby understorey; exotic conifer; and exotic deciduous trees. A supplementary study then examined sites with a mixture of eucalypt and acacia trees with a shrubby understorey. The findings showed that Noisy Miners dominated corridors of eucalypts, virtually excluding small birds, whereas native acacias, exotic conifer and exotic deciduous corridors had small birds and no resident Noisy Miners. The greatest abundance and richness of small birds occurred in plantings combining eucalypts with at least 15% acacias, in this case bipinnate species. Given these results, it is recommended that eucalypt plantings should be supplemented with both acacias (preferably bipinnate) and a shrubby understorey.

Stuart-Smith, A. Kari; Hayes, John P.; Schieck, Jim				Forest Ecology and Management	231	1-3		1-17	August 1 2006	2006				English	3	22	By emuLating natural disturbances like wildfire, managers hope to maintain biodiversity in managed forests. Leaving residual live trees in harvested areas is an important component of this strategy. However, the influence of this approach on songbird communities is largely unknown. We surveyed songbirds in 166 stands in the Rocky Mountains in BC, Canada, that had been logged or burned by wildfire. Stands were located in mid or high elevation biogeoclimatic zones, and varied from 7 to 45 years since disturbance and in density of residual trees from 0 to 320 conifer overstory, 0 to 832 conifer understory, and 0 to 68 broadleaf trees/ha. Although differences in bird communities between burned and logged stands of similar ages were detected, these differences were not consistent between biogeoclimatic zones, nor did they explain a large amount of the variation in bird communities. Logged stands had a higher density of birds, but expected species richness did not differ between logged and burned stands. All but a few rare species were detected in both disturbance types. Of 26 species analysed in detail, densities of 14 were greater in logged stands, 6 were greater in burned stands, and 6 were not significantly different between disturbance types. The bird community, bird abundance and densities of individual species were influenced by residual tree density and type. As time since disturbance increased, bird communities in burned and logged stands in the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir zone became more similar, but those in the Montane Spruce zone became less so, likely due to differences in residual tree density. Results suggest differences in bird communities in logged and burned stands >=7 years post-disturbance are mainly in abundance rather than community composition, but abundances of individual species can be significantly influenced by residual tree density and type. Managers can influence the abundance of some species in harvested areas by manipuLating the type and density of residual trees. [copyright] 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	Stuart-Smith, A.

S and N were highest in village and green corridor sites. S in urban plots ranged from 13 to 18 species, similar to farmland, but N was much lower in farmland. Marked differences in the number of individual species between plots were recorded. S and N were independent of age of development and area of gardens within plots but both were correlated with the area of greenspace. Greenspace alone and combined with gardens was correlated with the numbers of several individual species. The results are discussed in relation to proposed new large-scale housing developments in England.

Palmer, Grant C.; Bennett, Andrew F.				Biological Conservation	130	3		447-457	July 2006	2006				English	2	17	Riparian zones are a characteristic component of many landscapes throughout the world and increasingly are recognised as key areas for biodiversity conservation. Their importance for bird communities has been well recognised in semi-arid environments and in modified landscapes where there is a marked contrast between riparian and adjacent upslope vegetation. The value of riparian zones in largely intact landscapes with continuous vegetation cover is less well understood. In this study, birds were surveyed at 30 pairs of riparian and adjacent non-riparian sites in extensive mesic forests of the Victorian Highlands, Australia. Riparian sites were floristically distinct from non-riparian sites and had a more complex vegetation structure, including a mid-storey tree layer mostly absent from non-riparian sites. Bird assemblages at riparian sites had significantly greater richness, abundance and diversity of species than was recorded at adjacent non-riparian sites. Species composition also differed significantly between these habitat types. Compositional differences in assemblages were due to a suite of distinctive species in each habitat and to significant contrasts in the densities of species that occurred in both habitat types. Many species (36%) attained a significantly greater abundance in riparian habitats. The distinctiveness and richness of the riparian avifauna contribute to the diversity of continuous forest landscapes. The spatial patterning of the avifauna, the occurrence of complementary assemblages, the presence of rare species and the potential for riparian habitats to serve as refuges, all point to the value of riparian zones and highlight the importance of landscape-level planning and management for avifaunal conservation.

Woodley, Stephen J.; Johnson, Greg; Freedman, Bill; Kirk, David A.				Canadian Field-Naturalist	120	3		298-306	July-September 2006	2006				English	0	20	We studied the abundance of cavity-nesting birds in forestry-related habitats in a region of Acadian forest in New Brunswick. We examined five reference stands of natural forest, a chronosequence of conifer plantations up to 19 years old (the oldest in the study area), two selectively harvested stands, and a 30-year-old naturally regenerated clear-cut. The species richness and abundance of cavity-nesting birds were higher in reference forest (average 10.0 species per stand; 5.3 territories per 10 ha) than in plantations (2.3/stand: 1.0/10 ha), selectively harvested stands (7.0/stand; 3.8/10 ha), or the naturally regenerated clear-cut (5.0/stand; 2.5/10 ha). A cluster analysis segregated the "community" of cavity-nesting birds of natural forest from those of other treatments. Of the various harvested stands and plantations, five with a relatively large number of residual snags clustered similarly in the cluster analysis, while those with no or very few snags also clustered together. We used arrays of nest boxes (12 per stand) to examine whether the availability of cavities was limiting the use of habitats otherwise suitable for foraging by cavity-dependent species. Nest-box use for nesting and roosting was much higher in the seven plantations examined (average 4.0/10 ha for nesting and 2.9/10 ha for roosting) than in three reference stands (each 0.3/10 ha), suggesting that the plantations were deficient in this critical-habitat element. Our results suggest that certain mitigations, such as leaving residual snags and living cavity-trees, would help maintain populations of some cavity-dependent birds in clear-cuts and plantations. However, some cavity-dependent species might not be accommodated by these mitigations and are potentially at risk in intensively managed areas, unless landscape-scale management plans ensure the survival of sufficient areas of older mixed-wood forest.

Hanowski, JoAnn; Danz, Nick; Lind, Jim				Forest Ecology and Management	229	1-3		63-72	July 1 2006	2006				English	0	17	We examined response of breeding bird communities to varying levels of timber harvest in and around 16-forested seasonal ponds in northern Minnesota, USA. This experimental study employed a before-after-control-impact design with three different harvest treatments. Treatments were assigned randomly (n = 4 ponds/treatment) and were applied within 17 m wide buffers outward from the ponds' edge: clear-cut harvest (reduction of basal area to <2 m2/ha), partial cut harvest (reduction of basal area to 7-10 m2/ha), and no harvest (no cut). Forest stands around treatment buffers (n = 12) were clear-cut harvested (ranging from 6.5 to 12.5 ha). Ponds with no harvest in the adjacent forests (controls) or buffers surrounding the ponds (n = 4) were maintained throughout the 5-year study. Prior to harvest, we found no significant difference (P > 0.05) in bird community composition around seasonal ponds versus nearby forest habitat, suggesting that seasonal ponds do not affect bird community structure in a mature forest setting at this scale. Overall bird numbers and species richness increased (P < 0.05) in all pond buffers compared to controls over the 4 years after harvest. Increases in bird numbers on treated versus control pond buffers were found across all migration and nesting guilds, and among the forest edge guild. Bird community species composition also changed within the treated versus control pond buffers after harvest. Differences in bird communities among treatments were small the first year after harvest, but continued to diverge from controls over the 4 years after harvest. Bird communities of the clear-cut treatment were most dissimilar to controls. Both the partial and no cut buffer bird communities were more similar to the control than the clear-cut treatment. Treated pond buffers had more birds associated with early successional habitat. In contrast, many interior forest-associated bird species did not occur in any of the buffers after harvest. We found no difference in breeding bird community composition between pond buffers and other residual patches left on harvested sites, but there was a significant difference between harvest treatments when we combined pond buffer and residual patch birds on each site. Early successional habitat-associated bird species were more abundant in residual patches on sites that had a clear-cut pond buffer and forest-associated species were more abundant in residual patches on sites with no cut pond buffers. Habitat for mature forest-associated bird species can be maintained on harvest sites by leaving no cut or partial cut buffers around seasonal ponds or in similar sized residual patches in other areas of the harvest.

Landscape and Urban Planning	77	1-2		39-53	June 15 2006	2006				English	15	230	A functional network of green space is important for the maintenance of the ecological dimension of a sustainable urban landscape. We used avian ecological diversity as a proxy for evaluating the functionality of different types of urban green space. The urban landscape of the municipality of Orebro in Sweden was stratified into four strata (City centre, Residential, Greenway and Periphery). Bird species found in these strata were classified into four ecological groups with decreasing degree of specialisation (woodpeckers, hole-nesters, forest birds and urban birds). Overall there was lower bird species richness in the City centre and Residential areas compared to the Greenway and Periphery. Woodpeckers, hole-nesters and forest birds showed an increasing trend in the number of species as well as individuals from the City centre to the Periphery while urban birds showed the opposite trend. The amount and quality of green space as well as natural vegetation increased from the City centre to the Periphery. Species richness of woodpeckers, forest birds and hole-nesters were positively correlated with tree density while urban birds showed an inverse correlation. There was no dead wood in City centre, Residential and Greenway in contrast to the Periphery, which held some dying trees, stumps and old windthrows. Our findings emphasise the importance of urban green space with natural structures to maintain high ecological diversity. Finally, we discuss how conflicts between habitat for biodiversity maintenance and other functions of green space could be handled by zoning. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our research was undertaken between January 2002 and July 2004 at the Reserva Ducke, near Manaus (02[degree]55[minute], 03[degree]01[minute]S; 59[degree]53[minute],59[degree]59[minute]W) in central Amazonia, to verify how the forest structure affects the occurrence and abundance of two bird species: the Plain-brown Woodcreeper Dendrocincla fuliginosa and the White-chinned Woodcreeper Dendrocincla merula. Bird species occurrence was recorded using lines of 20 mist-nets (one sample unit), along 511-km transects distributed along, 9 parallel 8 kin trails covering an area of 6400 ha. Along these transects, we placed 50 x 50m plots where we recorded forest structure components (tree abundance, canopy openness, leaf litter, standing dead trees, logs, proximity to streams, and altitude). We then related these variables to bird occurrence and abundance using multiple logistic and multiple linear regression models, respectively. We found that D. fuliginosa frequently used plateau areas being more abundant in areas with more trees. On the other hand, D. merula Occurred more frequently and was more abundant in areas with low tree abundance. Our results suggest iliac although both species overlap in the reserve (both were recorded in at least 68% of the sampled sites). they differ in the way they use the forest microhabitats. help to maintain Therefore, local variation in the forest structure may contribute to the coexistence of congeneric species and may local alpha diversity.

Skorka, Piotr; Martyka, Rafal; Wojcik, Joanna D.				Acta Ornithologica (Warsaw)	41	1		49-54	Summer 2006	2006				English	0	16	The aim of the study was to compare different habitat types according to species richness and estimate their value for total species richness at a landscape level. The study was carried out in the years 1995-2001 in the Tarnow region (1400 km2, S Poland). All bird species were classified according to broadly defined breeding habitat type. Four main, easily distinguishable habitat types were specified: forests (18% of the area), open areas (70%), wetlands (1%) and anthropogenic areas (11%). Birds were classified as habitat specialists if they bred in only one habitat type, or as habitat generalists, if they bred in two or more habitat types. Altogether, 151 species nested in the study area, and a total of 87 species were habitat specialists. There were statistically more endangered species (so called "losers") among the habitat specialists than in the habitat generalists' group. Habitat specialists were also statistically less abundant than habitat generalists. The following numbers of species were recorded in the specific habitats: forests - 70, open areas 75, wetlands - 61, anthropogenic areas - 46. Among these, the percentages of habitat specialists were the following: forests - 41.4%, open areas - 18.7%, wetlands - 52.5%, anthropogenic areas - 26.1%. It was found that the numbers of species inhabiting the various habitat types differed from the number to be expected on the basis of their area. This was especially apparent in the case of wetlands, which constituted only a small part of the total area, but as many as 32 species (21.1% of all) occurred only there. For conservation purposes, wetlands appear to play the most important role in shaping species richness in the landscape studied here. However, each habitat type contained some species that were not noted in other habitats.

O'Reilly, Lindsay; Ogada, Darcy; Palmer, Todd M.; Keesing, Felicia				African Journal of Ecology	44	2		165-170	June 2006	2006				English	0	25	Fire is an important determinant of many aspects of savanna ecosystem structure and function. However, relatively little is known about the effects of fire on faunal biodiversity in savannas. We conducted a short-term study to examine the effects of a replicated experimental burn on bird diversity and abundance in savanna habitat of central Kenya. Twenty-two months after the burn, Shannon diversity of birds was 32% higher on plots that had been burned compared with paired control plots. We observed no significant effects of burning on total bird abundance or species richness. Several families of birds were found only on plots that had been burned; one species, the rattling cisticola (Cisticola chiniana), was found only on unburned plots. Shrub canopy area was negatively correlated with bird diversity on each plot, and highly correlated with grass height and the abundance of orthopterans. Our results suggest that the highest landscape-level bird diversity might be obtained through a mosaic of burned and unburned patches. This is also most likely to approximate the historical state of bird diversity in this habitat, because patchy fires have been an important natural disturbance in tropical ecosystems for millennia.

Thiollay, Jean-Marc				Biodiversity and Conservation	15	7		2085-2108	June 2006	2006				English	0	44	The impacts of human pressure, habitat changes, and efficiency of conservation measures on the non-passerine bird community were assessed in the Sudanian belt of Burkina Faso. Three regions with increasingly large protected areas and higher conservation status were compared. In each region, natural savanna woodlands were also compared to traditionally cultivated areas. Six groups of diurnal raptors and six groups of other large bird species were counted along 167 5-km transect counts during the dry season. Within savanna woodlands, the only significant and consistent declines from the little disturbed Eastern National Parks to the more populated and exploited Western forest reserves were those of the largest terrestrial game birds (Guinea fowl, Bustard, Ground Hornbill), eagles and vultures, which became virtually extinct in the least protected areas. Although some species groups maintained substantial, if not higher populations in cultivated areas (rollers, non-game terrestrial birds, several raptors), the overall abundance of both raptor and non-raptor species declined markedly (50-65%) from natural savanna woodlands to tree-dotted cultivated and fallow fields. Again large game birds, eagles and vultures were absent from every agricultural areas censused. Yet, all of them were still commonly recorded in the same natural and cultivated areas during surveys I conducted in the same regions from 1968 to 1973. The main factors correlated with large bird extinctions or declines from national parks to mere forest reserves and from natural woodlands to fields were first related to hunting, then to habitat degradation and fragmentation through intensive cattle grazing and wood cutting and extension of cultivated areas.

Walker, Jonathan S.				Biological Conservation	130	1		60-69	June 2006	2006				English	0	17	Relatively few studies have focussed on the relationship between resource use and rarity. Rare species could differ from common species in two ways: rare species may utilise resources that are themselves rarer or rare species may utilise a narrower range of resources than common species (i.e., they are more specialised). I investigated the relationship between local abundance and patterns of food resource use for an assemblage of 19 frugivorous birds in the tropical lowland rain forest of Sulawesi, Indonesia. Over a 10-month period I collected data on two measures of rarity, the local abundance and monthly variability in local abundance of each bird species, together with data on their feeding ecology including dietary specialisation, resource availability, resource overlap and habitat use. These measures produced 18 ecological variables, 17 of which 1 correlated with the two measures of rarity using univariate correlations and minimum adequate multiple regression models. These were carried out using the original data and independent contrasts that controlled for potential phylogenetic bias. Both measures of rarity were most strongly correlated with measures of resource availability. In both the original data and independent contrasts regression models of the temporal variability in bird abundance, only temporal fruit availability was included as a significant predictor. in the regression models of bird abundance, the strongest significant predictor was the amount of rare fruit in the diet (a negative relationship). Both models also included measures of resource specialisation, however, these were not significant in the absence of the measure of resource availability. On Sulawesi, rare frugivorous birds utilise rare resources. Specialisation, however, might be an important factor in species persistence once they become rare. The generality of the findings need to be tested. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sheep, voles, forestry and nature conservation in the British uplands.		Evans, Darren M.; Redpath, Stephen M.; Elston, David A.; Evans, Sharon A.; Mitchell, Ruth J.; Dennis, Peter				Journal of Applied Ecology	43	3		499-505	June 2006	2006				English	8	103	1. The British uplands are internationally important for their unique plant and bird communities. They have considerable economic, nature conservation, landscape, aesthetic and tourism-related value and as a result are under a variety of different pressures, most notably from sheep farming, shooting interests, commercial forestry and conservation interests.2. In order to optimize biodiversity in the uplands, the challenge is to find how to balance the different land-use pressures. One key upland species that is potentially affected by livestock grazing, and is of considerable interest to both foresters and nature conservationists, is the field vole Microtus agrestis. Relaxation of livestock grazing can result in an increase in vole numbers. This in turn could have both positive and negative implications for biodiversity as (i) field voles are a major source of prey for other species and (ii) they are a cause of damage to newly planted trees and potentially damaging in areas of native woodland regeneration.3. A replicated, randomized block experiment, consisting of six replicates of four livestock grazing treatments, was established in 2003 (with baseline data collected in 2002). This enabled us to examine the effects of livestock grazing on field vole abundance.4. We have demonstrated experimentally for the first time that livestock grazing pressure affects the abundance of field voles (as measured by a vole sign index) in the uplands. In the first year of the experiment, immediate treatment effects were detectable, with a lower abundance of voles in the conventionally grazed treatment compared with those in the ungrazed treatment, and with intermediate vole abundances in the lightly grazed treatments. The significant treatment effects became more apparent in 2004, with a higher abundance of voles in the extensively grazed mixed treatment (i.e. sheep and cattle) than in the extensively grazed treatment that contained only sheep.5. Synthesis and applications. In order to maximize biodiversity in the uplands, our results suggest that low intensity livestock grazing, used in a novel ways, could be a useful management tool to reduce vole abundance (and hence subsequent tree damage) compared with excluding livestock from young plantations completely. Furthermore, vole abundance would be higher at low grazing intensity compared with conventional stocking rates, thus still providing food for raptors and other vole-eating vertebrates. Indeed, low-intensity sheep and mixed livestock grazing might improve prey availability as a direct consequence of increased heterogeneity in vegetation structure. Our results suggest that it may be possible to maintain the open character of moorland habitats, and benefit key upland species generally, by reducing sheep grazing pressure and introducing low-intensity mixed livestock grazing throughout the uplands.

Donnelly, Roarke; Marzluff, John M.				Urban Ecosystems	9	2		99-117	June 2006	2006				English	0	32	Urbanization reduces the quantity of native vegetation and alters its local structure and regional spatial pattern. These changes cause local extirpations of bird species associated with native vegetation and increases in the abundance and number of bird species associated with human activity. We used 54-1 km2 landscapes in the Seattle, Washington, USA metropolitan area to determine (1) the relative importance of habitat quantity, structure, and pattern to bird diversity and abundance and (2) whether housing developments can be managed to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on forest bird diversity. In general, bird species richness was high and many native forest species were retained where urban landcover comprised less than 52% of the landscape, tree density (especially that of evergreens) remained at least 9.8 trees/ha in developments, and forest was at least 64% aggregated across the landscape. These results suggest that the quantity, structure, and pattern of forested habitat affected breeding bird diversity in urbanizing landscapes. However, habitat pattern appeared less influential than other habitat attributes when results from all community- and population-level analyses were considered. Conservation of native birds in reserves can be supplemented by managing the amount, composition, structural complexity, and-to a lesser extent-arrangement of vegetation in neighborhoods.

Stober, Jonathan M.; Krementz, David G.				Wilson Journal of Ornithology	118	2		138-144	June 2006	2006				English	2	7	Using radiotelemetry, we studied variation in home-range size of the Bachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) at the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, during the 1995 breeding season. At SRS, sparrows occurred primarily in two habitats: mature pine habitats managed for Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) and pine plantations 1 to 6 years of age. The mean 95% minimum convex polygon home-range size for males and females combined (n = 14) was 2.95 ha [plus or minus] 0.57 SE, across all habitats. Mean homerange size for males in mature pine stands (4.79 ha [plus or minus] 0.27, n = 4) was significantly larger than that in 4-year-old (3.00 ha [plus or minus] 0.31, n = 3) and 2-year-old stands (1.46 ha [plus or minus] 0.31, it = 3). Home-range sizes of paired males and females (it = 4 pairs) were similar within habitat type; mean distances between consecutive locations differed by habitat type and sex. We hypothesize that a gradient in food resources drives home-range dynamics.

Paquet, Jean-Yves; Vandevyvre, Xavier; Delahaye, Laurence; Rondeux, Jacques				Forest Ecology and Management	227	1-2		59-70	May 15 2006	2006				English	1	31	Although considered by some as a less "ecologically suitable" forestry model than "near-natural" stand management, even-aged plantation forest management, with regeneration procedure involving clearcutting, creates temporary habitat for many early-successional birds. The present study addresses the question of the conservation value for birds of clearcutting-related open areas in European temperate forest, in the context of a mixed woodland-farmland landscape. The point count technique was used to census the breeding birds on 300 sampling plots, distributed in the eight main habitat types of the Ardenne region (southern Belgium), including agricultural land, edge habitats, closed forest habitats and open areas in forest. Most of these open areas in forest derive from clearcutting practices, rapidly planted with young Norway Spruce (Picea abies). We quantified the conservation value of a given habitat type by using a "conservation value index", integrating the frequency of occurrence of each species in the considered habitat and their conservation status in Europe or in southern Belgium. Both conservation value index and species richness were higher for edge habitats and open areas in forest, compared to forest interior and agricultural land. Detrended Correspondence Analysis of the plot species lists showed that bird assemblages from open area in forest are not intermediate between forest and agricultural open land, as opposed to external edge habitats. Hence, open areas in forest do not contain bird assemblages composed of forest species mixed with colonizing agricultural species but rather shelter specific bird assemblages. An Indicator Species analysis further emphasized this specificity and identified seven species, which, in the Ardenne context, form a group of species specific to open areas in forest. Due to major changes of land use in the Ardenne during the 20th century, which leads to a tremendous decrease of moor, heath and fallow land areas, clearcut openings in the plantation forest progressively gained high conservation value at the regional scale. Further studies about habitat requirement of the conservation interest species inhabiting these open areas is needed, including a better understanding of how early-successional species react to forest planning. If plantation forestry evolves to an uneven-aged and more permanently closed forest, then other options, including semi-natural habitat restoration, are urgently required to save early-successional bird communities.

Schieck, Jim; Song, Samantha J.				Canadian Journal of Forest Research	36	5		1299-1318	May 2006	2006				English	1	52	Within boreal forests of western North America, the dominant large-scale natural disturbance is wildfire. Thus, harvesting that is as similar as possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities. We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds) from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies. Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a single forest type.

Antos, Mark J.; Fitzsimons, James A.; Palmer, Grant C.; White, John G.				Austral Ecology	31	2		254-261	April 2006	2006				English	2	19	Introduced birds are a pervasive and dominant element of urban ecosystems. We examined the richness and relative abundance of introduced bird species in small (1-5 ha) medium (6-15 ha) and large (>15 ha) remnants of native vegetation within an urban matrix. Transects were surveyed during breeding and non-breeding seasons. There was a significant relationship between introduced species richness and remnant size with larger remnants supporting more introduced species. There was no significant difference in relative abundance of introduced species in remnants of different sizes. Introduced species, as a proportion of the relative abundance of the total avifauna (native and introduced species), did not vary significantly between remnants of differing sizes. There were significant differences in the composition of introduced bird species between the different remnant sizes, with large remnants supporting significantly different assemblages than medium and small remnants. Other variables also have substantial effects on the abundance of introduced bird species. The lack of significant differences in abundance between remnant sizes suggests they were all equally susceptible to invasion. No patches in the urban matrix are likely to be unaffected by introduced species. The effective long-term control of introduced bird species is difficult and resources may be better spent managing habitat in a way which renders it less suitable for introduced species (e.g. reducing areas of disturbed ground and weed dominated areas).

This study analyses how forest management determines the local distribution of the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) and black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) and its relationship with the type, structure and size of the stands used for nesting by both species, as well as their dead wood requirements. The most suitable nesting habitat of both species is the mature forest (stands of regular large final crop trees), but the size of the mature fragments and a minimum quantity of dead wood is also important.

Brawn, Jeffrey D.				Conservation Biology	20	2		460-469	April 2006	2006				English	2	68	Efforts to restore and maintain oak savannas in North America, with emphasis on the use of prescribed fire, have become common. Little is known, however, about how restoration affects animal populations, especially those of birds. I compared the breeding densities, community structure, and reproductive success of birds in oak savannas maintained by prescribed fire (12 sites) with those in closed-canopy forests (13 sites). All sampling was conducted in Illinois (U.S.A.). Of the 31 bird species analyzed, 12 were more common in savannas, 14 were not affected by habitat structure, and 5 were more common in forest habitat. The species favored by disturbance and restoration included Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), Mourning Doves ( Zenaida macroura), Red-headed Woodpeckers ( Melanerpes erythrocephalus), Indigo Buntings ( Passerina cyanea), and Baltimore Orioles (Icterus galbula). Those more common in closed-canopy forest included Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Wood Thrushes ( Hylocichla mustelina). Few species were unique to one type of habitat, but overall avian community structure in oak savannas and closed-canopy forests was generally distinctive. Estimates of nesting success (derived from 785 nests) revealed that 6 of the 13 species considered experienced greater productivity in the savanna habitat. Rates of brood parasitism were unaffected by restoration and habitat structure. Within savannas, tract size had little effect on breeding abundances and reproductive success. My results illustrate that restoration techniques can significantly affect the ecology of constituent animal populations and communities and have key implications regarding avian conservation and the management of forest habitat in fragmented landscapes. Small patches of forest habitat that regularly function as population sinks may offer far better prospects for birds if they are subjected to disturbance and ecosystem restoration.

Bani, Luciano; Massimino, Dario; Bottoni, Luciana; Massa, Renato				Conservation Biology	20	2		512-526	April 2006	2006				English	0	37	Our purpose was to define a quantitative and expeditious method to analyze the effects of processes that influence species distribution and abundance at different organizational scales. We considered habitat loss, the breaking apart of habitat patches, and habitat structural alteration critical processes that affect species distribution and abundance. We evaluated the effects of these processes by considering the response of selected indicator species to isolation (landscape scale), patch size and edge effect (patch scale), and habitat structure (plot scale). We used broadleaf forests as our case-study ecosystem and birds as indicator species. Faunal data came from a georeferenced, long-term, breeding-bird database, and environmental data were obtained from field surveys and land-use digital cartography. Birds, grouped according to their sensitivity to patch isolation, patch size, edge effect, and habitat structure, indicated how environmental conditions affected species abundance. The most sensitive group to the above-mentioned processes included the Marsh Tit (Parus palustris), Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), and Short-toed Treecreeper (Certhia brachydactyla). We evaluated the umbrella effect of these species for the conservation of the other co-occurring birds and found that their effectiveness varied according to the criterion used to select sites for protection. Site selection based on indicator species identified forest patches with greater species abundance than an alternative criterion that chose sites based on patch isolation and size, edge effect, and forest structure. The alternative criterion, although not as efficient as indicator species, may nevertheless be useful and effective for conservation when faunal data are lacking and guidelines for habitat management or restoration are needed. Our method is applicable to other ecosystems and taxa because the processes we considered occur in many ecosystems and may have significant effects on species from all taxonomic groups.

Paracuellos, Mariano				Ardea	94	1		87-98	Spring 2006	2006				English	3	20	Correlations of richness and distribution of passerines were studied in a complex of 40 vegetation patches dominated by Common Reed Phragmites australis (0.05-28.66 ha) in south-eastern Spain. Fourteen morphological, hydrological and vegetative parameters of the reed beds, as well as characteristics of the avian species, were quantified to identify variables related to the occupation of the reed beds by passerines. Variables related to habitat patchiness and structural complexity of emergent vegetation were the best predictors of avian species richness, but their importance changed seasonally. Spatial configuration (size, perimeter and isolation) of the reed beds was the best predictor in winter, and the vegetative complexity was best during the breeding period. The capacity of passerines to occupy habitat patches in space and time was linked to species abundance. Differences in abundance among the various bird species appeared to favour the order of disappearance in the complex when the reed beds lost species richness ('nested' pattern). The results highlight the need for the conservation, restoration, or creation of large heterogeneous and non-isolated reed beds to maintain the greatest number of bird species that depend on these scarce and ecologically valuable habitats.

Barlow, J.; Peres, C.A.; Henriques, L.M.P.; Stouffer, P.C.; Wunderle, J.M.				Biological Conservation	128	2		182-192	March 2006	2006				English	4	64	We combine mist-net data from 24 disturbance treatments taken from seven studies on the responses of understorey Amazonian birds to selective logging, single and recurrent wildfires, and habitat fragmentation. The different disturbance treatments had distinct effects on avian guild structure, and fire disturbance and the isolation of forest patches resulted in bird communities that were most divergent from those in continuous, undisturbed forest in terms of their species composition. Although low-intensity logging treatments had the least noticeable effects, the composition of understorey birds was still markedly different from the composition in undisturbed forest. This analysis demonstrates the importance of preventing habitat fragmentation and the spread of fires in humid tropical forests, and highlights the need for more research to determine the long-term suitability of large areas of degraded forest for forest birds.

Ochrona obszarow wodno-blotnych w parkach narodowych.	Denisiuk, Malgorzata; Denisiuk, Zygmunt				Chronmy Przyrode Ojczysta	62	2		3-27	Marzec-Kwiecien 2006	2006				Polish	0	0	National parks in Poland have been treated as the most important and the most efficient form of nature conservation. In 23 national parks major geographic regions and landscape zones are represented. They are characterized by high diversity of vegetation and animal life. In total 354 plant associations including 269 non-forest communities, mostly represented by water-swamp phytocoenoses, were recorded. Amongst 70 associations of endemic range type there are 11 bog and fen phytocoenoses. In parks 184 vascular plant species are under law protection as well as 44 endemic taxa are protected. There are representatives of all living mammalians, ca. 200 bird species and numerous reptiles, amphibians and fish species as well as a few thousands of insects and other invertebrates. Each national park protects non-forest areas, including water and swamp habitats referred as bogs and wetlands which are environs of rush-sedge, fen and aquatic communities. Of 23 national parks 7 parks are distinguished in which contribution of non-forest areas amounts to more than 40% (on the average 72%) and 7 other parks with smaller area of non-forest vegetation (ca. 30%). In remaining national parks role of non-forest areas is secondary or minimal (tab. 1 and 3). The participation of swamp and water habitats is considerably higher in lowland national parks and there woodiness is lower. However, mountain parks, generally rich in non-woodland vegetation (montane glades and alpine meadows) are characterized by poverty of water and swamp ecosystems (tab. 3). Practical methods of protection of wetland areas must take into account type of vegetation communities, their current state of preservation in natural habitats, and degree of anthropogenic transformations. In the management plans which comprise partial and strict protection also diversity of water and swamp areas and their ecological characteristics (water bodies, head-waters, streams and rivers, fens, transitional mires and bog, desiccated wetlands) should be taken into account and specific methods of their protection ought to be applied. Using particular protection methods of wetland environs one should remember that they are habitats of specific fauna which represent precious value in functioning of natural systems which undoubtedly are national parks.

Diaz, Leticia				Forest Ecology and Management	223	1-3		54-65	March 1 2006	2006				English	0	42	Complex vegetation structure and floristic composition heterogeneity increase niche diversity, which is thought to also increase avian diversity. Woodland avifauna from the Sieff a de Guadarrama, Madrid, was studied during spring 2003 to test whether floristic composition and structure of mixed oak-pine forests provided a suitable environment to sustain a specialized avian community that differed in species composition from those of pure pinewoods and oak woodlands. Habitat selection patterns of each species, as well as the intensity with which they selected their preferred habitat were also studied. Bird species richness was significantly higher in mixed oak-pine forests than in pinewoods, whereas differences in avian abundance among the three forest types were not clear. No species preferred or exclusively used mixed transitions. Therefore, slight increases in avian abundance and species richness within mixed forests were explained through the assemblage of both typical oakwood and pinewood avifauna. The results are discussed in the context of the general impoverishment of Nearctic-Palaearctic bird species in the southwestern Palaearctic margin, and the high spatiotemporal fluctuations that mixed transitions have suffered since the Quaternary period. The results highlighted the importance of forest maturity, low altitudinal position of forests and, diversity and development (cover and height) of the shrub layer for forest birds in the region.

Ludwick, Timothy J.; Murphy, Robert K.				Prairie Naturalist	38	1		1-11	March 2006	2006				English	0	4	Prescribed fire is among key tools for restoring and managing prairies in the northern Great Plains, yet there are no published reports of its impacts on grassland passerine birds on native prairie in the Drift Plain, a major physiographic subregion. We examined relationships between prescribed fire history and abundance and habitat of breeding passerines in Drift Plain prairie at Des Lacs National Wildlife National Refuge in northwestern North Dakota. In 2003, we used point counts (n = 79 75 m radius plots) to survey bird abundance on 16 management units that had been prescribe-burned one to three times each since 1992. General habitat composition and structure also were measured at each point count plot. We detected 14 passerine species, six of which were common (occurred on greater than 10 % of plots). Three endemic, historically common passerine species were rare or absent regardless of fire history. Abundances of common bird species were not influenced strongly by fire history, which contrasts with data from research on the adjacent Missouri Coteau physiographic subregion. Vegetation structure (litter depth and plant height-density) and occurrence of an exotic grass species, smooth brome (Bromus inermis), decreased with fire history. However, we detected no relationships between bird species abundances and these particular vegetation variables, perhaps because smooth brome continued to be a pervasive structural influence on all management units. Our findings indicate a need for better understanding of bird-fire relationships on remnant prairies in the vast Drift Plain.

The results of the survey of Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), Green Woodpecker (Picus viridis), Grey Woodpecker (Picus canus), Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (Dryobates minor), Stock Dove (Columba oenas), Jackdaw (Coloeus monedula) and Raven (Corvus corax) are presented in this paper together with results of a special survey of the Grey Woodpecker in parts of the forest (3,010 ha) in 2005. Compared to other study sites Black and Green Woodpecker, Stock Dove and Raven show a high abundance. The population of the Grey Woodpecker seems to be the largest known in Lower Saxony. Investigated threats to the typical forest species are habitat losses because of intensive forest management, especially in old oak tree stands in the private parts of the forest. The conservation status as landscape protection area and the forest management clearly do not meet the importance of the area for the conservation of the typical forest species. Because of the high abundance of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker (452 breeding pairs in 2004) and the Grey Woodpecker (minimum of 30 breeding pairs in 2005) the whole forest should be protected as Special Protected Area (SPA) following the European Bird Directive.

A group of species such as Sturnus cineraceus and Columba livia were more frequently observed in sparser woodlands. These species are not typically categorized as woodland species, and they preferred mixed habitat of tree-covered vegetation and open areas. The birds of another group, including Streptopelia orientalis and Lanius bucephalus, which tend to use tree crowns as foraging habitat were more frequently observed in the woodlands surrounded by agricultural areas rather than in those surrounded by urbanized areas. This could be because those species can move across agricultural areas, but not urban areas, so that the effect of woodland isolation is not very remarkable for them when agricultural areas surrounded woodlands. On the other hand, some species preferred open area to vegetated area. A mixture of open space and woodlands would result in woodlands of reduced value for these woodland birds. Site planning that reduces the degree of interspersion should be adopted, if woodland habitat is to be conserved or restored. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Monterrubio-Rico, Tiberio C.; Escalante-Pliego, Patricia				Biological Conservation	128	1		67-78	February 2006	2006				English	0	21	A considerable number of bird species depend on tree cavities availability for nesting in temperate and tropical forests in Mexico. Tree cavity availability is reduced in heavily managed forests, making cavity nesting species particularly vulnerable to the high rates of forest loss and degradation that occur every day in the remaining wilderness areas of the country. We analyzed information about nesting behavior, distribution, and conservation status of resident landbird avifauna from 35 important and protected bird areas of Mexico. The main intention was to determine the proportion of resident bird species that nest in tree cavities and are more sensitive to intensive forest management practices. Our results revealed that 17% (112 species) of the resident landbird avifauna need tree cavities for nesting. Cavity nesters represented a higher proportion of endangered and threatened species than non-cavity nesters. The families Strigidae and Psittacidae represented the highest number of tree cavity nesting species in status. In the 35 avifaunas examined, the mean percentage of cavity nesting species ranged from 17% to 21%. The cloud forest reserve of "El Triunfo" with 43 species, is the area with the highest concentration of cavity nesting species in Mexico. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Burhans, Dirk E.; Thompson, Frank R., III				Ecological Applications	16	1		394-405	February 2006	2006				English	2	32	Many studies have examined differences in avian community composition between urban and rural habitats, but few, if any, have looked at nesting success of urban shrubland birds in a replicated fashion while controlling for habitat. We tested factors affecting nest survival, parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), and species abundance in shrubland habitat in rural and urban landscapes. We found no support for our hypothesis that nest survival was lower in urban landscapes, but strong support for the hypothesis that survival increased with nest height. We found strong support for our hypothesis that cowbird parasitism was greater in urban than rural landscapes; parasitism in urban sites was at least twice that of rural sites. We found strong support for an urban landscape effect on abundance for several species; Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Brown-headed Cowbirds were more abundant in urban landscapes, whereas Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla) and Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora pinus) were more abundant in rural sites. There was support for lower abundances of Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea) and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) with increased housing density. For six other species, edge and trail density or vegetation parameters best explained abundance. Lower abundances and greater parasitism in habitat patches in urban landscapes are evidence that, for some species, these urban landscapes do not fulfill the same role as comparable habitats in rural landscapes. Regional bird conservation planning and local habitat management in urban landscapes may need to consider these effects in efforts to sustain bird populations at regional and local scales.

Fleming-Singer, Maia S.; Horne, Alexander J.				Ecological Engineering	26	2		147-166	February 1 2006	2006				English	0	23	The San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary (SJWS), Irvine, CA, is a 32 ha series of shallow ponds created to maximize nitrate removal rates while maintaining 90% open water and episodically exposed shoreline for avian habitat. Design elements created non-ideal denitrification conditions by diminishing an organic carbon source (emergent vegetation) and increasing sediment exposure to oxygen. SJWS aqueous nitrogen and avian data (1999-2002) were analyzed to discern whether design and operating conditions allowed for simultaneous nitrate removal and diverse, abundant avian habitat. Average TIN removal efficiency was 80% while average TN removal efficiency was 60%; the difference reflects Org-N production in the marsh. Based on Chl-a measurements, roughly 40% of Org-N produced in the system was present as algae. The highest annual nitrate removal rates occurred April-May (350-500 mg/m2/d) and September-October (250-425 mg/m2/d). First order rate constants ranged 30.7-47.5 m year-1. Seasonal plantings of barnyard grass (Echinocloa crus-galli) were intended to serve as a carbon amendment for denitrification, however, there was no difference in nitrate removal between amended and non-amended conditions, likely because data averaging obscured a small, localized enhancement signal. Average avian species richness was high, ranging between 65 and 76 species month-1, while average relative abundance was mid-range, at 65-83 birds ha-1 month-1. Birds observed included common and rare species. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mazerolle, Marc J.; Poulin, Monique; Lavoie, Claude; Rochefort, Line; Desrochers, Andre; Drolet, Bruno				Freshwater Biology	51	2		333-350	February 2006	2006				English	5	100	1. Peatlands have suffered great losses following drainage for agriculture, forestry, urbanisation, or peat mining, near inhabited areas. We evaluated the faunal and vegetation patterns after restoration of a peatland formerly mined for peat. We assessed whether bog pools created during restoration are similar to natural bog pools in terms of water chemistry, vegetation structure and composition, as well as amphibian and arthropod occurrence patterns.2. Both avian species richness and peatland vegetation cover at the site increased following restoration. Within bog pools, however, the vegetation composition differed between natural and man-made pools. The cover of low shrubs, Sphagnum moss, submerged, emergent and floating vegetation in man-made pools was lower than in natural pools, whereas pH was higher than in typical bog pools. Dominant plant species also differed between man-made and natural pools.3. Amphibian tadpoles, juveniles and adults occurred more often in man-made pools than natural bog pools. Although some arthropods, including Coleoptera bog specialists, readily colonised the pools, their abundance was two to 26 times lower than in natural bog pools. Plant introduction in bog pools, at the stocking densities we applied, had no effect on the occurrence of most groups.4. We conclude that our restoration efforts were partially successful. Peatland-wide vegetation patterns following restoration mimicked those of natural peatlands, but 4 years were not sufficient for man-made pools to fully emulate the characteristics of natural bog pools.

Robertson, Peter; Silveira, Charles; Coventry, John; Eyles, Don; Williams, Amanda; Sluiter, Ian				Parks Victoria Technical Series	31			i-ix, 1-84	February 2006	2006				English	0	7	During December 2002, a wildfire burnt approximately 189,360 ha within the central and northern areas of the Big Desert in north-western Victoria. As part of the approved rehabilitation plan, a requirement was to examine the effects of the fire on selected and threatened birds, mammals and reptiles, in order to guide appropriate management actions Some historical information was available from survey work conducted by the Fisheries and Wildlife Division between 1985 and 1987 - twenty sites from that survey were within the vicinity of the 2002 fire. It was decided, therefore, to re-examine in detail the fauna of these twenty sites, in December 2003 and February 2004, as well as to establish some additional sites. Two over-riding objectives were: to compare the vertebrate fauna present in the northwest of the Big Desert in 2003/04 with that recorded in 1985/87; and to compare the fauna present within burnt areas 12 months after the December 2002 fire with that of adjacent unburnt areas. Fourteen species of mammal, including four introduced taxa, are known from the study area. The reptile fauna included seven species of snake and 27 lizard species - it is likely that this represents nearly the complete lizard fauna of the study area, with the exception of the Heath Monitor, known from the south of the Big Desert but not found during the survey, and the Heath Skink, which was found during the survey and appears to have a very localised distribution in the central south of the Big Desert. Of particular note was the discovery during the 2003/04 survey of the threatened Mallee Worm-Lizard (Aprasia aurita) in the north of the study area - it was previously known only from the eastern fringe of the Big Desert. Only three species of frog (family Myobatrachidae) are known from the area. Eighty-one bird species were recorded, including the threatened Malleefowl, Regent Parrot, Mallee Emuwren and Red-lored Whistler. With only two sample points in time (1985/87 and 2003/04), it was difficult to confidently attribute the observed differences in species occurrences to the effects of time (with its concomitant changes in vegetation succession), or to the effects of the recent fire - both may contribute to some of the observed changes. Furthermore, natural fluctuations in species abundance (and/or detectability) may occur, in response to factors such as long-term weather patterns, such as the recent protracted drought. However, some generalisations on the short-term post-fire responses of the vertebrate fauna are presented below. Some rare and localised/specialised bird species (e.g. Mallee Emu-wren, Striated Grasswren and Red-lored Whistler) were not found post-fire - their future in the burnt area is uncertain. Low mobility, localised or high site-fidelity species are probably dependent on their habitat patches remaining unburnt - or some may be able to move into small unburnt patches, with subsequent recolonisation over time, provided that source populations are available. The responses of other species were variable, with increases or decreases apparent in populations. Many may be able to survive in unburnt patches and then recolonise/increase populations as habitat becomes suitable. Others have the capacity to move over larger distances, to recolonise later. Many birds may be more mobile than other vertebrates, with the capacity to move in or out of fire areas - although there must be habitat elsewhere for them to move to and from. The effects of fire on some species may extend to adjacent nonburnt areas, if these remaining areas of habitat are too small to maintain viable populations until the burnt areas recover - such may be the case with the Malleefowl. Some small mammal species were not found post-fire. Their populations may be extremely small in the study area, or they may have been excluded. Their recovery will depend upon their capacity to either increase populations as habitat conditions change, or to recolonise from source populations elsewhere. The responses of reptiles to fire are likely to be variable. Burrowing species may be able to survive the fire - their subsequent recovery will depend upon their ability to survive in the changed conditions after the fire. Non-burrowing species are likely to be killed during fire, with the subsequent recovery of their populations probably dependent upon their capacity for recolonisation from unburnt patches. Artificial barriers to movement may inhibit recolonisation. The overriding aim of management of the Big Desert, an area where conservation values are acknowledged as the primary consideration, must be to maintain long-term ecological function and biodiversity. Determining how best to achieve this aim is, however, extremely problematic. Obviously, one of the major forces driving this ecosystem is fire. The biota of the Big Desert is adapted to fire, and relies on it to maintain long-term ecological function. The timing, location, size and intensity of fire will influence how this biota responds. Current and past 'European' management has concentrated on fire 'protection' and 'suppression', with an emphasis on protection of human assets and infrastructure around the margins of the desert, often with little cognisance of the effects such a strategy may be having on conservation values within the Big Desert ecosystem. It appears that past fire management practices have brought about a decrease in fire frequency, but generally a large increase in the area burnt in any one fire - fire suppression methods may have inadvertently contributed to this outcome. The result has been an uneven distribution of age-classes within the vegetation communities present, often with large areas of just one age-class predominating. Consequently, elements of the biota requiring particular successional stages may be disadvantaged - or, alternatively, other elements may be advantaged. Management of fire in the Big Desert, according to the historical patterns alluded to above, for the fauna appears to have resulted in progressive simplification of the ecosystem - the common, generalist, widespread, fire-tolerant, high fecundity or mobile taxa are persisting - the rare, specialised, localised, high site-fidelity, fire-sensitive, low-fecundity or low-mobility taxa appear to be in decline. Examples of the latter group may include the Malleefowl, Striated Grasswren, Mallee Emu-wren, Red-lored Whistler, Mallee Whipbird, Western Blue-tongued Lizard, Bardick, Heath Monitor, Mitchell's Hopping Mouse and perhaps Mallee Ningaui. When the added potential effects of introduced predators on these sensitive elements of the fauna are considered, the future of some may be tenuous. Detailed knowledge of the ecologies and life-histories of such taxa will be required to guide informed management. It is imperative, therefore, that management, especially with regard to fire, address these issues. Fire management must be based on informed ecological principles founded on detailed knowledge - its primary aim, at least within the core of large and relatively undisturbed conservation areas, must be switched from the often poorly-defined 'protection' objectives of the past to sound ecological management objectives. Obviously, this ecological management will need to be integrated with requirements for protection of significant private or localised public assets where these may occur, such as at the margins of the large conservation areas. It is apparent that smaller fires are likely to have fewer long-term negative effects on the vertebrate fauna. It is imperative, therefore, to develop a strategy of applied fire and fire protection based on sound ecological principles. The strategy should aim for a relatively stable fire age-class distribution within the Big Desert, must also consider the location of these age-classes, and should be cognisant of the location and age-class structure requirements of individual EVCs. In its application, we must also be especially cautious of the requirements of rare, specialised or localised taxa, as these appear to be the ones most at risk from inappropriate fire, and may be those most dependent on later seral stages. Important factors to consider when formulating the strategy include:.. Because unburnt patches within fire areas are likely to be so important for the fauna, it is essential that the behaviour and location of any imposed fire is planned to retain as many remnants as possible, and that these are well-distributed within the fire area. Different vegetation types will have different capacities to 'produce' remnants, and fire intensity will influence the likelihood of patches being left unburnt. .. Need careful consideration of the effects of barriers to movement which may impede recolonisation, particularly when implementing firebreaks or constructing roads... Consideration of patch sizes required to maintain viable populations is important when planning fire areas/barriers. .. Special protection/management of particular rare or localised taxa is likely to be required, when planning fires (or suppression). Similarly, the successional stage requirements of these taxa are an important consideration. .. Some species may be more vulnerable to fire during drought when distributions and/or populations contract to 'drought refugia'. The characteristics and locations of these drought refugia needs to be known so that they can be given appropriate protection from fire. Detailed studies should be supported or initiated to address the following knowledge requirements: .. Population responses post-fire of selected 'indicator' taxa;.. Movement capabilities of selected taxa; .. Potential movement barriers; .. Life-history characteristics which may influence recolonisation capabilities of selected taxa;.. Utilisation of unburnt patches during and immediately after fire; .. Fire characteristics/behaviour which influences remnant formation; .. Distribution/habitat of selected localised/threatened taxa; .. Conservation ecology/demography of selected taxa; .. Effects of drought, and its interactions with fire; .. Characteristics/locations and importance of drought refugia for selected taxa.

Canova, Luca				Landscape and Urban Planning	74	2		102-109	January 15 2006	2006				English	2	20	Between the 1980s and 1990s, conservation policy in Lombardy (NW Italy) was enhanced with the establishment of the Protected Areas System, which encompassed a wide area of nature reserves and regional parks. The main aim of the Protected Areas System was to preserve cultural, natural and traditional human activity over large areas affected by very rapid development processes. Currently, the Protected Areas System covers about 26% of Lombardy, and human activity within the protected areas is managed and controlled by a consistent body of rules and laws, operating in an eco-sustainable framework. The actual effect of these rules and regulations on landscape and biodiversity conservation is, however, poorly understood. The aims of this study are: (1) to describe the development of the Protected Areas System and its features in southern Lombardy between 1980 and 1994; (2) to confirm that avian species richness is higher in the Protected Areas System than in the related buffer zones; (3) to describe the role of the regulations and laws in establishing the Protected Areas System. The study was carried out in four regional parks of southern Lombardy, and in the related buffer areas, considered as controls. Five variables (natural habitat surface, field size, grassland availability, urban areas, and avian species richness) were compared within and outside the protected areas. Results are summarized as follows: during the study period, the surface covered by natural habitats decreased significantly in control (63.6%) than in protected areas (33.2%), the average field area increased 34.2% in control areas and 15.3% in protected areas, urbanized areas increased 52.3% in control areas and 15.1% in protected areas, while no significant difference was observed in grassland availability. Avian species richness was significantly higher in protected than in control areas. Results showed that despite a general reduction of the environmental value in the wider environment from the 1980s to the early 1990s, the network of protected areas effectively protected some landscape features, and successfully contributed in restraining the expansion of urban areas. Moreover, it confirmed that avian species richness is higher in the Protected Areas System than in control areas. Data on restraining urban development was of the utmost importance, since the Lombardy Protected Areas System included wide areas of primary urban value. These data can be partially explained by the dominant role of the Park Development Plan on the Urban Development Plan, adopted by the local municipality, and proposes the application of the precautionary principle in the simplification process, which is currently affecting the rules and laws governing protected areas in Italy.

We used a replicated landscape study to evaluate relationships between forest structure and avian diversity at both stand and landscape-levels. We used data on bird communities collected under comparable sampling protocols on four managed forests located across the Southeastern US to develop logistic regression models describing relationships between habitat factors and the distribution of overall richness and richness of selected guilds. Landscape models generated for eight of nine guilds showed a strong relationship between richness and both availability and configuration of landscape features. Diversity of topographic features and heterogeneity of forest structure were primary determinants of avian species richness. Forest heterogeneity, in both age and forest type, were strongly and positively associated with overall avian richness and richness for most guilds. Road density was associated positively but weakly with avian richness. Landscape variables dominated all models generated, but no consistent patterns in metrics or scale were evident. Model fit was strong for neotropical migrants and relatively weak for short-distance migrants and resident species. Our models provide a tool that will allow managers to evaluate and demonstrate quantitatively how management practices affect avian diversity on landscapes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Roberge, Jean-Michel; Mikusinski, Grzegorz; Svensson, Soren				Acta Universitatis Agriculturae Sueciae	84			1-19	2006	2006				English	0	1	In northern Europe, a long history of land use has led to profound changes within forest ecosystems, including reductions in the amount of dead wood and area of older deciduous forest. The white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) is one of several specialised forest species whose populations have declined in Sweden. Conservation management directed at this species' habitat has made it a de facto umbrella species for conservation of the biodiversity associated with forests rich in deciduous trees and dead wood. We assessed empirically the value of the white-backed woodpecker as an indicator and umbrella species in central Sweden. Occurrence of the woodpecker in breeding bird atlas squares (5x5 km) indicated high species richness of forest birds, particularly species of special conservation concern, which included on average 13% more species in squares with than without the woodpecker. The number of red-listed cryptogam species expected to benefit from conservation actions directed at white-backed woodpecker habitats was higher in sites where the woodpecker bred compared to where is was absent. However, no such pattern was found for red-listed beetles, which were very rare in the material. White-backed woodpecker occurrence was positively associated with the current area of deciduous and mixed forests with high conservation value. Considering its potential as an indicator species, its specialised habitat requirements and its role as a flagship species, using the white-backed woodpecker as an umbrella species may provide a coarse filter for the conservation of a suite of other deciduous forest species. However, focusing solely on white-backed woodpecker habitat may not provide for the conservation of all deciduous forest species, which stresses the need for a suite of complementary planning approaches.

Roberge, Jean-Michel				Acta Universitatis Agriculturae Sueciae	84			143pp.	2006	2006			Variously paginated. Papers indexed separately.	English	0	2	In northern Europe, a long history of anthropogenic land use has led to profound changes within forest ecosystems. One of the proposed approaches for conservation and restoration of forest biodiversity is the use of umbrella species, whose conservation would confer protection to large numbers of naturally co-occurring species. This thesis aims to evaluate some of the prerequisites to the umbrella species concept, focusing on resident birds in hemiboreal and boreal forests. The study was performed in four areas belonging to the southern Baltic Sea region: central and southern Sweden, south-central Lithuania and northeastern Poland. A review of empirical evaluations of the umbrella species concept performed in various systems suggested that multispecies approaches addressing the requirements of both the umbrellas and the beneficiary species have better potential than approaches based coarsely on the area needs of single species. An analysis of co-occurrence patterns among resident forest birds in landscape units of 100 ha showed that some species reliably indicated high species richness through their presence. For birds of deciduous forests, there was high cross-regional consistency in the identity of the best indicators. Specialised woodpeckers (Picidae) were prominent among the species that performed well as indicators. Their presence in the landscape units was generally linked positively to the degree of naturalness of the forest and to the amounts of resources that have become scarce in intensively managed forests, such as dead wood and large trees. In Sweden, occurrence of the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) in bird atlas squares was positively related to species richness among forest birds of conservation concern, as well as to the area of deciduous and mixed forests of high value for conservation. Moreover, the number of red-listed cryptogam species linked to deciduous trees and dead wood was higher where the woodpecker bred. Those results for birds of northern forests suggest that the umbrella species concept may constitute a useful component of conservation planning, especially in the work towards the derivation of quantitative targets. However, umbrella species are not a panacea and should therefore be seen as part of a complementary suite of approaches.

Avian Conservation and Ecology	1	2		17pp.	2006	2006	http://www.ace-eco.org/archive.php		Unpaginated.	English	0	1	Wetlands in southern Alberta are often managed to benefit waterfowl and cattle production. Effects on other species usually are not examined. I determined the effect of managed wetlands on uplandnesting shorebirds in southern Alberta by comparing numbers of breeding willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus), marbled godwits (Limosa fedoa), and long-billed curlews (Numenius americanus) among areas of managed wetlands, natural wetland basins, and no wetland basins from 1995 to 2000. Surveys were carried out at 21 sites three times each year. Nine to ten of these areas (each 2 km2) were searched for nests annually from 1998-2000. Numbers of willets and marbled godwits and their nests were always highest in areas with managed wetlands, probably because almost all natural wetland basins were dry in this region in most years. Densities of willets seen during pre-incubation surveys averaged 2.3 birds/km2 in areas of managed wetlands, 0.4 in areas of natural wetland basins, and 0.1 in areas with no wetland basins. Nest densities of willets (one search each season) averaged 1.5, 0.9, and 0.3 nests/km2 in areas of managed, natural, and no wetland basins, respectively. Similarly, pre-incubation surveys averaged 1.6, 0.6, and 0.2 godwits/km2 in areas of managed, natural, and no wetland basins, and 1.2, 0.3, and 0.1 godwit nests/km2. For long-billed curlews, pre-incubation surveys averaged 0.1, 0.2, and 0.1 birds/km2, and 0, 0.2, and 0 nests/km2. Nest success was similar in areas with and without managed wetlands. Shallow managed wetlands in this region appear beneficial to willets and marbled godwits, but not necessarily to long-billed curlews. Only 8% of marked willets and godwits with nests in the area were seen or heard during surveys, compared with 29% of pre-laying individuals and 42% of birds with broods. This suggests that a low and variable percentage of these birds is counted during breeding bird surveys, likely limiting their ability to adequately monitor populations of these species.

Brown, David R.; Sherry, Thomas W.				Biotropica	38	1		91-99	January 2006	2006				English	1	7	We used plot-level manipulations and analyses to test the effects of food availability on the behavior and condition of resident dry-forest birds in Jamaica. Two control plots were monitored in each of 2 yr. Food was Supplemented on five plots over 2 yr with piles of cut oranges distributed around plots, which served as a direct source of carbobydrates and water, and an indirect Source of ground arthropods due to increased above-ground activity. We reduced ants on five plots over 2 yr; however, We found no difference in total ground arthropod biomass between control and reduction treatments, so we pooled these plots For analysis. We selected nine focal resident bird species for study of relative abundance, body condition, and breeding condition. Birds were sampled prior to, and 5 to 6 weeks after the initiation of treatments. Seven of nine species had higher relative abundance following food supplementation. Three species were recaptured more frequently in supplementation plots than in control plots. These abundance and persistence responses did not Cause any changes in body condition. In one species, Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), food supplementation resulted in higher concentrations of individuals in breeding condition. These results demonstrated Functional response to dry-season food availability and suggest a limiting mechanism. This Study helps explain mechanisms by which bird populations respond to resource availibility, and is the first Successful plot-level food supplementation experiment for tropical forest birds.

Martin, Kathy; Norris, Andrea; Drever, Mark				British Columbia Journal of Ecosystems and Management	7	3		10-25	2006	2006	http://www.forrex.org/jem/default.asp			English	0	4	The health of coniferous and mixed forests in western Canada is a critical forest management issue with implications for the forest industry, biodiversity conservation, and regional land use planning. The mixed forests of interior British Columbia have high biodiversity and species abundance, and support rich communities of over 185 wildlife vertebrate species, about 24% of which are cavity-nesters. These cavity-nesting birds and mammals live in complex, strongly structured wildlife communities (Nest Webs) that consist of an array of excavators and consumers of tree holes, many of which have strong preferences for large, old and decayed trees, especially deciduous trees, for nesting. Mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) and fire are the two major natural disturbance types structuring mature conifer stands in the interior of the province. The temporal changes in value and availability of dead and dying trees and their associated insect fauna are expected to result in stand-level variation in wildlife populations. Our research in the Cariboo-Chilcotin region showed that insect outbreaks can initially result in improved conditions for cavity-users and many other birds that feed on insects in dead and dying trees, but as the epidemic proceeds, these enhanced conditions deteriorate for many species as the supply of forest insects and old trees decline. The cumulative effects of habitat and environmental changes on the working landscape have the potential to negatively affect the stability of wildlife populations. This paper summarizes field observations regarding changes in forest stand conditions and avian biodiversity and evaluates the patterns of habitat change, beetle salvage, and wildlife responses as the MPB epidemic runs its course. It also discusses some of the issues that forest managers face when considering the maintenance of critical habitat for cavity-nesting species.

Nijman, Vincent				Contributions to Zoology	75	3-4		161-168	2006	2006				English	0	30	The Javan gibbon Hylobates moloch is confined to the last remnants of rainforest on the island of Java, Indonesia. As of 2002, the species has been recorded in 29 forest areas, and the wild population is conservatively estimated at 4100-4500 individuals. Over 95% of the gibbons are in populations of >100 individuals, and the four largest areas support populations of >500 individuals each. In 2003, 56 Javan gibbons were maintained at eight Indonesian zoos, 15 at four Indonesian wildlife rescue centres, with five potential breeding pairs. There is no evidence that the species has bred successfully in captivity in Indonesia. Outside the range country, 48 Javan gibbons were maintained at ten institutions in nine countries, with six breeding pairs. The total ex-situ population is some 120 individuals, the majority of which is wild-caught. At present most initiatives relating to the conservation of the Javan gibbon have targeted small isolated forest areas and the ex-situ population, whereas in-situ protection of the largest populations in the wild has been largely ignored. Significant populations are currently found in unprotected forests. The large captive population of Javan gibbons within Indonesia allows, with improved co-operation, to set up an integrated captive-breeding programme. This should, not be seen, however, as a means to improve the conservation status of the wild Javan gibbons, which needs to be achieved through protection of remaining habitat, but could be used for improving the prevailing low levels of conservation awareness in Java.

Carrascal, Luis M.; Diaz, Leticia				Ecoscience	13	1		100-110	2006	2006				English	0	11	The influence of habitat structure and abiotic factors on winter bird distribution was studied at the within-habitat level in the montane Pyrenean oakwoods of central Spain. Abiotic factors associated with thermal stress were estimated based on altitude and solar radiation received by woodlands (calculated by the steepness and orientation of the terrain). This paper demonstrates the great importance of abiotic factors in influencing bird distribution. Several bird community parameters related to density and species richness decreased with altitude, while they increased with radiation incidence of oakwood plots (i.e., birds avoided northern orientations where solar radiation is minimal in winter). The most important habitat structure variables related to bird distribution were the density of young and mature oaks. A thick undergrowth of thin oaks negatively influenced total bird abundance and species richness and the number of species of the ground searchers guild. Conversely, oak maturity played a positive role on total bird density and species richness and on the number of species of tree canopy gleaners and trunk foragers. Bird density and species richness were better explained by tree regression models considering complex interactions between variables than by general linear regression analyses. To enhance winter survival and habitat suitability for birds, forest management in these mediterranean endemic oakwoods should preserve the most mature forests at lower altitudes exposed to the south.

Lenard, Susan; Carlson, John; Hendricks, Paul; Currier, Coburn	Lenard, Susan; Carlson, John; Hendricks, Paul; Currier, Coburn			Grassland bird surveys in North Valley County, Montana: progress report.				i-vii, 1-22	2006	2006			Separate unpaginated appendices.	English	2	12	Populations of grassland associated birds have exhibited the steepest declines of any suite of bird species in North America over the past several decades. Loss of habitat throughout North America, resulting from conversion of native prairie to agricultural production, has been identified as the primary cause of historic grassland bird declines. Large blocks of intact prairie lands remaining in Montana, therefore, provide critically important breeding habitat for many grassland bird species. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands, especially in the northeastern and northcentral portions of the state, are important breeding habitats for many imperiled grassland species endemic to the Great Plains as the primary landcover in this area is native mixed-grass prairie. Few areas in the state contain such extensive blocks of intact grasslands. Recognizing land management decisions can greatly influence native fauna by altering vegetation structure and plant composition, biologists in the Glasgow Field Office of the BLM initiated a grassland bird project to identify the diversity and abundance of prairie birds on BLM lands in north Valley County. Livestock grazing, the Bureau's primary land management activity in the county, has long been documented with the potential to either positively or negatively impact native flora and fauna. The degree to which grazing can influence native bird species varies widely and is dependent upon many factors including habitat type, timing and intensity of grazing, soil type, weather, and the specific habitat requirements of the bird species under consideration. To better understand the impact of different grazing histories on presence and relative abundance of native prairie bird species, fixed-radius point counts were randomly placed across BLM lands in north Valley County in areas with native grassland plant cover. Transects consisting of three point locations were surveyed using standard avian point count protocols to document bird species abundance and diversity across pastures with differing grazing histories. The project, which began in 2001, evolved into a multi-year inventory, currently in its fifth year. No other project focused on grassland birds in Montana has gathered consistent data at the same locations for this length of time. The information gathered during this project will provide critical information on grassland bird/grazing dynamics and the current status of prairie birds in this increasingly rare ecosystem. This project is especially significant as it encompasses the most extensive remaining piece of prairie in Montana (Figure 1). Seventy-three species of birds, representing 12,121 total individuals, were recorded during 996 avian point counts (332 three-point transects) conducted in north Valley County during the early summer months of 2001 through 2005. Fifteen of the species recorded are state Species of Concern, including the following seven which are endemic to the Northern Great Plains: Ferruginous Hawk (Buteo regalis), Long-billed Curlew (Numenius americanus), Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), Lark Bunting (Calamospiza melanocorys), Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii), McCown's Longspur (Calcarius mccownii), and Chestnut-collared Longspur (Calcarius ornatus). Eight more widespread grassland associated Species of Concern also recorded on the project include: Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), Swainson's Hawk (Buteo swainsoni), Franklin's Gull (Larus pipixcan), Common Tern (Sterna hirundo), Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorous). The most abundant species recorded on the project was Chestnut-collared Longspur (3,116 individuals), followed by Western Meadowlark (1,878 individuals), Horned Lark (1,638 individuals) and Sprague's Pipit (1,213 individuals). In total, these four species represented more than 64% of the total number of individual birds observed over the five years of study. The fifth and sixth most abundant species were Baird's Sparrow (691 individuals) and Lark Bunting (658 individuals), increasing the total percentage to over 75% of all birds recorded. While the abundance of each varied from year to year across the five year time period, these six species were consistently the most abundant. Local weather conditions do not appear to explain variations in abundance across the five years, although drought conditions elsewhere may have had some influence on the abundance of select species in Montana during some years. Timing of the field inventory during the first two years of the study may explain a portion of these trends, at least possibly for Lark Bunting. Fieldwork started approximately one week earlier during the first 2 years of the project. The abundances for these years could reflect birds newly arrived and not yet on established territories. The effects of grazing activities and a variety of other factors could also explain the trends, although the influence of these variables has not yet been investigated. Eighty-nine percent of the total number of individuals recorded are represented by 12 species, 7 of which are state Species of Concern. Six of these seven species are species endemic to the Northern Great Plains. Their presence and relative abundance reflects the uniqueness and importance of this area; few places remain in the Northern Great Plains ecosystem that support such a composition of species. Their abundance also reflects a landscape of diverse vegetation characteristics as each species requires unique habitat elements for breeding and foraging. Chestnut-collared Longspurs and Sprague's Pipits require areas with moderate levels of grass cover and litter, for example, while Baird's Sparrows require dense grass and litter, and McCown's Longspurs require sparse grass and bare ground. In addition to the availability of habitat, the condition is also critical. A heterogeneous prairie mosaic can support a greater number of grassland endemics. Although once plentiful across the Northern Great Plains, large blocks of intact native prairie habitat are now rare. Protecting these lands from conversion and other activities in conflict with historic disturbances (e.g. grazing and fire regimes that mimic the natural frequency and intensity) is critical to maintaining native prairie capable of supporting a diverse species assemblage. Without this protection, many of these endemics would likely disappear from the landscape.	Lenard, Susan; P.O. Box 201800, 1515 East Sixth Avenue, Helena, MT 59620-1800, USA, USA.

Verberk, W.C.E.P.; van Duinen, G.A.; Brock, A.M.T.; Leuven, R.S.E.W.; Siepel, H.; Verdonschot, P.F.M.; van der Velde, G.; Esselink, H.				Journal for Nature Conservation	14	2		78-90	2006	2006				English	0	10	Heterogeneous landscapes are biodiversity 'hotspots'. Degradation resulting from acidification, desiccation and eutrophication not only decreases habitat quality, but also causes heterogeneity to decline. While restoration measures aim at restoring habitat quality, they can further reduce heterogeneity when they affect large parts of an area (large scale) or cause disturbance (high intensity). Successful restoration of biological diversity therefore requires knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the relation between landscape heterogeneity and species diversity. This paper addresses two questions: (1) Do bog pools in a heterogeneous landscape harbour more aquatic macroinvertebrate species than those located in more homogeneous landscapes? (2) Is distance between water bodies an important factor determining species composition? To answer the first question, aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages in bog pools with a similar water chemistry range were studied in bog remnants differing in landscape heterogeneity. The most heterogeneous remnant (Korenburgerveen) had the highest scores on all diversity indices, indicating that bog pools situated in a heterogeneous landscape have a higher diversity than those located in more homogeneous landscapes. To answer the second question, the most heterogeneous remnant was studied in greater detail. Adjacent water bodies were more similar in species composition than expected on the basis of differences in local environmental conditions. This indicates that not only environmental conditions, but also spatial configuration determines the species composition. In conclusion, species diversity in heterogeneous landscapes (i.e. those with a combination of different parts) is greater than the total number of species that would be present if the individual parts were separated. Conservation and restoration strategies should not only focus on enlarging habitat areas and restoring a single habitat type, but also on conserving and strengthening landscape heterogeneity. We present some guidelines for improving habitat quality without causing heterogeneity to decline. [copyright] 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Yrjola, Rauno; Aalto, Hanna; Kontiokorpi, Jari; Aalto, Janne				Metsahallituksen Luonnonsuojelujulkaisuja Sarja A	163			1-105	2006	2006				Finnish	0	0	Siikalahti is a eutrophic and varied bay of Lake Simpelejarvi in the municipality of Parikkala, south-eastern Finland; Simpelejarvi drains into Lake Ladoga in Russia. The water level in Lake Simpelejarvi has been lowered several times, which in part has promoted the transformation of Siikalahti into a valuable bird wetland. Siikalahri became the valuable bird wetland of international importance that it is today due to human action in the 1950s and *60s. Alongside the Bays of Rautalahti and Sammallahti, Siikalahti was designated a site of international importance in the national bird wetland conservation programme in 1981. Due to the valuable range of species occurring in Siikalahti, the bay has also been included in the Natura 2000 network both as a Special Protected Area (SPA) according to the Birds Directive and a Site of Community Interest (SCI) according to the Habitats Directive. The EU provided LIFE Nature funding for habitat rehabilitation in the bay from 2001 to 2003. Siikalahti is Finland's most important inland bird wetland both as a breeding ground and as a migration staging area. The avifauna of the bay has been monitored and researched for a lengthy period of time. Continuous observation series start from the 1980s, and bird censuses were also carried out in previous decades. The programme for monitoring avifauna carried out in Siikalahti, Parikkala, between 2002 and 2004 consisted of breeding bird censuses, estimations of the breeding success of waterfowl and counts of staging birds during spring and autumn migration. The results were compared with previous census results from Siikalahti. Furthermore, the breeding avifauna in various areas of the bay and the impact of the habitat rehabilitation were also estimated. The research results show that the waterfowl populations in Siikalahti have increased during recent years, and that breeding has also started to become somewhat more successful. The number of Little Gulls (Larus minutus) has increased, and the decrease in the Black-headed Gull (Larus ridibundus) population has halted thanks to the breeding islets constructed during rehabilitation.-The amount of Northern Lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) has increased thanks to the meadows being cleared up. No great changes took place in the number of territories of forestland birds during the research period 2002-2004. The numbers of staging waterfowl and waders increased during the research period 2002-2004. The maximum number of staging waterfowl was more than 2000 individuals, and Siikalahti has reached the status of a migration staging area of international significance.On the basis of the avifauna, the conservation value of Siikalahti increased compared with 1993. During recent years, the conservation value has remained fairly stable, the score for 2004 being 383.1 points. Siikalahti remains the most valuable inland bird wetland in Finland. The most important breeding species in Siikalahti include the White-backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos), Slavonian Grebe (Podiceps auritus), Marsh Harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and the Eurasian Bittern (Botaurus stellaris). Further valuable species include the Spotted Crake (Porzana porzana) and the declined Little Crake (Porzana parva). Habitat rehabilitation measures (construction of islets for breeding, increasing areas of open water and clearing up of meadows) carried out in Siikalahti have increased the amount of avifauna in the southern part of the bay. Fewer rehabilitation measures have been carried out in the northern part, and the amount of birds has not increased there.

There are few resources, however, that provide comprehensive advice on every step of organizing and carrying out a survey, from the early stages of planning to final use of the data. Even fewer resources are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of potential users, from amateurs interested in change of bird life in a local study preserve to professionals testing hypotheses on the response of birds to habitat management, although much of the advice should be the same for every monitoring program. Whether survey objectives are very modest or rigorously scientific, samples must be sufficiently numerous and well distributed to provide meaningful results, and the survey should be well designed to ensure that the money and effort going into it are not wasted. This document is intended to be a complete resource for anyone planning to organize monitoring of noncolonial landbirds within a relatively small geographic area (e.g., from the size of a woodlot to a large park). The first of its two parts provides background explaining the importance of good study design and gives specific advice on all aspects of project planning and execution of high-quality data collection for the purpose of hypothesis testing. The second part is self-contained and nontechnical and describes complete plans for a site-specific checklist survey, suitable for addressing monitoring questions frequently asked by amateurs and for involvement of volunteers in data collection. Throughout are references to additional resources, from background literature to sources of existing survey protocols, analysis software, and tools for archiving data.

Comparing the data from two neighbouring sample plots (Smoszew - 26-29 pairs, Stare Budy - 44-58 pairs), it can be presumed that at least 310-320 Middle Spotted Woodpeck pairs occur within the refuge. This indicates that the "Dabrowy Krotoszynskie" oak forest is one of the three most important refuges of this species in western Poland. Its abundance in the study plots was found significantly related with the coverage of deciduous forest (r=0.86, P=0.003), including oak woods older than 80 years (r=0.83, P=0.006). Within a few dozen years most of the oak tree stands will have reached the felling age, which will result in diminution of the oak forest area - and this seems the main factor threatening the Middle Spotted Woodpecker population within the "D4brc Krotoszynskie" refuge.

The consequence was appearance of favourable environmental conditions for the Nightjar. The study plot covered a part of the burnt area situated within the Rudy Raciborskie Forest Division, occupying 4500 ha. In 2003 a single control was performed - in the 2nd and 3rd decade of June, during which 80-85 displaying males (density 17.8-18.9 pairs/10 km2) were observed within the study area. During the two 2004 controls (in the 2nd and 3rd decade of June, and the 1st of July) the species abundance was estimated at 80-90 breeding pairs (density 17.8-20.0 pairs/10 km2) and 160-180 pairs on the whole fire-burnt area. The Nightjar territories were distributed evenly about the whole study plot. The birds occupied sites inside dense young pine woods, predominating in the fire-burnt area. The species density within the fire-burnt area in the Rudy Raciborskie Forest Division ranks among the highest in Poland. This results from the size of open space area and occurrence of deciduous tree species (birch, oak) both in the remnants of old tree stand and in the new stands, which is probably conducive to abundance of insects the Nightjar feeds on.

International Conference on Ecology and Transportation 2005 Proceedings, August 29 - September 2, 2005, San Diego, California.				397-405	2006	2006				English	0	4	The concept of the road-effect zone has been developed and researched predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere. This study measures the extent of road impacts into a temperate eucalypt forest ecosystem in southeastern Australia. The Epsom-Barnadown Road is a two-lane arterial road connecting regional centres in northern Victoria to the City of Greater Bendigo. Passing through the Bendigo Regional Park, the Epsom-Barnadown Road carries more than 1,600 vehicles per day. Transects of 1 km in length cited perpendicular to the road were established to measure road impacts on the flora and fauna of box-ironbark forest. Exotic vegetation was found to extend about 50 m from the road. Traffic noise and light penetration varied according to topography and vegetation cover, but averaged of 350 m and 380 m, respectively, from the road. Mammal surveys indicated there was an increase in species richness once traffic noise reached ambient levels (40 dB) and traffic light penetration ceased. Bird surveys resulted in the identification of four species (9%) that only occurred within 150 m of the road (edge species) and 21 species (58%) that only occurred at distances of 150 m or more from the Epsom-Barnadown Road (interior species). A core habitat area for bird species was identified at about 900 m from the road. It was found that the average width of forest in the Bendigo Regional Park impacted by the Epsom-Barnadown Road was 1800 m, which translates to an area of 1.8 km2 per kilometre of road.

Tomasevic, Jorge A.; Estades, Cristian F.				Ornitologia Neotropical	17	1		1-14	2006	2006				English	1	17	The ecology of secondary cavity-nesting birds (SCN) has been a matter of great interest for many years throughout the world, in part because of the direct and strong relationship between the breeding biology of these species and the impacts of forest management on the availability of cavities. While there exists a great body of knowledge on the ecology of SCN in the Nearctic and Palaearctic regions, information from the Neotropics is scarce, in particular for the temperate forests. In order to describe the effect of forest stand attributes on the abundance of SCN, we conducted a two-part study in the coastal range of the Maule region, south-central Chile. First, using 40 point-count stations covering the entire range of Nothofagus forest conditions, we related forest-stand attributes to the density of four SCN (austral winter and spring 1999, 2000). Second, using a nest-box experiment (spring 1999, winter 2000), we tested whether cavities were limiting the density of SCN in a second-growth forest. Point-count data suggest no relationships between the abundance of all SCN and habitat attributes during the winter (both years), but a significant and positive association with canopy height, total foliage volume, mean stem diameter and abundance of cavities (estimated) during the spring (both years). At the individual species level, cavities did not enter into a stepwise linear regression model for most species (most significant predictors were canopy height and stem diameter) suggesting that either our definition of what an appropriate nest site is was wrong or that factors such as cavity spatial aggregation and territoriality may have obscured a potential relationship. The nest-box experiment showed that the density of Thorn-tailed Rayaditos (Apbrastura spinicauda, P 0.05) and House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon, P 0.01) was limited by nesting sites during the breeding season, but not during the non-breeding one.

Vilella, Francisco J.; Hengstenberg, Derek W.				Ornitologia Neotropical	17	4		563-579	2006	2006				English	1	18	The Broad-winged Hawk (Buteo plapterus brunnescens) is an endemic, non-migratory subspecies of the highly migratory nominate form. Broad-winged Hawks inhabit the interior montane forests of Puerto Rico and are listed as endangered. We studied the Broad-winged Hawk in Rio Abajo Forest and surrounding lands during 2001 and 2002. Adult and juvenile Broad-winged Hawks were trapped using a modified bal-chatri trap and a dho-gaza net. Nestlings were taken by hand from the nest. We collected morphometric measurements and radio-tagged eight Broad-winged Hawks. We obtained 884 locations from radio-tagged hawks and mapped territories of unmarked Broad-winged Hawk breeding pairs by direct observation from limestone hilltops. Telemetry locations per hawk averaged 105 (10-277) overall, with an average of 3.5 locations per bird per week. Transmitter life ranged from 31 to 464 days and averaged 218 days. Adult annual home range (95% kernel) averaged 213.1 ha, and ranged from 62.9-446.1 ha. Juvenile annual home range averaged 130.7 ha, and ranged from 48.2-250.9 ha. We recorded Broad-winged Hawks perched in 16 different tree species at an average height of 10.4 m. Tree species most frequently used as perches were Hibiscus elatus and Tectona grandis. Analysis indicated disproportional use of habitat by Broad-winged Hawks (P 0.001). In our study area radio-tagged Broad-winged Hawks selected four of six available habitat associations. These included seasonal evergreen forest, montane forest, montane evergreen shrub, and regenerating forest. We identified three areas of high Broad-winged Hawk use in the periphery of Rio Abajo Forest that should be considered for protection or acquisition. We documented reduced dispersal by Broad-winged Hawk juveniles and suggest this is an adaptive response to insular conditions.

Pacific Conservation Biology	12	1		50-63	2006	2006				English	0	1	We provide a geographic and landscape context for ongoing studies on bird communities in eucalypt woodland remnants on the New England Tablelands, New South Wales. We draw together several surveys that have not been published in the scientific literature, and integrate them with previously published material. A total of 142 woodland bird species, including 12 threatened species, was recorded in remnant woodland in the area above 900 m elevation from 50 km SSE to 100 km NNW of Armidale. There was a positive relationship between remnant size and bird species richness. Woodland reserves >300 ha supported significantly more species than remnants <100 ha on private land. Intensively surveyed reserves also had more species than remnants surveyed more casually. Threatened and other declining species occurred mainly in medium-sized (100-300 ha) and large reserves; foraging guilds of small to medium-sized, ground and above-ground insectivores were impoverished in degraded medium-sized and small remnants on private land. Almost the full range of woodland bird species was found at one or more sites, indicating their conservation value. However, some species were found in few sites or were only vagrants at a site. Active management will be needed to retain the current diversity of bird species in such heavily cleared landscapes.

Pacific Conservation Biology	12	3		168-174	2006	2006				English	0	0	The decline of woodland birds that follows from habitat fragmentation, degradation and loss of connectivity is well reported in the literature. However, reports of immediate responses by birds to these events are scant. This study, in the eastern whealtbelt of Western Australia, detected that when half of a 10 ha remnant of Allocasuarina shrubland was chained (vegetation knocked over and largely killed), birds responded quickly; increaser species apparently benefited and decliner species became restricted to the remaining unchained remnant of shrubland. There was some correspondence between the trends in variety and/or abundance of arthropods with those of bird species richness. Two Near-threatened species, the White-browed Babbler Pomatostomus supercilious and the Crested Bellbird Oreoica gutturalis, were only detected in the non-chained part of the remnant. These findings clearly highlight the immediate ecological consequences of clearing of native vegetation, and highlight the importance of conserving even the smallest remaining fragments.

Proceedings of the Annual Conference Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies	60			8-14	2006	2006	http://www.seafwa.org/proceedings.htm			English	0	1	We conducted a 13-year study to determine bird species richness and abundance in field edges maintained in conservation buffers and mowed field edges on two agricultural experiment stations in Mississippi. Both experiment stations were intensively managed for agricultural row crop and dairy production with field edges managed with frequent mowing and herbicide application. Habitat reclamation and management on 41 ha of field edges was initiated on each farm in 1988 and included selective spraying herbicides to control agronomic grasses, cessation of annual mowing, protection from livestock access, and planting legumes and shrubs. We surveyed birds from 1 May through 15 June on permanently established, fixed-width transects in three conservation buffer and three mowed field edges adjacent to row crops on each experimental farm from 1989 through 2001. We detected 25 bird species on mowed field edges and 51 species on edges maintained in conservation buffers on both farms. Mean species richness and bird abundance were higher (P < 0.05) on conservation buffers than on mowed field edges on both farms. We attributed higher bird species richness and abundance in conservation buffers to a more diverse habitat structure and increased food plant availability created by native plant succession and shrub plantings. These results support the concept that creation and maintenance of conservation buffers in field edges along row crops can increase bird species richness and abundance on agricultural lands.

Herrando, Sergi; Brotons, Lluis; Llacuna, Santiago				Revista Catalana d'Ornitologia	21			17-28	2005(2006)	2006				English	0	0	The relationship between arthropod availability and bird energy requirements was studied in Mediterranean shrublands. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that food availability is a possible constraint in the recovery of bird communities in post-fire dynamics. We used the sweep-net sampling method to collect arthropods, and the point-census method to assess bird abundance. The censuses were carried out during the breeding and wintering seasons in a fire-free zone and in two burned zones (one burned four years before the fieldwork, the other 16 years before it). During the breeding season, we found a positive association between arthropod availability and bird requirements in all three zones. However, compared with the other two zones, the recently burned zone contained fewer birds than expected, based on arthropod availability. Thus, it seems that birds exerted significantly lower predation pressure on arthropod populations in this zone than in the other two zones, which resembled each other in this parameter. These results suggest that arthropod availability does not constrain breeding-bird numbers soon after fire; however, it could do so in later successional stages. During winter, when the studied bird species also feed on fleshy-fruits, there were no conclusive associations between arthropods and birds.

At community level, simple and multiple correlation and PCA analysis showed that fragment size was the main predictor of species richness and diversity index. In the range size 10-100 ha, values of species richness and diversity index tended to cumulative values. At guild level, interior species were absent in fragments smaller than 10 ha. In accordance with other authors. 10 ha could be a fragment size threshold that contributes to predict the abundance of these species. Edge species decreased and interior species increased their abundance in larger fragments (> 50 ha in size). Slope of area/species curves (and z value) is higher not considering the edge species component. These species, generalist and/or inhabiting the surrounding habitats, may confound the "island effect" on bird communities of wood habitat remnants.	Lorenzetti, Emanuela; Via C.

Whitfield, D.P.; Thomas, C.J.				Scottish Natural Heritage Commissioned Report	181			i-vii, 1-22	2006	2006				English	0	0	Background Large areas of the blanket bogs of northern Scotland are classified under the EC Birds Directive as the Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands Special Protection Area (SPA) for their bird populations, including the golden plover Pluvialis apricaria due to its listing on Annex 1 of the Directive and over 1% of the national population breeding in the classified site. Although golden plovers nest and rear their chicks on the bogs, breeding and non-breeding adults frequently forage on agricultural fields located close to the bog. These fields are not within the boundaries of the SPA; however, because they are used by golden plovers which breed on the SPA they are a potentially important resource for a SPA interest. To help inform aspects of the implementation of a Management Strategy developed under the Life Peatlands Project and particularly in relation to agricultural practice, it is essential that the requirements of golden plover in relation to their use of fields is understood. In 1996 an extensive survey of a large number of fields located within 6km of the SPA was undertaken, designed to identify those fields used by golden plovers and their characteristics. The purposes of the present study were to analyse these data to provide both an indication of the important features of field selection by plovers (and therefore appropriate management prescriptions) and to identify a sample of fields for continued monitoring. Main findings 1,368 fields were surveyed, and only 44 (39 within the systematic study) were occupied by golden plover. Occupied fields were widely scattered within the limits of close proximity to the SPA, but no or few occupied fields were found in Strathnaver and N Halladale. Golden plover selected fields with poor drainage and some cover of rushes, probably because such fields had more abundant leatherjacket prey. The vast majority of occupied fields had short (<5cm) swards through grazing. Flocks of plovers avoided field boundaries and so larger flocks occupied larger fields. Occupied and unoccupied fields could not be predicted on the basis of the measured field characteristics suggesting either that plovers used unmeasured characteristics to select fields or, more likely, that many suitable fields were not occupied. Recommended management prescriptions included avoiding agricultural 'improvement' (eg drainage, reseeding as silage) of occupied fields and suitable alternatives, and appropriate grazing regimes to maintain a short sward and leatherjacket densities.

Bird communities ranged from open-habitat assemblages in clearcut areas to forest-obligate assemblages in ST stands. Little overlap of avian community composition was observed between ST stands and clearcut areas. PT and SS stands supported avian communities where most species were observed at intermediate abundance values compared to ST or clearcut areas. Highly fragmented, closed-canopy stands embedded within the silvicultural landscape of HSNF do not support large populations of species traditionally associated with detrimental edge effects on forest-obligate songbirds. Intensively managed PT and SS stands appear to provide suboptimal habitat for forest and grassland species. Land managers in HSNF could maximize regional avian diversity by maintaining a mosaic of large closed-canopy, oak-pine stands, and fire-maintained open areas embedded among other silvicultural stand types.

Morimoto, Sakae				Strix	24			89-97	2006	2006				Japanese	0	1	The nest sites of Mountain Hawk Eagles were studied in Hiroshima Prefecture from 1982 to 2005. The nest tree species were identified and the distances between the different nests of a pair were measured, if they had more than one nest. Of 19 pairs and 26 nests confirmed in the study sites, seven pairs (37%) had two nests in their territories. Only two of them (10.5%), however, maintained both nests for more than one year. Of the nest trees, 19 (73%) were Pinus densiflora, four (15%) Abies firma, two (8%) Zelkova serrata and one (4%) Quercus serrata. In six of seven territories with two nests, both nests were built in Pinus densiflora and in the other territory Zelkova serrata was used as a nest tree. In the sites where the nests were built on Pinus densiflora, the nest trees were taller than the other neighboring trees. In the site where Zelkova serrata was used as a nest tree, the nest trees were also taller than the other trees. The average heights of trees with old and new nests were 22.8[plus or minus]1.64m and 18.7[plus or minus]2.84m respectively. The mean DBHs were 62.0[plus or minus]9.0cm and 46.3[plus or minus]9.46cm respectively. Seventeen pairs used the same nests continuously, five of which built new nests because their old ones collapsed, the nest trees died or fell down. These data indicate that the pair first used the tallest suitable tree available and then the second tallest tree. The distances between the old and new nests were 50-150m with an average of 90[plus or minus]1.83m. They were located in the same stand of trees. Two pairs, on the other hand, simultaneously maintained their old and new nests for more than one year. The mean distance between the nests was 550[plus or minus]70.7m (unless the distance was measured to the nearest cm). One of them built a new nest in a different wood in their home range because they were prevented from using their previous nest site. In Hiroshima Prefecture Mountain Hawk Eagles have been faced with the decrease of suitable nest trees due to pine blight and other causes. When they happen to lose their present nests, therefore, they will have great difficulty in finding replacement nest trees. This situation will result in reducing the number of breeding pairs and hence the population of the species. Therefore it is urgent to take measures to conserve the breeding habitats including suitable trees of Mountain Hawk Eagles in the prefecture.

Hanula, James L.; Horn, Scott; Wade, Dale D.				U S Forest Service General Technical Report SRS	93			57-66	2006	2006				English	0	7	Dead wood is a major component of forests and contributes to overall diversity, primarily by supporting insects that feed directly on or in it. Further, a variety of organisms benefit by feeding on those insects. What is not well known is how or whether dead wood influences the composition of the arthropod community that is not solely dependent on it as a food resource, or whether woody debris influences prey available to generalist predators. One group likely to be affected by dead wood is ground-dwelling arthropods. We studied the effect of adding large dead wood to unburned and frequently burned pine stands to determine if dead wood was used more when the litter and understory plant community are removed. We also studied the effect of annual removal of dead wood from large (10-ha) plots over a 5-year period on ground-dwelling arthropods. In related studies, we examined the relationships among an endangered woodpecker that forages for prey on live trees, its prey, and dead wood in the forest. The results of these and other studies show that dead wood can influence the abundance and diversity of the ground-dwelling arthropod community and of prey available to generalist predators not foraging directly on dead trees.

Wang, Yong; Schweitzer, Callie Jo; Lesak, Adrian A.				U S Forest Service General Technical Report SRS	92			17-20	2006	2006				English	1	2	We examined bark-foraging and cavity-nesting birds' use of upland hardwood habitat altered through a shelterwood regeneration experiment on the mid-Cumberland Plateau of northern Alabama. The five regeneration treatments were 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent basal area retention. The 75 percent retention treatment was accomplished by stem-injecting herbicide into mostly midstory canopy trees; the other removal treatments were implemented through chain saw felling and grapple skidding. Density and species composition of bark-foraging and cavity-nesting birds were monitored during the breeding season of 2002 and 2003. Signs of bark-foraging and excavation activities were examined for permanently-marked trees in vegetation sampling plots in spring and fall of 2003 and spring, 2004. A total of 11 species were detected; 9 of them established breeding territories on the study plots. Tufted Titmice were the most abundant species (1.35 [plus or minus] 0.12 territories per plot per year), followed by White-breasted Nuthatch (0.67 [plus or minus] 0.08 territories per plot per year) and Downy Woodpecker (0.58 [plus or minus] 0.11 territories per plot per year). Species richness, abundance, and diversity indices of bark-foraging and cavity-nesting birds varied by the regeneration treatments: Clearcut had the lowest values. Interestingly, no difference was detected among the other four treatments. The amount of snags (measured as total d.b.h.) differed among the treatments: Plots that received the 75 percent retention (herbicide) treatment had the highest value. The signs of bark foraging and excavation activities (number of pecks and excavations) were positively correlated with the availability of dead trees.

Quality Vegetation Management (QVM) is one such technique that utilizes the selective herbicide Imazapyr and prescribed burning. Timber growth (d.b.h., total/merchantable heights, and cubic foot volume per acre) and summer avian community responses (relative abundance, species richness, and total conservation value) to the QVM treatment are being evaluated in mid-rotation CRP loblolly pine plantations in two physiographic regions of Mississippi. By 2-years post-treatment, significant increases in the relative abundance of six early successional bird species were detected on treated sites. Although not significant, mean pine growth increment increases were slightly greater on treated plots than on control plots.

We used data from previous research to compile complete species lists for the monument and to assess inventory completeness. There have been 784 species recorded at Montezuma Castle NM (Table 1), of which 85 (11%) are non-native. In each taxon-specific chapter we highlight areas of resources that contributed to species richness or unique species for the monument. Of particular importance are Montezuma Well and Beaver and Wet Beaver creeks and the surrounding riparian vegetation, which are responsible for the monument having one of the highest numbers of bird species in the Sonoran Desert Network of park units. Beaver Creek is also home to populations of federally-listed fish species of concern. Other important resources include the cliffs along the creeks and around Montezuma Well (for cliff and cave roosting bats). Based on the review of past studies, we believe the inventory for most taxa is nearly complete, though some rare or elusive species will be added with additional survey effort. We recommend additional inventory, monitoring and research studies.	Schmidt, Cecilia A.; USGS Southwest Biological Science Center, Colorado Plateau Research Station, 2255 N.

Ornithologische Untersuchungen in einem Bann- und Wirtschaftswald vor und nach Sturm.	Hohlfeld, Frank				Vogelwelt	127	1		51-64	2006	2006				German	0	2	The 'Bechtaler Wald' oak hornbeam forest in the upper Rhine valley was heavily affected by the gale 'Lothar' in December 1999. About 80% of the trees were uprooted. Bird densities were surveyed in spring and the results from a strict forest reserve and a managed forest were compared. The survey was started in 1994, repeated in 1999 previous to the storm and continued in 2000 and 2001. Bird densities, nesting cavities and cavity trees were recorded. In 1994 and 2002, forest structure and composition were recorded using a sampling method; these data have been used for interpretation of the ornithological data. Before the storm, bird diversity and species composition were very similar in the two forest types. Cavity-nesting birds reached higher densities in the strict forest reserve because they used the higher amount of dead wood (snags) and damaged trees for breeding and foraging. After the gale, bird communities of the compared areas evolved differently. The not cleared strict forest reserve had higher bird densities than the cleared forest. In the cleared forest, species composition was found to have changed more than in the strict forest reserve. The differences in the density of cavity-nesting birds between the strict forest reserve and the managed forest increased. Tree species was found to be less important than tree consistency for cavity-nesting birds. Snags and damaged trees became more important for cavity-nesting birds in the strict forest reserve. They were found to breed even in fallen dead tree sterns. Only in the strict forest reserve uplifted tree roots and fallen tree crowns created important nesting habitats for several bird species. Most bird species settled in the forest both before as well as after the storm. Some characteristic forest species disappeared and some species of open land occurred especially in the cleared parts of the managed forest. At these places the managed forest changed temporarily into open grassland with scattered trees. The strict forest reserve remained a forest covered predominantly by trees, either standing or lying on the ground.	Hohlfeld, Frank; Charlottenbuger Str 5, D-79114 Freiburg, Germany, Germany.

Kamp, Johannes; Sohni, Vincent				Vogelwelt	127	1		65-70	2006	2006				English	1	1	As part of a bird mapping project at riparian and mountainous forest sites in the Republic of Adygeya, northwestern Russian Caucasus, in May 2004 we collected data on habitat use of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker subspecies Dendrocopos medius caucasicus. Our observations revealed that the subspecies utilises a variety of tree. stands with rough bark, including pure willow-poplar and alder woods. Furthermore, breeding was confirmed in beech-fir and polydominant broad-leaved forests containing large amounts of dead wood. We observed foraging birds up to the tree line at 1200 m. We assume, that the woodpecker inhabits all kinds of broad-leaved forests in the area that feature a sufficient amount of dead wood. These observations are in agreement with new findings from Central Europe, which contradict the traditional opinion of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker being a species strongly dependent on mature oak stands. Furthermore, we present data on population density and differences in voice compared to the nominate race. Using our density data, we calculate a new population estimate for the northwestern Caucasus of 8050 to 9200 breeding pairs.	Kamp, Johannes; Hindenburgstr. 3, D-26122 Oldenburg, Germany, Germany.

Zur Vogelbesiedlung des Golfplatzes "Apeldoer" in einer Knicklandschaft im westen Schleswig-Holsteins 2002-2004.	Busche, Guenther				Vogelwelt	127	2		75-84	2006	2006				German	0	1	The breeding birds of the golf course Apeldoer in western Schleswig-Holstein were surveyed in the period 2002-2004. The survey area mainly consists of grassland with banked hedges and pools. The whole area, including some woods, buildings and a garden, covers 95 ha (Table 1). A total of 349 pairs of 53 bird species bred in the area. The golf course itself, which including a bordering hedge covers 91 ha, was used for breeding by 40 species, seven of which were dominant. A total of 222 pairs bred in this area during the survey period, with a total abundance of 22.4 pairs/10 ha (Table 2). Mainly the creation of landscape elements such as ponds and the toleration of large expanses of roughs led to the high diversity of birds recorded on the golf course. The species spectrum diversified and the breeding numbers of waterbirds and ground-nesting species increased. The Skylark was prominent with 20 singing individuals (density on grassland 2.5 singing individuals/10 ha, in the surrounding farmland only 0.1/10 ha, p < 0.001). The golf course forms an island habitat for other species such as Tufted Duck, Coot, Oystercatcher and possibly the Cuckoo. A comparison with adjoining farmland for species with more than two breeding pairs demonstrates that the golf course is better for birdlife than the surrounding area: Compared to the farmland, 11 species occurred in higher and five species in lower densities on the golf course, whereas densities did not differ in 13 species (Table 2). The diversity (SHANNON/WEAVER index) relationship was 3.33 on the golf course compared to 2.76 in adjoining farmland. Almost all individuals fed exclusively within the golf course complex. Breeding success seems at least to be high enough to support viable populations on the golf course. Disturbance from running the golf course and predators (Carrion Crows) seems to be negligible. The golf course is - after two evaluations - of local to regional importance. A comparison with ten more golf courses can be summed up as follows (after FLADE 1994): golf courses do not constitute their specific breeding-bird community, but have to be regarded as 'fragmented parks'. An own indicator species group can not be defined for golf courses.

Out of 24 species inhabiting old pine forests, only three (Tree Pipit, Coal Tit, Scarlet Rosefinch) were still found immediately after the fire; 1 one species (Song Thrush) newly occurred. Bird abundance declined to approx. 20%. Only the Tree Pipit maintained its previous density and continued to predominate. In late summer, nine species were seen, and Great Spotted Woodpecker, Coal Tit, and Willow Tit reached the density they had prior to the fire. Total bird abundance was minimal during that phase (63 ind./km2). Three years after the fire, 12 species were found in early summer, the growth of shrubbery favouring warblers, Siberian Rubythroat, Red-flanked Bluetail, Brown Shrike (all new), and Scarlet Rosefinch. Having dominated the previous communities, the Tree Pipit exhibited a significant decline. The increasing food supply during summer (berries etc.) supported new species (Hazel Grouse, thrushes), which then occurred at high densities. However, the number of species and the total bird abundance were still below the values of the initial communities in old forests.

Wildlife Research	33	2		137-148	2006	2006				English	1	5	Fine-scale variation in habitat structure and composition is likely to influence habitat use by avian species with limited flight capabilities. I investigated proportional use of available habitat and microhabitat by the southern emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus), a threatened, flight-limited passerine, at three sites in Victoria, in relation to vegetation structure and composition. Emu-wrens appeared to discriminate between habitats with regard to structural rather than floristic characteristics. Habitats with dense vertical foliage of shrubs, grasses and sedges/rushes between ground level and 100 cm, and dense horizontal cover of medium to tall shrubs, were used most frequently. However, when availability of habitat was taken into account, habitat use was negatively correlated with the vertical density of low shrub foliage and species richness. Within habitats, emu-wrens more frequently used plant species that had a dense canopy cover (26 [plus or minus] 2% of total cover, crown diameter 93 [plus or minus] 5 cm), high foliage density between 50 and 100 cm, and average heights of [approximately]1 m. Plant species in which the birds nested comprised [approximately]14% of total canopy cover and were densest between ground level and 50 cm. Canopy cover, vegetation height and vertical foliage density were consistently important variables correlated with emu-wren habitat use at multiple fine-scales. This study provides valuable information for conservation management of the species; in particular, the restoration of degraded habitats.

A total of 21 bird species (average 5.0, range 1-12) was found to breed in abandoned farmland of Wroclaw Plain (SW Poland, Lower Silesia Province). Between 1 and 94 pairs bred per field in 66 out of 67 study fields (average surface 5.0 [plus or minus] 10.5 ha). Six species (Acrocephahis palustris, Saxicola rubetra, Sylvia communis, Miliaria calandra, Locustella naevia, Emberiza schoeniclus) represented some 83% the whole community. The number of pairs was positively correlated with the field size. The occurrence of a rich and diverse breeding bird fauna on older abandoned fields was conditioned by the presence of a well-preserved vegetation cover (Tanacetum vulgare, Solidago sp., Artemisia vulgaris) of the previous year. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Diversita e struttura dell'avifauna in una successione post incendio di bosco meso-mediterraneo.	Bellia, Enrico				Avocetta	29	2		75-84	Diciembre 2005	2005				Italian	0	0	I analysed the species richness, the turn-over and the structure of the bird communities along a secondary post-fire succession (Erico-Quercion ilicis) in the Madonie Regional Park (Sicily). During the springs 2002 and 2003, I made 475 random point counts in 6 sampling areas burned between 1993 and 2001, and in 4 control areas not burned since 25 or 50 years. Overall, 33 bird species were recorded in the secondary succession. Species richness was positively related to the time elapsed from fire, according to a logarithmic curve that reached a plateau 25-30 years after fire. The turn-over of species decreased during the succession, even if the relationship was only marginally significant. In the first stages of post-fire succession the turn-over reflected the recolonisation by species of shrubby vegetation. Bird communities in each post-fire stage form an ordered nested subset of the whole forest community. The investigated bird community showed a relatively high resistance and resilience to fire perturbation and was able to recover completely in 25 years after fire.

Cockle, Kristina L.; Leonard, Marty L.; Bodrati, A. Alejandro				Biodiversity and Conservation	14	13		3265-3288	December 2005	2005				English	1	18	In the Atlantic forest region, there is a need to develop economic activities that can be carried out in buffer zones around parks, with minimal impact on forest bird species. One such possibility is the farming of yerba mate, Ilex paraguariensis, under native trees. We compared bird speciesEu9 presence and abundance between a forest reserve and an adjacent plantation of shade-grown yerba mate, to determine which species might use such plantations. Of the 145 species that were regularly recorded in the forest, 66%, including five globally threatened species, were also regularly recorded in the plantation. Most canopy species and tree trunk insectivores showed similar abundance in both habitats, but forest floor and understory species were absent from the plantation. Within the plantation, higher tree density did not lead to a greater abundance of forest birds. Yerba mate grown under native trees could be used to rehabilitate cleared land and allow recolonization by some Atlantic forest bird species.

Oppel, Steffen				Biodiversity and Conservation	14	14		3407-3422	December 2005	2005				English	1	11	Limited spatial resources available for conservation lead to controversy about whether to apply single-species management or ecosystemary approaches in order to maintain biodiversity. In this study I analyse changes in a community of breeding coastal birds over a 90-year period, in order to examine whether natural processes on an unmanaged island are in accordance with requirements to save endangered species. Both diversity and species richness of the community increased significantly over time, and evenness increased after having been severely reduced by human impact. Diversity, evenness and species richness seemed to approach an equilibrium in the past decade, but number of breeding pairs declined as a consequence of altered natural disturbance regime. Species identity changed over time, with two initially very common species recently becoming locally extinct. These species are of high conservation concern, and their disappearance causes a problem for the concept of naturalness on islands. I conclude that natural processes need to be applied to the entire landscape in order to maintain dynamic processes that are essential for the survival of these species. The natural changes on the island should not be interrupted, but rather demonstrated to the public in order to increase conservation mindedness and gain support for changes in anthropogenic influences on a larger spatial scale.

Er, Kenneth B.H.; Innes, John L.; Martin, Kathy; Klinkenberg, Brian				Biological Conservation	126	3		410-419	December 2005	2005				English	5	40	Forest loss with accompanying urbanization is often permanent as forests are replaced by impervious concrete structures or surfaces. The remaining forest patches are usually isolated and too small to maintain viable populations of forest-dependent wildlife species. Consistent with the species-area function (S = cA2), extirpation of species should follow forest loss. However, this has rarely ever been tested in the urban landscape. We determined whether the observed number of forest-dependent bird extirpations occurring after forest loss matches that predicted by the species-area function in Vancouver (study area [approximately]126.7 km2), British Columbia, Canada. Prior to European settlement in 1859, Vancouver was covered completely by coastal western hemlock forest. Based on published historical maps of forest cover and present Landsat imagery of Vancouver, we estimated that approximately 87% of the forest area in Vancouver has been converted to urban development. Using the species-area function, we then predicted that approximately 14 bird species closely associated with lowland forest should have been extirpated. This figure is significantly greater than the three bird species known to have been extirpated in Vancouver. When we constrained the comparison to bird species closely associated with lowland forest and restricted in their distribution in British Columbia, we found a close match between the observed and predicted number of extirpations, suggesting that bird species closely associated with lowland forest and restricted in their geographic distribution are most prone to extirpation as a result of forest loss. Given that urban areas are situated in productive habitats with inherently high species richness, it is important that local land-use plans incorporate the conservation of habitat fragments from the onset and place particular emphasis on the regionally restricted forest-dependent species.

Biological Conservation	126	4		540-547	December 2005	2005				English	0	26	This study examines bird occurrence on 20 green lanes (farmland tracks with un-sealed surfaces, bordered on each side by hedgerows) and on 20 paired single hedgerows during the 2002 breeding season in Cheshire, UK. Measures of bird abundance, territories and species richness were all found to be significantly greater on green lanes than on single hedgerows. Significantly more birds were also found to occur on the inside rather than on the outside of green lanes in terms of abundance and species richness. All measures of bird occurrence on green lanes were influenced by hedge width and surrounding land use. Bird abundance on single hedgerows was influenced by the number of trees and amount of hawthorn in the hedge. Seventeen of the 18 most abundant bird species recorded in this study were found to occur in greater numbers on green lanes rather than in single hedgerows; for half of these species the difference was significant. The importance of green lanes for birds, and other wildlife is discussed, as well as their possible future within the UK landscape. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cleary, Daniel F.R.; Genner, Martin J.; Boyle, Timothy J.B.; Setyawati, Titiek; Angraeti, Celina D.; Menken, Steph B.J.				Landscape Ecology	20	8		989-1001	December 2005	2005				English	1	35	A comprehensive understanding of variables associated with spatial differences in community composition is essential to explain and predict biodiversity over landscape scales. In this study, spatial patterns of bird diversity in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, were examined and associated with local-scale (habitat structure and heterogeneity) and landscape-scale (logging, slope position and elevation) environmental variables. Within the study area (c. 196 km2) local habitat structure and heterogeneity varied considerably, largely due to logging. In total 9747 individuals of 177 bird species were recorded. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) revealed that the best explanatory models of bird community similarity and species richness included both local- and landscape-scale environmental variables. Important local-scale variables included liana abundance, fern cover, sapling density, tree density, dead wood abundance and tree architecture, while important landscape-scale variables were elevation, logging and slope position. Geographic distance between sampling sites was not significantly associated with spatial variation in either species richness or similarity. These results indicate that deterministic environmental processes, as opposed to dispersal-driven stochastic processes, primarily structure bird assemblages within the spatial scale of this study and confirm that highly variable local habitat measures can be effective means of predicting landscape-scale community patterns.

Seigel, Alison; Hatfield, Colleen; Hartman, Jean Marie				Urban Habitats	3	1		87-116	December 2005	2005	http://www.urbanhabitats.org/issues.html			English	0	1	Tidal marshes located in urbanized regions have experienced a long history of degradation. As a result, restorations have frequently been conducted to improve the habitat quality of these marshes. Few studies, however, have investigated the effect of restoration on avian community composition in urban tidal marshes. To this end, we conducted avian surveys for one year prior to restoration and three years after restoration at Harrier Meadow marsh, in the Hackensack Meadowlands, New Jersey. After restoration, avian species richness and abundance increased, while evenness decreased, mostly due to large flocks of sandpipers sporadically visiting the marsh during migration. Prior to restoration, generalists were by far the most abundant foraging guild, while they shared dominance with mudflat and open-water foragers after restoration. Avian surveys were also conducted for three years after restoration at Mill Creek marsh, also in the Meadowlands. Though the restoration goals were the same for Harrier Meadow and Mill Creek, the two marshes had distinct habitat compositions after restoration, and this allowed us to examine avian response to variation in habitat availability. In all three years of monitoring after restoration, Harrier had a greater avian density and higher species richness than Mill Creek; however, avian abundance at both marshes was dominated by the same three foraging guilds. Evenness did not differ across post-restoration years or between marshes. Avian abundance showed a decreasing trend during the three years of postrestoration monitoring; however, further monitoring will be necessary to determine the long-term trends in the avian community.

Rimmer, Christopher C.; Lambert, J. Daniel; McFarland, Kent P.				VINS Technical Report	05-05			1-27	December 2005	2005				English	0	4	Bicknell's Thrush is one of eastern North America's most rare, at-risk migratory songbirds, believed to number no more than 50,000 individuals across its restricted and highly fragmented breeding range. The species is a habitat specialist, nesting in the U.S. only in fir-dominated montane forests generally above 900 m in elevation. These forests face numerous threats that include global climate change, atmospheric deposition of acidic ions and mercury, recreational ski area development, telecommunications tower construction, and wind turbine development. On its Greater Antillean wintering grounds, Bicknell's Thrush is largely restricted to moist, primary broadleaf forests, many of which have been severely reduced in extent and are poorly protected. The species is inadequately monitored by traditional sampling methods such as the Breeding Bird Survey, and estimates of breeding or wintering densities are unreliable at best. An elevation-based model of Bicknell's Thrush habitat in the U.S. indicates 136,250 ha of potentially suitable conifer-dominated montane forest habitat. Of this, a total of 3,151 ha of potential Bicknell's Thrush habitat occurs in the Green Mountain National Forest (GMNF), representing 27.2% of all potential habitat within Vermont (11,580 ha) and 2.3% of the species' U.S. habitat. Analysis of 47 mountaintop survey routes censused annually from 2001 to 2004 shows Bicknell's Thrush in a four-year decline, averaging -9.0% per year. Because few timber harvesting operations occur in the montane fir-dominated forests preferred by Bicknell's Thrush, the most promising opportunities on the GMNF for active management exist in areas of habitat that are currently developed for recreation, telecommunications, or wind power facilities. Measures to minimize or mitigate possible impacts of activities that may alter Bicknell's Thrush habitat include: 1) restricting timing of activities to before 15 May or after 1 August; 2) avoiding areas where natural disturbance, either chronic or random, could maintain suitable habitat; 3) striving for a "no net loss" habitat mitigation process; 4) consolidating small, adjacent habitat fragments into single, larger blocks on developed peaks; and 5) conducting vegetation management on ski areas or other managed sites to maintain and enhance appropriate habitat for Bicknell's Thrush. A coordinated Conservation Strategy for Bicknell's Thrush should include 1) continuation of standardized, long-term population monitoring and demographic research; 2) development of a spatially explicit Population Viability Assessment; 3) development of spatially explicit density estimates from the GMNF and the species' entire breeding range, to enable accurate calculations of total population size; 4) small-scale experimental manipulations of forest stands above 2500' in the GMNF for the purpose of developing habitat improvement techniques for Bicknell's Thrush; 5) formation of a species management team to oversee and guide conservation planning for Bicknell's Thrush on the GMNF, and throughout its breeding range; 6) formalization of an international consortium that includes GMNF, VINS, and other U.S. and Hispaniolan partners, to plan Hispaniolan conservation projects that target Bicknell's Thrush; and 7) collaborative development of informational materials on the GMNF and elsewhere that showcase Bicknell's Thrush habitat management efforts and educate the public about montane forest ecology and conservation.

Michael				Wildlife Society Bulletin	33	4		1432-1439	Winter 2005	2005				English	1	9	The southeastern United States population of the painted bunting (Passerina ciris) has decreased approximately 75% from 1966-1996 based on Breeding Bird Survey trends. Partners in Flight guidelines recommend painted bunting conservation as a high priority with a need for management by state and federal agencies. Basic information on home range and survival of breeding painted buntings will provide managers with required habitat types and estimates of land areas necessary to maintain minimum population sizes for this species. We radiotracked after-second-year male and after-hatching-year female buntings on Sapelo Island, Georgia, during the breeding seasons (late April-early August) of 1997 and 1998. We used the animal movement extension in ArcView to determine fixed-kernel home range in an unmanaged maritime shrub and managed 60-80-year-old pine (Pinus spp.)-oak Quercus spp.) forest. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we estimated an adult breeding season survival of 1.00 for males (n = 36) and 0.94 (SE = 0.18)for females(n=27). Painted bunting home ranges were smaller in unmanaged maritime shrub (female: kernel (x)over bar> = 3.5 ha (95% CI: 2.5-4.51; male: kernel (x)over bar> = 3.1 ha (95% CI: 2.3-3.9)) compared to those in managed pine-oak forests (female: kernel (x)over bar> = 4.7 ha (95% CI: 2.8-6.6); male: kernel (x)over bar> = 7.0 ha (95% CI: 4.9-9.1)). Buntings nesting in the managed pine-oak forest flew long distances (>=300 m) to forage in salt marshes, freshwater wetlands, and moist forest clearings. In maritime shrub buntings occupied a compact area and rarely moved long distances. The painted bunting population of Sapelo Island requires conservation of maritime shrub as potential optimum nesting habitat and management of nesting habitat in open-canopy pine-oak sawtimber forests by periodic prescribed fire (every 4-6 years) and timber thinning within a landscape that contains salt marsh or freshwater wetland openings within 700 m of those forests.

McCracken, Jon D.				Biodiversity	6	3		20-29	November 2005	2005				English	1	10	Grassland birds, in this study defined as species that are wholly or mostly dependent upon upland grasslands for their survival, have experienced the most pronounced declines of any other group of birds on the North American continent, and the declines appear to be continuing unabated. Widespread declines of farmland birds are also occurring in Great Britain and western Europe, largely due to the intensification of agricultural operations. Habitat loss has been the major driving force for declines of grassland birds up until the last 50 years when the intensification of mechanized agricultural operations, along with increased habitat fragmentation that is associated with larger "industrial" farm sizes, became strong factors Other threats to grassland birds come from invasive species and planting of exotic grasses, urbanization, residential development, oil and gas extraction, wind power development, excessive predation/parasitism, fire suppression that results in succession to shrubland, ground water depletion, development of transportation corridors, use of pesticides, and rodent eradication programs. No single management approach or conservation solution will benefit the entire suite of grassland bird species across large geographic regions. Just stabilizing populations of grassland birds at their present levels presents a huge conservation challenge.

Brazilian Journal of Biology	65	4		683-695	November 2005	2005				English	0	2	The effects of fire on the composition of a bird community were investigated in an Amazonian savanna near Alter-do-Chao, Para (Brazil). Mist-net captures and visual counts were used to assess species richness and bird abundance pre- and post-fire in an approximately 20 ha area. Visual counts along transects were used to survey birds in an approximately 2000 ha area in a nearby area. Results using the same method of ordination analysis (multidimensional scaling) showed significant effects of fire in the 20 ha and 2000 ha areas and strongly suggest direct effects on bird community composition. However, the effects were different at different spatial scales and/or in different years, indicating that the effects of fire vary spatially and/or temporally. Bird community composition pre-fire was significantly different from that found post-fire. Using Multiple regression analysis it was found that the numbers of burned and unburned trees were not significantly related to either bird species richness or bird abundance. Two months after the fire, neither bird species richness nor bird abundance was significantly related to the number of flowering trees (Lafoensia pacari) or fruiting trees (Byrsonima crassifolia). Since fire is an annual event in Alter-do-Chao and is becoming frequent in the entire Amazon, bird community composition in affected areas could be constantly changing in time and space.

Alderman, Jolyon; McCollin, Duncan; Hinsley, Shelley A.; Bellamy, Paul E.; Picton, Phil; Crockett, Robin				Landscape Ecology	20	7		857-870	November 2005	2005				English	1	32	Landscape configuration and dispersal characteristics are major determinants of population distribution and persistence in fragmented habitat. An individual-based spatially explicit population model was developed to investigate these factors using the distribution of nuthatches in an area of eastern England as an example. The effects of immigration and increasing the area of breeding quality habitat were explored. Predictions were compared with observed population sizes in the study area. Our model combined a nuthatch population simulator based on individual behaviour with a grid-based representation of the landscape; nuthatch life cycle and immigration parameters were user selectable. A novel aspect of the model is user-selection of habitat perceptual range. Using a realistic set of parameters, the number of breeding pairs predicted by the model matched observed numbers. According to model simulations, the main cause of nuthatch scarcity in the study area was the inability of patches to support viable populations without immigration from elsewhere. Modelled habitat management, which increased breeding quality habitat in existing woods, lowered the threshold above which the study area population became self-sustaining. The existence of a large core habitat area was critical in producing a self-sustaining population in this landscape, the same area in dispersed small woods failed to sustain populations.

MacDonald, Michael A.; Apiolaza, Luis A.; Grove, Simon				Forest Ecology and Management	218	1-3		277-290	October 24 2005	2005				English	1	15	Birds were surveyed before logging and approximately 10 years after logging in dry sclerophyll forest in Tasmania at a site where retained vegetation corridors in the form of wildlife habitat strips (WHS) of 100 m width and streamside reserves (SR) of 40 m width had been established. Similar surveys were done in nearby extensive forest. After logging, both categories of retained vegetation corridors had lower bird species richness (per count) and abundance that was not observed in the extensive forest. Compositional change was less obvious between the survey periods. Inferential statistics were not performed on individual species' abundances, but absolute counts of some species are discussed. Logging-sensitive species, such as the golden whistler (Pachycephala pectoralis), satin flycatcher (Myiagra cyanoleuca) and the hollow-nesting green rosella (Platycercus caledonicus) persisted in corridors after logging. However, a small number of species, including the dusky robin (Melanodryas vittata), yellow wattlebird (Anthochaera paradoxa) and strong-billed honeyeater (Melithreptus flavicollis) declined in or disappeared from both logged areas and wildlife habitat strips. Retained vegetation corridors maintain a slightly depauperate version of the pre-logged avifauna, and differences in abundances might be expected to lessen as the surrounding matrix of native regeneration matures. Both wildlife habitat strips and streamside reserves are considered to have conservation value for avifauna in the study area, although we recommend more attention be paid to the provision and value assessment of wildlife habitat strips in upper slope habitat.

Bambalov, N.; Kozulin, A.; Rakovich, V.				Stapfia	85			221-232	6 Oktober 2005	2005				English	0	0	The peatland formation and peat accumulation factors combination was not the same in the different Belarus regions, therefore the peatland sizes, peat deposits, peat stocks of various types and the territories general swamping are essentially different. Peatlands occupied 2,939.000 ha or 14.2 % of the total area of Belarus. The Belorussian experts classify mires depending on the water-mineral nutrition conditions and the growing vegetation. There are three mire types depending on these criteria: low-moor (eutrophic or fen), transitional (mesotrophic or poor fen) and high-moor (oligothrophic or bog). The low type peat deposit area in Belarus is 81.6 % (2,103.800 ha), transitional is 3.4 % (106.200 ha), high one is 15.0 % (333.700 ha). The necessity of mires and peat deposits protection is stipulated both by vast mires territory in Belarus and by the results of large-scale peat extraction and drainage amelioration, resulting in more than 40% of already drained initial areas and biospheric processes destabilization. Many unique mire landscapes and habitats of a great number of biological diversity species were eliminated. The functions of Belarusian mires to preserve landscapes and biological diversity, atmospheric air purification from carbon dioxide excess and its saturation with oxygen, and special role of mires to form the climate, hydrological regime and quality of waters on large regions is obligatory as new regard of their assessment in media formatting role.

Shirley, Susan M.; Smith, James N.M.				Biological Conservation	125	4		475-489	October 2005	2005				English	1	33	Buffer strips are strips of forest retained along streamsides after harvesting to mitigate negative impacts of forestry on aquatic and riparian fauna and water quality. The capacity of riparian buffer strips of old-growth forest to maintain species richness and abundance of natural bird communities was explored in coastal montane forest on Vancouver Island, Canada. Breeding bird communities in buffer strips of varying widths along rivers were compared with controls of equivalent area in uncut old-growth riparian forest to identify shifts in species richness, diversity, abundance and composition. We observed that effects on riparian bird communities were greatest in very narrow buffers with high amounts of edge habitat. Several forest-interior species were found almost exclusively in wider buffers and abundances dropped dramatically between wide (125 m) and medium (41 m) width buffers with replacement by open-edge species in narrow buffers. Species composition of communities in wide buffers were very similar to controls while narrow buffers shared less than half of their species with controls. Species richness and diversity increased in buffers over the three years while remaining constant in controls. Increases in species richness and abundance within buffers were positively correlated with similar increases in the adjacent clearcuts, suggesting that regeneration in clearcuts may facilitate recolonization of forest in remnant buffers. For the forest-interior species found primarily in wide buffers, buffers >100 m may need to be retained. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Smucker, Kristina M.; Hutto, Richard L.; Steele, Brian M.				Ecological Applications	15	5		1535-1549	October 2005	2005				English	8	99	Fire can cause profound changes in the composition and abundance of plant and animal species, but logistics, unpredictability of weather, and inherent danger make it nearly impossible to study high-severity fire effects experimentally. We took advantage of a unique opportunity to use a before-after/control-impact (BACI) approach to analyze changes in bird assemblages after the severe fires of 2000 in the Bitterroot Valley, Montana. Observers surveyed birds using 10-minute point counts and collected vegetation data from 13 burned and 13 unburned transects for five years before fire and three years after fire. We compared changes in vegetation variables and relative bird abundance from before to after fire between the set of points that burned and the set of points that did not burn. The magnitude of change in vegetation variables from before to after fire increased with fire severity. The relative abundances of nine bird species showed significantly greater changes from before to after fire at burned points compared with unburned points. Moreover, when burned points were separated by whether they burned at low, moderate, or high severity, an additional 10 species showed significant changes in relative abundance from before to after fire at one or more severities. Overall, almost twice as many bird species increased as decreased significantly in response to fire. We also found changes in abundance between one year after and two years after fire for most species that responded to fire. Thus, species that have been termed "mixed responders" in the literature appear to be responding differently to different fire severities or different time periods since fire, rather than responding variably to the same fire conditions. These findings underscore the importance of fire severity and time since fire and imply that both factors must be considered to understand the complexities of fire effects on biological communities. Because different bird species responded positively to different fire severities, our results suggest a need to manage public lands for the maintenance of all kinds of fires, not just the low-severity, understory burns that dominate most discussions revolving around the use of fire in forest restoration.

Walter, Scott T.; Maguire, Chris C.				Journal of Wildlife Management	69	4		1578-1591	October 2005	2005				English	1	18	We examined cavity-nesting bird use of natural snags (n = 221) and 10- to 12-year-old snags (n = 836) created by topping mature conifers in 3 silvicultural treatments (group-selection cuts, 2-story regeneration harvests, clearcuts with retained trees) and 2 snag arrangements (clustered, scattered) in 30 Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands in the Oregon Coast Range. Eight bird species nested in created snags. Open-canopy stands (2-story and clearcut treatments) had higher levels of avian nesting, species richness, and species diversity compared to closed-canopy, group-selection stands. We did not find a difference in nesting levels between clustered and scattered snags. In created snags, most active nests were in the top 25% of the bole, cavity entrances typically faced northeast, and the presence of dead branches did not alter use of snags for nesting. Topped conifers that remained alive (n = 102) were rarely used for nesting or foraging. Since the last survey 6 years prior to our survey, the number of cavities per created snag per silvicultural treatment increased 3.3- to 6-fold, and we observed 4 additional avian species nesting; 3 were secondary cavity nesters. Total cavities per snag averaged 5.1, 4.3, and 2.5 for created snags, natural snags >12 years old, and natural snags 12 years old, respectively. Only I created snag fell in the decade since topping. Natural new snag recruitment resulting from residual green tree mortality was highest in 2-story stands (0.76 snag/ha) and lowest in clearcuts, (0.20 snag/ha). Snags created by topping large conifers provided nesting and foraging structures for cavity-nesting birds under a range Of silvicultural conditions, and use was influenced more by residual green tree density than snag arrangement. In addition, created snags increased in value for birds through their first decade (88% had cavities). Because snags created by topping last long and are readily used by birds, they should be considered a management option to improve avian habitat in managed forests.

Shochat, Eyal; Patten, Michael A.; Morris, Douglas W.; Reinking, Dan L.; Wolfe, Donald H.; Sherrod, Steve K.				Oikos	111	1		159-169	October 2005	2005				English	2	30	Ecological traps occur when habitat selection and habitat suitability (measured in terms of fitness) are decoupled. We developed a graphical model based on isodar theory to distinguish between an ideal distribution and an ecological trap. We tested the model's predictions using data on breeding bird populations in managed tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. Between 1992 and 1996 we monitored success for 2600 nests of 26 breeding species in undisturbed, grazed, and burned and grazed plots. We also sampled arthropod biomass and nest predator abundance. Using the isodar model we determined that managed plots are ecological traps: compared with success on plots left undisturbed, nest success on plots that were only grazed was lower, and success on plots that were burned and grazed was substantially lower. Yet birds preferred to nest on managed plots, where arthropod abundance was measurably higher. Reptiles were the most abundant taxon of nest predators, and their abundance was highest in managed plots. Consequently, tree-nesting species had higher nest success than shrub- and ground-nesting birds. Nest success also increased with tree height. We concluded that isodar theory is a useful tool for detecting ecological traps if any component of fitness is measured in addition to animal densities. Our study also suggests that (1) human modification of the environment may alter simultaneously food and predator abundance, (2) the former affects nest site selection and the latter nest success, and (3) such ecosystems are likely to become traps for breeding birds.

Arctic	58	3		295-304	September 2005	2005				English	0	11	Breeding birds (songbirds, shorebirds, and ptarmigan) were surveyed at the Ekati Diamond Mine in Canada's Northwest Territories from 1996 through 2003. Surveys were conducted on permanent, 25 ha mine and control plots. Five metrics (relative density of individual species, relative density of all birds, species richness using rarefaction curves, and species diversity using two indices) were used to assess potential impacts up to a distance of 1 km from the mine. Six species were more common on mine plots, and three were more common on control plots. Species diversity was slightly higher on mine plots when measured with Fisher's alpha index. No other metrics suggested strong impacts. This study suggests that the mine has had a relatively limited impact on the upland breeding bird community within 1 km of the footprint but has provided habitat for at least one synanthropic bird species. Further monitoring of breeding birds on the tundra should include pre-development control data and demographic variables such as reproductive success and survival.

These stands are spatially mixed with timber forests. The objective was to evaluate richness and density of birds in timber Nothofagus pumilio forests and their unproductive associated environments, and discuss forest management implications. These stands showed significant differences in their forest structure, which generate a great variety of ecological environments. A total of 1881 individuals belonging to 30 bird species were observed during the sampling, in spring and summer seasons. These species were mainly migratory and insectivores, Passeriforms being the most important group. From 12 to 17 birds/ha were found, which varied with the forest environments and seasons. Timber stands of Nothofagus pumilio support a low number of bird species. Most of them are opportunistic and a few prefer these woods over other forested or afforested areas. Low bird density and richness characterize these austral forests, which share their diversity with a high variety of ecosystems along Patagonia. Timber N. pumilio forests has a marginal value for bird species conservation, considering its richness, density and the percentage of this forest in the total forested landscape of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina).

Rickel, Bryce				U S Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station General Technical Report RMRS-GTR	135	2		1-12	September 2005	2005				English	0	1	During the 19th and early 20th centuries, people moving westward saw the grasslands as a land that could fulfill their dreams of new homes, new opportunities, and new freedoms. The settlement of the grasslands brought many changes that affected wildlife. These changes include conversion of wild habitats to agriculture and urban areas, and the dissecting of the landscape with roads, fences, and rails. This land conversion and dissection have resulted in habitat loss and fragmentation. Another drastic change to the grassland has been the alteration or loss of riparian habitats and wetlands, affecting many wildlife species that use riparian areas or are riparian obligates. Introduction of farm and ranch livestock has imposed another change by subjecting native species to competition pressures that they had not evolved with. Natural predator-prey relationships have been disrupted as many predators were greatly reduced in number or extirpated because they prey on livestock. Conversely, populations of some prey species have been reduced, at times intentionally, because they were and are deemed as a pest and a nuisance. Another change that has altered grassland ecosystemshas been fire suppression. Suppression of fire has result in changes in the structure and species composition of the vegetation and, consequently, has influenced the wildlife species of the grasslands. In light of the many, often dramatic, changes people have made to the grassland ecosystems mentioned above and which will be discussed in more detail in the following chapters, it is worth repeating the words Over time, many of the wheels and cogs (biological diversity, predator-prey relationships, competition, wild habitats, and so forth) in the grassland ecosystem have been changed, broken, or replaced, resulting in a system that does not work as well as it had originally evolved to work. Consequently, it is wise for land managers to work with the components of the system that are present and strive to have them working as well as possible. The information in this volume is intended to help manage the wildlife and fisheries components of the grassland ecosystems. of Aldo Leopold (1949: 190): The last word in ignorance is the man who says of an animal or plant: "What good is it?" If the land mechanism as a whole is good, then every part is good, whether we understand it or not. If the biota, in the course of eons, has built something we like but do not understand, then who but a fool would discard seemingly useless parts? To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering. Over time, many of the wheels and cogs (biologicaldiversity, predator-prey relationships, competition, wild habitats, and so forth) in the grassland ecosystem have been changed, broken, or replaced, resulting in a system that does not work as well as it had originally evolved to work.

Despite the abundant information on avian use of, and reproductive success in, strip habitats during the breeding season, few studies have examined the potential value of field borders for wintering birds. We planted 89.0 km of field borders (6.1 m wide) along agricultural field edges on one-half of each of three row crop and forage production farms in northeastern Mississippi. We sampled bird communities along these field edges during February-March 2002 and 2003 using line-transect distance sampling and strip transects to estimate density and community structure, respectively. We used Program DISTANCE to estimate densities of Song (Melospiza melodia), Savannah (Passerculus sandwichensis), and other sparrows along bordered and non-bordered transects while controlling for adjacent plant community. Greater densities of several sparrow species were observed along most bordered transects. However, effects of field borders differed by species and adjacent plant community types. Diversity, species richness, and relative conservation value (a weighted index derived by multiplying species-specific abundances by their respective Partners in Flight conservation priority scores) were similar between bordered and non-bordered edges. Field borders are practical conservation tools that can be used to accrue multiple environmental benefits and enhance wintering farmland bird populations. Provision of wintering habitat at southern latitudes may influence population trajectories of short-distance migrants of regional conservation concern.

This study investigated relationships between such factors and total richness of breeding birds based on data from four studies within highly forested landscapes in the southeastern United States (Arkansas, South Carolina, and West Virginia) that were managed for commercial forest products. Habitat attributes were developed from forest inventory data and other information at the stand level and in circular buffers with radii of 250, 500 m, and I km around each sample point. Species accumulation curves for all study sites indicated greater richness in the youngest stands, with greater landscape age heterogeneity, and with proximity of sample points to roads. However, bird richness was not related to distance to nearest water or stream density at any scale. Pine forests had the most species at two of three sites where pine forests occurred. Stand biomass and basal area were generally not predictive of avian richness. Watersheds within the Arkansas site under more intensive management showed greater bird diversity. Overall, forest management appeared to have a positive effect on total bird richness. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Forest Ecology and Management	214	1-3		331-343	August 3 2005	2005				English	0	36	Forest management influences both stand and landscape structure. While research exists on stand-scale habitat relationships for cavity-nesting birds, there are few studies at the landscape scale. In a managed forest, we characterised the influence of local vegetation on the occurrence of cavity-nesting bird species and determined whether landscape scale variables explained any of the remaining variation. We selected three spatial extents for investigation based on the species' natural history: (1) local (100 m radius); (2) meso-scale (300 m radius); (3) macro-landscape (1000 m radius). Variables at the larger scales generally explained little of the species occurrence once we controlled for local factors. The occurrence of boreal chickadees, red-breasted nuthatches, hairy woodpeckers, and yellow-bellied sapsuckers was explained by variables solely at the local scale. Two species most commonly associated with younger stands, northern flicker and downy woodpecker, were influenced by variables at both the meso-scale and macro-landscape scales, although the amount of variance explained by the greater of these extents was small. We speculate that the comparatively strong influence of meso-scale variables may be due to the larger home range size of these two species. Sites that are appropriate at the stand level could remain unoccupied if the area of suitable habitat is not extensive enough to contain an entire home range. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Komdeur, Jan; Pels, Mariette D.				Biological Conservation	124	1		15-26	July 2005	2005				English	0	20	Management policies to save threatened species are not always successful, often due to the lack of a scientific basis and evaluation of the species response. We describe the ecological studies and the conservation actions taken between 1985 and 1992 on Cousin Island (29 ha, Seychelles) to safeguard the future of the highly threatened Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), which until 1988 only occurred on this island. A detailed field study was designed to (1) identify the key processes influencing warbler demography, (2) identify appropriate management techniques to increase the warbler population, and (3), assess the influence of the resulting habitat management. Since 1980 the island has been saturated with c. 115 territories and c. 320 birds. The warbler is purely insectivorous. Morinda (Morinda citrifolia), the most insect rich tree, is preferred for foraging. The higher the insect abundance (and Morinda cover) in territories the higher the reproductive success and survival of warblers. Insect numbers were highest in the central part of Cousin and decreased towards the coast. Coastal territories protected by a salt tolerant hedge of Scaevola (Scaevola taccada) had more insects and higher reproductive success than unprotected territories. Between 1990 and 1992 Morinda trees were planted on the island and Scaevola along the coast. Although these habitat restoration measures have not resulted in higher numbers of adult warblers and territories due to habitat saturation, they have been successful in terms of improving the quality of existing breeding territories and with that the reproductive success of breeding birds (including the number of territories producing recruits), and the exchange of individuals (genetic material) between territories. We provide evidence that the high reproductive potential of this species is likely to improve the resilience of the species to catastrophic events. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pons, Pere; Bas, Josep M.				Ardeola	52	1		119-131	Junio 2005	2005				English	0	15	Aims: To evaluate the occurrence of open-habitat and steppe-land bird species in Western Mediterranean burned areas and to assess the role of the extent and location of the fire on species richness and composition. At the species level, the relationship was explored between habitat breadth, distribution extent and the ability to occupy recently burned areas. Location: Iberia and Southern France Methods: Fieldwork and bibliography were assembled to obtain breeding bird inventories for 21 burned areas, mostly large wildfires (135-23,800 ha). The sampling effort was standardized in relation to the area in the I I fire locations surveyed using transects. Results: Single burned areas contained 0 to 15 open-habitat species (mean = 7.6), and in all the areas combined there were 22 species, including 17 with an unfavourable conservation status in Europe. The most frequent were Carduelis cannabina, Lullula arborea, Alectoris rufa, Oenanthe hispanica and Emberiza cia, but characteristic steppe-land birds such as O. leucura, Calandrella brachydactyla and C. rufescens also bred in particular burned areas. After controlling for the extent of the species range in the Spanish distribution Atlas, passerine occurrence in burned areas was positively related to the species' habitat breadth in a gradient of unburned habitats. Cluster analysis separated a species-poor group of fire locations from a species-rich group, and showed that some neighbouring areas had a similar species composition. However, there was no spatial autocorrelation between burned areas, and species composition was correlated with the fire extent (Mantel test). Species richness tended to increase with increasing fire area. From the regression equation 5, 9, 12-13 and 16-17 open-habitat species may be expected to occur in burned areas of 100, 1000, 10,000 and 100,000 ha, respectively. Conclusions: This study stresses the importance of biogeographical constraints on colonisation of new habitat patches created by disturbances. The extent of the fire rather than the proximity between burned areas influenced species richness and composition of open-habitat birds in recently burned areas. The best post-fire colonisers were generalists regarding habitat structure. The role of large wildfires in the conservation of threatened open-habitat birds seems to be significant and merits further study.

Estratificacao vertical de coleopteros caropfilos (Insecta: Coleoptera) em fragmentos florestais do sul do Estado de Minas Gerais, Brasil.	Goncalves, Teresa T.; Louzada, Julio N.C.				Ecologia Austral	15	1		101-110	June 2005	2005				Spanish	0	0	Fragmentation is one of the most important issues for conservation challenges. Habitat fragmentation results in the interruption of many biological processes that are essential for keeping the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems. The maintenance of habitat structure and its consequences in diversity is highly connected to spatial heterogeneity. There are many studies about spatial heterogeneity of habitats concerning horizontal effects; however, a new focus is given to vertical resource distribution, considering that half of the world's biological diversity must be sheltered in the canopy. This study was conducted in 4 Atlantic forest fragments near the town of Lavras, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and its main objective was to analyze the diversity and vertical distribution of carpophylous beetles (Insecta: Coleoptera) inside and between forest patches. At each forest fragment, beetles were sampled in 2 consecutive days, at 2 distinct points at least 50 m apart. Traps were baited with fermented banana and exposed for 24 h in 4 different strata of the canopy (1.5 m, 4.5 m, 7.5 m and 10.5 m high). A total of 1236 beetles were sampled (86 species from 19 families). The most diverse families were Nitidulidae (26.4% of the species), Staphylinidae (20.7%) and Cerambycidae (9.2%). We observed a significant difference in the vertical distribution of composition of species and structure of the analyzed communities, with the upper stratum presenting a higher species richness and relative abundance. Explanations for the distribution observed are discussed regarding the availability of food resources and microhabitat characteristics. Species distribution among fragments was not homogeneous, being probably the result of the differences present in areas, shapes and conservation levels of the sampled fragments.

Lourenco, Pedro M.; Granadeiro, Jose P.; Palmeirim, Jorge M.				Journal of Applied Ecology	42	3		477-486	June 2005	2005				English	2	21	1. Despite covering a relatively small area on a global scale, estuarine tidal flats are vital to many aquatic bird species during much of the yearly cycle. Small-scale features of tidal flats, such as water drainage channels, can influence the carrying capacity of estuarine wetlands, yet their ecological impact is poorly understood. In this study we evaluated the influence of drainage channels on the quality of feeding habitat for waders in the Tagus estuary, Portugal.2. We measured the abundance of seven wader species at five distance classes from drainage channels, and analysed the variation in peck rates, step rates, turning rates and success rates. In addition we measured the density of macroinvertebrate prey and the sediment physical-chemical characteristics at different distances from the channels.3. All wader species occurred at higher densities near the channels. In the study area 44% of the birds fed on just 12% of the available surface, less than 5 m away from drainage channels. Wader foraging behaviour also suggests a greater feeding effort near the channels.4. While the characteristics of the sediments did not change significantly with distance from channels, prey abundance corresponded closely with wader abundance, suggesting that the small scale distribution of birds on the tidal flats may be related to the presence of their prey.5. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the areas around drainage channels are particularly important feeding sites for waders foraging on tidal flats. Consequently, managers of estuarine wetlands should strive to preserve or improve channel networks. This can be achieved by (i) preserving saltmarshes and saltpans adjacent to tidal flats, (ii) minimizing the reclamation of upshore flats and (iii) avoiding embankments and canalizations of inland water flows that reduce the number of water entry points onto tidal flats.

Jones, Stephen G.; Gordon, David H.; Phillips, Gary M.; Richardson, Bruce R.D.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	33	2		422-434	Summer 2005	2005				English	2	18	Although golf course construction significantly alters natural wildlife habitat, the resulting remnant, disturbed, and introduced landscape patches may provide valuable habitat for birds. Considering the current rate of new course construction, the effects of land consumption and habitat alteration on breeding bird communities in coastal South Carolina are of immediate concern. During summer 2000 and 2001, we sampled 24 golf-course landscape units (GCLU) to assess their value to the breeding bird community. We defined a GCLU as the legally owned parcel of land where a golf course was sited, including the course and all associated development (e.g., residential housing). Sample units (n=24) were selected to represent a gradient of GCLUs ranging from low to high landscape alteration and were subjectively classified a priori into I of 3 alteration groups (G1 (low), G2 (medium) or G3 (high)). We conducted Analysis of Variance procedures to determine whether estimations of species richness, Neotropical migrant richness, and degree of conservation concern differed across the gradient. We explored relative strengths of associations between landscape structure (landscape composition and spatial configuration) and avian community parameters at 2 spatial scales using stepwise multiple regression techniques. We used simple linear regression to assess the relationship between percent forested area of the GCLU and avian community parameters. Total number of species and number of Neotropical migrant species, as well as degree of conservation concern of the species present, were higher in less-altered GCLUs (F2,2114, P0.05), and were significantly influenced by percent forested area (adj. R2 = 0.9-0-57). The majority of birds associated with less-developed landscapes were woodland and scrub-shrub breeding species, while urban-breeding species were found primarily in the more-altered landscapes [chi]2=440.3, df=6, n=4757, P0.001). The area of forest and disturbance patches, size variability in managed turfgrass patches, and measures of spatial complexity proved most useful in explaining variability of response variables due to landscape structure (adj. R2=0.57-0.90).

Merola-Zwartjes, Michele; DeLong, John P.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	33	2		435-447	Summer 2005	2005				English	1	15	The goal of our study was to determine how golf courses in the desert environment impact the indigenous bird community and, particularly, to see whether golf courses may serve as surrogate riparian habitats for southwestern birds. We compared the avian communities on 5 golf courses in the Albuquerque, New Mexico area (4 traditional and 1 "naturalistic") to those of 5 paired natural areas that served as reference sites. We surveyed birds using breeding-season point counts over 2 years and measured several habitat characteristics of each site. In agreement with most other studies of urbanization effects, we found that bird abundance was greater on 4 out of 5 golf courses. In contrast to many studies of urban birds, we found that both total species richness and species diversity was higher on the golf courses in 3 out of 5 cases, and indigenous species richness was higher on all 5 of the golf courses. Of the bird species unique to the golf-course communities, 74% were riparian associates. Although they had high numbers of indigenous species, most of the individuals on golf courses were relatively common generalist species. The naturalistic golf course that was dominated by native vegetation had greater indigenous bird species richness, diversity, and abundance when compared to its reference site and all of the other courses. We conclude that golf courses do have the potential to support riparian bird communities but that their conservation potential can be enhanced through the addition of habitat complexity and structure.

Rodewald, Paul G.; Santiago, Melissa J.; Rodewald, Amanda D.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	33	2		448-453	Summer 2005	2005				English	0	20	The red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) once was a common species in much of the Midwest and eastern North America in oak (Quercus sp.) savanna farmlands, and other open habitats with trees. This species has experienced a range-wide population decline over the last century that likely is associated with changes in land management within agro-ecosystems and loss of oak savanna. structural similarities with natural habitats used by the species, we expected that golf courses could provide suitable breeding habitat for red-headed woodpeckers. From mid-May to early August 2002 and 2003, we censused red-headed woodpeckers on 100 randomly selected golf courses in northern and central Ohio, measured habitat characteristics at each course and surrounding each active woodpecker nest, and monitored nesting success of breeding pairs. We recorded 158 adult red-headed woodpeckers on 26 of the 100 censused courses. Golf courses used by redheaded woodpeckers contained trees that were 12% larger in diameter and had approximately twice as many hard-mast trees (e.g., oaks, hickories (Carya sp.), American beech (Fagus grandifolia)), standing dead trees (snags), and dead limbs as courses without woodpeckers. Habitat measurements at 49 active nests indicated that nest patches contained roughly twice as many hard-mast trees, snags, and dead limbs as non-nest habitat plots over the entire course. Most nests (67%) were located in dead limbs of live trees, rather than in snags. Of 16 nests monitored on courses, 75% successfully fledged >=1 young, and this was comparable to 10 nests monitored off courses, for which 80% successfully fledged >=1 young. Our findings illustrate that highly modified habitats, such as golf courses, could play a valuable role in the conservation of wildlife associated with open, disturbance-maintained woodlands, including the declining red-headed woodpecker.

LeClerc, Joshua E.; Cristol, Daniel A.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	33	2		463-470	Summer 2005	2005				English	0	6	We surveyed the avian communities of 87 golf courses during the 2002 breeding season to determine whether golf courses provided significant habitat for birds of conservation concern in Virginia. We defined birds of conservation concern as those with breeding priority scores >=16 in our region, as classified by partners in Flight (2002). The species richness and relative abundance of birds on golf courses varied widely, but in general, courses supported few birds of conservation concern. We found that a typical course had 7 species of conservation concern at a relative abundance of 2 birds of conservation concern per hectare. This compared unfavorably to richness and relative abundance values found at reference landscapes selected to represent the land that golf courses replaced in this region. Because some golf courses had >3 times as many species of conservation concern as others, we compared the land cover on the richest and most depauperate golf courses in an attempt to explain what attracted birds of conservation concern to some courses but not others. Proportions of forested land within the golf-course boundaries and within 1.5 km of the center of the course were the best predictors of a course's conservation value. Our results suggested that 1) regional planners should not expect typical golf courses to provide more habitat for birds of conservation concern than alternative land uses, including residential or agricultural uses; and 2) designers of golf courses in this region can increase the conservation value of courses by increasing the amount of forested land on the course.

Wildlife Society Bulletin	33	2		494-506	Summer 2005	2005				English	1	21	Previous work on gradients of human-altered landscapes has identified golf courses as potentially valuable areas for wildlife conservation. We assessed 6 golf courses in and around Oxford, Ohio that were surrounded by varying degrees of land-use intensity and studied bird communities within these courses to identify factors that promote diverse bird assemblages. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) and aerial photography to estimate percentages of different land-cover types surrounding each course using buffers at scales of 100-1,000 m. We also measured onsite vegetation characteristics within 50 m of the same points used for bird sampling. We used simple linear regressions between each environmental variable and bird community statistics (abundance, species richness, Shannon diversity, and evenness) to determine which variables had the most influence on bird communities. We found that landscapes surrounding golf courses were the most important determinants of bird diversity and on-site variables were relatively unimportant. Specifically, natural land-cover buffers (forests, riparian areas, and open water) promote bird diversity and residential cover reduces diversity, especially in small buffers immediately surrounding courses. Results were similar when we limited the bird data set to Neotropical migrants or to birds with declining population trends.

Pons, Pere; Wendenburg, Clara				Animal Conservation	8	2		183-193	May 2005	2005				English	1	31	We studied the influence of vegetation structure and tree phenology on bird communities along a gradient of tropical forest degradation in NW Madagascar. Birds were censused by point counts at Ankarafantsika, one of the largest remnants of the severely reduced dry deciduous forest. The original forest was dominated by foliage insectivores. A few years after wildfire, regrowth was dense, most forest bird species were still present and additional understorey species appeared. As a result, species richness and abundance per point count increased. In contrast, when forest was transformed into savanna, the avian assemblage became poor, dominated by granivores and aerial insectivores, with only seven species shared with the original forest. Foliage volume, grass volume and bare ground cover explained most of the bird community variation by means of canonical correspondence analysis. Birds tended to increase their habitat breadth along the forest-savanna gradient. An index of bird conservation value, including abundance, endemism and the threatened status of the species, was highest in burned forests (1.12), intermediate in unburned forests (1) and lowest in savanna (0.44). The results emphasise the urgent need to protect not only the undisturbed fragments, but also the burned dry forests, because of their high value for biodiversity.

Biological Conservation	123	1		91-101	May 2005	2005				English	3	38	We show how Chilean forest bird species richness, abundance and guild structure changes as a function of structural properties of forest stands. We surveyed bird assemblages in two old-growth (>200 years), two mid-successional (30-60 years), and two early-successional forest stands (4-20 years), from November 1999 to September 2000, on Chiloe Island, southern Chile (42[degree]S). Birds were grouped into four habitat-use guilds: large-tree users, vertical-profile generalists, understory species, and shrub-users that occasionally use forests. We recorded a total of 24 bird species: 21 in old-growth, 14 in mid-successional and 16 in early-successional stands. Large-tree users and understory birds were most abundant in old-growth stands, vertical-profile generalists were common in both old-growth and mid-successional stands, and shrub-users were only common in early-successional stands. For nine bird species we found significant relationships between their local abundance and forest structural elements. Higher bird densities in old-growth forests were associated with greater availability of canopy emergent trees, snags, logs and understory bamboo cover in this habitat. Accordingly, bird species diversity in forest stands can be predicted by the presence of these structural elements, and forests should be managed to conserve structural elements that create favorable habitat for bird species in order to prevent future species losses due to logging practices.

Wethered, Robyn; Lawes, Michael J.				Biological Conservation	123	1		125-137	May 2005	2005				English	1	26	Bird species composition (61 species) of Afromontane forest fragments (n = 19) embedded in a natural grassland matrix or a plantation forestry matrix were compared. Forest bird assemblages in a natural grassland matrix displayed a nested non-random species distribution. Species loss was significantly area-dependent and predictable. Assemblages in the plantation-dominated matrix were also nested but were neither area- nor isolation-dependent and these potential processes had equal influence over bird species composition. Forests patches 50 ha in plantation were more species rich than those in a grassland matrix and visa versa for patches >50 ha. The effect of the matrix is revealed here with arboreal plantation cover promoting dispersal across the landscape, favouring abundant generalist bird species in smaller patches than expected in the plantation matrix, and the loss of some specialists and species living at low densities from large (>50 ha) patches. Because of a significant species-area relationship and possible area-dependent extinction, the largest forest patch in the nested series in a grassland matrix protects most bird species (89%). However, in a plantation matrix the absence of a species-area relationship requires the combination of many larger forest patches to protect most bird species. Plantation forests in the matrix significantly alter forest bird assemblage structure and composition. To avoid the effects of insularisation and to maintain the viability of bird communities in Afromontane forests requires conservation of the larger forests in a natural matrix. However, for forests in a plantation matrix, the management of dispersal processes by manipulation of the matrix may be as important to conserving species and communities as is minimising extinctions. Avoiding placing plantations near large forests, increasing the size of small patches, and where afforestation is unavoidable, placing plantations in the vicinity of small rather than large. forest patches, are preferable management practices.

Brotons, Lluis; Pons, Pere; Herrando, Sergi				Journal of Biogeography	32	5		789-798	May 2005	2005				English	3	25	Aim Two main mechanisms may explain post-disturbance species colonization patterns of early successional habitats such as those originated by wildfires. First, post-disturbance colonization is not limited by the dispersal ability of the species to reach the newly created open areas and, secondly, colonization is limited by dispersal. Under the first hypothesis, we expect, at a regional scale, to find similar post-disturbance communities to develop on recently burned sites. However, colonization limited by dispersal will lead to strong between-site variations in species composition.Location To test these hypotheses, we studied the post-fire colonization patterns of nine open-habitat bird species in eight distantly located wildfires in the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula.Methods We censused post-fire bird composition by means of field transects and identified potential colonization sources from species-habitat suitability maps derived from atlas data.Results Our results showed strong significant differences in post-fire species composition between burnt areas. Burnt areas located in areas with low probability of species presence before the fire event showed lower species occurrence and richness after the fire.Main conclusions These results do not support the idea that early successional stages and open habitats have a homogeneous community structure at regional scales and suggest that dispersal is a key constraint determining bird colonization of post-fire habitats. Further attention should be paid to landscape heterogeneity as a key factor in determining population dynamics of open-habitat species in the light of current and future land-use changes in Mediterranean regions.

Hanley, Thomas A.; Smith, Winston P.; Gende, Scott M.				Landscape and Urban Planning	72	1-3		113-133	April 30 2005	2005				English	3	61	We review results and implications from recent wildlife studies that followed from the 1997 Tongass Land Management Plan (TLMP) and identify information needs and directions for research, development, and application. Sustained population viability of wildlife species was identified as a major issue in the TLMP planning process. Several species were identified as management indicator species, and research was conducted to determine their potential sensitivity to forest management. Southeastern Alaska was found to be a region with an especially high degree of endemism in its small mammal fauna, principally because of the combination of its archipelago geography combined with highly dynamic glacial history. Two species of endemic small mammals selected for demographic study, however, appeared to be less dependent on old-growth forests than had been suspected at the time TLMP was written: the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) because of relatively high suitability of noncommercial, low-volume, mixed-conifer forest; and the southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) because of relatively high suitability of precommercially thinned young-growth forest. The northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) was found to be problematic for "management indicator" status because of logistical difficulties involved in monitoring this relatively rare, highly mobile species that frequently changes nest sites. Sampling protocols were developed for marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), although murrelet populations do not appear to be in trouble on the Tongass. The conservation strategy of TLMP for American marten (Martes americana) appeared to be sound on Chichagof Island where marten have been studied intensively, but implications for the rest of southeastern Alaska were unclear without further work. Studies of the Alexander Archipelago wolf (Canis lupus ligoni) indicated that population density of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and road access (to wolf hunters) were the predominant factors affecting wolf productivity and mortality, respectively. Finally, studies of bird community response to timber-harvest alternatives to clearcutting indicated that although creation of forest "edge" may increase nest predation rates, the actual response depends on a broad array of factors and is highly variable. We suggest that research, development, and application focus on plant and animal communities and management of vegetation to achieve specific objectives for wildlife habitat. We suggest that such efforts emphasize silviculture of second-growth forests, understanding old-growth reserves, distribution of endemic small mammals, and alternatives to clearcutting. Models for evaluating black-tailed deer habitat and populations are needed for subsistence-hunting management, and some work needs to be directed at interactions between tourism and selected wildlife species.

In this scenario, an alternative agricultural practice that may reduce the impacts of fragmentation in outer landscapes is a perforation process, which involves conservation in agricultural fields surrounded by continuous forests. Such practices enhance the positive impact of ecological services on fields. In this study we analyzed the biological diversity state in perforation fields and their surrounding forests. The analysis was done using dung beetles as biological indicators. A nested pattern in dung beetles distribution was found, which ordered the surrounding continuous forest sites as the ones with the highest species richness, followed by the perforation fields, and placed the fragmentation practice fields (continuous agricultural fields surrounding forest patches) with the lowest one. Indicator species for perforation fields and surrounding continuous forests were chosen. In general, perforation practice fields differed in composition, based upon functional groups richness and identity; it also contained a higher species richness than the fragmentation practice. Agricultural practices that enhance biological diversity conservation such as perforation, should be recommended and considered in natural resource management by local communities in order to take advantage of ecological services that otherwise may be gradually lost.

Tomialojc, Ludwik; Wesolowski, Tomasz				British Birds	98	4		174-193	April 2005	2005				English	0	0	As a result of some 500 years of protection, parts of the Biatowieza Forest, in Poland, remain in a near-primeval condition. Studies of the breeding birds in the core part of the forest (Biatowieza National Park) over 29 years show that the bird community is species-rich but that densities of individual species are usually low, resulting in only moderate overall densities. In some species, low densities are a consequence of large territories and social exclusion, but more often they reflect the undersaturation of habitats by birds, despite superabundant food supply and nest-sites. Low productivity, resulting from high nest predation, may contribute to undersaturation. Species composition and numbers of birds fluctuate within relatively narrow limits, with the populations of closely related species fluctuating either independently of one another or in parallel; interspecific competition for resources plays a minor role. Some attributes of the Biatowieza ecosystems resemble conditions in undisturbed tropical forests but contrast sharply with those in fragmented, temperate secondary forests. The present Biatowieza avifauna provides a glimpse of that existing in central European forests before their historical transformation by humans.

Ortega, Catherine; Ortega, Joseph; Walton, Joshua				Colorado Birds	39	2		56-63	April 2005	2005				English	0	1	The Missionary Ridge Fire of 2002 burned 70,662 acres in southwest Colorado. In the summer of 2003, we conducted bird censuses, monitored nests, and investigated nest site selection by Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) around Vallecito and Lemon reservoirs, La Plata County, Colorado. We conducted censuses from 9 May through 25 July on three transects with 26 plots on unburned sites and five transects with 47 plots on burned sites. The mean number of Hairy Woodpeckers was significantly higher on burned sites (0.26 +/-0.35 individuals/plot) than unburned sites (0.07 +1-0.12 individuals/plot). All Hairy Woodpecker nests were found within the burned sites. We sampled vegetation within 12.5 m of all Hairy Woodpecker nests and at random plots. Compared to randomly available habitat, Hairy Woodpeckers selected nest sites with taller nest trees, shorter distance to nearest dead tree, higher percent of live ground matter, more dead deciduous trees (mostly dead Quaking Aspen, Populus tremuloides), and more emerging aspen saplings.

Landscape and Urban Planning	71	2-4		263-275	March 28 2005	2005				English	4	40	Most insights about the effects of residential development on wildlife are based on research from urban and suburban areas. Yet exurban development is an increasingly prevalent form of human settlement in many parts of the world. Moreover because such development often occurs near the periphery of protected areas, it may have a disproportionate influence on native species. We examined bird community patterns in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado across a gradient of exurban development to determine how avifauna responded to this form of settlement. Using fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed the occurrence and abundance of breeding birds in 11 developed sites and in 6 nearby undeveloped sites, all occurring in a forested matrix. We sampled ground-level habitat features at each survey point and derived digital land-cover maps from aerial photographs to characterize and quantify road development and building density. We found little evidence that land-cover varied with development intensity, yet bird abundance increased significantly with building density. Patterns of species richness were equivocal due to a highly influential observation. Principal components analysis (PCA) distinguished two axes that explained nearly 50% of the variation in the bird community and were strongly associated with road and building density. Weighted average analysis showed a marked decline in the abundance and richness of species that were insectivorous or nested in snags, suggesting that reductions in dead wood may have influenced the bird community. However, no conclusions could be drawn because dead wood was confounded with building density. Logistic regression of species occurrence and building density indicated that the incidence of some generalist species increased with building density, whereas the incidence of specialists decreased. Overall, our results suggest that development at low densities can favor habitat generalists. Similar patterns have been observed in more urbanized areas. If exurban development persists as a popular form of settlement in the Rocky Mountains, a regional plan for protecting avian habitat and limiting development dispersion will be necessary to maintain native bird communities.

Lohmus, Asko; Remm, Jaanus				Acta Oecologica	27	2		125-128	March 2005	2005				English	1	16	We experimentally tested whether the lack of high-quality nest holes may limit the number of secondary cavity-nesters in cavity-rich habitats. We mapped and measured natural tree-holes in 10 mature aspen forests in Estonia. In five experimental plots, we provided nest-boxes on trees having suitable cavities for hole-nesting passerines. This improved the quality of available cavities but retained their total number (due to territoriality, sites in the same tree could not be occupied simultaneously) and location on the landscape. In the next breeding season, the density of hole-nesting passerines increased in experimental plots but remained at the same level in control plots. The increase was due to the species that used boxes: Parus major that preferred these over natural cavities, and Ficedula hypoleuca that used both nest types more opportunistically. We concluded that the quality of cavities can influence the numbers of hole-nesting birds in old cavity-rich forests, also; probably, adaptive habitat selection is the proximate mechanism in this case.

There were 20 times more birds detected and 3 times as many species detected in forest-riparian sites than in grass-riparian sites. There were over three times as many species observed in forest-riparian sites as grass-riparian sites. Not all species were associated with trees or shrubs. and not all that were associated with trees or shrubs were riparian dependent. A significant curvilinear relationship was detected between tree cover and winter bird species richness. Based on this relationship we hypothesize that providing 10-15% of a square km in tree cover would maximize winter bird richness within the range of conditions that we sampled.

Moser, Ann J.; Ratti, John T.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	33	1		273-284	Spring 2005	2005				English	0	7	The value of riparian zones to nongame birds and islands to nesting waterfowl has been well documented. Therefore, we predicted that nongame birds would have higher densities and nest success on riverine islands because they would be better protected from predators. Furthermore, because larger islands may support resident mammalian predators, we hypothesized that nest success would decrease with increasing island size. In 1998 and 1999, we compared breeding bird density, nest success, habitat, and potential nest predators between islands (n=44) and mainland sites (n=44) on the middle Snake River in Idaho and Oregon, USA. Ground-, shrub-, and tree-nesting guilds had higher densities on islands, while island was a significant predictor in 5 of 10 species-habitat models. Despite this trend, neither daily survival rates of nests by nesting guilds or proportion of riparian cover types were different between islands and mainland sites. We also could detect no relationship between nest-survival rates and island size. Our camera study on artificial nests demonstrated that nongame-bird nests were available to a wider range of predators than those typically identified in waterfowl studies. Nest predators such as deer mice (Permomyscus maniculatus) and squirrels (Sciurus spp.) often were resident on even the smallest islands. Black-billed magpies (Pica hudsonia) likely were a major nest predator along the Snake River, where they were found in extremely high densities. We also observed a trend toward higher brown-headed cowhird (Molothrus ater) densities and parasitism rates on islands. Influence of landscape-level factors, such as river morphology and land use, on the distribution and abundance of nongame birds and nest predators requires additional research. Our research demonstrated that agencies managing islands for nesting waterfowl should not assume that those same islands also provide refuge for nongame birds.

Gjerde, Ivar; Saetersdal, Magne; Nilsen, Trygve				Biodiversity and Conservation	14	2		377-393	February 2005	2005				English	4	39	In a comparative study we investigated woodpecker abundance in forest landscapes with different proportion of native pine forest and spruce plantations in western Norway. In 100 circular study plots of 100 ha each we recorded 38 white- backed - Dendrocopos leucotos, 22 grey- headed - Picus canus, 13 great spotted - Dendrocopos major, 6 green - Picus viridis, and 2 lesser spotted - Dendrocopos minor woodpeckers in the breeding season. The mean number of recorded woodpecker species peaked at 20 - 40% spruce plantations. The two most common species in the study, the white- backed and the grey- headed woodpeckers are both Red-listed species in Norway and among the rarest woodpeckers in Europe. The white- backed woodpecker preferred plots with higher than average proportions of standing dead trees and deciduous trees, and low proportions of spruce plantations in the plots. The grey-headed woodpecker preferred plots in the western ( coastal) parts of the study area with presence of large aspen Populus tremula trees. Logistic regression models did not reveal any clear threshold values with respect to proportion of spruce plantations in plots, although both woodpecker species were extremely rare in plots with > 60% spruce plantations. We recommend spruce plantations to be kept at moderate levels to ensure viable populations of woodpeckers in western Norway.

An experimental assessment.		Cruz-Angon, Andrea; Greenberg, Russell				Journal of Applied Ecology	42	1		150-159	February 2005	2005				English	2	59	1. Coffee is produced in tropical regions of the world, largely in Latin America. Coffee cultivation techniques range from traditional systems, where coffee grows under a diverse canopy of shade trees (shade-coffee plantations), to modern systems, where coffee grows without any type of shade (sun-coffee plantations). Shade-coffee plantations provide refuge for forest fauna in otherwise deforested landscapes. The conservation value of these agro-ecosystems depends upon their structural and floristic diversity.2. The way coffee producers manage the vegetation, including the epiphytic component, may profoundly affect the value of plantations for conserving biological diversity. Shade-coffee certification programmes have emerged to verify that coffee advertised as 'shade grown' is actually grown on highly biodiverse plantations. Although these programmes universally encourage epiphyte protection from pruning (a common practice), there has been no experimental evaluation of the importance of epiphytes in supporting faunal diversity. We report the effect of experimentally removing epiphytes on the bird assemblage in a shade-coffee farm near Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico.3. We established two matching pairs of epiphyte removal and control plots. We compared bird diversity and abundance, based on daily censuses during the breeding and non-breeding season. We used existing information on the way in which birds use epiphytes as foraging and nesting substrates to explain the presence of different species in plots with epiphytes.4. Plots without epiphytes tended to be less diverse than plots with epiphytes, but rarefaction analysis and ANOVA showed no significant differences in species richness between treatments in any of the seasons. Mean bird abundance was significantly higher in plots with epiphytes during both seasons, and a multidimensional scaling analysis showed that bird community structure differed between the two treatments.5. Eighteen forest bird species were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. Three non-forest species were more common in plots without epiphytes. Resident bird species that used epiphytes as a nesting substrate were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes.6. When epiphytes are removed, canopy cover, foraging substrates, nest sites and nest materials are eliminated and microclimatic conditions change. This could increase predation on adult birds and nests, increase intra- and interspecific competition, and decrease individual survivorship.7. Synthesis and applications. This is the first experimental assessment of the importance of epiphytes for birds. Shade-coffee plantations with epiphytes maintain higher abundance and diversity of the inhabitant bird fauna than plantations without epiphytes. This study reinforces the value of positive epiphyte management as an important factor in shade-grown coffee certification, where the goal is to promote biodiversity conservation.

Maeda, Taku				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	105	1-2		347-351	January 2005	2005				English	0	6	Bird communities in flooded rice strips of different widths were surveyed in 71 fields around Lake Kasumigaura, on the Kanto Plain (central Japan). Strips categorized into four width classes (<50, 50-100, 100-300 and >300 m) and two locations (core>100 and <100 m from edges) were censused from May to July 1998, and mean species number and density of birds were compared. Both density and mean species differed significantly between classes, strips >300 m wide favoring bird diversity and number of marsh and grassland species. Breeding skylarks and fan-tailed warblers hardly occurred in fields adjacent to edges. Strips <50m wide were not suitable feeding site of egret species (Ardeidae), but supported diurnal activity of black-crowned night herons and species requiring both rice fields and adjacent environment. As a consequence, bird conservation in rice field strips needs to consider both their width and location within the environment. [copyright] 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Applied Soil Ecology	28	1		1-13	January 2005	2005				English	5	77	Legume-based pastures generally rely on soil biological activity to provide nitrogen (N) for plants. This study examined seasonal pasture growth in nine adjacent hill pastures, under sheep or beef. with different long-term managements, including certified organic, no fertilizer, and conventional fertilizer application, that formed a sod-fertility sequence. We determined relationships between net N mineralization, as a measure of soil biological activity and N availability, and microbial biomass, soil organic matter, and fauna. Net N mineralization generally explained differences in pasture production (r = 0.87). On an areal basis, net N mineralization was strongly related (r = 0.93) to total soil N (0-200 mm depth) and negatively related (r = -0.92) to soil C:N ratio, but not to soil C. Total N and C:N ratios were related to soil phosphorus (P) status and probably past N fixation by legumes. Where labile P was low, the N:P ratios of both soil microbes and enchytraeids were wide, and the organisms appeared to be P limited, possibly competing with plants for P. Faunal grazing on soil micro-organisms appeared to release P. We could find no convincing evidence that net N mineralization, pasture growth or soil biological diversity increased under organic farming. Rather, the data from organic pastures followed similar trend lines to data from pastures under conventional management. [copyright] 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Since then the scope of the project has been expanded to incorporate a basin approach centered on the Upper Mississippi River and intended to rehabilitate ecosystems and abate threats at key sites that cross several spatial scales. A particular emphasis is on spatial strategies that result in cumulative downstream benefits. The use of the best available science, applied in an adaptive and accountable manner, is a fundamental principle of The Nature Conservancy and the Upper Mississippi River Project. This paper briefly explains the mission and work of The Nature Conservancy and then explores a few of the ways we are supporting river science to improve management strategies, influence the vast array of public and private institutions working in this basin, and more effectively direct the allocation of public dollars to conservation.

English	0	0	The Ivory-billed Woodpecker has long held a special place in the psyche of North American conservation, eliciting unusually colorful prose, even from scientists, as an icon of the wild. The reverence in which it was held did little to slow the habitat loss that led to its apparent extinction 60 years ago. A consequence of the emotion and attention associated with the amazing rediscovery of this species is that conservation biologists will be under considerable pressure to make good on this "second chance." This poses a challenge to conservation paradigms that has important political consequences. First, the decline of the species is due to habitat loss, recovery from which has been much more seldom achieved than recovery from declines due to impacts on vital rates. This challenge is exacerbated by the enormous area requirements of the species. Second, the species at best exists as a critically small population. It will be difficult to make the case that a viable population can be established without undermining the small population paradigm that underlies conservation strategies for many other species. This has already resulted in some political backlash. Conservation of this species is best based on the one point of clear scientific consensus, that habitat is limiting, but this may result in additional political backlash because of conflicts with other land uses.

Chris; Warner, Barry G.				Canadian Field-Naturalist	119	1		64-75	January-March 2005	2005				English	0	18	Wetland construction has been an effective means of mitigating wetland habitat losses due to agricultural and other activities. However, the type, variety, and age of the habitats created are often critical components in the success of the wetland when the aim is to enhance the bird community. Hilliardton Marsh was constructed as a series of cells between 1993 and 1997 in boreal eastern Ontario to provide waterfowl habitat. We determined habitat change and monitored breeding-season bird use before construction and one year after the last cell was constructed. Wetland construction resulted in dramatic changes to the vegetation and bird communities. The area was transformed into a variety of wetland habitats, but primarily marsh, one of the rarest wetland types in boreal Ontario. Survey stations with moderate habitat change exhibited the greatest change in bird species richness. Total species richness increased 55% from 56 to 87 species, with obligate wetland birds increasing from 3 to 26 species. Rare birds increased from I I to 27 species, with most as obligate or facultative wetland birds, but also Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus). Bird abundance, as measured by the number of stations where a species was observed, increased significantly for obligate wetland birds. There were no significant losses of species from any bird group, as adjacent upland habitat was preserved. This short-term study has shown that construction of new wetland habitat in boreal eastern Ontario, especially marsh, can significantly increase the numbers of breeding-season birds, including rare species. However, long-term monitoring is required to ensure sustained success of wetland construction projects for birds.	Locky, David A.; 11212 64th St, Edmonton, AB T5W 4H3, Canada, Canada.

Awifauna legowa lesnego rezerwatu przyrody "Przeciszow".	Ledwon, Mateusz				Chronmy Przyrode Ojczysta	61	5		49-58	Wrzesien-Pazdziernik 2005	2005				Polish	0	0	The observations were carried out in "Przeciszow" nature reserve in 2003. The aim of this investigation was to estimate the number of breeding birds. The "Przeciszow" nature reserve (a total area 85.13 ha) is situated in the Valley Oswiecim. It was created to protect an oak-hornbeam forest. The mapping method was used to estimate number of birds (Tomialojc 1980a). There was sample plot (27 ha) situated in the east part of reserve, where density of all species was investigated (Table 1). Over whole area of reserve only rare birds were counted. In the study area 46 breeding bird species were recorded. The total density was 74.8 pairs per 10 ha. The dominant group of birds was hole nesters (33.7 pairs/ 10 ha, 12 species). On the second place were birds nesting in bushes or in trees above 1,5 m high (28.8 pairs/ 10 hal6 species), and next - species nesting on the ground or in vegetation up to 1,5 m high (11,8 pairs/10 ha7 species). In the reserve some rare breeding species were recorded: Collared Flycatcher Ficedula albicollis, Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, Grey-headed Woodpecker Picus canus, Mistle Thrush Turdus visciuorus, Middle Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos medius. The high number of breeding species is result of birds nesting connected with ecotone (15.2% of total number of species). The density of the breeding pairs is average to compare with another plots from oak forest in Poland. It seems that major factors which delimit the number of birds in reserve are: small wood area, age of forest, small number of dead trees. It determine the number of hole nesters. High density was reached by Great Spotted Woodpecker (4.1 pairs/ 10 ha, 11 holes with chicks on census plot). It is the highest density of this species in Poland.

Hodder, Kathy H.; Bullock, James M.				English Nature Research Reports	648			117-168	2005	2005				English	0	2	Naturalistic grazing does not have a formal definition; consequently the term tends to be used loosely. In this report we have attempted to clarify the issue by defining the differences between naturalistic and other forms of extensive grazing for conservation. The principal of linking or expanding sites in order to avert the ecological problems, which are often associated with small isolated reserves, is not in question; nor is the utility of extensive grazing for the management of large sites. The defining difference between naturalistic grazing and other large, extensively grazed conservation management is in the role of 'natural processes'. In the naturalistic approach, there is no specified grazing density, instead herbivore populations are resource-limited. Rather than managing towards targets for habitat and species composition, direct management intervention is reduced to a minimum and the natural process is seen as an aim in itself. The principal issue raised by the naturalistic grazing concept is the unpredictability of outcomes: if the conservation of natural processes becomes the goal, it is then difficult to define targets and to evaluate development of wild areas. The lack of defined goals is incompatible with current management aims based on targets for species and habitats of conservation concern, which are guided by Biodiversity Action Plans, in order to fulfil obligations agreed in the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992). It is not realistic for proponents of naturalistic or wilderness grazing to assume that biodiversity benefits of naturalistic grazing can be forecast by describing the habitats and species found in the landscape that they assume will emerge. In fact there is little theoretical or empirical knowledge allowing prediction of the outcomes of any naturalistic grazing regime. Management within 'acceptable limits to change' may therefore be more realistic than complete non-intervention, but in areas with high biodiversity this may differ little, if at all, from managing to targets. Limits could be set by taking account of both ecological and cultural factors, as well as those imposed on site managers, such as reserve size and 'completeness' (ie the range of habitats available), climate change and airborne pollutants. These latter factors impose a limit to how 'natural' a system can be, because it will unavoidably be affected by inadvertent human actions. Legislative changes would be needed to allow the use of resource-limited herds, and even then, there would be important limits to their potential 'naturalness'. There are unlikely to be adequately large and networked nature reserves to allow seasonal migration, and the absence of large predators has important consequences for grazing behaviour, and hence ecosystem development. It is likely to be very difficult to impose a wilderness ideology on the busy cultural landscapes of Britain, particularly lowland areas. Even in upland areas, it may be the sense of wilderness or 'naturalness' that is sought by the public and site managers. This goal is one of landscape management, rather than naturalistic management, because the main aim is to fulfil a deep psychological need for access to places that appear to be in a state of wilderness. Active management, such as the maintenance of unobstructed views will often be necessary to achieve this aim, and this requirement may conflict with stepping back from intervention. Respondents to the case study questionnaires often expressed an interest in moving away from highly prescriptive target-led management for their landscape-scale projects; however, the potential loss of biodiversity or highly valued habitats was rarely seen as acceptable, and this lead to an impasse for groups and even individuals. More progress was made when accepting that management is for multiple aims, including active conservation of biodiversity and also landscape management to maintain a sense of wilderness. Confusing these separate objectives may make it more difficult to grasp the exciting opportunities we now have for developing large interconnected nature reserves for the benefit of plants, animals and people.

Treslagsskifte fra bjork til gran - okologiske effekte pa faunaen.	Pedersen, Ashild Onvik; Einarsen, Goril				Fauna (Oslo)	57	4		148-159	2004(2005)	2005				Norwegian	0	2	Introduction of spruce, mainly Norway spruce Picea abies, in northern and western Norway have altered the dynamics and structure of the natural forest landscape. Consequently, by either increasing or decreasing the amount of natural habitats and resources important to wildlife communities. The article summarizes ongoing and earlier research at the University of Tromso and the Norwegian Institute of Nature Research, Tromso on ecological effects of tree species conversion on fauna. Relevant results from similar research on the west-coast of Norway are also reviewed. Birch forest is the dominant forest ecosystem in northern Fennoscandia, exclusively distributed in this region. Planting of spruce was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century. In the 1960 and 1970s spruce planting accelerated due to a strong commitment by the Norwegian government in order to supplement the small households in remote locations in northern Norway. From 2003 the state subsidies of spruce planting in northern Norway was stopped, and future planting activity is expected to decrease dramatically. Negative effects from tree species conversion from birch to spruce plantations were found for several bird and mammal groups. Not all effects could be explained only by the large scale alteration of the natural forest landscape, but changes in population sizes and community structure were found for both small mammals and passerine birds. Decrease in population density for both rodents and shrews were found in spruce plantations. Changes in parasite community in shrews also indicated negative effects of the tree species conversion. In the sub-arctic birch forests changes in bird communities were found due to both planting of spruce and regional differences between the study areas. Similar results were found on the western coast of Norway where density and species diversity of both passerines and woodpeckers changed with increasing coverage of spruce plantations. However, the highest species diversity of passerines was found in a mosaic of 40 % spruce plantations and 60 % pine forest (natural forest). For capercailie Tetrao urogallus, the number of lek areas and density decreased with increasing amount of spruce plantations. A recent study on predation on ground nesting birds did not provide evidence for any effect of spruce plantations on predation pressure in sub-arctic birch forests. In continuation of this study, an ongoing study on vertebrate dynamics will further analyse the predator prey relationship in relation to spatial and temporal factors in the forest landscape at different scales. Also data on beetles, snails and earthworms will be analysed at the University of Tromso in order to better understand possible effects from the spruce plantations on the ground and soil living fauna. Today, spruce plantations in northern-Norway are still fairly young (< 60 years). The forest will over the next decades change dramatically. The present and previous research conducted is performed on relatively young stands making it difficult to predict ecological effects when the spruce forest change to older, closed stands. Focus on habitat restoration,protectionand monitoring in order to avoid further fragmentation, habitat loss and edge-effects, will be important forest management perspectives in the future.

Winter, Susanne; Flade, Martin; Schumacher, Heiko; Kerstan, Eberhard; Moeller, Georg				Forest Snow and Landscape Research	79	1-2		127-144	2005	2005				English	0	10	A 'Research and Development Project' in Brandenburg (Germany) running from 1999 to 2003 aimed to define nature conservation standards for the management of lowland beech forests. The avifauna, saproxylic beetle fauna, ground beetles, saproxylic fungi, and the stand structures were investigated in twelve managed near-natural beech forests, and in six that had been unmanaged for 12 to more than 100 years near-natural beech forests to identify bioindicators for near-natural forest stands, which maintain the typical biocoenosis of beech forests. Some selected spotlight-like results are presented in this paper. The results show, for example, striking differences in stand structures between near-natural beech stands and managed forests, close dependence of bird species on silviculture influences and effects of forest developmental phases on ground beetles of beech forests. For instance, near-natural stands are much more structured, richer in dead wood (10-20 times of the volume of managed forests) and are characterised by a much higher abundance of breeding birds, especially wood-inhabiting and beech forest indicator species, as well as some saproxylic fungi species. Saproxylic and ground beetles are characteristic of deciduous forests. Some examples for bioindicators of natural or near-natural beech forests are: 1 High number of special tree structures (e.g. trees with severe crown damage, large cavities, clefts in the stem, scratches and bark bags with/without mould), which are typical attributes of ancient forests and a suitable structural indicator. 2 The Middle Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos medius was identified as a valid indicator for mature beech forests with old trees. The occurrence of D. medius depends on two typical stand structures: a) rough bark structures (typical for old beech trees >200 years), and b) dead wood in parts of the stems or branches of standing trees. 3 Carabus glabratus is suggested as a bioindicator among the ground beetles. 4 Fungi species of the genus Pluteus are significantly more frequent in unmanaged forests. 5 The number of individuals of saproxylic beetle species which are not captured in the managed forests is three times higher than in >50 year-old unmanaged beech forests.

The first part of the book contains short abstracts about species, and the protection of their habitats. In the second part, more detailed overviews are given, to enable understanding the background of every suggested protection measure. Every species is treated in a separate chapter. In the beginning of every chapter, the current status in Estonia and in Europe and the purpose of the conservation of the species are presented, as well as the short summary about its numbers, distribution and breeding phenology. This will be followed by a detailed overview about studies of species' habitats, both in landscape and nest site level, performed in Estonian and elsewhere. Also protection measures used in Estonia and in other countries are introduced. Finally, further protection needs and purposes are discussed, and optimal protection measures are suggested. The suggestions are distinguished as general and concrete actions. General actions should be used for protecting the Estonian population of a species by making strategic decisions in a national level. Concrete measures should be used to save a particular nest site. The latter could not be used, of course, in every single nest site of numerous species, but one should consider using them in nature reserves, and these suggestions could act as guidelines for the landowners caring about the nature.

Mueller, Mathis; Spaar, Reto; Schifferli, Luc; Jenni, Lukas				Journal of Ornithology	146	1		14-23	January 2005	2005				English	0	4	The increasing intensity of farming of meadows is supposed to be the major cause for strong declines of many meadow breeding birds. The whinchat, Saxicola rubetra, a Palaearctic migratory bird, is an indicator species of open grassland farmed at a low intensity. Originally widespread throughout Switzerland, it is now restricted to mountain and subalpine grassland. We document the changes in meadow cultivation in subalpine farmland from 1988 to 2002, and the breeding performance and density of the whinchat. We explored the impact of habitat degradation on the population dynamics of this meadow bird. The cultivation of hay meadows changed markedly within the 15 years: the onset of mowing was shifted forward by about 20 days, and farmers applied new techniques such as silage and irrigation. This shift was more pronounced in the favourable farmland in the valley bottom ( Pradellas) than on the slopes (Vna). The percentage of successful whinchat broods, ranging from 5% to 78% in different years, strongly depended on mowing date on both sites. In spite of earlier mowing, birds did not change their time schedule of breeding. Breeding success in Pradellas was too low to compensate for mortality ( sink population), but because of immigration the number of breeding pairs did not decrease until 2000. Population size may therefore be a misleading indicator of local population viability. Based on the breeding schedule of whinchats at different altitudes, we recommend mowing dates in agreement with the reproductive cycle of ground nesting meadow birds.

Indrawan, M. Kartawinata, K. van Balen, B. Fredriksson, G. Dennis, R. Wulffraat, S. Duckworth, W. Kingston, T.	English	2	20	Deforestation, forest degradation and hunting are having an increasing impact on wildlife in Borneo and many species are threatened. The Indonesian government has pledged to do its best to control these problems, a pledge that has been formalized in a range of laws and international agreements. But despite the need for immediate and definitive actions, achieving conservation goals remains fraught with challenges. Part of the problem is that conservation interest has focused on protected and unlogged forest, but we need to recognise that logged forest is a vital component of any comprehensive approach to landscape-scale conservation. Our review focuses on the ecological and life history aspects of Bornean vertebrates and how these relate to forest management, with a specific emphasis on lowland and hill dipterocarp forest. But ecological studies seldom lead to improved forest management practices. Our review provides three responses to this: 1. Recommendations in the research literature are compiled and translated into management implications. These can be presented to those who need to know about them. 2. Knowing that a species declines with forestry interventions is seldom enough to clarify how forestry practices might be adapted (short of a ban) in order to mitigate the negative impacts. We set out to link species sensitivity with ecological and life history correlates to develop a better understanding of why a given taxon is vulnerable, allowing a more species-specific approach to the protection of habitat characteristics and components. 3. Research needs to answer management relevant questions. We identify priority topics for research. Our primary intention is thus to identify and clarify what makes fauna vulnerable to various kinds of forestry-related interventions. Based on these results, insights and related hypotheses, we compile and develop recommendations for improved management practices and identify priorities for future research. We are pragmatic: we acknowledge the critical role of the socio-political context for implementing our proposals. Yet, while various key issues are raised, the pace of change in Indonesia is currently so rapid and the issues so complex that our discussion of this context cannot resolve all the current and future opportunities. We focus, therefore, on technical ecological information, the validity of which is independent of volatile local politics. We found a considerable body of ecological information relevant to the management of tropical forests and their wildlife. Improving current management practices requires collaborations between ecologists and forest managers to develop pragmatic guidance for improved practices. The present review and synthesis is one component in achieving this collaboration, focusing upon the fauna of the Malinau area in East Kalimantan (Indonesia).In Part I of this book we summarize knowledge concerning various forest interventions and how they affect selected wildlife species. We identify a range of effects caused by timber harvesting, and note the associated influences of hunting and forest fragmentation. Additional problems are caused by exotic species, law enforcement, fires and a range of other factors. Yet despite decades of wildlife research on Borneo there is little information on the magnitude and mechanisms of threats to wildlife. Most studies considered in this book report on autecological studies of various species, but do not analyse species characteristics in relation to different threat levels. Still, we are able to draw various conclusions about the effects of timber harvesting and associated factors on wildlife, and provide general management recommendations. Selective logging has fewer direct negative consequences for many vertebrate species than is sometimes assumed. It certainly affects certain groups of species, like terrestrial, insectivorous birds and mammals, which suffer from the reduced ground cover. This may primarily be caused by the slashing of ground cover and lianas, which is currently required by law. Some species, though, such as deer and banteng, appear well adapted to, and can increase in, the more open habitats that follow logging. Timber harvesting generally brings a number of associated problems in addition to the direct disturbance of forest habitat. Two important aspects, from a wildlife conservation perspective, are increased hunting and forest fragmentation. Hunting can pose a considerable threat to some forest fauna and this threat often increases with forestry roads, increased access to forests and the provisioning needs of camps. Improved hunting technologies and increasing availability of guns add to the pressure. Roads, skid trails and degraded areas fragment forest habitats. Small isolated populations, such as those created by fragmented or heavily harvested landscapes, are at much greater risk of various deleterious effects that can ultimately lead to local extinction. Some species have minimum fragment size requirements for population persistence. Recent research has highlighted the importance of maintaining 'forest-like' habitats, or a network of 'forest stepping-stone' habitats in the intervening landscape. The effects seem likely to be worst in forests with excessive road density, wide clearings, and many large deforested openings. Forest edges can generate signifi cant effects on individual, population, and community dynamics in remaining forest areas. Several studies report that the effects of logging can extend considerable distances into surrounding undisturbed forests. In Part II of this book we analyse species in relation to their tolerance to the effects of logging and forest change. Using multivariate analyses we identify various factors associated with bird and mammal species that are vulnerable to logging interventions. These factors are dietary specialization, restricted feeding strata, endemicity, apparent evolutionary age (those that evolved during the Miocene or Early Pliocene) and absence from small islands. Factors which we found not to be significant in our data set are group size, number of young per litter, body weight and home range size. Terrestrial insectivores and frugivores appear particularly sensitive to timber harvest practices, whereas herbivores and omnivores were more tolerant or even benefited from logging. Based on these fi ndings we provide recommendations on forest management for concession managers, local and national governments, in Part III. We support the application of good conservation planning, good road building and reduced impact logging methods. Specific recommendations include the retention of ecologically important habitat structures (large trees, hollow trees, fruiting species) and locations (salt licks, watercourses). In terms of silvicultural practices we recommend that understorey slashing (currently a legal requirement) be discontinued. We recommend regulating hunting in timber concessions; law enforcement authorities and concession managers must be able to control this. Hunting of vulnerable species would ideally be eliminated. It is important to retain a contiguous forest. Where forest areas are broken up by wide-roads, logging and agriculture, forest corridors should be maintained as much as possible to maximize connectivity within the forest matrix. At the concession level, retaining linear forest elements (e.g., riverine forests) as corridors between forest blocks can increase faunal dispersal and thus the chances of species survival in forest patches. Reducing the width of roads and tracks, maintaining canopy connectivity over roads, and limiting felling-gap sizes, should also reduce the effects of fragmentation on arboreal species. In addition to these more general recommendations, we suggest many specific actions that might help the conservation of several specific species. Examples include the need to set aside sufficiently large areas for protected large carnivores (Malayan Sun Bear, Clouded Leopard), retain large dipterocarp trees for Helmeted Hornbill nesting and for Great Slaty Woodpecker feeding, and regulate collection of freshwater turtles. We highlight, amongst other things, how governments can better support wildlife conservation in forestry concessions. The government has the important task of evaluating the list of species presently protected in Indonesia, as many rare and endangered species are missing from the list (e.g., Straw-headed Bulbul). We call for an operational action plan to ensure that clear conservation goals are effectively implemented at the concession level (current requirements, though well-intended, have little impact on management choices). We find several areas where effective biodiversity-friendly forestry management is limited by our lack of knowledge. In Part IV we focus on this and provide research recommendations. While research will continue to contribute to our understanding of how timber harvesting practices and their associated impacts might be refi ned to benefit wildlife conservation, a lack of knowledge cannot be used to justify delay in implementing our main recommendations. We may not yet be in a position to describe and advocate perfect management, but we can definitely propose substantial improvements of current practices.

Baur, Bruno; Meier, Trudi; Froeberg, Lars; Rusterholz, Hans-Peter				Mitteilungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaften Beider Basel	8			99-114	2005	2005				German	0	1	Knowledge of species richness, number of threatened (red list) species, and of the proportion of specialized species allows an assessment of the conservation value of a particular habitat. Species richness of vascular plants, calcicolous lichens and terrestrial gastropods were examined as indicators for the conservation value of the Rappenflue, a limestone cliff at the eastern edge of the Gempen plateau (northwestern Swiss Jura mountains). A total of 151 plant species were recorded on the plateau, the free-face and the talus of the cliff. Fifteen of the 151 species were specialized rock plants and 4 species are listed in the red list of Switzerland. Twenty-one out of the 31 species of calcicolous lichens found were recorded for the first time in the canton of Solothurn. Fifty-six gastropod species were found, six of them are on the red list of Switzerland. These findings demonstrate the extraordinarily high species diversity of the Rappenflue. However, the sensitive cliff communities are threatened by the increasing impact of recreational activities in this habitat. At some places, damages to the specialized vegetation were recorded at the cliff edge due to frequent picnicking. Different means to preserve the unique biological diversity at the Rappenflue are suggested.

Wykorzystanie osiki Populus tremula przez ptaki w pierwotnych drzewostanach Bialowieskiego Parku Narodowego.	Walankiewicz, Wieslaw; Czeszczewik, Dorota				Notatki Ornitologiczne	46	1		9-14	2005	2005				Polish	0	1	The aim of this work was to establish how often birds of the Bialowieza National Park (BNP) use the aspen Populus tremula for nesting and foraging. Aspens have been revealed to be frequently used by many bird species, despite their share in the BNP stands being fairly low - the proportion of all aspen trees (alive and snags together) of the trunk diameter [double dagger] 10 cm was 0.2% in lime-hornbeam-oak stands, 0.8% in ash-alder stands and 0.4% in spruce-pine forest. Five of the seven secondary cavity nesting birds studied (Starling Sturnus vulgaris, Nuthatch Sitta europaea, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, Great Tit Parus major, Blue Tit P. caeruleus) and also two woodpecker species (Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major, White-backed Woodpecker D. Ieucotos) used the aspen as a nesting tree more often than it might be inferred from its share in the stands. Five of the six species of woodpeckers (White-backed Woodpecker, Great Spotted Woodpecker, Lesser Wood-pecker D. minor, Middle Spotted Woodpecker D. medius, Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius) were also observed to prefer aspen trees as foraging place. In the light of these facts, the policy to re-move the aspen, as seemingly short-living species, which is executed in national parks, finds no scientific grounds. Such a procedure deprives some bird species, e.g. White-backed Woodpecker, of their foraging and breeding places, thus leading to a decline in the biodiversity of protected areas.

I also provide details on the avifauna of the Sipaliwini savanna, which prior to my visit had not been surveyed by ornithologists for at least 20 years. Observations of birds from the interior region add to our knowledge of the distribution and richness of Suriname's avifauna. The Sipaliwini savanna harbors a number of bird species that are not found elsewhere in the Guianas. The savanna itself has a low human population density and is relatively unaffected by the large-scale cattle grazing and frequent fires that have degraded other savanna regions throughout the Neo-tropics. The Sipaliwini appears to contain healthy populations of several species that require late-successional post-fire habitats or are otherwise sensitive to human activity, including the San Parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis) and Rufous-sided Pygmy-Tyrant (Euscarthmus rufomarginatus). Continued protection of the savanna from extensive fire and grazing is urged.

Wes, Jr				Proceedings of the Annual Conference Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies	59			10-16	2005	2005				English	0	0	Loss of pine-grassland communities has contributed to declines in populations of northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite) and red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis; RCW). However, evolving land management priorities on publicly-owned lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) increasingly emphasize restoration of historic cover conditions and habitat for endangered species such as the RCW. These land use changes should benefit pine-grassland species, including bobwhite, but effects are not well understood. Therefore, we monitored abundance and distribution of breeding bobwhites on the Homochitto National Forest of southwestern Mississippi during 1994-1999. We quantified abundance of breeding bobwhites using call counts in three landscapes that differed in extent of land under management for RCWs (low = 7.5%, intermediate = 46.7%, and high = 66.2%). Bobwhite abundance was closely tied to intensity of management. Landscapes with an intermediate and high proportion of stands dedicated to RCW management had relative abundance of bobwhite 46.9% and 232% greater than that observed in landscapes with a low extent of RCW management. RCW management likely enhances bobwhite habitat through maintenance of pine-grassland communities, and when applied to landscapes, has the potential to improve bobwhite populations locally and regionally.

Proceedings of the Annual Conference Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies	59			43-56	2005	2005				English	0	4	Conservation buffer practices implemented under U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farm Bill programs offer opportunities for enhancing breeding season habitat for farmland birds. Recently, CP33 (Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds) was added as a new continuous Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) practice designed to address habitat goals for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) under the Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative. However, it is presumed that this practice will also benefit other birds. To evaluate potential benefits of CP33 field borders for farmland birds, we established a total of 89.0 km of experimental field borders (6.1-m wide) along agriculture field edges on three 405-ha farms in Clay and Lowndes counties, Mississippi. We used 200-m x 20-m strip transects to measure abundance and diversity of birds inhabiting bordered and non-bordered field edges. Indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) and dickcissel (Spiza americana) abundances were nearly twofold greater along bordered field edges. However, mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), and common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) abundances did not differ between bordered and non-bordered field edges. Field borders adjacent to strip habitats (i.e., fencerows, drainage ditches) had greater total bird and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) abundance than non-bordered edges adjacent to strip habitats. Species richness was greater along bordered than non-bordered edges. Within intensive agricultural landscapes where large-scale grassland restoration is impractical, USDA conservation buffer practices such as field borders (CP33) may be useful for enhancing local breeding bird richness and abundance.

Basal area and vegetation coverage were greater in undisturbed forest. The herbaceous cover was greater in the middle strata of the burned forest but fern cover was higher in the understory of undisturbed sites. Tall trees and canopy vines were positively associated to bird species richness. Other associations between vegetation and bird community structure were inconclusive. Overall bird abundance and richness did not differ significantly across treatments.	Flores, Betty; Museo de Historia Natural Noel Kempff Mercado, Av.

Sparks, Robert A.; Hanni, David J.; McLachlan, Megan	Sparks, Robert A.; Hanni, David J.; McLachlan, Megan			Section-based monitoring of breeding birds within the Shortgrass Prairie Bird Conservation Region (BCR 18).				i-iv, 1-173	2005	2005				English	0	2	In 2004, Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory (RMBO) implemented the fourth year of grassland bird-monitoring program within the shortgrass prairie region. During this year, RMBO conducted surveys in four western states (Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma) and five National Grasslands (Cimarron, Comanche, Kiowa, Pawnee and Rita Blanca). The objective of this program is to monitor population trends and distributions of grassland birds within the Shortgrass Prairie Bird Conservation Region (BCR 18) using section-based surveys, a road-based point count technique. A one square mile section is the basic land management unit of the prairie. The section-based survey technique was determined to be the most efficient and effective method for surveying and monitoring grassland birds (Hanni 2002) in a landscape dominated by private ownership. RMBO surveyed 2,414 sections within BCR 18, 15 May - 3 July 2004. Sections were stratified by habitat then randomly selected for survey in proportion to habitat acreage on the landscape - 1,802 sections of native prairie habitat, 552 of dry-land agriculture habitat, and 60 of land in CRP. We observed 115 bird species. Included are 38 species of concern, as recognized by Partners In Flight (2004) and/or the participating state and federal agencies. We calculated density estimates for 49 species, analyzed by management unit, habitat type, percent shrub cover and percent grass cover >15 cm. Included among these density estimates are 22 species of concern, as recognized by Partners In Flight (PIF database 2004) and/or the participating state and federal agencies. We present distribution and index of abundance maps for 62 species. In 2004, we conducted exploratory habitat analyses to determine habitat preferences of eight grassland bird species; Burrowing Owl, Loggerhead Shrike, Cassin's Sparrow, Brewer's Sparrow, Lark Bunting, Grasshopper Sparrow, McCown's Longspur and Chestnut-collared Longspur. Two habitat conditions were used in the analysis, percent shrub cover and percent grass cover >15 cm. We used a chi-square goodness of fit test (alpha .05) to detect significant differences between expected use based on availability and observed use within habitat condition categories. Figures were generated to illustrate significant preferences of habitat conditions by selected shortgrass prairie bird species (Neu et. al 1974, and Byers et. al 1984). Long-term monitoring of Short Grass Prairie BCR region will provide valuable information on trends and distribution within a framework that allows land managers to make cooperative management decisions. Equipped with this information and habitat preferences of prairie birds, units to assess habitat suitability for species of concern. In addition, monitoring birds will provide data that can by applied to monitoring ecosystems, since bird species utilize an inclusive habitat spectrum within ecosystems. As a result bird monitoring provides a cost-effective means for monitoring ecosystems at a variety of scales..

Prior to the early 1990s, the rural landscape was a mosaic of forest, dolomite glades, and pasture but development proceeded rapidly in the 1990s with increased promotion of Branson, Missouri as a vacation and retirement destination. Point count data were collected in areas with native vegetation intact and that are not likely to be developed as the region continues to urbanize (undeveloped sites), and at a 375-ha residential/golf development (developed site). Eleven of 18 regularly-recorded species showed declines, five of them significant, on the developed site relative to their trends on the undeveloped sites. Each of those five species was associated with forest or forest edge habitats. Only one species showed a significant decrease on the undeveloped sites. Notably, some forest species were reduced in the developed site even though patches of forest and other native vegetation remained. We suggest that a regional conservation strategy be developed so that the needs of all species of forest avifauna can be met as urbanization continues its advance on native habitats.

The forest stands were 4- 103 years old, had undergone a clearcut or selective tree removal, and represented four successional stages (early, sapling/pole, mid, and late). Neotropical migrants constituted 60.5 to 69.0 percent of species richness. Mean breeding bird density for all species was 225.1 pairs/40 ha [plus or minus]16.3 se) with an overall mean density for neotropical migrants of 186.2 pairs/40 ha [plus or minus]5.4 se). Late successional cove hardwood forest habitats provide for a significantly more diverse avifauna with respect to the entire avifauna, and, specifically the neotropical migrants, than does sapling/pole or midsuccessional forests. Neotropical migrants are the most substantial avian component of the highly diverse cove hardwood forest habitat, accounting for a minimum of 70 percent of the individual birds in each successional class. Therefore, their needs must not be overlooked in considering the consequences of habitat alterations and management activities.

Engstrom, R. Todd; Palmer, William E.				U S Forest Service General Technical Report PSW	191			1151-1157	2005	2005				English	0	0	Sport hunting for Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) is the reason that approximately 300,000 acres of semi-wild lands still exist in the Red Hills region of north Florida and south Georgia. Use of fire for management and relatively large (400 to 4,000 ha), contiguous land ownerships permitted populations of bobwhite and Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) to persist in the Red Hills as regional populations of these two species declined precipitously. Three factors play important roles in the habitat shared by these species: canopy cover, canopy tree species composition, and ground cover composition. These factors affect quality of fuel, which influences the occurrence of fire (ecological stability) and the costs of land management (economic stability). We used simple habitat models for these species to examine tradeoffs that optimize habitat conditions for each species. Maintaining conditions that enable healthy populations of both species to co-exist into the 21st century will require innovative management tools, including habitat restoration, and serious interest in conservation within the community of landowners.

Threats are ongoing to the remaining sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) shrub steppe areas due to current land-use patterns. The proposed North American Sage-Grouse Management Plan, if implemented, could help manage existing sagebrush habitats used by sage-grouse and other sagebrush-dependent avifauna, restore degraded habitats, and rehabilitate habitats no longer capable of sustaining sagegrouse within the sagebrush habitat type in western North America. The long-term goal would be to restore sagebrush habitats capable of sustaining sage-grouse distribution and abundance at pre-1960 levels. The proposed North American Sage-Grouse Management Plan would have important benefits to other sagebrush obligate species such as Sage Sparrow (Amphispiza belli), Sage Thrasher (Oreoscoptes montanus), and Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri) as well as other avian species that seasonally use shrub-steppe habitats for important life processes.

In 1992, the EU provided the member states with its Agri-environment Regulation 2078/92 to help member states reverse these developments by means of agri-environment schemes. The question is: will the implementation of these schemes be sufficient to restore the biological diversity on farmland? Most studies that have examined the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes have focussed on farmland birds in Great Britain and The Netherlands. So far, the positive effects appear to be limited. Continuous evaluation and adaptation of these schemes is needed to enable the biodiversity on farmland to recover from the EU's former policy.

Although targeted species such as sport fish may benefit, increasingly there are concerns over nontarget species. We assessed the impacts of a drawdown of Lake Kissimmee on Florida apple snails. Prior to the drawdown, we found apple snails at significantly higher densities in sites dominated by sandy substrates and emergent macrophytes: no snails were found in sites with deep layers of unconsolidated organic material and dominated by Nuphar luteum. Following the drawdown. some of the sites containing this unconsolidated organic material were also scraped with heavy equipment (e.g., bulldozer) to remove the organic layer. We monitored the response of 31 snails from one site. most of which were stranded in the dry littoral zone during the 1995-1996 drawdown. Mortality rates of stranded snails were high due to the dry conditions of the littoral zone., but also indirectly due to increased vulnerability to predation by several avian species. The Survival data was corroborated by the 1996 and 1997 funnel trap data wherein our catch declined by 80 % from 1995 (pre-drawdown) levels. The proportion of juveniles also declined significantly, indicating an impact on recruitment. Snail abundance did increase. albeit marginally. in some sites. indicating potential benefits of drawdown and organic Substrate removal in some types of littoral zone habitats. However, the timing of drawdown events appears critical, as evident in poor recruitment and relatively low abundance following completion of lake restoration activity. In order to avoid substantial losses to non-target species such as apple snails, we suggested that natural resource managers give greater consideration to the potential negative impacts of deviating from the natural hydrologic regime in terms of timing, duration, and frequency.

Kolonievogels in grootschalige wetlands: de Donau-delta als voorbeeld de Rijn- en Maasdelta?	Platteeuw, Maarten; Kiss, J. Botond; Zhmud, Michael Ye.; Sadoul, Nicolas				Limosa	77	2-3		79-92	december 2004	2004				Dutch	0	0	During the breeding seasons of 2001 and 2002 two comprehensive surveys of colonially breeding waterbirds (Pelicaniformes and Ciconiiformes) were carried out in both the Romanian and Ukrainian parts of the Danube Delta. Apart from being the first time in history that this internationally important area for these groups of birds was comprehensively surveyed, the aim of this study was to obtain insight in the crucial factors affecting site selection and population size of colonial waterbirds. In 2002, the year with the most complete survey, a total of 209 colonies was found, holding almost 40,000 breeding pairs of 13 species. The most abundant species were Great Cormorant (22,787 pairs), Pygmy Cormorant (9,341 pairs) and Great White Pelican (4,150 pairs). Among the wading birds, remarkable figures included 3,340 pairs of Glossy Ibis, 2,964 pairs of Black-crowned Night-heron, 1,725 pairs of Little Egret and 1,279 pairs of Squacco Heron. For most of the species involved-the survey was rather complete, except for Purple Heron. This is a notoriously skulky breeding bird of inundated reed beds, of which colonies are hard to find, both from the ground and during aerial surveys. Of the total of 236 different colony sites, located during both years, the vast majority was situated in trees (148). A further 60 were found in inundated reedbeds, 16 in reedbeds with sparse trees, 10 on bare ground on islets and two on floating aquatic vegetation. Therefore, all colony sites were well protected against access by terrestrial predators (e.g. Red Fox) and generally well out of the way of human influence. For Pygmy Cormorant and Squacco Heron, two examples of not very far ranging species with well-defined and different feeding grounds, the proximity of suitable feeding habitats (as mapped for the area by Hanganu et al. 2002) to the colony sites was-of some influence on colony size. This and, even more, the fact that most colonies were situated close to the numerous smaller lakes and ponds in the central part of the delta, indicate that, besides safety of the actual breeding site, the availability of feeding areas also played an important role. Probably, the decisions of potential breeders take place on different scale levels. Firstly, a global selection of a suitable area is made on the basis of availability of good feeding grounds within a species-dependent flight range (e.g. 50-60 km for pelicans and up to 10 km for smaller herons). The farthest ranging species also generally have the highest food requirements and therefore need larger feeding areas. For these species, colonies may establish all over the area, but for smaller herons and ibises the area is largely confined to the central part. Within this 'flyable' range, the safest and most isolated sites will be chosen as colony sites. Then, the actual colony sizes will depend on both the availability of safe nest sites within each colony and the carrying capacity in terms of food availability within the daily flight range from the colony site. It is argued that these considerations on site selection and spatial configuration of-feeding. and breeding habitats are fundamental in restoration attempts for man-made river, systems such as the Dutch Rhine and Meuse delta area. Spatial planning of these attempts should not only focus on local conditions but also take into account the actual and potential configuration of wetland habitats on a larger scale	Platteeuw, Maarten; RIZA, Postbus 17, NL-8200 AA Lelystad, Netherlands, Netherlands.	m.platteeuw@riza.rws.minvenw.nl					Zoology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Reproductive Biology	0024-3620		Conservation; Conservation measures; Nutrition; Reproduction; Reproductive behaviour; Ecology; Population dynamics; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe	Aves [Habitat management / Wetlands / Colony breeding site selection & population size significance; Romania & Ukraine] [Food availability /  / Breeding site selection & population size relationships] [Breeding site /  / Selection; conservational significance] [Colonial breeding /  / Site selection & population size] [Population size /  / Breeding colonies; conservation aspects] [Romania / Danube Delta / Breeding colony site selection & population size] [Ukraine /  / ].

Tubelis, Darius P.; Lindenmayer, David B.; Cowling, Ann				Oikos	107	3		634-644	December 2004	2004				English	0	11	This study investigated the influence of the width of patches of native eucalypt forest on bird occurrence in stands of exotic radiata pine (Pinus radiata) forests that surrounded such patches. Boundaries between eucalypt and pine forests were surveyed to examine bird occurrence and species richness at different distances in the pine matrix from eucalypt forest edges. Birds were counted by the area search method within 0.5 ha quadrats at 32 study sites (where sites spanned the boundaries of pine and eucalypt forests). Data were examined using generalised linear mixed models. Species richness and occurrence of particular species in quadrats located within pine forests decreased with increasing distance from eucalypt patches. This resulted, in part, from the fact that several species found in native patches also use pine plantations as additional foraging areas. Species richness decreased more quickly with distance from eucalypt patches in younger than in older pine stands. The width of native forest patches also influenced bird occurrence in adjacent pine forest matrix. Bird species richness decreased more rapidly in exotic plantations adjacent to wide rather than narrow patches of native forest. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have previously reported that dimensions of patches can influence the use of surrounding matrix. We introduce the term "halo effect" for the influence of patch attributes on the differential use of matrix adjacent to native patches. These patterns highlight that conservation efforts in patchy environments should protect not only native patches but also adjacent areas of matrix into which animals extend their home ranges.

Van Dyke, Fred; Van Kley, Sarah E.; Page, Christy E.; Van Beek, Jodi G.				Restoration Ecology	12	4		575-585	December 2004	2004				English	2	44	Recent losses and fragmentation of tallgrass; prairie habitat to agriculture and urban development have led to corresponding declines in diversity and abundance of plants and birds associated with such habitat. Mowing and burning are alternative management strategies for restoring and rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, but their specific, comparative effects are the subjects of ongoing evaluation. We compared the responses of plant and bird communities on four sets of mowed, burned, and untreated sites of small (3-10 ha), fragmented tallgrass prairies at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR), Iowa, U.S.A., during May-July in 1998 and 1999. Species richness and diversity of plants, resident grassland birds, and communities of birds associated with grassland edges (edge species) were independent of treatment. Although not affecting species richness and diversity in plant communities, mowed sites ranked lower in total plant coverage and total forb coverage than burned sites or untreated sites. In contrast, untreated sites had more coverage by shrubs, suggesting that mowing and burning did retard shrub encroachment. Overall, abundance and diversity of plants and birds were generally insensitive to management strategies. Small, fragmented sites of rare habitat may not respond in the short term to management treatments and may not be capable of supporting highly diverse communities, no matter how intensively manipulated. It is more probable that diversity of native prairie communities can be enhanced and restored only through long-term efforts, acquisition of large land units capable of supporting stable populations, and deliberate reintroduction of species of high conservation value.

Nassauer, Joan Iverson				Wetlands	24	4		756-765	December 2004	2004				English	2	77	In an interdisciplinary project to develop protocols for long-term cultural and ecological monitoring of wetland restorations in Minnesota, we compared restored and reference wetlands on several ecological and cultural measures including land-use context, cultural perceptions, and management practices. Cultural measures were drawn from our surveys of visitors, neighbors, planners, and managers of the wetlands. This paper discusses their perceptions of six metropolitan wetlands (four recent restorations and two reference sites), how cultural measures of their perceptions compared with selected site characteristics and biodiversity measures, and what results suggest for wetland design and management. Overall, sites that were perceived as more well-cared-for and as a good place to enjoy nature were perceived as more attractive. In addition, objective site characteristics, like cultural cues and natural landscape context, were related to perceived attractiveness. While plant species richness was not significantly related to perceived wetland attractiveness for our sites, bird species richness was related to attractiveness.

Harrison, Charles A.; Kilgo, John C.				Wilson Bulletin	116	4		314-323	December 2004	2004				English	1	8	Clearcutting is the preferred timber harvest method in bottomland hardwood forests because it is most likely to result in regeneration of preferred species. However, clearcutting generally has negative impacts on forest birds. Patch-retention harvesting may provide similar silvicultural benefits, but its effects on birds are unknown. We surveyed breeding birds in uncut control, clearcut, and patch-retention treatment areas (11-13 ha) for one season prior to harvest and two seasons postharvest in a bottomland hardwood forest in the Lower Coastal Plain of southeastern South Carolina. Bird observations recorded along line transects were analyzed using the software EstimateS to estimate species richness and program Distance to estimate densities. We found greater species richness and bird densities in the patch-retention treatment than in the clearcut in both postharvest seasons. We detected no forest-interior birds in the clearcut after the harvest, but by the second postharvest season in the patch-retention treatment, the density of forest-interior birds had returned to approximately half of its preharvest level. Thus, based on density response, patch-retention harvesting appears to be less detrimental to forest birds than clearcutting. However, additional work is needed to determine whether retained patches influence avian survival and productivity.

Jiguet, Frederic; Villarubias, Stephane				Biological Conservation	120	2		153-160	November 2004	2004				English	1	40	Satellite tracking of black storks was used to estimate home range sizes and to study habitat selection during the breeding season. Breeding and non-breeding adults foraged over very large areas (ca. 54 000 ha for 12 territories), preferentially in woodlands with high number of river sources, mirroring the species needs for high quality water resource. Rearing and post-fledging ranges of breeding partners largely overlapped. Home ranges of non-breeding adults largely overlapped ranges of breeding birds, so that assessing home range size of breeding pairs from observed densities is not reliable. Protection and management of breeding and feeding habitats appear to be the most important conservation measures to be considered. This study allowed to evaluate how large these protected areas should be, and which habitat types they should encompass. Conservation measures for the species in western Europe should include protection of very large forest areas and also focus on managing river networks to ensure a high water quality as far as 20 km away from nests.

Atkinson, Philip W.; Buckingham, David; Morris, Antony J.				Ibis	146		(Suppl 2)	99-107	November 2004	2004				English	1	36	Increases in the intensity of the management of agricultural grasslands over the past 50 years have reduced plant species diversity in swards and increased uniformity in structure through changes in fertilizer regimes, grazing and mowing practices. These factors, as well as increased disturbance and trampling, have reduced the number and diversity of forbs and thus the diversity and abundance of invertebrates, in particular of foliar species. Associated with these changes in management, there has been a large decline in the abundance of many species of farmland birds in pastoral areas and more local extinctions compared with arable areas. To understand the impact of these management changes on bird populations, and design measures to reverse the declines, it is necessary to identify the key factors influencing bird usage of fields. We review results from five studies, which have related fertilizer and grazing management to bird usage of grass fields. Species that fed on soil invertebrates tended to show a positive response to the amount of nitrogen fertilizer added and increased grazing pressure, although there was a high degree of correlation between these two variables. In summer, many species, including corvids, Common Blackbird Turdus merula, Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris, Pied Wagtail Motacilla alba and Hedge Accentor Prunella modularis, showed a negative relationship with sward height, and in winter more species showed a positive relationship with bare ground. Taller sward heights are associated with a greater abundance and diversity of bird invertebrate food resources, and accessibility of food items or a lower risk of predation (actual or perceived) are likely to be the reasons for birds choosing to forage on shorter swards and in areas with more bare ground. Birds feeding on soil invertebrates were found to be generally tolerant of modern management practices that maintain short swards short, as accessibility to the soil has been increased. Species that feed on foliar invertebrates or forb seeds have been affected negatively by modern grassland agricultural practices.

Aviles, Jesus M.				Biodiversity and Conservation	13	11		2015-2025	October 2004	2004				English	1	23	Changes in agricultural policies have favored tree clearing and removal of shrubs to favor intensive farming in the holm oak Quercus ilex dehesas of Iberia. The effect of these changes for bird species wintering in this agricultural landscape has been rarely analyzed. Here the effects are studied of farming changes in traditional holm oak dehesas on population size, social structure and time budget of common cranes Grus grus in eight traditional wintering sites in Spain. The role of acorn availability, the principal winter food of the species, in relation to management is also assessed. The number of cranes in each wintering area was not related to degree of agricultural intensification, nor to the availability of acorns. However, crane flock size decreased, and the relative occurrence of isolated family groups increased in less intensively transformed wintering areas characterized by the predominance of fallow lands. The age composition of crane flocks varied with acorn availability since more juveniles were reported in areas with relatively lower acorn availability. Time budget was also related to acorn availability, since cranes spent relatively more time preening in those wintering areas with higher availability of acorns. Globally evidence suggests the need to maintain the fallow land (posios) to sustain the wintering populations of cranes in Iberia, since this agro-grazing system maintains most of the juvenile cranes using the western migratory route.

Lacki, M.J.; Fitzgerald, J.L.; Hummer, J.W.				Wetlands Ecology and Management	12	5		447-457	October 2004	2004				English	0	3	Data on the response of bird communities to surface mining and habitat modification are limited, with virtually no data examining the effects of mining on bird communities in and along riparian forest corridors. Bird community composition was examined using line transects from 1994 to 2000 at eight sites within and along a riparian forest corridor in southwestern Indiana that was impacted by an adjacent surface mining operation. Three habitats were sampled: closed canopy, riparian forest with no open water; fragmented canopy, riparian forest with flood plain oxbows; and reclaimed mined land with constructed ponds. Despite shifts in species composition, overall bird species richness, measured as the mean number of bird species recorded/transect route, did not differ among habitats and remained unchanged across years. More species were recorded solely on mined land than in either closed forest or forested oxbow habitats. Mined land provided stopover habitat for shorebirds and waterfowl not recorded in other habitats, and supported an assemblage of grassland-associated bird species weakly represented in the area prior to mining. A variety of wood warblers and other migrants were recorded in the forest corridor throughout the survey period, suggesting that, although surface mining reduced the width of the forest corridor, the corridor was still important habitat for movement of forest-dependent birds and non-resident bird species in migration. We suggest that surface mining and reclamation practices can be implemented near riparian forest and still provide for a diverse assemblage of bird species. These data indicate that even narrow (0.4 km wide) riparian corridors are potentially valuable in a landscape context as stopover habitats and routes of dispersal and movement of forest-dependent and migratory bird species.

The habitat suitability model contains three parameters : tree basal area (GHA), number of tree species (NBESS) and tree composition (ESS) (Table 1).'These parameters are estimated by a forest inventory. Observations showed that the habitat suitability indices model performs well for 9 ha plots but is irrelevant for 1 ha plots. The Lesser Spotted Woodpecker requires the presence of a high diversity of tree species, a high density of dead trees and a basal area of more than 15 m2/ha. Dead trees and basal area parameters were used to design multiple logistic regression model. Foresters could use this model as a tool in their forest management.

Laiolo, Paola; Caprio, Enrico; Rolando, Antonio				Biodiversity and Conservation	13	10		1925-1941	September 2004	2004				English	2	16	Forest management modified the original structure of most European forests, and in the most extreme cases, genuinely natural and semi-natural forests were turned into plantations through clear felling and replanting, often using non-native species. We compared the bird community structure of native oak woods of northern Italy with that of their anthropogenic counter-parts: black locust and sweet chestnut woods. The three stand types were compared in terms of vegetation structure, bird species richness, diversity and abundance of foraging guilds. We analysed both the overwintering and the breeding community, to assess whether management had specific seasonal effects on bird diversity. Forestry-imposed disturbances affected bird diversity more consistently in winter than in breeding time: bird species richness and diversity were significantly greater in oak and chestnut stands, which were the preferred habitat for bark foragers and foliage gleaners. In the breeding period, bird diversity of black locust woodlands increased, and inter-stand differences were not significant. At this time of year, understorey gleaners were more abundant in black locust stands (where shrubs were denser). In winter, species richness, diversity and the abundance of several guilds were positively correlated with stand age, whereas in the breeding period canopy gleaners preferred younger woodlots. Despite the lack of inter-stand differences in breeding bird diversity, young-managed woods benefited generalist birds that need no particular conservation efforts. Conversely, priority species for forest conservation such as specialised bark foragers positively selected native and mature stands throughout the year. We suggest that detailed year-round studies on diversity and community composition could sharpen the precision with which it is possible to prescribe conservation measures in forested areas.

Bennett, A.F.; Hinsley, S.A.; Bellamy, P.E.; Swetnam, R.D.; Mac Nally, R.				Biological Conservation	119	2		191-206	September 2004	2004				English	0	37	Small patches of natural or semi-natural habitat have an important role in the conservation of biodiversity in human-dominated environments. The values of such areas are determined by attributes of the patch as well as its context in the surrounding land mosaic. There is a need for better understanding of the ways in which assemblages are influenced by patch context and the scale over which this occurs. Here we examine the influence of regional environmental gradients on the richness, annual turnover and composition of breeding bird species in small woods in south-eastern England. Regional gradients were defined independently of woods by an ordination of attributes for 5 km x 5 km landscape units across a 2100 km2 region. Patch-level attributes, particularly area, were the most important predictors for most bird variables. For woodland migrants and woodland-dependent species, variables representing the context of each wood, either at a local or regional scale, explained significant additional variance in species richness after accounting for wood area, but did not do so for species turnover. Significant context effects for woodland-dependent species related to the extent of hedges and woodland cover in the local vicinity (1 km radius), whereas for woodland seasonal migrants the best predictors of richness after patch area were two regional environmental gradients. The initial cue to settlement for migrants may be at a coarse regional scale, with selection for suitable landscapes that have a greater extent of woodland cover. Edge species showed different responses: they were influenced by the diversity of structural features in woods, and were a more-dominant component of the avifauna in isolated woods in open fenland environments of the region. Significant relationships between coarse regional gradients (25 km2 units) and bird assemblages in small woods (0.5-30 ha) suggest that population and community processes in the avifauna operate across a broader scale than local patch neighbourhoods. They also highlight the importance of adopting a landscape or regional perspective on potential changes to land-use in rural environments, and on the conservation management of small reserves.

Styring, Alison R.; bin Hussin, Mohamed Zakaria				Journal of Tropical Ecology	20	5		495-504	September 2004	2004				English	1	12	We investigated the microhabitat preferences and relative abundances of 13 species of woodpecker in Sungai Latang Forest Reserve, West Malaysia. The availability of suitable microhabitat corresponded strongly with woodpecker abundance, and snags were the most highly preferred foraging substrate across species and study sites. Large amounts of necromass, including snags, were present in 5-y-old logged and unlogged forest, but dead wood was in low abundance in 10-y-old logged forest. The absence or scarcity of large, snag-foraging woodpeckers from older logged stands suggests that this resource may remain in low abundance for a considerable time.

Jobin, Benoit; Belanger, Luc; Boutin, Celine; Maisonneuve, Charles				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	103	3		413-423	August 2004	2004				English	3	31	Riparian habitats play a major role in biodiversity conservation in intensive agricultural landscapes because they represent remnants of both wetland and woody habitats available for wildlife. The importance of herbaceous, shrubby and wooded riparian habitats for the conservation of biodiversity (plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds, small mammals) is well documented for the Boyer River watershed (southern Quebec, Canada). This paper examines their conservation value for these different taxonomic groups at the watershed level and the possible effects on wildlife of various landscape modification scenarios. The overall species richness and insectivorous bird abundance in the watershed would increase markedly if there were more wooded strips in the landscape mainly due to additional plant and bird species. A scenario where all three types of riparian strips would be well-represented in the watershed is most likely to be implemented. This scenario would be the most beneficial to wildlife communities because of high native species diversity within wooded strips combined with the presence of unique species associated with each of the three types of strips. Encouraging landowners to protect existing wooded riparian habitats would be the most effective and cost-beneficial method to maintain current level of habitats distribution in the landscape, and to favour the establishment of new shrubby and wooded strips in the Boyer River watershed.

Breininger, David R.; Oddy, Donna M.				Ecological Applications	14	4		1079-1089	August 2004	2004				English	0	14	The concept of source and sinks can guide conservation, but empirical studies are needed to demonstrate that this concept applies to the real world. We investigated whether the source-sink concept Could help to clarify the influence of habitat potential (scrub ridge characteristics), population density, and fires (shrub heights) on Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) demography and dispersal. We mapped territories and measured survival, recruitment, emigration, immigration, and shrub heights annually for 12 years. We classified territories as oak if they overlapped well-drained ridges, oak-palmetto if they overlapped poorly drained ridges >0.4 ha, and palmetto-oak if they only overlapped poorly drained ridges 0.4 ha. Territory size differed little among these categories but was negatively correlated with the annual number of breeding pairs, which ranged from 12 to 27. Scrub ridge characteristics influenced the locations of sinks and potential sources, whereas population density and fires caused temporal variation in demographic success. Oak territories were usually sources because they were net exporters of individuals and because recruitment exceeded mortality. Oak-palmetto territories sometimes functioned as sources but were often pseudo-sinks because density dependence caused mortality to exceed recruitment. Palmetto-oak territories were true sinks because they were net importers of individuals and mortality exceeded recruitment regardless of population density. All scrub was short (1.2 m) or medium height (1.2-1.7 m), but the spatial arrangement of these height classes changed regularly because fires occurred every 2-7 years. We observed a quadratic relationship between demographic success and the area of medium-height scrub within territories. Territories that had 0.9-1.2 ha of medium-height scrub had the highest demographic success. Applying source-sink concepts at the territory scale was useful to quantify habitat variation at a spatial scale relevant to population processes, reserve design, and habitat management. Our approach can be applied by using territory maps or geographic information systems to partition heterogeneous landscapes into territories and then by classifying territories into potential sources and sinks using scrub ridge characteristics and shrub heights.

Pavlacky, David C. Jr; Anderson, Stanley H.				Western North American Naturalist	64	3		376-384	August 2004	2004				English	1	8	We compared vegetation structure used by 14 bird species during the 1998 and 1999 breeding seasons to determine what habitat features best accounted for habitat division and community organization in Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands of southwestern Wyoming. Habitat use was quantified by measuring 24 habitat variables in 461 bird-centered quadrats, each 0.04 ha in size. Using discriminant function analysis, we differentiated between habitat used by 14 bird species along 3 habitat dimensions: (1) variation in shrub cover, overstory juniper cover, mature tree density, understory height, and decadent tree density; (2) a gradient composed of elevation and forb cover; and (3) variation in grass cover, tree height, seedling/sapling cover, and bare ground/rock cover. Of 14 species considered, 9 exhibited substantial habitat partitioning: Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura), Bewick's Wren (Thryomanes bewickii), Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides), Plumbeous Vireo (Vireo plumbeus), Green-tailed Towhee (Pipilo chlorurus), Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri), Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis), and Cassin's Finch (Carpodacus cassinii). Our results indicate juniper bird communities of southwestern Wyoming are organized along a 3-dimensional habitat gradient composed of woodland maturity, elevation, and juniper recruitment. Because juniper birds partition habitat along successional and altitudinal gradients, indiscriminate woodland clearing as well as continued fire suppression will alter species composition. Restoration efforts should ensure that all successional stages of juniper woodland are present on the landscape.	Anderson, Stanley H.; Univ Wyoming, USGS, Laramie, WY 82071, USA, USA.

Shochat, Eyal; Tsurim, Ido				Biodiversity and Conservation	13	8		1571-1590	July 2004	2004				English	0	13	Bird habitat conservation may require different management strategies for different seasonal bird assemblages. We studied habitat use by winter birds in forest and scrubland habitat patches in the northern Negev, Israel. Our goal was to assess whether differences in responses to landscape and habitat structure between breeding and non-breeding seasons require changes in future conservation plans that have been suggested for the Negev breeding bird community. We evaluated habitat and area effects on bird abundance and distribution and tested whether species habitat use during winter involves niche shifts. Compared with breeding birds, a larger proportion of winter bird species occupied both scrubland and forest. As in summer, forest bird species responded to habitat structure, whereas scrubland species were associated with both habitat structure and area. Resident birds disperse into habitats in which they were not present during summer. Consequently, for several species, the correlation between bird densities and environmental factors showed a better fit at the landscape rather than at the habitat scale. In addition, rather than niche shift, birds actually extended their niche breadth. Nest site selection may constrain bird distribution into a realized niche, smaller than their fundamental niche. Despite the scale differences in habitat use, the similar species diversity patterns between seasons suggest that both winter and summer birds would benefit from conservation of scrub patches larger than 50 ha, and enrichment of foliage layers within the planted forests.

Tubelis, Darius Pukenis; Cowling, Ann; Donnelly, Christine				Biological Conservation	118	3		353-364	July 2004	2004				English	1	23	We examined landscape supplementation (sensu (Oikos 65 (1992) 169)) by forest birds along forest/savanna boundaries in central Brazil to: (1) verify the role of savanna vegetation in providing resources to forest bird communities; (2) suggest minimum amounts of savannas to be conserved within corridors, to provide adequate foraging habitat for forest birds outside reserves. Transect counts parallel (n=64) and perpendicular (n=64) to forests were conducted in eight savannas (cerrado sensu stricto) between February 2000 and January 2001. Patterns of species richness and abundance of birds in relation to distances from forests were examined using Generalised Linear Mixed Models. Omnivores were the most abundant birds foraging in savannas, followed by insectivores and frugivores. Landscape supplementation in savannas was proportional to the density of savanna vegetation. Also, it was higher in the breeding season than in the non-breeding period. These two patterns suggest that surrounding savannas play a major role in providing additional foraging areas for forest bird species. We suggest that the environmental policy currently protecting 20 m of gallery forests along each side of rivers be modified to include at least 60 m of savanna along these forests through central Brazil. The study suggests that appropriate conservation efforts should also encompass the surrounding matrix to which the home ranges of target species are expanded, and not only their major habitat.

Pechacek, Peter; Kristin, Anton				Journal of Wildlife Management	68	3		683-693	July 2004	2004				English	1	21	We studied year-round food preferences of the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) from 1994 to 2000 in Berchtesgaden National Park, Germany. We color-banded 52 birds for individual recognition, and we radiomarked 25 adults from this sample. We analyzed 142 feces of 30 adults and 588 feces of 40 nestlings from 15 nests. Additionally, we took samples from 20 trees recently used for foraging in 10 woodpecker territories to estimate local prey availability. Based on relative abundance and relative frequency of food items (i.e., importance value), overall diet composition of adult three-toed woodpeckers was dominated by spiders (Araneidea), larvae of longhorn beetles (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae), and bark beetles (Coleoptera, Scolytidae). Adults ate longhorn beetle larvae primarily during nesting, while imagines (fully developed adults) and larvae of various bark beetles appeared to be the main food resource outside the nesting season. Nestling diet was dominated by spiders and longhorn beetle larvae that were gathered 247 [plus or minus] 122 m ( (x)over bar> [plus or minus] SD) from the nest. Our results demonstrated that consumption of bark beetles by three-toed woodpeckers varies throughout the year, being lowest during the nesting season, while longhorn beetle larvae are preferred throughout the year. Securing habitat requirements of both bark and wood-boring beetle communities is a critical step to maintaining viable three-toed woodpecker populations.

Examining a gradient of residual- fired- cut pinewood, the species richness increases, as well as the percentage of edge species, probably because of the growth of environmental heterogeneity induced by fire. After the pinewood cut, a decrease of species richness, particularly of the stenoecious wood and shrub species, is observed. Fire and consequent deforestation produced a species turnover, so the bird community of cut pinewood greatly differed from the other coenoses. Communities of homogeneous or mature vegetation ecosystems show a smaller proportion of edge species and a higher percentage of non-Passeriformes as compared to disturbed ecosystems. Cluster analysis (UPGMA; Euclidean Distance) confirmed the peculiarity of the cut pinewood community and the role of vegetation structure in order to determine the bird community composition.

Dos Anjos, Luiz				Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias	76	2		429-434	June 2004	2004				English	0	14	Bird communities were studied in two types of fragmented habitat of Atlantic forest in the State of Parana, southern Brazil; one consisted of forest fragments that were created as a result of human activities (forest remnants), the other consisted of a set of naturally occurring forest fragments (forest patches). Using quantitative data obtained by the point counts method in 3 forest patches and 3 forest remnants during one year, species richness and relative abundance were compared in those habitats, considering species groups according to their general feeding habits. Insectivores, omnivores, and frugivores presented similar general tendencies in both habitats (decrease of species number with decreasing size and increasing isolation of forest fragment). However, these tendencies were different, when considering the relative abundance data: the trunk insectivores presented the highest value in the smallest patch while the lowest relative abundance was in the smallest remnant. In the naturally fragmented landscape, time permitted that the loss of some species of trunk insectivores be compensated for the increase in abundance of other species. In contrast, the remnants essentially represented newly formed islands that are not yet at equilibrium and where future species losses would make them similar to the patches.

Henderson, I.G.; Vickery, J.A.; Carter, N.				Biological Conservation	118	1		21-32	June 2004	2004				English	0	33	Winter food for farmland birds can be enhanced by planting seed-rich 'winter bird crops' (WBCs), the content of which is highly variable. Data from three winters (October to March in 1998/1999, 1999/2000 and 2000/2001) were used to assess the value of different WBCs for lowland farmland birds in England, based on around 100 plots per winter. Densities of gamebirds, insectivorous and seed-eating passerines were generally higher on WBCs than on conventional crops, stubbles or grassland (except for skylark (Alauda arvensis) and rook (Corvus frugilegus). Kale supported high densities of the widest range of bird species (including insectivorous and seed-eating species), quinoa was used by finches and tree sparrows (Passer montanus), and (unharvested) seeding cereals supported high densities of buntings. Sunflowers, phacelia and buckwheat supported low densities of most bird species. The differences between WBCs were more marked in late winter, owing to better seed retention by kale and quinoa compared with other crops. A combination of kale, quinoa and seeding cereals will support the highest densities of the greatest variety of bird species, but WBC content can also be varied to suit circumstance or species. This study demonstrates the value of WBCs for a wide range of birds, and discusses this with respect to existing 'agri-environment schemes', highlighting the need for similar options in pastoral landscapes where seed resources are particularly rare.

Parasitism rates reached 50% in an ungrazed reserve, but only 14% on an adjacent grazed plot. The resulting difference in breeding success was not, however, attributable to vegetation parameters used to describe microhabitat use. Cowbird parasitism rates therefore seem to be influenced largely by factors operating at the landscape level. These may include grazing scheme, topography, humidity and host availability. It is suggested that lower species diversity and bird abundance rendered the grazed site less attractive to cowbirds. Current parasitism rates are of great conservation concern due to the low population size of Pale-headed Brush-finch, and the initiation of controlling measures is pressing. Management options described from intensive cowbird control programmes in North America are reviewed and evaluated for their applicability here. To. combine the possibility of further data collection with commencement of immediate conservation action, we consider two alternative approaches. Nest monitoring and cowbird egg removal would enable the study of the distribution of parasitism in relation to landscape and vegetation variables, whereas cowbird shooting and nest monitoring might provide a larger short-term benefit to reproductive output. Habitat management, resumption of some grazing in the reserve and cowbird removal should be considered for the intermediate future.

Isacch, Juan P.; Holz, Silvia; Ricci, Laura; Martinez, Mariano M.				Wetlands	24	2		235-243	June 2004	2004				English	1	8	Vegetation structure is an integral component of avian habitat selection. Therefore, structure changes caused by management practices can influence avian communities. The salt marshes of the pampas region of Argentina have experienced an increase in fire use as a management tool to improve cattle forage and to avoid accidental fires. A spring burn of 200 ha of salt marsh in Mar Chiquita Biosphere Reserve, Argentina, in September 1995, allowed us to compare the response of birds associated with two vegetation communities, one dominated by Spartina densiflora (Spartina marsh) and another dominated by Juncus acutus (Juncus marsh) from one month to one year post-bum. We recorded changes in plant species composition and vegetation structure (height and cover) at 40 days after the burn and every season for the subsequent year. Fire reduced total cover of both plant communities. Juncus marsh recovered pre-burn structure and bird community by one year post-fire. However, Spartina marsh recovery was incomplete in that period. Relative abundances of bird species that used unburned Juncus marsh were similar to those in burned Juncus marsh in the spring period one year after the burn. Plant height at the burned Spartina marsh did not reach that of the unburned Spartina in 12 months; red-capped wren-spinetail (Spartonoica maluroides), a rare tall-grass-dependent species, settled burned parcels at lower relative abundances than in unburned habitat. Because species that first use the burned patches are very common and widespread in other habitats, and excessive burning may reduce available habitat for endangered or rare species, prescribed burns should be avoided in this region.

Tejeda-Cruz, Csar; Sutherland, William J.				Animal Conservation	7	2		169-179	May 2004	2004				English	0	29	It has been documented that certain types of shade coffee plantations have both biodiversity levels similar to natural forest and high concentrations of wintering migratory bird species. These findings have triggered a campaign to promote shade coffee as a means of protecting Neotropical migratory birds. Bird censuses conducted in the El Triunfo Biosphere reserve in southern Mexico have confirmed that shade coffee plantations may have bird diversity levels similar to, or higher than, natural forest. However, coffee and forest differed in species composition. Species with a high sensitivity to disturbance were significantly more diverse and abundant in primary ecosystems. Neotropical migratory birds, granivorous and omnivorous species were more abundant in disturbed habitats. Insectivorous bird species were less abundant only in shaded monoculture. Foraging generalists and species that prefer the upper foraging stratum were more abundant in disturbed habitats, while a decline in low and middle strata foragers was found there. Findings suggests that shade coffee may be beneficial for generalist species (including several migratory species), but poor for forest specialists. Although shade coffee plantations may play an important role in maintaining local biodiversity, and as buffer areas for forest patches, promotion of shade coffee may lead to the transformation of forest into shade coffee, with the consequent loss of forest species.

Elphick, Chris S.				Biological Conservation	117	1		105-110	May 2004	2004				English	0	11	I examined how winter flooding of post-harvest rice fields-a management practice used to benefit waterbirds-affects field use by other birds. In addition to waterbirds previously studied, I recorded 56 bird species in rice fields. Of these, five were more abundant in flooded fields, ten were more abundant in unflooded fields, no difference was detected for 19, and the remainder were too rare to draw any conclusions. Species that were more common in unflooded fields were all carnivorous or granivorous in winter, whereas species that were more common in flooded fields were mostly insectivores commonly associated with aquatic habitats. The net effects of the responses by individual species were fewer raptor species in flooded fields, but no difference in the species richness of other landbirds. Winter flooding potentially has negative effects for some birds, but has no discernible effects on most species studied and may benefit some passerines.

Saisonale Veranderungen der Raumnutzungsmuster von mittelschwabischen Waldvogelzonosen.	Utschick, Hans				Ornithologischer Anzeiger	43	1		19-47	Mai 2004	2004				German	0	0	Combined grid (90 units of 6.25 ha) and polygon mapping (92 forest stands from 0.3 to 29.7 ha) of a bird community on 562 ha of a Mid-Swabian forest landscape (2 test areas of 250 ha each near Ettenbeuren/Krumbach and Oberschonegg/Ottobeuren; 1 area of 62.5 ha near Edelstetten, Southern Bavaria) was used to analyse the influence of stand composition and management intensity on the time-space-distribution of forest birds (time-standardized monthly counts; Mar 1999 to Feb 2000). Main results are: - Bird communities of forest stands depend on stand characteristics and on the local character of the surrounding forest landscape as well. During the breeding period, stand characteristics (in small stands those of the neighbouring stands too) are more important. During summer (fledgling period) and autumn (migration) landscape variables like stand distribution patterns, and mainly in winter, the local space-pattern of climatic site-conditions strongly influence local distribution of forest birds. -Habitat preferences of forest birds fluctuate within a year between nearly all stand classes (tree composition, age, structure, intensity of use) of the tested, very productive and heavily used forest area. Same was found at the tree species level, where the distribution pattern of large-dimensioned oaks, leaf trees (without beech) or larches is very important. -In a managed spruce-dominated landscape mature nature reserves and similar broadleaved stands of sufficient size are necessary for a high bird species diversity due to founder population effects. At all seasons, such stands specially increase the value of local bird communities when situated on slopes with southern exposition at margins of extensive forest areas. The consequences for using forest bird data in nature conservancy problems (for example in creating management strategies following an evaluation impact study or in planning the conservation and development of reserves) should lay emphasis on non-breeding aspects (at least winter aspects) and on forest characteristics at the landscape level (connectivity aspects at least at the km2-level). The most suitable method is a quantitative grid mapping with subunits (stand polygons within the grid), but this method has rarely been used to date due to difficulties getting comparable data standards at different landscape levels. What is important for the forestry management in the Mid-Swabian, spruce-dominated forest landscapes, is that the time-space patterns, specially those of coniferous bird guilds, are well supported by the existing management system (Altersklassenwald) based on rotating qualities (time, space) of small sized forest stands (average 6 ha). But high bird community diversity can only be reached, if this system is be completed by a narrow grid of mature broadleaved stands or reserves (4-10 ha), especially on sunny slopes (very important mainly for winter birds) and at forest margins, and an enrichment of leave trees and larch within many spruce stands.

We used radio-telemetry to test this hypothesis in an alpine mountain forest in southeastern Germany between 1994 and 2000. Stepwise backward multiple-regression showed that adaptive kernel home-range size using 95% use distribution (n=24 woodpeckers) was positively related to forest extent and tree-species diversity. Conversely, we found smaller home ranges with increasing density of potential cavity trees, and with increasing dbh-range of trees at breast height. The habitat variables shown to effect home range selection were attributes of mature boreal forests. This implied that maintaining a boreal-like habitat (i.e. spruce-dominated autochthonous forests including their natural disturbance regime) would be the best option for successful conservation of the alpine subspecies of the three-toed woodpecker.

Here we explore the potential effects of managing eastern Ontario deciduous forests for the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea) by examining its potential as a biodiversity indicator species and as an umbrella species. Our results indicate that the Cerulean Warbler would not be an effective biodiversity indicator, as its distribution across the studied landscape did not coincide with areas of high avian species richness. However, the Cerulean Warbler may be effective as an umbrella species for the maintenance of populations of other canopy-nesting species that require mature deciduous forest habitats. It is hoped that the conclusions reached in Ontario, while perhaps not directly transferable to all parts of the breeding range, encourage other Cerulean Warbler researchers to ask similar questions in their study areas.

Tomialojc, Ludwik; Wesolowski, Tomasz				Journal fuer Ornithologie	145	2		81-92	April 2004	2004				English	1	30	The Bialowieza Forest (BF) is an extensive and relatively little changed forest complex on the Polish-Belarussian border. Data on the structure and diversity of its breeding avifauna have mostly been collected in primeval old-growth stands, preserved within the Bialowieza National Park (BNP). Mapping censuses repeated in space (plots, replicated in riverine, oak-lime-hornbeam and coniferous stands) and time (permanent plots, 28 years) reveal that the breeding bird assemblages are rich in species (29-52/season in a 25 to 33-ha plot), but of moderate overall density (40-120 pairs/10 ha). The latter is due to low, lower than in man-transformed areas, densities of the majority of particular species. Despite marked changes in vegetation structure, the composition of the breeding bird assemblage does not vary much across different primeval forest types, with a single breeding bird community inhabiting all of them, including treefall gaps. High richness of the BF avifauna stems from the Forest's geographical locality, as well as from a high level of the primeval avifauna retention. Over 95% of the 135-140 pristine species still breed there. Especially species-rich groups are birds of prey, owls, woodpeckers and Sylvinae warblers. Bird communities in the BNP and primeval tropical rain forests share many features, suggesting that natural differences between temperate and tropical forests were less pronounced in the past. The combination of high species richness with low densities of individual species is probably a feature of all pristine forests, independent of climatic zone. The BF avifauna must once have been typical of the ancient European forests and it has become so exceptional chiefly because it has preserved most of its pristine features. The BF thus constitutes an indispensable reference site for future studies of woodland bird biology. To ensure its survival should become a priority. Commercial logging, taking place over 80% of the Polish BF part, severely changes the Forest's structure and strongly affects the birds, especially species which depend on dead wood (Dendrocopos leucotos, Picoides tridactylus) and on old-growth stands. The small area protected as the BNP becomes an increasingly isolated "island", in which preservation of the primeval forest features seems to be impossible. In order to retain them, it is necessary to protect the whole BF area.

Those in Turkey present the international importance landscapes as to the various ecosystem characteristics and land use patterns. Nevertheless, these areas are currently facing many problems such as biodiversity loss and environmental degradation owing to coastal settlements and pollution factors. This paper describes the factors responsible for the main features and degradation types of the Deltaic landscapes and their impact for future land use. It also deals with : an overview of the Kizilirmak Delta, one of the most important Deltas along the central part of Black Sea Region (Turkey); presents major ecosystem of it; identifies land use pattern and discusses the threats by environmental and human induced disturbances, The most considering feature of this Delta is to show the largest and most significant wetland area of Turkey which has been able to protect its natural beauties on the Black Sea Coasts. A Delta plain of 56 000 hectares extends through the area at the north of the Samsun-Sinop highway. The ecological system of the Delta is extremely rich in terms of its biological variety as well as its fauna (especially number of bird species). But, the Delta including terrestrial areas close to the water resources and the vegetation between aquatic and terrestrial systems, has been constantly modified by human activities. Consequently, some considerations for environmental conservation and sustainable management were put forward for the future generations.

Laiolo, Paola; Rolando, Antonio; Valsania, Valentina				Acta Oecologica	25	1-2		129-136	March 2004	2004				English	1	21	Habitat structure and its effect on bird communities in logged and abandoned montane beechwoods of North-western Italy were analysed to assess bird responses to natural regenerative aspects of succession. In the study area three seral and management types of beechwoods were identified: up to 15 years old beech coppices, 30-50 years old stands where small scale selective cutting still occurs, and natural regenerating 30-50 years old stands located in a wilderness preserve (Val Grande National Park). Bird species richness, abundance and diversity were significantly greater in naturally regenerating stands, whereas little differences existed between the two managed stands. This suggests that bird diversity of beechwoods younger than 50 years might depend on management-policy more than on the successional stages. Species-specific logistic regression models and canonical correspondence analysis indicated that micro-habitat features such as the amount of snags and the presence of edges were important predictors of bird community composition. In our study area, natural habitat recovery appears sufficiently robust to achieve 'passive' restoration of wilderness without intervention. Our results indicate that simple measures could be taken to improve biodiversity in the managed landscapes.

Ten out of 26 breeding species showed an increase in population size (Little Grebe, Great Crested Grebe, Black-necked Grebe, Little Bittern, Tufted Duck, Common Tern, Rufous Nightingale, Savi's Warbler, Reed Warbler and Yellowhammer), seven a decline (Common Teal, Common Pochard, Northern Lapwing, Common Snipe, Tree Pipit, Willow Warbler, Golden Oriole) and no change was evident in nine species (Water Rail, Spotted Crake, Moorhen, Black-headed Gull, Common Cuckoo, Grasshopper Warbler, Marsh Warbler, Great Reed Warbler, Reed Bunting). Formerly common birds in the wetlands have disappeared or continued breeding only irregularly, for example the Common Snipe or the Tree Pipit. On the other hand, Savi's Warbler and Rufous Nightingale expanded their distribution and population size. The Common Tern started to breed due to specific conservation measures. Considering the critical situation of wetlands within the densely populated canton of Zurich the overall results are encouraging. We conclude that the long-term management measures started in wetlands in the 1970s are successful. These measures include the restoration of deteriorated wetlands, actions against succession processes like constructing ponds, fine tuning of water levels or grazing cattle at specific spots, species conservation measures and the control of recreational activities.

Lohmus, Asko				Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Sciences Biology Ecology	53	1		52-67	March 2004	2004				English	0	3	To establish new reserves for biodiversity, the conservation value of currently managed forests should be assessed. I compared the bird fauna of a large reserve (Alam-Pedja) and an adjacent managed forest landscape in east-central Estonia. At 20-ha scale. managed forests had a denser and more species-rich bird fauna and as high abundance of species of conservation concern as the reserve. This was due to the higher small-scale diversity of vegetation types and a higher share of fresh-type forests in the managed area. since at the landscape scale, the species richness of the managed forest and the reserve were similar. Moreover. the species-area curves of the reserve and a combined sample of the reserve and the managed landscape did not differ, indicating that the latter added new species only due to enlarged area and not because of a distinct fauna. Thinnings changed community composition and tended to decrease species-richness. I conclude that managed forest landscapes are impoverished hut still valuable for the conservation of forest birds in Estonia. Using the existing middle-aged or old unmanaged second-growth for new reserves seems to be an acceptable conservation strategy if the potential sites of conservation are immediately excluded from commercial use.

Gimenes, Marcio Rodrigo; dos Anjos, Luiz				Ornitologia Neotropical	15	1		71-85	27 February 2004	2004				English	0	2	The number and composition of bird species on three islands in the upper Parana river, Brazil, were compared. Porto Rico island, 103 ha, and Mutum island, 976 ha, are highly deforested; Bandeira island, 14 ha, is slightly deforested. Five habitats have been recognized: forests, shrubs, open fields, aquatic areas and sand bars. A transect passing through all the above habitats on the islands was sampled monthly, from December 1999 to September 2000. Birds on the three islands totalled 113 species: 99 on Mutum, 86 on Bandeira, and 82 on Porto Rico islands. The high number of species on Bandeira island, taken its small size, is probably due to the presence on it of a continuous and little disturbed forest. On the contrary, forests on Mutum and Porto Rico islands are fragmented. Well preserved islands, albeit small in size, should have priority in conservation programs.

Condor	106	1		37-49	February 2004	2004				English	3	38	The presence of rotted wood is often noted in descriptions of woodpecker nest and roost sites, and ornithologists have found that certain fungi and species of woodpeckers, such as the red heart fungus (Phellinus pini) and Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) are intimately linked. The relationship assumed is usually one of woodpecker dependence or preference for partially decayed wood in which to excavate cavities, but the woodpecker is also sometimes suggested as a vector for the fungus. In this paper we review such associations and describe patterns evident among woodpecker nest sites that suggest microclimatic and microhabitat characteristics favoring fungal colonization of trees, woodpecker-favorable responses of trees to fungi, and ultimate use of the trees for woodpecker cavity excavation. Factors that favor fungal invasion and tree use by woodpeckers include tree species, growth history, site characteristics such as proximity to water and exposure to sun or shade, nature and position of tree injury, local climate, forest age and species composition, fire frequency, and human management activities. Woodpecker cavity height and entrance orientation may be related to the dispersal dynamics of fungi, which in turn may be related to forest vegetation, thermal, and hydric characteristics.

Bouzat, Juan L.; Johnson, Kristine				Molecular Ecology	13	2		499-505	February 2004	2004				English	1	18	We evaluated the genetic structure of birds from four closely spaced leks in a peripheral population of lesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus). Analyses of molecular variance revealed significant genetic structuring among birds from different leks for six microsatellite loci (FST = 0.036; P = 0.002), but we found no genetic differentiation at the mtDNA control region. Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg revealed an excess of homozygote genotypes within each of the leks studied (FIS = 0.190-0.307), indicative of increased inbreeding. Estimates of relatedness using microsatellite data suggest that the genetic structuring among lesser prairie-chicken leks occurs in part because of a lek mating system in which males at some leks are related. Structuring may also be caused by stochastic effects associated with a historical decline in population size leading to small, semi-isolated leks and high site fidelity by reproductive males. Results from this study suggest that microspatial genetic structuring may occur in lek-mating bird species with low levels of dispersal.

Danley, Robert F.; Murphy, Robert K.; Madden, Elizabeth M.				Western North American Naturalist	64	1		72-77	February 2004	2004				English	3	19	No published data exist on responses of grassland passerines and their habitat to combined grazing and burning treatments in northern mixed-grass prairie. At Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (LNWR) in northwestern North Dakota, we monitored breeding bird occurrence, abundance, and habitat during successive annual grazing treatments (1998-2000) on 5 prescribe-burned, mixed-grass prairie management units (range=50-534 ha, each burned 3-6 times in the previous 10-20 years). All breeding passerine species characteristic of upland, northern mixed-grass prairie were common (>10% occurrence) during at least 1 of 3 years on burned and grazed units, except Chestnut-collared Longspur (Calcarius ornatus), which was uncommon. Vegetation was generally shorter and sparser than that found on 4 nearby units treated by fire only (1999; density, visual obstruction, and height, all P<0.01). Regardless, occurrences of individual bird species resembled those previously documented on prairie units at LNWR with similar fire histories but no grazing; however, Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) occurred 2.4 times more frequently on burned and grazed units studied. Our data suggest that species diversity of breeding grassland passerines changes little during initial years of rotation grazing at moderate stocking rates in fire-managed, northern mixed-grass prairie at LNWR.

Borgmann, Kathi L.; Pearson, Scott F.; Levey, Douglas J.; Greenberg, Cathryn H.				Auk	121	1		74-87	January 2004	2004				English	0	11	Food availability during winter may determine habitat use and limit populations of overwintering birds, yet its importance is difficult to judge because few studies have experimentally tested the response of nonbreeding birds to changes in resource abundance. We experimentally examined the link between fruit availability and habitat use by manipulating winter abundance of Myrica cerifera L. (Myricaceae) fruits in managed longleaf (Pinus palustris) and loblolly (P. taeda) pine stands in South Carolina. Myrica cerifera is a common understory shrub in the southeastern United States and provides lipid-rich fruit in late winter (February and March), when insects and other fruits are scarce. On treatment plots, we covered fruiting M. cerifera shrubs with netting in early winter to prevent birds from eating their fruits. In late February, when M. cerifera fruit crops were largely depleted elsewhere on our study site, we uncovered the shrubs and documented the response of the bird community to those patches of high fruit availability. Relative to control plots, total bird abundance (excluding the most common species, Yellow-rumped Warbler [Dendroica coronata]) and species richness did not change after net removal. Yellow-rumped Warblers, however, became significantly more abundant on treatment plots after net removal, which suggests that they track M. cerifera fruit abundance. We suggest that M. cerifera plays a role in determining the local distribution of wintering Yellow-rumped Warblers at our study site. To put these results into a management context, we also examined the effect of prescribed fire frequencies on M. cerifera fruit production. Across pine stands with different fire regimes, M. cerifera fruit abundance increased with the number of years since burning. It takes 4-6 years for individuals to recover sufficiently from a burn to produce large quantities of fruit. Thus, shorter intervals between burns will reduce winter fruit availability. Taken together, these results suggest that within those pine plantations, the local winter distribution of at least one common migratory bird is closely tied to fruit abundance, which in turn is tied to the frequency of prescribed fires.

Olsen, Henrik; Schmidt, Niels M.				Basic and Applied Ecology	5	2		203-210	2004	2004				English	1	18	Attempts to reverse the population declines of many wader species in Denmark and other parts of Europe during the last 20-30 years have resulted in the application of several management implements. In this study we evaluate the effect of two management implements (grazing by cattle and winter flooding) on the number of breeding pairs of lapwing, redshank, avocet, ringed plover, and oystercatcher in the Klydeso reserve, eastern Denmark, from 1990 to 2001. We also include a proxy of winter climate, the index of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), in our models in order to quantify the relative importance of the applied management and winter severity. Lapwing and avocet breeding numbers increased significantly concurrent with the application of cattle grazing, most likely due to an increased number of nesting sites and/or improved predator detection. Conversely, oystercatcher breeding numbers declined as the fraction of the reserve grazed by cattle increased, which may be attributed to changes in food availability on the grazed areas, but also due to increased predation risk. Ringed plover and redshanks in particular responded positively to the introduction of winter flooding, possibly due to increased availability of suitable foraging sites. Ringed plover may also experience increased nest site availability after winter flooding. Oystercatcher and ringed plover were both affected by winter severity, but with opposite trends, and oystercatcher breeding numbers increased after mild winters, while ringed plover decreased. Remaining species were not influenced by winter severity. The possible reason for this is discussed by comparing the lapwing breeding numbers in Klydeso reserve divide reserve to Tipperne reserve in western Denmark. Though winter severity may seem of no importance for some of the species in the Klydeso reserve, it may still be important in areas where the management effort is constant.

Reddersen, Jens; Petersen, Ib Krag				Dansk Ornitologisk Forenings Tidsskrift	98	1		21-32	2004	2004				Danish	0	1	In the spring and summer of 1998, the value of SRC willow plantations as habitat for breeding birds was investigated in a 147 ha mixed, typical Danish farmland study area which included eight commercial SRC willow plots in various stages of regrowth after harvest (0.1-1.7 ha). Territory densities, species composition, species richness and species similarity were compared across six major biotope categories: (rotational) Field, (grass) Set-aside, (various types of) Meadow/Fen, Deciduous wood, SRC willow and (small fragments of) Coniferous wood. Breeding bird territory maps were constructed by standardized evaluation of detailed field-visit maps showing positions of various breeding activities at each of ten visits. Six functional species groups based on 'breeding bird habitat preference' were defined, allowing the pooling of species data in an effort to gain statistical power. This grouping was based on information from the literature and therefore strictly independent of our data. The total material comprised 363 breeding territories of 49 bird species. In almost all respects, such as total and species-group territory densities and species richness, SRC willow attained an intermediate position, with far less birds than both Deciduous and Coniferous wood but with similar bird densities as Meadow/Fen, and usually with more birds than Set-aside and Fields. While other biotope categories often hosted a very characteristic species composition, incl. birds unique for that biotope type, SRC willow hosted a mixture of birds from both mosaic farmland, open land and moist non-forest biotopes; true forest species, however, were absent. The results are discussed in relation to variation in SRC willow management, including recommended modifications of management for increasing the habitat value of SRC willow for birds.

Results focus on species common to early successional habitats and pine-grasslands and on forest species and habitat generalists. In the 3rd growing season post-fire, Indigo buntings (Passerine cyanea) and northern bobwhites (Colinas virginianus) were more abundant in recently burned heavy use sites than in light use sites. Conversely, red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceus) were more abundant in light use sites in the 3rd growing season post-fire than in recently burned, heavy use sites. Further study could help determine if these species are indicators of disturbance.	Duncan, Lisa; Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, P.O.

Borges, Sergio Henrique				Ibis	146	1		114-124	January 2004	2004				English	1	13	There have been few studies of the fauna of the distinctive vegetation that grows on sandy soil in Amazonia. Leached and nutrient-poor sandy soil is associated with a vegetation type that varies in structure from open fields (campinas) to low canopy forests (campinaranas). During a bird inventory in sandy soil vegetation at Jau National Park (JNP), I recorded 128 bird species, with 55 in campina and 94 in campinarana. Estimates suggested only 150 bird species should be expected to occur in these habitats, a reduced species diversity compared with other vegetation types in the Amazon region. This low species diversity is probably linked to the low productivity of this habitat and its relatively simple vegetation structure. Despite the relatively low diversity, at least 14 bird species (3% of the entire avifauna) appear to be restricted to white sand vegetation in JNP. In Amazonia as a whole, some 37 bird species are associated with vegetation in sandy soils. Biological inventories of other taxa are needed to understand the contribution of white sandy vegetation to the faunal distribution in Amazonia.

The proportion of habitat types on the plots differed statistically (G-test, G5 = 23.5, p<0.001), the most substantial differences concerning orchards, and meadows and pastures (table 1). The study was carried out in 1995 (PO) and 1996 (PP) between early April and mid-July, when 10 morning controls were made. Besides, 4 night controls on PO and 3 on PP were performed in April-July with the application of cassette recorder stimulation of four owl species. On the two plots jointly 85 breeding bird species were recorded: PO - 77, PP - 75. The number of species common to both plots equalled 67 (QS = 88.2%). Exclusively on one plot, 18 species occurred: PO - 10, PP- 8. Of the 42 species counted on both plots, only 10 did not show significant differences (>50%) in densities on the fragments of agricultural landscape under comparison. Densities of other 32 common species differed considerably between the plots; as many as 29 species reached a higher density on PO, and only 3 species on PP Since forests, beside villages, group the largest number of species and pairs breeding in agricultural landscape, preservation of broken structure of this type of environment will be advantageous to many species of birds in the future.

Habitat preferences of the species mentioned were established with the application of the habitat selectivity index, the analysis covering circles with radii of 50 m (Marsh Warbler), 100 m (Whinchat and Whitethroat) and 200 m (Tawny Pipit) described around the centres of singing places. Preference for idle and was typical of all the species; it was the highest in the Tawny Pipit (+0.33) and Whinchat (+0.32), and lower in the Whitethroat and Marsh Warbler (+0.20 each). Meadows were preferred by the Marsh Warbler (+0.45) and Whinchat (+0.11), while avoided by the Tawny Pipit (-0.86). The latter species and the Whitethroat revealed also preference for forest edges (+0.75 and +0.47 respectively). None of the studied species preferred farmland, settlements or orchards. The results indicate that idle land seems to bean important type of environment significantly shaping the species composition of breeding bird assemblages in the mosaic of agricultural landscape of Central Poland.

Sikora, Arkadiusz; Rys, Andrzej				Notatki Ornitologiczne	45	4		253-262	2004	2004				Polish	0	1	In 1990-2003 a study of the distribution, numbers and habitat preferences of the White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos was conducted in Warmia and Masuria. The species breeding territories are situated in the northern sections of the regions mentioned, where the distribution is continuous, with a few key breeding grounds. Based on known breeding sites, the total abundance of the White-backed Woodpecker in Warmia and Masuria was assessed at 50-70 pairs, but as many as 70-80 pairs may actually occur in the area. Ca 2/3 breeding territories were found in forests exceeding 50 km2, the remaining ones in woods below 10 km2. The largest population, composed of 30-40 pairs, was discovered in the Borecka Forest, and 20 pairs were recorded to breed in the eastern part of the Nizina Sepopolska lowland. The White-backed Woodpeckers preferred old deciduous stands. Merely 10-20% of the Warmian and Masurian populations bred in reserves. The densities in the nature reserves within the Borecka Forest were 5 times higher than in unprotected areas. The factor conducive to occurrence of the species is the abundance of dead trees, e.g. at sites where beavers occur. And therefore, in order to prevent the extinction of the White-backed Woodpecker, it is advisable to undertake in forests steps which would result in an increase of the amount of dead trees and also to take under protection larger forest areas.

Kinross, Cilla				Pacific Conservation Biology	10	2-3		180-192	2004	2004				English	0	1	Many windbreaks are being planted on the Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia to provide shelter for stock and crops, but little is known of the effect of these linear plantations on the regional bird community. This paper compares the avian diversity, density and species composition in a range of habitats in agricultural landscapes, including farm windbreaks, and draws conclusions as to the benefits of windbreaks to bird conservation. The data were collected between 1993 and 1997 with 12 visits to each of 84 sites, placed a priori into seven habitat types on six grazing properties in the Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia and analysed using ANOVA and canonical variate analysis to identify bird-habitat relationships and patterns. Species diversity and density were found to be highest in remnant woodland and lowest in grassland, but differences between other habitats were less robust. Windbreaks >19 m wide were closer in diversity and species composition to remnant woodland than windbreaks <=15 m wide. Of the 105 bird species observed, 17 were confined to remnant woodland and 67 native species were observed using planted sites. These species were not, as had been predicted, entirely composed of generalist-opportunistic species, but, particularly in the wider planted sites, included several woodland species identified as declining in this region. Although clearly not as important as remnant woodland, farm windbreaks, shelterbelts and woodlots of suitable size and composition appear to contribute significantly to avian diversity in agricultural areas and their planting should be encouraged and supported by the rural community and government.

Laiolo, Paola; Rolando, Antonio; Valsania, Valentina				Revue d'Ecologie la Terre et la Vie	59	3		453-463	2004	2004				English	0	11	In Italy the spread of Castanea sativa is largely dependent upon humans, who first protected and then cultivated it for about 3000 years. Recently, however, chestnut cultivation has steadily declined, due mainly to social and economic factors. In this paper we analysed the dynamics of the bird community in chestnut stands that represent a gradient from woods impacted by domestic firewood collecting to abandoned and derelict coppice interspersed with mature fruiting cultivars. Bird diversity, density, species richness and the abundance of six out of the sixteen commonest species were positively affected by the occurrence of mature fruiting sweet chestnuts in the study stands. These old trees (> 100 years) are rich in cavities and support many dead branches and thus can take the place of dead standing wood for birds, offering food, nesting and roosting sites. We also found a significant trend of increasing bird abundance, species richness and diversity with increasing stand age; heterogeneity in vegetation structure and composition following natural regeneration possibly created more forest-like conditions than uniform younger woods, thus supporting a richer bird community. The present findings are discussed in terms of conservation of bird diversity in old coppiced woods.

Transactions of the Western Section of the Wildlife Society	40			68-81	2004	2004				English	1	1	We examined bird-habitat relationships within and across a range of aspen habitats in four major watersheds in the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains of California and Nevada to identify habitat features of importance to aspen-breeding birds. Using point counts and vegetation assessments from 462 individual stations between 2001 and 2003 allowed us to investigate important habitat features at watershed and regional scales. Several trends were found: bird species richness and abundance were positively correlated with lower percent conifer cover, increased herbaceous cover, and lower shrub-class aspen cover. Dusky Flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri) presence and abundance were positively correlated with increased percent shrub-class aspen cover and lower percent tree-class cover of all conifers or individual coniferous species. Warbling Vireo (Vireo gilvus) presence and abundance were positively correlated with increased percent tree-class aspen cover. The results suggest that mature aspen stands with healthy herbaceous communities and limited or no conifer intrusion are optimal habitats for aspen-breeding birds in the eastern Sierra Nevada. To maximize bird species richness and bird abundance, management actions in aspen stands should concentrate on conifer removal, where conditions warrant, and the promotion of a healthy herbaceous layer. Conservation planning for birds in aspen habitats of the Sierra Nevada is discussed.	Richardson, T.

Three 20-ha complete block replicates of 5 experimental treatments (15 treatment units, 4 ha per unit) were used. The five treatments were operational shelterwood stands with target overstory retention levels of approximately 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent. The residual basal area and resultant canopy cover of these overstory retentions were compared among treatments and both showed three distinct conditions, closed canopy, open forest, and clearcut. Territory spot-mapping was used to quantify bird species richness and density during the first post-treatment year, between mid-April and July 2002. Sixty bird species were detected with 34 of those defending territories on the sites. Clearcuts (0 percent retention) had significantly lower values than the other four treatment types for overall bird territory density, species richness, and Shannon diversity index. Territorial density of breeding songbirds was highest in the 50 percent retention treatments, while species richness and Shannon diversity peaked in the units with 25 percent basal area retention.

Point counts conducted during the non-breeding and breeding seasons of 2000-2002 showed that winter bird species abundance and evenness (J') did not change significantly between pre- and post-treatment winter surveys. However, bird species richness increased significantly between years. No differences were found between treatments for species abundance, richness, or evenness during the breeding season. However, foliage-gleaning and canopy-nesting breeding species were detected significantly more often in thinned than burned or control sites. Nest searches and monitoring found 79 nests (thin, n = 30; burn, n = 27; control, n = 22) with a 49-percent failure rate over the 2-year period. Most of these failures (41 percent) occurred in thinned stands.	Zebehazy, Laura A.; Department of Forest Resources, 261 Lehotsky Hall, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634, USA, USA.

Biomasse, Siedlungsdichte und Artenzahl von Vogelgesellschaften colliner und submontaner Laub-und Nadelwaelder in Suedwestdeutschland.	Gatter, Wulf; Schuett, Rainer				Vogelwelt	125	3-4		251-258	2004	2004				German	0	1	This study examines the relationship between population density, species number and biomass of birds and forest type (broad-leaved, mixed, or coniferous) as well as forest age. The study material is based on territory mappings between 1967 and 1995. The abundance of birds in forests with pre-dominating Beech Fagus sylvatica and Northern Spruce Picea allies increases from deciduous through mixed to coniferous forests. The avian biomass, however, remains roughly the "Fame in all three forest types because the average weight of the birds decreases from deciduous (26.8 g) through mixed (26 g) to coniferous (19.4 g) forests: in coniferous forests there are smaller birds occurring at greater densities. In coniferous forests, the dense evergreen foliage restricts the movement of birds, and the thick arboreal structure supports an avifauna of small 'flitters'. In young stands there is a decline in population density after the thicket stage. After the pole stage, population density and bird biomass increases again with stand age, especially in broad-leaved woodland. No clear dependence on a particular stand age is discernible in coniferous forests, at least when younger than 100 years. Other factors, such as presence of clearings and proportion of dead wood, are probably more significant. Extremely high population densities in small, old, protected forests with up to 275 territories/10 ha cannot be extrapolated to corresponding extensive forests. In coniferous and deciduous woodland there are on average 23 [plus or minus]5 species/10 ha, in mixed woodland over 26 [plus or minus]5. There are indications that the number of species rises with stand age in mixed and coniferous woodlands, but probably less in deciduous woodland. Before leaves appear on deciduous trees, coniferous forests and even single evergreen trees provide early breeders with protection from predators. They also give shelter against the cold and buffer climatic extremes, thereby supporting early breeding. The expansion of coniferous plantations at the end of the 19th century has allowed several bird species (e.g. Coal Tit Parts cuff, Crested Tit P. cristatus, Firecrest Regulus ignicapillus) to considerably increase their range and numbers in Central Europe.

Suedbeck, Peter; Flade, Martin				Vogelwelt	125	3-4		319-326	2004	2004				German	0	1	During the past 20 years, the Middle Spotted Woodpecker as an excellent indicator species for the conservation status of mature deciduous forests experienced an increasing interest of ornithological research. This paper summarises the current knowledge on population sizes and trends, habitat selection and abundance of the species in Germany and draws conclusions for forest nature conservation. In some federal states, during recent years detailed surveys have been performed. The resulting population estimates are distinctly (up to four times) higher than previous estimates from the late 1990s. In Table I, an overview of the results of a questionnaire which was send to the responsible administrations and ornithological societies of all federal states is given. The total German population is actually estimated at 16,500-22,000 bp., with largest numbers in Hesse, Lower Saxony, Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria, and Brandenburg. Although this higher population numbers are mainly due to intensified surveys, there is evidence (e.g. from the German Common Birds Census) for a distinct increase of the species especially in western and northern Germany - as it is also observed in the Benelux and Baltic countries. Furthermore, studies on occurrence, abundance and foraging habitats in different forest types revealed that the species does not only occur in (mixed) oak forests, but also in pure beech and alder forests, so far they show a high proportion of mature trees and standing dead wood. This means also, that today the Middle Spotted Woodpecker occurs only in a very small part of its former natural range in Germany, and that the actual populations have a relict character. The future population development of the species is regarded as an important indicator for the ecological sustainability of forestry management in Germany.

Woinarski, J.C.Z.; Armstrong, M.; Price, O.; McCartney, J.; Griffiths, A.D.; Fisher, A.				Wildlife Research	31	6		587-596	2004	2004				English	4	23	Forty-seven 50 m x 50 m quadrats were sampled systematically for vertebrates at Litchfield National Park, northern Australia, in both 1995-96 and 2001-02. A total of 184 vertebrate species was recorded from this sampling, of which 92 species were recorded from five or more quadrats. There was substantial change in the reported species composition of these quadrats between these two periods: the mean Bray-Curtis index for similarity in species composition from the baseline to subsequent sampling of a quadrat was only 22.1 (for an index that varies from 0 for complete turnover in species to 100 for unchanged composition). For individual species, correlations across quadrats in the abundance scores from baseline to resampling varied from -0.12 to 0.85. Matched-pairs testing showed that there was significant change in abundance for 18 species from the baseline to repeat sampling, and significant increase in total bird species richness and total native mammal abundance, but significant decrease in reptile species richness. Fire history was recorded biannually for 40 of the 47 quadrats. Fire was very frequent, with quadrats being burnt in an average of 3.65 years of the six years between fauna samples. Three aspects of this fire history (total number of years of fires, number of fires in the late dry season, and interval from the last fire to the date of resampling) were related to change in the fauna composition of quadrats. Neither the similarity in species composition, nor change in richness or total abundance of all vertebrates or of the four taxonomic classes considered (frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals) were significantly correlated with these components of the fire history of sampled quadrats. This lack of association was possibly because the monitoring period was too short to show pronounced directional change, because the system was responding to many factors other than fire, because the variations in abundance were too large and the number of samples too small to detect true associations, or because fire histories preceding baseline sampling were not considered. The apparent instability of fauna species and communities in this system provides a considerable challenge for broad-brush (that is, vertebrate community-wide) monitoring. Power analysis demonstrated that, for most species, more than 1000 sample sites are needed to be 90% certain of detecting a 20% change in abundance, and with a 10% chance of accepting a Type I error. This level of sampling effort is commensurate with the current level of vertebrate sampling in this region.

However, little is known about the effects of fire management practices on non-game bird communities, particularly in deciduous forests of the Midwest that are important breeding grounds for many Neotropical migrant songbirds. We compared bird species abundance and community composition in a recently burned (1993 and 1995) closed-canopy forest plot with an adjacent unburned plot, using breeding bird surveys conducted in 1996 and 1997. Avian species richness and overall bird abundance (for all species pooled) did not differ between sites. Avian community composition, however, differed between sites in both years. Ground-nesting Black-and-white Warblers (Mniotilta varia), Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocappilus) and Eastern Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) were more abundant in the unburned site. Conversely, cavity-nesting White-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis) were more abundant in the burned site. Migrant and resident ground- and shrub-nesting guilds were more abundant in unburned forest. Prescribed fires may adversely affect habitat quality for some forest songbirds, particularly species which require dense understory growth. Prescribed fires may benefit other species by creating open understories and snags. Land managers should consider the direct and indirect effects of habitat alteration associated with prescribed fires on all nesting songbirds to conserve local and regional avian biodiversity.

Biological Conservation	114	3		327-340	December 2003	2003				English	0	30	We examine the effects of matrix type on forest bird species richness in historically fragmented forests of the KwaZulu-Natal midlands, South Africa. Bird species-area relationships for forest fragments within natural grassland were compared with those surrounded by plantation forestry (Pinus spp.). While fragments in grasslands displayed a species-area effect, no such effect (slope [approximately]0) was detected for fragments in plantations. The critical fragment size to avoid an island effect on species richness was 302 ha for fragments in grasslands, and contained 51 of the 61 forest bird species encountered. Small forest fragments (<50 ha) within grasslands were less species-rich than those surrounded by plantation, while the reverse was true for forests larger than 50 ha. Bird density was significantly lower in larger forest patches within plantation when compared to those in grassland. However, a slight decline in species density with increasing species richness in a patch (i.e. weak density compensation) characterised only those bird assemblages surrounded by a grassland matrix, suggesting these are approaching species saturation. Commercial plantations may increase the likelihood of colonisation of, and immigration from, small forest fragments by birds, reducing the incidence of area-dependent extinction in small fragments, but may also result in lower species richness in larger fragments. The latter is likely a consequence of the promotion by plantations of a wider distribution of generalist species in, and the loss of some specialised or rare species from, large patches. Management options are to avoid planting plantations near large forest patches and to increase the size of small patches where possible. Where afforestation is unavoidable, placing plantations in the vicinity of small forest patches rather than large forest patches may be preferable.

Rey Benayas, Jose M.; de la Montana, Enrique				Biological Conservation	114	3		357-370	December 2003	2003				English	2	32	Identifying areas with relevant features of biodiversity is useful to rank priorities for strengthening the design of well-sited natural protected areas and to optimize resource investment in conservation. This study provides decision makers critical tools for highlighting pieces of land worthy of conservation in Spain. We studied four taxa--amphibians, reptiles, nesting birds and mammals--in a 50 x 50 km grid (n=259 cells). We used five criteria for identifying areas of high-value diversity: species richness, rarity, vulnerability, a combined index of biodiversity, and a Standardized Biodiversity Index that measured all four taxa together. As far as we know, the combined index of biodiversity and the Standardized Biodiversity Index are original. Areas of high-value diversity were defined as those cells within the 15% top segment of ranked values for the different criteria. Congruence of areas of high-value diversity for taxa pairs was moderate to low, and averaged 38.5% for areas of high-value diversity based on the combined index of biodiversity. The performance based on the average proportion of threatened species excluded from areas of high-value diversity followed the rank combined index of biodiversity = rarity (0.3%) > vulnerability (9.9%) > species richness (13.8%). The areas of high-value diversity identified according to the Standardized Biodiversity Index included all amphibian and mammal species, all but one reptile species (categorized as rare) and all but six bird species (three of which were categorized as threatened). About 70% of the areas of high-value diversity identified based on the Standardized Biodiversity Index included natural protected areas. However, they average only 274.6 km2, thus occupying a small fraction of the areas of high-value diversity, and there is no guarantee that the species found in an area of high-value diversity site will be present in its protected fraction. Consequently, we urge managers of natural protected areas to conduct diversity surveys. We also urge that additional natural protected areas be established to include the gap of 30% of areas of high-value diversity not currently protected. We took an step for biodiversity conservation planning in the studied region, and discuss the usefulness of maps of areas of high-value diversity for conservation, ecological restoration, and environmental impact assessment and mitigation.

Maclean, Ilya M.D.; Hassall, Mark; Boar, Rosalind; Nasirwa, Oliver				Bird Conservation International	13	4		283-297	December 2003	2003				English	0	14	The density and species richness of bird communities in disturbed and undisturbed stands of papyrus Cyperus papyrus were compared. Point counts, corrected for different probabilities of detection in different swamps, suggested that the species richness of bird communities in stands of papyrus disturbed by burning, grazing or pollution was higher than in nearby stands that were not disturbed. However, there were fewer species and individuals of highly specialized birds or species characteristic of papyrus, in disturbed stands than in undisturbed swamps. At <1 ha-1, the density of Papyrus Gonolek Laniarius mufumbiri in Ugandan swamps was, for example, significantly lower in polluted and burnt sites than in undisturbed papyrus where up to 13 ha-1 were recorded in the centre of swamps. White-winged Swamp Warbler Bradypterus carpalis was only recorded in undisturbed papyrus. In the papyrus that fringes Lake Naivasha in Kenya, outside the geographical range of species restricted to papyrus, disturbance in the form of grazing selects against species classified as swamp-reliant. Species classified as generalist users of papyrus were much less sensitive to disturbance than specialists. The density of swamp specialists was also lower near the edge of swamps, where total species richness was higher. These results are discussed in relation to conservation management of papyrus swamps in East Africa.

Provencher, Louis; Litt, Andrea R.; Gordon, Doria R.				Conservation Biology	17	6		1660-1671	December 2003	2003				English	2	16	Soil characteristics, disturbance histories, and species richness among distinct groups of plants and animals may be useful predictors of important conservation areas when data are limited. We used multivariate analysis of covariance to test the hypothesis that the species richness of plants, arthropods, herpetofauna, and breeding birds are correlated and increase with soil fertility (silt and clay content in sandy soils), soil variability, and hardwood midstory reduction in subxeric, nutrient-poor longleaf pine sandhills at Eglin Air Force Base in northwest Florida. During 1994-1995 and 1998-1999, we sampled 30 81-ha plots with varying fire-exclusion histories and at two spatial scales of resolution (10 x 40 m and 81 ha). The relationship between the number of plant species and percent silt and clay and its coefficient of variation was significant and positive at the plot level (81 ha) but not at the subplot level (10 x 40 m). Herpetofaunal species richness was the only faunal variable that increased with silt and clay content, but the coefficient of variation did not. Multivariate effects of hardwood reduction were significant in 1998-1999 but not in 1994-1995, which suggests that the reintroduction of fire increased species richness across taxa. Univariate effects of hardwood reduction were marginally significant for plant species richness at the subplot level and not significant for herpetofaunal species richness at either scale. Plant and arthropod species richness were not correlated. Herpetofaunal species richness was not correlated with that of other taxa (plant and animal). The species richness of plants and arthropods were each significantly positively correlated with the richness of breeding bird species at the subplot level during 1994-1995, whereas only arthropod species richness was positively correlated with bird species richness at the plot level in either year. Our results suggest that the restoration of fire regime may be the most effective tool with which to increase diversity in pyrogenic areas considered for conservation protection.

Pereira, Paulo Miguel; da Fonseca, Manuela Pires				Conservation Ecology	7	3		31pp.	December 2003	2003	http://www.consecol.org/Journal/			English	0	1	The southern Iberian Peninsula is dominated by a savannah-like ecosystem, the montado, which is a typically Mediterranean cultural adaptation to generally poor productive areas. Montados are exploited for three main uses: forestry, agriculture, and extensive grazing, in proportions that vary according to local conditions (more or less productive land) and historical circumstances. Because these ecosystems occur over a large geographic area (they occupy some 6 million ha), biodiversity would be expected to vary among montados. However, differences in management practices may also influence species distribution. In this paper, we investigate differences in plant and bird species diversity among 60 montados distributed all across southern Portugal. The environmental variables studied included geographical coordinates, climatological data, soil type, and altitude. We also investigated agro-economic variables that could describe human activities at each site: animal husbandry (breeds, stock density, grazing rotation, etc.), agriculture (fallow rotation frequency, use of fertilizers, etc.), and forestry (cork harvesting, thinning, etc.). Finally, land-use type and metrics were assessed from rectified aerial photographs. Species richness among these two groups was not correlated, sites with high or low numbers of plant species not necessarily having high or low numbers of bird species. However, both plant and bird communities exhibited a similar pattern of species composition and turnover. This pattern was ecologically based, rather than a result of biological similarities between groups: direct gradient analyses and variance partitioning revealed strong correlations between species distribution and spatial gradients, namely longitude and latitude. In trying to distinguish anthropogenic from biophysical processes, we found that both were equally important as drivers of montado biodiversity. Plants and birds exhibited a similar ecological pattern, although environmental conditions were slightly more important in the case of plants, and human activities were slightly more important in the case of birds.

Confer, John L.; Pascoe, Sarah May				Forest Ecology and Management	185	1-2		193-205	3 November 2003	2003				English	1	18	We studied bird density and nesting success on utility rights-of-way (ROW) managed primarily by selective herbicide application in New York, Massachusetts and Maine. For comparison, we also estimated bird density in ROW managed by cutting in New Hampshire and New York and in shrublands managed by fire in the Finger Lakes National Forest (FLNF), New York. On herbicide-managed ROW, we detected a mean of 14.3 individuals and 12.2 species per point count, including many species of early-succession habitat that are declining throughout northeastern United States. Nesting success in forested landscapes of New York, Maine, and Massachusetts was 55% on the ROW, 69% in forests within 20 m of the ROW, and 63% in forests more than 20 m from the ROW. Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitized 5.3% of the nests and reduced host recruitment by even less. This suggests that ROW in forested areas support high production of shrubland birds and do not exert a measurably harmful effect on forest-nesting birds. Selective herbicide application on ROW sustained shrubland vegetation and supported high densities and high nesting success. Mechanical cutting lowered the structural diversity of vegetation the following spring and was associated with fewer individual birds and species. Cool burns in early spring produced a high structural diversity of herbs, shrubs and trees and supported a high density of birds and bird species. Long-term maintenance of shrublands by burning will require supplemental cutting to remove saplings. As reforestation continues to reduce shrubland habitat, probably below pre-colonial levels, active management for early-succession habitat will be necessary to sustain current population levels of numerous species.

Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	99	1-3		113-124	October 2003	2003				English	1	22	The response of bird communities to a gradient of agricultural intensity was investigated in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Such knowledge may aid in predicting how avian diversity copes with increased human population density and land-use. A total of 34 transects were established on which bird censuses were made to test the effects of different fallow age, soil type and grazing intensity. Avian species richness was highest on actively disturbed land and gradually decreased with time since disturbance. Of 23 species restricted to one land-use type, 16 were found on cultivated land or recent fallows, 8 of them being categorized as uncommon in West Africa. Guild analyses suggest that availability of nest sites and food were the principal factors affecting bird distribution. For birds to persist in the agricultural landscape woody vegetation should include many different species and large trees should occur in the fields. Cultivated lands on the cuirasse had the highest average number of birds and many species were restricted to this land-use type. The potential for negative impact on the bird community was hence particularly high on the cuirasse.	Soderstrom, B.; Department of Conservation Biology, SLU, P.O.

However, relatively little research has examined effects of thinning conifer forests on vertebrates. We experimentally manipulated stands using a randomized block design to evaluate influences of two thinning intensities on populations of diurnal breeding birds in western Oregon. We conducted point counts of birds seven times each year in 1994 (prior to treatment) and from. 1995 through 2000 (subsequent to treatment). We analyzed data using multiple linear regression and information-theoretic approaches to model selection. Of the 22 species for which we had sufficient data for analysis, detections of nine species decreased and eight species increased in thinned stands relative to controls, and there was no strong evidence that thinning influenced numbers of five species. Of the 17 species that responded to thinning, the magnitude of response of eight species varied with thinning intensity; for each of these species, response was greatest in the more heavily thinned stands. Although no species was extirpated from stands following thinning, detections of Hutton's Vireos (Vireo huttoni), Golden-crowned Kinglets (Regulus satrapa), Brown Creepers (Certhia americana), Blackthroated Gray Warblers (Dendroica nigrescens), and Varied Thrushes (Ixoreus naevius) decreased to less than half of the detections in controls in one or more treatment types, suggesting thinning significantly reduces their numbers. In contrast, American Robins (Turdus migratorius), Townsend's Solitaires (Myadestes towizsendi), and Hammond's Flycatchers (Empidonax hammondii) were rare or absent in controls but regularly present in thinned stands, and detections of Western Tanagers (Piranga ludoviciana), Evening Grosbeaks (Coccothrazistes vespertinus), and Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) increased by threefold or more in thinned stands relative to controls. Only Pacific-slope Flycatchers (Empidonax difficilis), Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus), and Western Tanagers showed strong evidence of temporal trends in response. For these species, differences between numbers in controls and treated stands became more extreme through time. Our findings suggest that thinning densely stocked conifer stands in landscapes dominated by younger stands enhances habitat suitability for several species of birds, but that some unthinned patches and stands should be retained to provide refugia for species that are impacted by thinning.

Guerrieri, Gaspare; Castaldi, Amalia				Rivista Italiana di Ornitologia	73	1		55-70	30 Settembre 2003	2003				Italian	0	0	We have studied for three years (2001-2003) the effects of a bush fire and the following interventions on the environment regarding populations of Green Woodpecker, Picus viridis, Great Spotted Woodpecker, Picoides major, and Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, Picoides minor, in a Mediterranean coastal pine-forest (Castel Fusano, Rome). The area has been studied also during the two years before the bush fire (1999-2000), that burnt about 30%) of the whole forest (900 ha). Previous to the fire, P. viridis average density, calculated in the mature areas of the pine-forest, was 0.40 territories per 10 ha (S.D. = 0.55), P. major's was 1.27 territories per 10 ha (S.D. = 0.85) and P. minor's was 0.24 territories per 10 ha (S.D. = 0.43). After the bush fire (2001-2002), the territories contraction of P. viridis and P. major was 14% and 28%, respectively. The average density in the spared areas, or only damaged by the fire, was significantly increased (1.00-0.86 and 2.00-1.86 territories per 10 ha). For P. minor, instead, the average density in the mature, not burnt areas of the pine-forest, was not significantly increased (0.29-0.25 territory per 10 ha), while the 36% and the 40% of the territory was burnt. During the 2003 breeding season, after the interventions for the environment reclamation, also on the spared areas, the density of the three species was further reduced of 35%, 53%, 60%, respectively. At that time, density was reduced especially in the pine-forest areas recently planted, not burnt by the fire, but subjected to thinning out of pines and underwood elimination (-50%, -72%, -100%).

Chari, K.B.; Abbasi, S.A.; Ganapathy, S.				Aquatic Conservation	13	5		373-386	September-October 2003	2003				English	0	16	1. Oussudu lake is a large, shallow wetland situated close to the city of Pondicherry, India. The lake harbours rich flora and fauna, and has been recognized as one of the important wetlands of Asia by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), 2. This paper summarizes the results of a 5-year study on the annual composition, richness, diversity and population density of the bird community at Oussudu. A GIS database was developed on the basis of field surveys and allied studies, 3. The study reveals a declining trend in the number and diversity of the birds found at Oussudu with the exception of herons, egrets, plovers and lapwings. A relationship appears to exist between this decline in bird diversity and an increase in illegal fishing, cattle grazing, encroachments and pollution. These factors may have contributed to the decline of food and shelter for the birds, 4.

Woltmann, Stefan				Biodiversity and Conservation	12	9		1921-1936	September 2003	2003				English	0	17	Bird community characteristics of three sites with different levels of disturbance were studied using transect surveys during the dry season in a subtropical humid forest in Bolivia. One area had been unintentionally burned 4 years prior and selectively harvested (DIS) 1 year prior to sampling. A second area had been selectively harvested 1 year prior to sampling and had no recent history of fire (HAR). Species richness, as assessed by species-time curves and rarefaction, was higher in both altered areas than in undisturbed forest (INT). In general, frugivores and omnivores were more abundant in both altered areas compared to intact forest. Canopy frugivores, understory omnivores and multiple-strata omnivores were most abundant in HAR. Canopy frugivores, near-ground insectivores, understory and multiple-strata omnivores were least abundant in INT, although INT had the highest abundances of canopy insectivores and near-ground omnivores. Richness and abundance of widespread species with low habitat specificity was higher in both areas that experienced disturbance compared to intact forest. Differences in bird community structure between disturbed and intact forest at this site are attributed primarily to the addition of widespread species with less narrow habitat requirements, and possibly to changes in the distribution of different food types.

French	0	0	Birds communities of Montricher commune have been censued between 1998-2000 with two different methods. First, avian counts have been conducted in spring 1998 over three square kilometres between 780 and 1640 m. Altogether, 47 species were identified with 37 confirmed breeders. Among these, woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) was the only vulnerable species at the Swiss level (KELLER et al. 2001) while cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) and redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) were the two near threatened species encountered. To contact rare and elusive species such as grouse, we prospected potentially suitable habitats looking for specific signs. Overall, 131 capercaillie and 41 hazel grouse signs were discovered. Capercaillie was present on the western side of the Combe de la Verriere from 1065 m of altitude whereas hazel grouse presence was detected from 1 160 m and was discovered only four times on the east side of the Combe de la Verriere. The total number of displaying capercaillie males has strongly regressed from five males in 1989 down to two males in 1999. On the whole commune, the number of adult capercaillie is between 4-6 birds whereas between 11-16 adults hazel grouse were present. This initial state was then completed with management implications and a management plan for the avifauna.

Seddon, J.A.; Briggs, S.V.; Doyle, S.J.				Pacific Conservation Biology	9	2		95-119	September 2003	2003				English	1	7	This study investigated relationships between birds and characteristics of woodland remnants in the central wheat/ sheep belt of New South Wales, in order to provide information for conservation management of woodland birds and their habitats in this region. Birds were surveyed in standard area plots in 36 woodland remnants, which ranged from 1 to 1 376 hectares in size, in the central Lachlan catchment in the wheat/sheep belt of New South Wales. Habitat (e.g., shrub cover) and landscape (measures of isolation) characteristics of the remnants were recorded also. Presence/absence occurrences of 20 or more bird species, mostly woodland birds, were positively related to remnant area, shrub cover, number of shrub species, pine cover, fallen logs and branches, and number of remnants within two and five kilometres of the survey remnant. Species of birds that are habitat generalists showed negative or no relationships with these habitat and landscape variables. Richness of all bird species was positively related to remnant area and shrub cover. Number of woodland bird species was positively related to remnant area, shrub cover and tree hollows. Lower species diversities in smaller remnants were most likely caused by lower chances of survival or of successful breeding in small remnants, effects of isolation on the ability of birds to recolonize smaller remnants, small remnants being of insufficient area for some species to form territories, and generally poor habitat quality in small remnants. Retention, management and enhancement of woodland remnants 10 to 20 hectares or larger in size with good understorey cover are necessary for the future viability of woodland birds in the wheat/sheep belt of New South Wales.

Bird Study	50	2		116-130	July 2003	2003				English	0	13	Aims: To determine habitat associations of seed-eating passerines on Scottish farmland in winter, and recommend appropriate conservation measures. Methods: Transect surveys were carried out on farmland in 100 1-km squares, containing 2885 fields, across Scotland. Birds, crops, field boundary features and weeds were recorded on three visits. Bird-habitat associations were examined using logistic regression models. Results: Seed-eating passerines were highly concentrated: 100 fields (1.4% of the area surveyed) held half the total count. The highest field densities of birds were recorded in fodder brassica crops and stubbles, averaging 12 and 3.3 birds/ha respectively. In fodder crops, weedier fields held many more birds. Multiple regression analysis emphasized the importance of fodder crops, stubbles and farmyards and suggested that declining bird species preferred more open landscapes. Several bird species were associated with fields containing very weedy patches, and/or weeds of the family Chenopodiaceae. These features were commonest in fodder brassicas. Many of the crop types found to be important as bird habitats in winter have declined in area in Scotland; the availability of seed food in such habitats may also have diminished. Such changes may partly explain recent population declines. Conclusions: Agri-environment measures for seed-eating passerines should support the widespread provision of small areas of seed-rich wintering habitats, such as weedy fodder brassicas and stubbles, especially in open (0-10% woodland and scrub) landscapes in areas with mild winters.

Methods: Birds were surveyed on both scheme and control sites. In the breeding season, a modified Breeding Bird Survey methodology was employed. Complete counts of all birds on each site were conducted in winter. Differences in numbers, or in the change in numbers between the first and second years, between scheme and control sites were assessed by multiple log-linear regression. Results: Most species or guilds did not show significant responses to the scheme, although there were statistically significant positive effects on some key target groups, including breeding Lapwing Vanellus vanellus and wintering granivorous passerines. Conclusion: The potential reasons for the lack of significant results, including the short length of the monitoring programme, are discussed. Future studies aimed at evaluating the effects of land management prescriptions on birds should be mindful of the time-scale over which monitoring is conducted.

Brandt, Thomas				Vogelkundliche Berichte aus Niedersachsen	35	1		39-54	Juli 2003	2003				German	0	0	In 2002, a countrywide census of the Eagle Owl was carried out in Lower Saxony in order to find all territories and to answer questions about habitat choice and conservation possibilities for the owl. Finally 59 territories were mapped, and another 16 were recorded without too much detail. Including an estimated amount of breeding pairs that could not be discovered about 75 to 85 pairs of Eagle Owls were calculated to be present in Lower Saxony. Within Lower Saxony, Eagle Owls were found to breed in six of nine natural regions and their density was highest in the southern Weser-Leine Highland with 66 % of all discoveries.In seven out of 18 counties five or more territories were found (Holzminden, Hameln-Pyrmont, Hannover, Goslar, Osnabrueck, Osterode, Schaumburg). Most of the breeding sites (75 %) were situated in deserted quarries, while about half of the quarries were still in use or served as dumping sites. Further breeding places were situated in gravel- and sandpits (12 %), on trees, in natural rocks or on the ground. Eagle owls breeding in buildings had been discovered in earlier years, but could not be seen in 2002. The exposition of breeding-walls does not seem to be of any importance. Results of preferences concerning height and length of the breeding-walls are not possible because of the small number of comparable walls that were not used as breeding sites. Eagle Owls bred within walls of a minimum height of 10 m, and a length of 20 m. As far as the population-development in Lower Saxony is known, the number of breeding Eagle Owls has increased steadily in the eighties and in the beginning of the nineties. During the last years only a small increase in number has been observed, and range-expansion has been low. About twenty breeding-sites known since 1980 were used as breeding place only temporarily. The results of the first countrywide Eagle Owl - census in 2002 and earlier results are discussed here. Protection suggestions from literature are summarized in this paper. The most important measure is the protection of abandoned quarries. They should not be used as dumping sites but protected against disturbance by leisure-time activities, such as rock-climbing.

Tattari, Sirkka; Schultz, Titta; Kuussaari, Mikko				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	96	1-3		119-132	June 2003	2003				English	2	20	Bayesian belief network (Fully Connected Belief Networks, FC BeNe) was used to estimate uncertainty in the functioning of established buffer zones in Finland. Four experts in the field of water protection and four in biodiversity were asked to assess the roles of 25 key variables involved in the functioning of buffer zones. The matrix comprised five levels of information: field properties, buffer zone properties, management measures, site data and concerns. The eight experts were asked to estimate probability distributions and causal relationships between the 25 variables, which included in particular erosion, particle bound P, dissolved P, and plant, insect and bird species diversity. Any of the three phases of the analysis; prior distributions, links and posterior distributions are end products which are usable as such. The highest uncertainties were attributed to management measures, e.g. sowing leys, meadow plants, trees and/or bushes and soil removal from the upper end of the field in order to create nutrient-poor meadows. Uncertainties were also seen in P-status, fertilizer and manure changes, transport of dissolved phosphorus, particle bound phosphorus, bird species diversity and landscape. All experts thought that erosion affects particle bound phosphorus, but there was wide deviation in the link strength values, 0.05-0.7, which clearly reflects a lack of knowledge. Two of the experts assumed particle bound P to become partly dissolved, the other two did not. The effect of buffer zones on transport of dissolved phosphorus was not clear. The link strength direction of the variables grazing and rotational grazing to dissolved P varied between the experts. According to the expert evaluations, positive impacts caused by buffer zones were probable in erosion, and in plant and insect species diversity, which is in agreement with existing empirical studies. Experts expected plant height to be beneficial to bird species diversity, but disagreed as to the effect of plant height on plant and insect species diversity. Biodiversity experts considered that steep slopes produced more erosion, more leaching, and hence more patches for biodiversity contrary to water pollution.

Perfecto, Ivette; Mas, Alexandre; Dietsch, Thomas; Vandermeer, John				Biodiversity and Conservation	12	6		1239-1252	June 2003	2003				English	5	57	We compare species richness of birds, fruit-feeding butterflies and ground-foraging ants along a coffee intensification gradient represented by a reduction in the number of species of shade trees and percentage of shade cover in coffee plantations. We sampled the three taxa in the same plots within the same period of time. Two sites were selected in the Soconusco region of the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Within each site four habitat types were selected and within each habitat type four points were randomly selected. The habitat types were forest, rustic coffee, diverse shade coffee, and intensive coffee (low density of shade). We found different responses of the three taxa along the intensification gradient. While ants and butterflies generally decrease in species richness with the decrease of shade cover, birds declined in one site but increased in the other. Ant species richness appears to be more resistant to habitat modification, while butterfly species richness appears to be more sensitive. Bird species richness was correlated with distance from forest fragments but not with habitat type, suggesting that scale and landscape structure may be important for more mobile taxa. For each of these taxa, the rustic plantation was the one that maintained species richness most similar to the forest. We found no correlation between the three taxa, suggesting that none of these taxa are good candidates as surrogates for each other. We discuss the implications of these results for the conservation of biodiversity in coffee plantations, in particular, the importance of distinguishing between different levels of shade, and the possibility that different taxa might be responding to habitat changes at different spatial scales.

To study urbanization impacts on habitat and avian populations we chose 21 upland sites and 21 riparian sites in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Habitat structure and species composition were measured at each sample point and a variety of landscape-habitat metrics were measured from aerial photographs and recorded as to location using a geographic information system (GIS). Spearman's rank correlations of habitat and avian community descriptor variables tested the strength and significance of the relationship between variables. Full stepwise regression procedures assessed the response to independent variables of landscape-habitat to five bird guilds. Guilds varied in the strength and nature of the relationship between community parameters and several gradients of habitat structure, vegetation, area and site configuration. Significant negative correlations of species richness of permanent resident, winter resident, and neotropical guilds with housing density, road density and volume of exotic woody species were found. These same guilds were positively correlated to riparian area, channel density, and total volume of woody species. Linear and quadratic regression equations explained between 40 and 81% of the observed variation in avian guild richness and abundance. Total volume of woody species was the single most important predictor included in regression equations for four of seven community guilds. The impacts of urbanization on native bird diversity may be reduced if emphasis is placed on maintenance of native vegetation and native riparian channels and banks in urbanized riparian areas.

Fleishman, Erica; Mcdonal, Neil; Mac Nally, Ralph; Murphy, Dennis D.; Walters, Jack; Floyd, Ted				Journal of Animal Ecology	72	3		484-490	May 2003	2003				English	2	56	1. In the deserts of the south-western United States of America, as in many ecoregions around the world, invasion of non-native plants is modifying the structure and composition of riparian vegetation. 2. Restoration of native plant species frequently proves to be ecologically and economically difficult. In the Muddy River drainage in the Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA), eradication of one the most aggressive invasive plants, Tamarix ramosissima (salt-cedar), often reduces the structural and compositional diversity of the remaining vegetation. This can have negative effects on native animals, including birds. 3. The objectives of our work were (i) to examine relationships between avian diversity and measures of vegetational diversity (species richness, dominance of non-native plants and vegetation structure [total vegetation volume]), (ii) to explore the extent to which avian community composition was associated with vegetation composition (floristics) or vegetation structure (physiognomy), and (iii) to consider the potential effects of alternative land management and ecological restoration strategies on the biodiversity of birds and other native fauna in watersheds in the arid south-western USA. 4. Species richness of all birds and of breeding birds was best modelled by total vegetation volume alone. Neither species richness of plants nor dominance of non-native plants had a statistically significant effect on species richness, abundance or evenness of birds. 5. Species composition of birds between sites was more similar when floristics was more similar, and vice versa. Species composition of birds was not correlated with physiognomy. 6. Species richness of native birds in the Muddy River drainage appears not to suffer from invasion of non-native plants, provided that the vegetational community retains sufficient structural diversity. 7. The composition of the bird community is closely related to floristics, and other taxonomic groups may exhibit different responses to vegetation structure and composition. Therefore, explicit strategies for landscape-scale management, restoration and maximization of native faunal diversity should consider how removal of invasive plants may affect physiognomy and floristics of the vegetational community as a whole.

Ross, Bradley D.; Yahner, Richard H.				Journal of the Pennsylvania Academy of Science	77	1		7-14	May 2003	2003				English	0	2	We examined distributional patterns of avian guilds in relation to habitat data in the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province, Centre County, Pennsylvania. County-wide avian data (migratory, habitat, and foraging guild classifications) were obtained from the Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas (BBA), and habitat data (cover types, roadways, and streams) were derived from satellite imagery and the state transportation department. Based on linear-regression analyses, certain guild types were positively affected by extensive amounts of herbaceous grasslands (e.g., neotropical migrants) and herbaceous land (e.g., canopy-sallier foragers) and negatively affected by herbaceous cultivated lands (e.g., deciduous forest species) and developed lands (e.g., trunk-bark foragers). Neotropical migrats and canopy-sallier foragers were positively associated with wooded land/herbaceous grassland and wooded land/herbaceous land edges, respectively. However, deciduous and coniferous forest species were negatively associated with herbaceous land and developed land interfacing forest habitat, and trunk-bark foragers were negatively associated by greater amounts of deciduous wooded land/developed land edges. Differences in the abundance of nest predators and brood parasites may be among the reasons why regional species richness differs with various types of land uses or edges. Birds associated with forested habitats were positively correlated with the amount of forestland within BBA blocks; conversely, forest associates were negatively affected by edge habitat. Thus, professionals need to consider the amount and juxtaposition of different land uses as well as the extent and types of edge habitat when creating natural reserves and managing avian communities. Even minor increases in the amount of forest fragmentation and associated increase in edge can make habitat unsuitable for deciduous and coniferous forest species.

Nappi, Antoine; Drapeau, Pierre; Giroux, Jean-Francois; Savard, Jean-Pierre L.				Auk	120	2		505-511	April 2003	2003				English	0	15	We studied snag use for foraging by Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) one year after a fire in an eastern black spruce (Picea mariana) boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. We searched for signs of foraging (bark flaking and excavation holes) by Black-backed Woodpeckers on 6,536 snags sampled in 56 plots located in portions of the burned forest that had not been salvage logged. A logistic regression model was developed based on the presence or absence of foraging signs. Results showed that Black-backed Woodpeckers used larger snags that were less deteriorated by fire (qualified as high-quality snags). Direct field observations of individuals foraging on 119 snags also indicated that used snags corresponded to those of high predicted quality. Finally, we assessed the relationship between food availability and snag characteristics by measuring the density of wood-boring beetle larvae holes on 30 snags of different size and deterioration classes. High-quality snags contained higher prey densities (wood-boring beetle holes) than smaller and more deteriorated snags. We recommend that forest blocks characterized by large and less deteriorated trees be preserved from salvage logging in recently burned boreal forests in northeastern North America.

Ecological Modelling	162	1-2		155-175	1 April 2003	2003				English	0	6	We developed a simulation model of forest succession in managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) short-leaf pine (Pinus echinata) plantations to explore factors that influence temporal variability in avian richness. We simulated 16 unique landscapes through a full harvest rotation (i.e. 25 years from planting to harvest). In the model, Neotropical migrant birds colonized tree stands based on habitat parameters such as vegetation type, stand size and configuration, and amount of edge. The model predicted species richness and abundance for each stand and across the landscape. Results demonstrated how stand size, stand configuration, and habitat fragmentation may play a substantial role in landscape suitability concerns for Neotropical migrant birds. An intermediate level of landscape fragmentation appeared to decrease variation in total bird abundance and to provide greater overall species richness, the latter an important consideration when the concern lies with optimizing multiple species management.

Herrando, Sergi; Brotons, Lluis; Llacuna, Santiago				Ibis	145	2		307-317	April 2003	2003				English	1	10	The occurrence of large burnt areas has increased considerably in southern Europe in recent years. In order to design management plans to prevent large wildfires while preserving biodiversity, understanding of the ways in which birds respond to these fires is required. We investigated the spatial variability of both avifauna and habitat structure in three zones: unburnt, burnt in 1982, and burnt in 1994. The habitat structure of the unburnt zone was the most variable spatially. However, bird species composition between sampling points was very homogeneous in space. In contrast, the bird communities inhabiting burnt zones were more spatially heterogeneous. This pattern was caused by distinct specific responses to variations in habitat structure. Open-space species responded to small changes in habitat structure with large changes in local abundance, whereas the response of forest species to these structural variations was much less. We suggest that land managers should select specific zones with limited vegetation recovery within large burnt areas and maintain them as open space to keep combustibility low and provide an appropriate habitat for several open space species that are of conservation concern.

Pretty, J.L.; Harrison, S.S.C.; Shepherd, D.J.; Smith, C.; Hildrew, A.G.; Hey, R.D.				Journal of Applied Ecology	40	2		251-265	April 2003	2003				English	11	113	1. River rehabilitation schemes are now widespread in the UK and elsewhere, but there have been few systematic assessments of their ecological effect, particularly on target organisms such as fish. Fish populations were therefore assessed in 13 lowland rivers using point abundance measures and depletion electrofishing. Each river was sampled in two reaches, respectively containing a small-scale rehabilitation scheme (artificial riffles or flow deflectors) and an unrehabilitated control reach. Detailed geomorphological surveys were undertaken for the two study reaches in each river to assess the physical and hydraulic effect of rehabilitation. 2. There were large qualitative and quantitative differences among rivers and some had relatively impoverished fish faunas. Overall, total fish abundance, species richness, diversity and equitability were not significantly different between rehabilitated and control reaches. This was true for both the sampling methods used. Bullhead Cottus gobio and stone loach Barbatula barbatula tended to be more abundant in rehabilitated reaches, but this was significant only for artificial riffles. There was a significant between-year difference in fish abundance. 3. In general, rehabilitation schemes increased depth and flow heterogeneity, and fish species richness and diversity appeared to respond positively to increased flow velocity in restored reaches. However, there were few significant relationships between the fish fauna and physical variables, indicating that increasing physical (habitat) heterogeneity does not necessarily lead to higher biological diversity. We therefore caution against the use of physical responses to rehabilitation as a surrogate or reliable predictor of ecological response. 4. The weak response of fishes to rehabilitation may have been because the schemes were inappropriate in design and scale for low-gradient rivers. Furthermore, fish assemblages may have lacked the potential for recovery because of poor water quality and/or because the schemes were isolated within longer sections of degraded river. More extensive and directed biological monitoring is essential to improve understanding and enable future improvements in the design of schemes and the selection of sites with greater potential for successful rehabilitation. 5. Synthesis and applications: From this substantial sample of lowland rivers, there is little evidence of any general benefit to fish of small-scale instream structures in river rehabilitation. From present ecological knowledge it may be that resources would be better devoted to promoting the development of lateral and off-channel habitats within the river corridor. Physical restoration will be most effective when used alongside other strategies to augment fish populations such as water quality management.

Sullivan, Thomas P.; Sullivan, Druscllia S.				Environmental Reviews	11	1		37-59	March 2003	2003				English	0	7	The conservation of biological diversity (biodiversity) is becoming an integral part of the sustainable management of forest- and agro-ecosystems. A vital part of these systems is weed control, or vegetation management, to enhance crop production. Because of its widespread use and environmental compatibility, this review was designed to evaluate glyphosate herbicide in terms of: (i) its role as a disturbance agent and (ii) a measure of its impact on species diversity of terrestrial plants and animals. Our analyses were based on 60 published studies of terrestrial plants and animals in temperate zone forest- and agro-ecosystems. Species richness and diversity of vascular plants was either unaffected or increased, particularly herbaceous species, in response to glyphosate. Responses of plant species in forest ecosystems differ from those in agro-ecosystems where glyphosate is used to repeatedly reduce non-crop vegetation in most situations. Richness and diversity of songbirds appeared little affected by glyphosate-induced habitat alteration. In studies on small mammal communities and glyphosate use, none found significant reductions in species richness or diversity. As for avian responses, some small mammal species declined temporarily whereas others increased. in abundance. The impact of glyphosate on large mammalian herbivores was measured by abundance of animals and food plants and by habitat use. Hares (Lepus spp. L.) and deer (Odocoileus spp. Rafinesque and Capreolus capreolus L.) were little affected, whereas reductions in plant biomass and related moose (Alces alces L.) forage and habitat use generally occur for 1-5 years after treatment. Studies on terrestrial invertebrates covered a wide range of taxa with variable responses in abundance to glyphosate treatments. The magnitude of observed changes in mean species richness and diversity of vascular plants, birds, and small mammals, from the effects of herbicide treatment, were within the mean values of natural fluctuations of these variables. The biological significance of this impact is limited to shifts in species composition based on changes in floral composition and structure of habitats. Management for a mosaic of habitats within forest and agricultural landscapes, which provide a range of conditions for plant and animal species, should help ameliorate the short-term changes in species composition accompanying vegetation management with glyphosate.

The research hypotheses were then proposed as (1) there are relationships between landscape structure indexes and birds' diversity in the rural areas of Taiwan; (2) the relationships between landscape structure and birds' diversity will be different in different hierarchical levels. In order to increase the bird species, landscape planners could tries to increase the density of water bodies, but decrease the farms and human planted woods. Decrease the density of constructed and human planted grasslands. Increase the area of un-worked acres, natural grasslands, and the area of water bodies and circular the water bodies and natural forest. In order to increase birds' diversity, landscape planners could decrease the concentration of paved areas. Concentrate the human planted trees to increase the core areas of woodlands. Increase the area of natural grassland circular. In order to increase the total number of birds in the planning areas, landscape planners could scattered the paved areas and lengthen the constructed areas. Decreases the core region of the constructed areas. Increase the area of un-worked acres and water bodies. Decrease the disturbance of both the interior area of natural and human planted woodlands and try to increase the density of water bodies. The analysis results showed that the small grain size indexes are more suitable for the rural areas of Taiwan to capture the influential factors of bird communities. The high fragmentation of land usages in Taiwan lessens the influences of the regional landscape pattern.

Weiermans, Jacolette; van Aarde, Rudi J.				Restoration Ecology	11	1		43-49	March 2003	2003				English	2	19	Post-mining coastal dune rehabilitation north of Richards Bay, KwaZulu-Natal started 20 years before field work for the present study commenced. This resulted in the development of a known age sere of coastal dune forest succession. These rehabilitating areas are fragmented by roads that may act as ecological edges. To establish whether roads affect regenerating bird, millipede, and rodent assemblages, multivariate techniques were applied to test for existence of edge and core assemblages within seral stages representative of the coastal dune forest successional sere. Edge and core assemblages were identified for both the bird and millipede communities but not for the rodent community. Low rodent numbers may have concealed edge effects, but the absence of edge and core assemblages could also be ascribed to the absence of a forest core. In the bird community species composition, richness, density, and total number of species contributed to the identification of edge and core assemblages. Within seral stages the species composition of millipedes differed between the edge and core assemblages. However, if the site was the same age the number of species in edge and core assemblages was similar. The generality of the edge concept should be approached with caution when dealing with taxa comprising species with such diverse natural histories as in the present study. It should also be kept in mind that some species require forest interiors for survival.	van Aarde, Rudi J.; Conservation Ecology Research Unit, Department of Zoology and Entomology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, 0002, South Africa, South Africa.

Hanowski, JoAnn; Danz, Nick; Lind, Jim; Niemi, Gerald				Forest Ecology and Management	174	1-3		315-328	17 February 2003	2003				English	4	15	We examined response of breeding bird communities to timber harvest in riparian areas using two harvest techniques (full tree harvest and cut-to-length (CTL)) along first to third order streams in northern Minnesota, USA. Although many studies have quantified bird response to riparian buffer harvest, we are unaware of any study that examined the response of breeding birds to riparian forest harvest using different cutting practices. We compared community composition, total abundance and species richness, as well as abundance of six individual species on plots within four treatments (three plots/treatment) completed within 30 m on both sides of the stream. Treatments in the riparian area (30 m on both sides of the stream) were: (1) riparian control (no harvest); (2) reduction of basal area to an average of 7-10 m2/ha with full tree harvest system; (3) reduction of basal area to an average of 7-10 m2/ha with CTL harvest system; and (4) control (no harvest in riparian area or upland). For treatments 1, 2, and 3, adjacent upland forests on the plots were clearcut. Bird surveys were completed 1 year prior to, and 3 years after harvest and revealed a significant response of the bird community to timber harvest in the riparian area. Bird communities were most affected by tree removal with both harvest methods, but harvest type also affected bird communities. Early-successional species, e.g. song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), mourning warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), and chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica) were associated with harvested plots, whereas forest species, e.g. scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea) and black-throated green warbler (Dendroica virens) were associated with riparian control and control plots. Of six individual species tested for response to riparian harvest treatment over time, only the ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) showed a significant time by treatment interaction. Ovenbird numbers decreased in both the CTL and full tree harvest plots through 2000, when no individuals were observed. Two other forest-dependent species, black-throated green warbler and hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus), showed similar responses to treatment as the ovenbird. The winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) responded positively to the greater amount of slash that was left on-plot with the CTL harvest system. However, with the exception of the winter wren, we found that bird species and communities did not differ in their response to harvest system.

To study the local breeding bird community we surveyed 100 listening sample points distributed in four habitat types: open grasslands, woodland edges between grasslands and conifers ("outside margins"), woodland edge near felling areas ("inside margins"), and coniferous woodland. A high number of species are linked within side margins, comparatively more than to outside margins and much more than in the two remaining habitats. Data analysis highlights the importance of the presence of bushes and grassy headlands in the margins for species diversity and the presence of certain species. Conservation work to restore the full gradual transition from forest to grassland would significantly increase the biodiversity value of the region.

Haben Wiesenvoegel in binnenlaendischen Schutzgebieten ein "Fuchsproblem"?	Koester, Heike; Bruns, Holger A.				Berichte zum Vogelschutz	40			57-74	2003	2003				German	0	1	In many reserves for meadow birds, mammalian predators were found (or assumed) to cause high egg losses in ground-nesting birds. Some studies presented evidence of a relationship between population densities of voles, the principal food of predators in the reserves, and egg losses. We studied the abundance of voles and the egg losses of Lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) in the nature reserve "Alte Sorge-Schleife" in northern Germany and in a neighbouring intensively cultivated grassland polder from 1999 to 2002. The study was part of a project to find out the reasons for the decrease of the numbers of breeding Lapwings in the nature reserve. The breeding density of Lapwings declined by 50% in the nature reserve between 1999 and 2002. Egg losses varied between 76% and 95%. The community of rodents was relatively rich in species. Only in spring 2001 could no rodents be caught in the reserve. In the intensively cultivated grassland polder Common Voles (Microtus arvalis) predominated. Between 0 and 118 individuals were caught. The number of lapwings in the polder did not decrease during the study period although the survival of chicks was low. Three explanations for the decline of Lapwings in the reserve are discussed: 1. The rising of the water levels and the reduced intensity of farming changed the vegetation in the reserve. Higher plants, in particular Juncus effusus, seemed to reduce the attractiveness of the area for Lapwings. 2. The changed grassland vegetation in the reserve supported a diversity of vole species, and the high water level increased the population of amphibians. Both factors caused a significantly higher predation rate at eggs of lapwings as a consequence. 3. The quick growth of vegetation in the reserve hampered a long egg-laying period. Losses of early clutches could not be replaced, and, as a result, the effect of predation was increased. Finally we propose some management options for meadow bird reserves.

Ten species of grasses and herbs occurred in the old field community compared to 6 on the reclaimed mine site. Both vegetation height and the amount of ground cover were significantly greater in the old field community. Fourteen bird species were observed using the old field community compared with 9 using the reclaimed mine site with 6 species common to both sites. Henslow's sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii) were more numerous on the reclaimed mine site with a mean frequency of 1.6 birds/100 m and a density of 7.1 bird/ha. On the reclaimed mine site, both the total number of birds (r = 0.621, P < 0.01) and the density (birds/ha) of the avian community (r = 0.277, P < 0.05) were significantly correlated with vegetation height, but only bird density was correlated with vegetative coverage (r = 0.860, P < 0.001). Whereas, in the old field community vegetation height was correlated with the density of the avian community (r= 0.879, P < 0.001), the total number of birds was not correlated with either vegetation height or area coverage. Reclaimed mine sites are an important component in the ecology of grassland bird communities, but they must be managed to curtail the invasion of woody vegetation via natural succession.

English	0	14	Purpose and Objective The purpose of the biodiversity assessment is to help inform the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Kosovo Mission's planning during the development of their new five-year Country Strategic Plan (CSP, FY 2004-FY 2008) and to ensure USAID compliance with Section 119 of the US Foreign Assistance Act (FAA 119) and Agency guidance on Country Strategy Development. In meeting the FAA 119 requirements of USAID/Kosovo, the assessment had three main objectives: 1. Provide an overview of biodiversity status and threats. 2. Highlight actions needed to conserve biodiversity. 3. Analyze and assess how USAID/Kosovo's planned future CSP may impact on, or contribute to, biodiversity conservation. Based on Mission guidance, the Biodiversity Assessment Team also briefly assessed ways in which the Mission's planned future CSP can contribute to improved environmental management and sustainability. Environmental Requirements for Country Strategic Plans (USAID/Kosovo is currently in the process of developing a new CSP. FAA 119 requires USAID missions worldwide to assess national needs for biodiversity, and potential USAID contributions to meet these needs, in developing all country strategy documents. Specifically, FAA 119 states that each country development strategy statement or other country plan, prepared by USAID, shall include an analysis of (1) the actions necessary in that country to conserve biological diversity, and (2) the extent to which the actions proposed for support by the Agency meet the needs thus identified.1 This requirement is further articulated in USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS), Section 201.3.4.11.b, on mandatory environmental analysis for strategic plans. Methodology The Assessment was conducted over a three-week period, by an ARD Team comprised of two expatriates and one local specialist, with expertise in biodiversity conservation, natural resources management and governance, and environmental protection and compliance. The team reviewed existing literature relevant to biodiversity conservation and environmental management in Kosovo. The Team Leader met with representatives from USAID's E & E Bureau and various regional biodiversity and environmental specialists from the World Bank. In Kosovo, the Team interviewed a diverse range of representatives from government agencies, donors, and civil society (see Annex F for the complete list of persons consulted), and took field trips to Sharr/Sara Mountain National Park and the proposed Bjeshket e Nemuna/Prokletije National Park. An additional trip was made to Prizren to attend a meeting of local environmental NGOs. Status of Biodiversity and Conservation in Kosovo Kosovo is exceptionally rich in plant and tree species considering its relatively small area. Thirteen plant species have been identified that grow only in Kosovo and approximately 200 species that grow only in the Balkans. Kosovo's plant diversity is the result of complex interaction of physical factors creating a wide variety of habitat conditions for plant growth. Kosovo's plant diversity is further enriched by the presence of species driven south during ice age periods. Forests cover about 40% of Kosovo but only about a third of this area is considered ecologically healthy and economically productive. Most of the remaining two-thirds consists of immature trees and bushy low forests that are cut periodically for firewood. The pace of firewood harvesting increased during and since the war, but Kosovo must still import more than half of its fuel wood and most of its construction timber. Mature oak forests are now highly threatened. Several species of plants are known to be on the verge of extinction in Kosovo or are already locally extinct-largely due to human actions. The factors that create favorable conditions for plant diversity in Kosovo also explain the high level of animal diversity within this relatively small area. There are an estimated 46 mammal species in Kosovo, many with regional or global conservation significance. The mountainous borderlands of Kosovo provide habitats for a number of large mammalian species including brown bears, lynx, wild cats, wolves, foxes, wild goat, roebuck, and deer. It is anticipated that 225 species of birds are either resident in Kosovo or are seasonal migrants-including several species of birds of prey. Most of the animal species in the country are threatened by destruction of forest habitats. Some species of water birds have already been lost in Kosovo, probably as a result of wetland destruction. Hunting was allegedly heavy during the 1990s but is currently banned and there is reportedly little illegal hunting. The current status of game populations is unknown. The populations of two species of turtles have been seriously depleted by collection for the pet trade. Aquatic ecosystems in rivers are highly threatened as a result of water pollution from domestic and industrial sources as well as uncontrolled sand and gravel mining in riverbeds. Much of the remaining diversity of land plants and animals is found in the higher mountains in the southern and western regions of Kosovo. The Sharr/Sara Mountain National Park to the south covers 39,000 ha and a proposed new park in the Albanian Alps west of Peje/Peae will protect an additional 50,000 ha. Other protected areas include two protected landscapes and 38 natural monuments. When the new national park is formally declared, Kosovo will have protected almost 10% of its land area, which is the internationally accepted target. Sharr/Sara Mountain National Park is officially managed by a staff under the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP), but one-third of its area is actually managed by the former Serbian park staff who report directly to Belgrade. Economic Value of Kosovo's Biodiversity Kosovo's biodiversity resources can be managed sustainably to produce economic benefits while also conserving biodiversity. The forests are an economically important renewable natural resource with the potential to supply wood and non-wood products as well as environmental services such as watershed protection and carbon sequestration. Kosovo must currently import most of its construction timber and more than half of its fuel wood because forests were not properly managed in past decades up to the present time. Authors of a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) forest sector study estimate that after the state forest industries are privatized and the supply of wood from the forests is predictable, 4,800 people will be employed directly in forestry and wood processing, with a total of 30,000 people employed in forest sector-related activities when downstream and support jobs are included. Collection of medicinal and herbal plants from the forests is the basis of an industry in Kosovo and wild mushrooms and berries are also collected for sale. The monetary value of these products is believed to be significant but has not been evaluated. In the past, hunting was an important source of revenue for a state-owned enterprise and some communities. Efforts underway by the Wildlife Management Office could again make hunting an economically important activity. Tourism at Sharr/Sara Mountain National Park already generates jobs in the service sector and could potentially benefit from municipal taxes from hotels and restaurants. With improvements in the management of that park and opening of the new park, nature-based tourism could be an important source of income for local municipalities and a source of jobs for the rural population. Legal and Institutional Aspects of Biodiversity Conservation The Environmental Protection Law was passed by the Kosovo Assembly in January 2003 and provides the broad legal framework for environmental management and biodiversity conservation. The provisions of this law will be elaborated by secondary laws, including acts that will address nature conservation and spatial planning, both of relevance to biodiversity conservation. The Law on Forests was passed in March 2003 and builds a legal foundation for putting forest management on a more rational basis, including provisions to manage forests in a manner that will protect biodiversity. This law will be elaborated by supplemental legislation including one that will address wildlife management. MESP has the primary mandate for conserving biodiversity. The Department of Environment within MESP has operational responsibility for national park management and other biodiversity management functions and the Institute for Nature and Environmental Protection (INEP) within the soon-to-be-formed Kosovo Environmental Protection Agency (KEPA) provides scientific support. The Kosovo Forest Agency (KFA) within the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural Development (MAFRD) is responsible for forest management on public and state lands including the collection of non-wood forest products. The Economy of Hunting under KFA will manage sport hunting when the hunting ban is lifted. The faculty of Biology at the University of Prishtine/Pristina, the Kosovo Academy of Sciences, and the Kosovo Museum each has a support role in the scientific aspects of biodiversity conservation. Actions Required to Conserve Biodiversity The following four areas require attention to bring biodiversity conservation in Kosovo up to acceptable international standards. * The scientific basis for biodiversity conservation is very weak in terms of appropriately trained academic scientists and practitioners in government and civil society. Academic and in-service training is sorely needed as well as technical assistance to the government. A related problem is that the information on biodiversity resources is outdated and fragmented. In order to manage and conserve these resources, comprehensive field surveys of all plant and animal groups are needed and these data must be entered into a geographically referenced database. * Protection of biodiversity is currently accomplished solely through setting aside protected areas. The management of the current national park is very weak and other protected areas are not actively managed. Technical assistance and funding is needed to make the protected area system perform its intended functions in terms of biodiversity conservation, education, and recreation. The government must continue to elaborate the legal basis of conservation and provide trained staff to enforce the laws. Steps must also be taken to protect ecosystems and species outside current protected areas by protecting rare plant habitats and protecting the rivers from pollution and sand mining. * Biodiversity resources that have economic value deserve special management attention and efforts are required to understand the biological basis for managing these resources. Modern management systems based on a solid scientific foundation, that take into consideration the unique characteristics of these resources, are needed to ensure the sustainability of forest and wildlife resources and additional regulations are required to ensure that economic benefits are captured by society. For example, if the natural regeneration rate of a particularly rare or economically important tree species is too slow to yield desired stocks, or if the natural regeneration process requires an intermediary species or a set of environmental conditions that are increasingly rare, then those responsible for management may decide to actively manage this resource (e.g., develop a seed bank, establish nurseries, transplant seedlings, etc.). * Improved environmental management will also enhance biodiversity conservation-especially efforts to reduce river pollution and sand and gravel mining in rivers, eliminate toxic pesticides from the market, and prepare spatial plans that reflect biodiversity values and environmental concerns. International Donor and NGO Support for Biodiversity and Environmental Management Given the pressing human needs facing post-conflict Kosovo, biodiversity conservation simply did not evolve as a priority programming area for most international donors or NGOs after the war. However, four years later, a small number of international donors and local NGOs have begun to focus on issues related to biodiversity conservation. Others donors and NGOs, addressing issues of environmental management (e.g., wastewater and solid waste management), have tangentially begun contributing to conservation efforts. Below we briefly describe those donor and NGO activities that are directly supportive of biodiversity conservation, and highlight some of the international donor activities that are indirectly contributing to biodiversity conservation through improving environmental management. International Donors Directly, and Indirectly, Supporting Biodiversity Conservation in Kosovo Currently the FAO, working with MAFRD, is the only international donor working in direct support of biodiversity conservation in Kosovo. Through two interrelated activities, the FAO is working to develop both a Forest Inventory and a Forest Sector Development Plan. The Forest Inventory will document the diversity, location, and relative abundance of Kosovo's forest resources. This will be a vital first step in the conservation of these resources-and, by virtue of the habitats they provide-to many of Kosovo's threatened and endangered animal species. Based upon this Forest Inventory, the FAO is also developing a Forest Sector Development Plan to establish a framework for managing forest resources over the short and medium term. Numerous other international donors, including the European Union (EU), the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR), the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), and Germany's GTZ are actively supporting efforts to address pressing environmental problems. These areas of focus include industrial pollution, solid waste, water quality/wastewater management and treatment, and capacity building. Based upon this assessment, it appears that considerable progress is being made in addressing both industrial pollution and solid waste management. However, donor support for activities that target improving water quality, including the development of wastewater management and treatment systems, and building the capacity of both the MESP and municipal governments to effectively support the environmental management process, has been slow to develop. NGOs Directly Supporting Biodiversity and Environmental Management in Kosovo While none of the international conservation NGOs have developed or implemented activities in Kosovo, one regional and a small number of local NGOs have become increasingly involved in promoting conservation. Interest in biodiversity conservation and environmental management continues to grow within the NGO community, however, the basic capacity of these NGOs remains quite low. To enhance the role of NGOs and other civil society organizations in promoting biodiversity conservation and environmental management, considerable capacity-building efforts will need to be focused on these primarily nascent organizations. Recommendations for Linking Improved Biodiversity Conservation and Environmental Management to USAID's Projected Country Strategic Plan (FY 2004-FY 2008) Although the need for assistance in environment, as well as health and education, was discussed during the strategy development review, USAID/Kosovo is not proposing to implement assistance programs in these areas. An expected decrease in USAID/Kosovo's annual budget, coupled with the Mission's comparative programming advantage, and the leadership roles of European donors, provided the rationale and justification for this decision. This being said, the Mission appears willing to look for ways to address environmental issues, including biodiversity conservation needs, through logical links with their projected future programs. Specific recommendations for linking both biodiversity conservation and improved environmental management, to projected Mission programs are provided in Section 8 of this Assessment Report. A summary of these linkage areas to projected Mission programs is presented below. * Projected SO 1 Program Areas - Economic Policy and Institutions Given the focus of SO 1, there appear to be some good opportunities to improve both biodiversity conservation and environmental management through projected SO 1 programs. As described by Mission staff, among other activities, SO 1 will likely provide organizational development support to ministries to increase their operational efficiencies. Given the relative newness of the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, coupled with its broad mandate, training and capacity building in organizational development could go a long way toward creating an enabling environment that would be increasingly supportive of biodiversity conservation and sound environmental management. Recommendation Provide organizational development training and capacity building to MESP to improve communication and collaboration, and to improve operational efficiencies. * Projected SO 2 Programming Areas - Private Sector Development Some of the economic activities that may be focal areas of SO 2 have the potential to negatively or positively impact upon biodiversity conservation and environmental management in Kosovo. Ensuring sustainability in the management and use of the natural resource base will be critical steps in improving biodiversity conservation and environmental management. The potential exists to design and implement activities linked to the agriculture and forestry sectors, positively impacting on biodiversity conservation and environmental management. Recommendations 3/4 In promoting secondary wood processing industries, incorporate principles of sustainable forest management written into the new Forests Law into activities to simultaneously ensure the supply of wood and promote sound environmental management and biodiversity conservation. 3/4 Assist growth of the valued-added wood products industry. 3/4 In promoting specialty food products, especially those gathered in the wild (e.g., mushrooms, wild blueberries, etc.), incorporate principles of sustainable use to ensure the long-term economic potential of the resource base. Specifically, develop resource-specific management plans negotiated with government and resource-user support, that provide the framework for use (seasonality, harvest limits, etc.) in exchange for assistance with developing market linkages. 3/4 Assist with the marketing of certified organic agricultural products, a growing market in western Europe. 3/4 Discourage the use of agro-chemicals banned in western Europe, to maintain the potential exportability of agricultural products to western European markets. 3/4 Given the strong potential for SO 2 activities to negatively impact on the environment, and pending the result of the SO-level IEE, it may be advisable for the Mission to conduct a programmatic environmental assessment (PEA) of this program area. A PEA differs from an environmental assessment (EA), in that a PEA covers multiple projects of a similar nature at multiple sites within a region or country, whereas an EA covers a specific project or activity at a specific site. This effort would increase the sustainability of SO 2 investments, while promoting sustainable economic growth. * Projected SO 3 Programming Areas - Democratic Institutions Within the scope of the proposed SO 3, there appears to be one very important area where improved biodiversity conservation and environmental management could be linked to projected SO 3 focal areas: legal reform. As understood by the Biodiversity Assessment Team, the evolving legislative development process has generally proceeded rather slowly. One notable exception, however, has been the Environmental Protection Law (described in Section 4), which passed on January 16, 2003 and was signed into law exactly four months later. While this is certainly encouraging, it is worth noting that the legal structure to support biodiversity conservation and environmental management is still far from complete. Passing with more than 80 Amendments, the law will need to be carefully analyzed and revised in the near future if it is going to effectively serve as the guiding tool for environmental protection and conservation. Potential Recommendations Given the importance of the macro-level legal framework in promoting both biodiversity conservation and sound environmental management, coupled with the lack of other donor support in this arena, it is recommended that USAID provide assistance to review, and as necessary, revise and elaborate the Environmental Protection Law. * Projected SO 4 Programming Areas - Local Governance and Civil Society Participation Within the scope of the proposed SO 4, there are numerous areas where improved biodiversity conservation and environmental management could logically be linked to proposed programs. As noted in the February 2003 Strategic Plan Concept Paper, Kosovo's 30 municipalities are more in the nature of counties than cities or towns, each being comprised of more than one urban settlement and greater or lesser amounts of rural and agricultural areas.2 These urban and rural areas are where people live and work. It is at this level where the management decisions of government, the private sector, and individual citizens have the greatest direct impact on the environment. As a result, this is logically the level where the most can be done to stem the tide of poor environmental management. Recommendations 3/4 Build the capacities of municipalities to fulfill their mandate vis-a-vis spatial planning, as discussed in the local government assessment, which include considerable focus on environmental protection. Spatial planning, in the Kosovo context, provides the basis for both zoning and environmental screening, and quickly developing this capacity could make considerable gains in rationalizing municipal development. 3/4 Build awareness of and capacity for environmental screening, including environmental impact assessments (EIAs), at the municipal level. 3/4 Promote the capacity of civil society organizations, including NGOs (such as REC and Aquila, discussed in Section 6) and the private sector, to participate and serve as effective partners in the environmental management process. In this effort, NGOs should be supported in their efforts to advocate for improved environmental management, and the private sector should be supported in efforts to improve their environmental management (including decreasing wastes, waste management, and increasing operational efficiencies).		ard@ardinc.com			USAID	Kosovo	Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology			Conservation; Ecology; Land zones; Eurasia; Europe	Animalia [Conservation measures /  / Biodiversity conservation needs & recommendations] [Ecology /  / Biodiversity status & threats; assessment & conservation recommendations] [Serbia and Montenegro / Kosovo / ].

Riffell, Samuel K.; Keas, Brian E.; Burton, Thomas M.				Landscape Ecology	18	2		95-111	2003	2003				English	2	27	Landscape context can influence species richness, abundance, or probability of patch-use by birds. Little is known, however, about the effects of landscape context on birds in wetland-dominated landscapes. This lack of knowledge is alarming because many wetlands are threatened by development and other human impacts, while serving critical functions as migratory, breeding and foraging habitat. To address this lack of knowledge, we censused birds in North American Great Lakes coastal wet meadows located along the northern Lake Huron shoreline in Michigan (USA) during 1997 and 1998. Using a suite of multivariate techniques, we first accounted for effects of area and within-patch habitat characteristics before testing for effects of landscape context. Most bird variables were significantly related to landscape context, and two major patterns were apparent. First, avian species richness, abundance, and probability of patch-use by some species were higher for wet meadows located in complex contexts (adjacent to many patch types) compared to simpler contexts (adjacent to only one patch type). Second, these variables were higher for wet meadows located in wetland contexts compared to contexts that were terrestrial and road-impacted, dominated by open water habitats, or dominated by forested wetland habitats. Conservation plans for wetlands have focused on saving large wetlands and creating the vegetative habitat structure required by birds, but they should go further and explicitly consider the landscape context of wetlands as well. Specifically, wetlands located in complex and/or wetland contexts should have a higher conservation value than similar wetlands located in simpler, more terrestrial contexts.

Kestenholz, Matthias				Mitteilungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaften Beider Basel	7			189-198	2003	2003				German	0	0	The bird community of the Wildenstein Nature Reserve (surface 1 km2) in the Jura Mountains (northwestern Switzerland) was studied by a territory mapping of breeding birds in 2001 and by standardized mist-netting in late summer, 1987 to 1989. 49 breeding species were found. The bark-climbing guild of birds is well represented (9 species totalling 34 to 47 territories), including the Middle Spotted Woodpecker (4 to 5 pairs), a vulnerable Red List species. This is due to very old stands of oak trees. The last Tree Pipits breeding in the Jura plateau are found in the meadows on nutrient-poor soils in the nature reserve. In the intensively farmed part of the reserve, however, the bird community is much reduced in species and numbers. Promoting oaks in neighbouring forests, extending grassland farmed at a low intensity, creating wildflower strips and planting thorny shrubs are recommended as measures for the protection of birds.

Buetler, Rita; Schlaepfer, Rodolphe				Nationalpark Berchtesgaden Forschungsbericht	48			13-26	2003	2003				English	1	1	The efficiency of the Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides Tridactylus as a natural agent against spruce bark beetles as a natural agent against spruce bark beetles was compared with the number of Ips typographus beetles captured in pheromone traps commonly used in Swiss forestry. The woodpecker's energy requirements and statistics derived from use of Swiss bark beetle traps served as input data. Our results demonstrate thatone woodpecker destroys more bark beetles than one trap, and the whole Swiss woodpecker population destroys more beetles than all installed traps together. In a second step, we determined the number of standing declining and dead trees, one of the most important habitat features, required by this woodpecker species. A simple model was developed relating the number of potential foraging substrates per unit area to five variables: the woodpecker's potential home range size in endemic bark beetle population levels, the bark area per foraging substrate infested by bark beetles, the breeding density of bark beetles, the woodpecker's foraging efficiency, and the woodpecker's energetic requirements. Althugh the model has to be further developed and validated, we have derived a provisional management recommendation. Based on the preliminary Monte Carlo nulation results, we recommend a snag retention level of at least 14 snags/ha (d.b.h. >= : 21 cm) over 200 ha forest areas, distributed patchily within a forest landscape.

Frank, Georg				Nationalpark Berchtesgaden Forschungsbericht	48			49-55	2003	2003				English	0	0	In 1999 and 2000 a quantitative survey of the White- backed Woodpecker Picoides leucotos as well as documentation of all other woodpecker species was carried out in the NATURA 2000 area "Otscher-Duerrenstein" (Lower Austria). Between 69-72 territories of the White- backed Woodpecker were recorded in 43 study plots covering a total area of 5,094 hectares (an abundance of 1.38 territories/ 100 ha). In adjoining plots that were 233 to 590 ha in size there were between 1.36 and 2.57 territories per 100 hectares. Therefore, in mature mountainous mixed forest White-backed Woodpecker was one of the most common woodpeckers, and in the primeval stands of the "Urwald Rothwald" it was the dominant woodpecker species. The White-backed Woodpecker occurred only in woods dominated by broad-leaved trees with beech accounting for about 68 % of the total trees per stand. Large amounts of dead wood, especially logs in great dimensions (on an average of 38 cm) and snags, seem to be the most important factor in determining what habitats are suitable for the White-backed Woodpecker. Compared with other woodpecker species, the White- backed Woodpecker (as well as the Three-toed Wood- pecker) prefers higher altitudes. Steep inclines and southerly slopes are typical characteristics of its territories. Based on the survey, it is estimated that there are a total of 208 territories in the study area, suggesting that the NATURA 2000 area "Otscher-Durrenstein" is of international importance for the White-backed Woodpecker. Based of this species' distribution and habitat management measurements were proposed.	Frank, Georg; Stieglitzweg 246, 1220 Wien, Austria, Austria.

Styring, Alison R.				Nationalpark Berchtesgaden Forschungsbericht	48			165-171	2003	2003				English	0	0	Woodpeckers, Family Picidae, are considered sensitive to logging and deforestation because they nest in tree cavities and often forage on large trunks or standing dead trees. The diverse woodpecker community found in the lowland rainforests of Peninsular Malaysia was investigated in 5 and 10 year old selectively logged forest and in unlogged forest using census, foraging, and habitat availability data. Relative abundance differed signifi- cantly both between logged and unlogged forest and between logged stands. Although members of this guild did not respond uniformly to logging, woodpeckers were generally less abundant in the 10 year old forest. This trend, supported by an earlier study in 45 year old managed forest, reflects a lack of heterogeneity in man- aged stands with relatively few snags and treefall gaps. Important foraging substrates were identified, and, combined with substrate availability data, were effective in predicting changes in abundance of individual spe- cies across forest types. The current practice of maintaining patches of virgin forest within logging concessions appears to be an effective way of maintaining a diverse community of woodpeckers and other cavity-nesting birds.

Kruszyk, Robert				Notatki Ornitologiczne	44	2		75-88	2003	2003				Polish	0	0	In 1994-1996 the Middle Spotted and Great Spotted Woodpeckers abundance on three deciduous wood plots in the Odra valley was assessed. The Middle Spotted Woodpecker density was higher in the plot with a high proportion of old trees and dead branches than in intensively managed plots, both in the breeding season (respectively 0.5 and 0.2-0.3 p/10 ha) and winter (0.9 and 0.3-0.5 inds/10 ha). The Great Spotted Woodpecker breeding population densities were comparable on all study plots in different years (0.6 p/10 ha on average), which indicates that this species is less dependent on old and dead trees. Observations of foraging behaviour indicate that both species preferred oaks, most commonly foraging in the upper canopy and on dead tree sections. Great Spotted Woodpeckers more often selected hornbeams, whereas Middle Spotted Woodpeckers visited more tree species and more frequently foraged on thick branches and the trunk. The main foraging method of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker was searching while that of the Great Spotted Woodpecker - chiselling. The former, less energy-consuming, accounts for the species connection with the oak tree, which has numerous dead branches and bark with deep crevices; the tree is not damaged and birds can forage on the same branch for several times. The pecking method, applied more commonly by the Great Spotted Wood-pecker, although involving higher consumption of energy, allows to use a wider spectrum of habitats.

Fayt, Philippe				Ornis Fennica	80	4		182-192	2003	2003				English	4	20	The effect of food supply on the Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus breeding density and productivity was investigated by comparing the pattern of annual changes in prey abundance in habitats with declining vs. stable woodpecker populations. In a burnt area of eastern Finland, where the woodpecker breeding population has been continuously diminishing, following a major increase the first year after fire, only the abundance of spruce bark beetles (Col., Scolytidae) (the woodpecker autumn-spring main insect prey) decreased through the years. Conversely, the abundance of longhorn beetles (Col., Cerambycidae) (the nestling main food supply) increased dramatically. On the other hand, in neighbouring old-growth patches where one pair was breeding annually, abundance of spruce bark and longhorn beetles did not change significantly between years, although the abundance level of the bark beetles differed among patches. Hence, my results suggest the woodpecker breeding population to be limited by food supply available outside the breeding season, as shown for other forest bird species. The finding, however, that woodpeckers breeding 6-7 years after the fire reared larger broods than earlier pairs, while brood size did not change annually under old-growth conditions, suggests longhorn beetle availability to be critical to reproductive success.

Stoate, C.; Araujo, M.; Borralho, R.				Ornis Hungarica	12-13	1-2		33-40	2003	2003				English	0	6	Across much of Europe, farmland birds have declined more than those in other habitats; many of the most threatened birds are dependent on extensive farming systems. This paper describes two case studies in which bird abundance was monitored in relation to spatial and temporal differences in agricultural management, one in southern Portugal, the other in central England. In Portugal, bird abundance and species diversity were monitored in 1995 using transects in relation to three agricultural systems. Bird abundance and species diversity were both low in simple intensively managed farmland, and highest in extensively managed farmland incorporating agroforestry systems (Montado). However, species of greatest national and European conservation concern were most abundant in simple, open, extensively managed landscapes. These extensive systems are therefore important for species diversity at national and European scales. In England, a conventionally managed farming system was adapted to encourage game-birds for shooting, and bird abundance was monitored annually. Transects were conducted within the study area from 1992 to 1998 and additional transects were conducted randomly in the surrounding farmland from 1995 to 1997. Bird abundance increased during the management period and was higher in the study area than in the surrounding area, especially for nationally declining species. However, there was little difference in species diversity across years or sites. Our monitoring demonstrates three important points: 1- Extensive farming systems play an important role in maintaining species diversity at national and European scales, even where abundance and diversity are low at the farm scale. 2- Abundance of nationally declining bird species can be restored rapidly, following population declines, if appropriate management systems are adopted. 3- Bird conservation can be accommodated within multi-functional land-use systems, including agricultural systems incorporating game management.

Buehlmann, Jost; Mueller, Werner; Passinelli, Gilberto; Weggler, Martin				Ornithologische Beobachter	100	4		343-355	Jahrgang 2003	2003				German	0	0	The population of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos medius was surveyed in 2002 for the third time after 1978 and 1988. In total, 106 (pairs) were found in 27 of the 69 potentially suitable oak wood areas. Population size was 22 % lower than in 1978 (148 (pairs)). Heavy losses occurred in three of the four (large) woodland areas. The local range decreased to about half the size of 1978. Our observations partly confirm the predictions of Muller (1982) that extinction probability of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker is linked to the degree of isolation of a suitable woodland plot. The loss of old oak trees in the last 24 years is likely to have led to a deterioration of many Middle Spotted Woodpecker habitats within the study area, although quantitative data on changes of factors influencing population size (density of old oaks, potential cavity trees and exact size of oak forests) are lacking. Shade-tolerant tree species growing up into the oak crowns and oak wood areas destroyed by gales are further problems. Broad-scale strategies to enhance habitat suitability for Middle Spotted Woodpeckers are urgently needed for the four core populations. We suggest a moratorium for harvesting oaks, until oak regeneration areas of at least 10 ha in size have reached an age suitable for colonization by Middle Spotted Woodpeckers. Such regeneration areas should be situated adjacent to existing old oak woods.

Metsakanalintukannat Suomessa ja Venajan Karjalassa.	Helle, Pekka; Belkin, Vladimir; Bljudnik, Leo; Danilov, Pjotr I.; Jakimov, Andrei				Suomen Riista	49			32-43	2003	2003				Finnish	0	3	Finland and its eastern neighbour, the Republic of Karelia (in Russia), belong to the same biogeographical entity and provide an excellent setting for many studies of landscape ecology. During the last half-century there has been a 'natural experiment' going on: forestry in Finland has been very intensive, whereas in Karelia forestry has had a minor impact on stand structure and forest landscape structure. Forest grouse are potentially good indicators of forest landscape structure and diversity, and the species are adapted to different stages of forest succession. There have been nationwide, annual monitoring counts of grouse in both areas for about 40 years. This is partly because grouse (capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, black grouse Tetrao tetrix, hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia and willow grouse Lagopus lagopus) have been traditionally hunted intensively and therefore it has been important to be aware of the population status of these species. The decrease in grouse populations during recent decades in Finland has been well documented, and abundant evidence suggests that among the main factors behind this population decline have been the direct and indirect effects of increased timber production. Since the impact of forestry has been much stronger in Finland than in Karelia, we predict that if there are differences in long-term population trends of grouse between these countries, the grouse would fare better in Karelia. The study area covers most parts of Finland and the Republic of Karelia. Both have been divided into subareas (Fig. 1) to assess the geographical patterns in long-term population trends. Nationwide line transect counts of grouse were begun in Finland in 1964. Counts are performed by a three-man chain: the person in the middle walks along the line and the other two walk at distances of 20 m from him; the width of the census belt is consequently 60 m. Densities (inds. per km2 forest land) are calculated directly by multiplying the number of birds observed by the area covered. The mean yearly amount of transects in 1964-88 was between 20,000-30,000 km. These grouse counts in 1964-1988 (so-called route censuses) were performed in the most favourable brood habitats of grouse and the transects were not necessarily the same in consecutive years. In 1989, a new monitoring programme, the so-called wildlife triangle scheme, was launched. The counting method with a three-person chain remained the same, but an important objective was a more random location of transects. The transects are triangular-shaped lines with 4-km side, the total length of the perimeter is 12 km. They are also permanently marked in the field. The amount of data is smaller than in brood counts (about 10,000 km per year), but the data are more useful, since all observations are located on the map. Monitoring of grouse populations in Karelia started in 1964 as a part of Russian game animal monitoring scheme (winter route counting). The monitoring is performed in January-March and it also includes counting of mammalian tracks. Transect line is more or less straight, usually 10 km in length. All grouse observations are recorded, irrespective of their distance from the transect line. For this reason, only estimates of relative abundance are obtained - observed number of individuals per 10 km. Finland began wintertime monitoring in 1989 as a part of the wildlife triangle scheme. It is a recommendation in both countries that the transects should be placed as randomly as possible to cover all main forested habitat types each area. This requirement has probably not been fully met, but when the data are used to detect temporal changes it is not a problem. Winter count data are available from 1964 to 1967 and 1984 to 2002 in Karelia and from 1989-2002 from Finland. The amount of data per year has been about 10,000-15,000 km each year in both countries. The capercaillie has shown a declining population trend in both countries and in all subareas in 1964-2002 (Fig. 2, Table 1). The data from Karelia suggest that the decline in capercaillie has occurred later than in Finland, i.e. during the 1990s. The black grouse has decreased significantly in numbers in southern and central Finland and in the whole of Karelia during the study period. In northern Finland, however, black grouse populations have tended to increase (Table 1). Hazel grouse shows a pattern similar to that of black grouse. The density of hazel grouse has decreased significantly throughout Karelia and in southern and central Finland (Table 1, Fig. 3). In northern Finland, however, the species has increased in numbers during the study period. The population change in willow grouse in 1964-2002 differs slightly from that of the other species. In Karelia, there has been a significant decrease in all subareas, while in Finland the same holds in central parts of the country (Table 1, Fig. 3). The relative densities of grouse in Finland and Karelia can he compared during 1989-2002, when the method used was the same (winter count). During this period, there was no difference in the relative densities of capercaillie between Finland and Karelia. Black grouse in the north and willow grouse are more numerous in Finland than in Karelia, but for hazel grouse the situation is reversed (Table 2). Grouse populations have considerably declined in both countries during the past four decades. There are unfortunately no data available for the whole period in Karelia, but evidence for the conclusion is strong. The other three species appear to have declined in Karelia steadily through the study period, whereas the decline in capercaillie is a recent phenomenon. Recently, further local declines in grouse populations in Karelia have been reported. In Finland, grouse densities dropped markedly from the early 1960s to the 1980s, but no further decreases occurred during the 1990s. A variety of reasons have been suggested for the population declines of grouse in Finland. For the most part the change is explainable by changes occurring in both forest quality and quantity and forest landscape structure, either in a direct (loss and deterioration of suitable habitats or their spatial fragmentation) or indirect fashion (regeneration of forests have created favourable environments for predators feeding on grouse nests and broods). The 'forestry hypothesis' capable of explaining recent changes in Finnish grouse populations does not appear to be valid for Karelia. Forests in Karelia are in as much a natural condition as those in Finland. They still consist of large patchy mosaics of mature and young stands, whereas in Finland the landscape is highly fragmented and composed of very small patches. The proportion of mature and old stands is also much higher in Karelia. The difference in proportion of deciduous stands and burned areas and also in the amount of dead trees is considerably in favour of Karelia. Furthermore, Karelian forests are thicker than those in Finland, since they are seldom thinned, compared with thinning 1-3 times during silvicultural rotation in Finland. The structure of the field layer is fairly similar in Finland and Karelia. Bird species requiring old forests are generally more abundant in Karelia than in Finland, but there are no major differences in population densities of forest generalist species. Grouse are possibly not so tightly associated with mature or old stands that the landscape structure on the Karelian side would be more suitable. What would then be behind the population decline of grouse in Karelia if changes in forest structure are not the key? One possibility is hunting, but reliable hag statistics are unfortunately not available. Population changes outside our study could also be involved, but no data are available to test this hypothesis. The present differences in densities of grouse species between Finland and Karelia, however, appear to reflect differences in forest structure. Species adapted to younger stages of succession (black grouse and willow grouse) are more numerous in Finland than Karelia, whereas the opposite holds for hazel grouse which prefer thick and mixed stands.

Weiss, Steffen				Vogelwelt	124	4		177-192	2003	2003				German	0	0	In a contiguous alder forest tract of 1,000 ha in the 'Oberspreewald' (Spreewald Biosphere Reserve) in Brandenburg, NE Germany, a survey of Middle Spotted Woodpecker was carried out by use of a tape lure. A total of 42 territories was mapped, 39 of which could be assigned to pairs, the remaining 3 to single territorial males. On the level of the whole forest tract, the territory centres of the pairs were overlaid with a detailed terrestrial habitat map by means of a geographical information system (GIS). The results show that areas without trees of more than 21 cm breast height diameter (BHD) were avoided by the woodpeckers. Forest tracts with standing dead trees (snags) of more than 35 cm BHD were clearly preferred. With the exception of only two territories, all territories and the 5 nesting cavities found were located in stands with strong-dimensioned dead wood. In at least 14 territories oaks were completely absent. No preference for oaks, which occur scarcely in the alder forests, could be observed. On the level of territories, the home range of a breeding pair in the period when they were feeding young was investigated by use of radio transmitters. The results allow a verification of the GIS habitat analysis. The radio tagging results were complemented by observation of the breeding cavity, where 4 young fledged. The home range of the male comprised 9.4 ha, the home range of the female 5.6 ha. Alder trees thicker than 22-25 cm BHD were preferred for foraging. In addition, the occurrence of some very thick trees and standing dead wood are of particular importance not only for foraging but also the construction of the nesting cavity.

Scherzinger, Wolfgang				Vogelwelt	124	5-6		213-221	2003	2003			Separate unpaginated plates.	German	0	0	The European landscape was primarily characterised by large forests. Thus, forest-dwelling owls are part of the primary fauna - a strong argument for their protection. But habitat preferences of 13 native owl species follow a broadly differentiated gradient, from tight association with forest structures to optional occurrence in the forest, or even to avoidance of woodland habitats. Pygmy, Tengmalm's, Ural. Great Grey and Hawk Owls turn out to he the most stenoecious forest species. Depending on strikingly different conditions of climate, stand and productivity of regional forest associations, the species diversity of European owls shows a gradual decline from north to south, indicating that boreal forests are most attractive to these birds. Habitat quality for owls is determined mainly by structural characteristics of the woodland and by availability of prey. The smallest owl species show the least plasticity, because they depend on woodpecker cavities of a certain size for breeding. Large species, in contrast, must also be able to reproduce at suboptimal sites, as large hollows are extremely rare, even in old primary forests. This is reflected in special adaptations by nestlings, like quality of mesoptylic-feathers. and in patterns of locomotion and anti-predator behaviour as well. Comparing the availability of forest habitats and habitat needs of forest-dwelling owls, the conclusion is that not all successional stages of woodland development offer suitable habitat. not even under natural conditions. But in contrast to dense and homogenous pole stands of young forests, old growth forest (rich in holes and nest sites. pronounced patchiness) is markedly preferred. Owls evolved as primary forest species and function as top predators, they are thus important indicator species for forest conservation. Habitat elements and structural characters required by owls must therefore be integrated in forestry management practices.

Abbott, Ian; Mellican, Amanda; Craig, Michael D.; Williams, Matthew; Liddelow, Graeme; Wheeler, Ian				Wildlife Research	30	4		321-329	2003	2003				English	1	10	In 1985 new silvicultural prescriptions for managing jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in south-west Western Australia came into operation. The most extreme logging treatment (gap release) involved removal of most of the overstorey from patches no larger than 10 ha, followed by a regeneration fire. In the other logging treatment (shelterwood), less wood was removed from a larger area, also followed by a fire. This study examined the impact of these disturbances on the avifauna by monitoring species richness and abundance of birds one year before logging, one year before burning, and for five years after burning. Although 68 bird species were recorded during the seven years of the study, 29 of these were detected fewer than 15 times. Of the other 39 bird species recorded, only two (Gerygone fusca and Acanthiza apicalis) showed a statistically significant treatment effect over time on their abundance. The abundance of G. fusca initially declined in the disturbed treatments and by Year 7 of the study (5 years post-fire) in the gap-release treatment had not recovered its original abundance. A. apicalis increased its abundance in both shelterwood and gap-release treatments. By Year 7, both species in the logged treatments had abundances similar to those in the unlogged treatments. Total abundance of all species varied little across treatments. Species richness was highest by Year 7 in the shelterwood and lowest in the gap-release treatment. In some years community structure varied more at the external-reference sites (not recently logged or burnt) than at the gap-release sites. In particular, there was little overlap in community structure in the external-reference treatment between the first and final years, whereas the pre-logging and final year in the gap-release treatment showed a high degree of overlap. These differences are suggestive of overriding short-term annual variation in broad-scale factors rather than local factors. Yearly variation in rainfall and temperature was documented; during low rainfall periods, populations of foliage arthropods may have been reduced.

The number of daily foraging observations was used as an index of bird abundance. The daily mean number of foraging observations for Parus major, P. caeruleus, P. palustris, Sitta europea, Certhia familiaris and Dendrocopos major was significantly higher in natural old-growth vs managed forest (ratio 4.8 : 1 for all six species pooled and 3.1 : 1, 3.2 : 1, 4.7 : 1, 5.7 : 1, 7.4 : 1 and 4.7 : 1 for the above-mentioned species, respectively). As the larger dominant species has an advantage in competition for nest holes, we would expect these to exhibit the smallest abundance ratio skews. This was not, however, the case and consequently, the results of this study do not support the hypothesis that a lack of nest holes should be the primary limiting factor for hole nesting species in managed forests. It was found that the species showing the strongest preference for foraging on dead wood were the same that had the most pronounced density skew between forest types. This could indicate that the lack of food resulting from silvicultural practice could be very important as a limiting factor in managed forests. Analyses of the use of dead wood of different diameter and from different tree species indicate that forest birds exploit diverse types of dead wood. Partially decayed standing dead wood was the most important substrate for the majority of species.

Eva				Hornero	17	2		71-83	Decembre 2002	2002				Spanish	0	0	We analyzed seasonal changes in species richness, composition, abundance and habitat use of birds in wetlands and terrestrial environments from the Carilauquen marsh system. We identified five important habitats for birds: marsh, coast of the lagoon, coastal salt-land, pichanal and shrubland. During the study we recorded 100 bird species that showed a heterogeneous distribution on the environmental mosaic; each habitat contributed with exclusive species to the overall species pool. The Carilauquen marsh system showed low between-habitat similarity; most of the bird species used only one or two habitats. Bird abundance and species richness were higher during spring and summer, likely due to the nest season of most of the species. Several endemic species of arid lands from Argentina nested in the terrestrial environments of Carilauquen. We analyzed the conservation value of the five habitats considering habitat preferences, distribution and taxonomic exclusivity of each bird-species assemblage. The conservation of the marsh guarantees the maintenance of high bird diversity, because this habitat harbours many species with restricted ranges and with narrow habitat preferences. The shrubland, in despite of its lower species richness in comparison to wetlands, is a habitat of special interest for bird conservation due to the species composition of the assemblage. An effective conservation strategy has to consider the complementarity of both habitats for the conservation of the regional avifauna.

Date, E.M.; Ford, H.A.; Recher, H.F.				Pacific Conservation Biology	8	3		177-195	December 2002	2002				English	0	3	We investigated the composition and distribution of bird assemblages in the continuous Pilliga woodlands of northwest New South Wales in relation to floristic''assemblages and disturbance (logging, fire and grazing) patterns. Box- ironbark woodlands contained high densities of White Cypress Pine Callitris glaucophylla and Narrow-leaved Ironbark Eucalyptus crebra, had a sparse, depauperate understorey, and were associated with frequent, intense logging and infrequent fires (due to fire exclusion and the use of grazing for fuel reduction). Box-ironbark woodlands were characterized by high frequencies of 12 bird species that occurred throughout the Pilliga and low frequencies of many other species. Blakely's Red Gum E. blakelyi woodlands typical of creeks and Broad-leaved Ironbark E. fibrosa woodlands typical of poor soils contained lower densities or smaller trees of C. glaucophylla and E. crebra, had a moderately dense, diverse understorey, and were associated with infrequent low-intensity logging and moderately frequent wildfire. Bird species assemblages of Broad-leaved Ironbark woodlands were similar to those of box-ironbark woodlands. Blakely's Red Gum woodlands were characterized by 36 bird species that were virtually absent from box-ironbark and Broad- leaved Ironbark woodlands, including 10 threatened and declining species. The 10 are among 48 woodland species that are known or thought to be declining and that are dependent on woodlands with mature trees and grassy or patchy grass/shrub understorey. We conclude that these species have declined in the Pilliga and will continue to decline under existing disturbance regimes, particularly in box-ironbark woodlands. We suggest adaptive management strategies for maintaining and rehabilitating their habitats.	Date, E.M.; P.O.

Randy; Henne-Kerr, Jackie L.; Grosshuesch, David A.				Restoration Ecology	10	4		645-655	December 2002	2002				English	0	17	Bottomland hardwood forests were planted on agricultural fields in Mississippi and Louisiana predominantly using either Quercus species (oaks) or Populus deltoides (eastern cottonwood). We assessed avian colonization of these reforested sites between 2 and 10 years after planting. Rapid vertical growth of cottonwoods (circa 2-3 m/year) resulted in sites with forest structure that supported greater species richness of breeding birds, increased Shannon diversity indices, and supported greater territory densities than on sites planted with slower-growing oak species. Grassland birds (Spiza americana [Dickcissel] and Sturnella magna [Eastern Meadowlark]) were indicative of species breeding on oak-dominated reforestation no more than 10 years old. Agelaius phoeniceus (Red-winged Blackbird) and Colinus virginianus (Northern Bobwhite) characterized cottonwood reforestation no more than 4 years old, whereas 14 species of shrub-scrub birds (e.g., Passerina cyanea [Indigo Bunting]) and early-successional forest birds (e.g., Vireo gilvus [Warbling vireo]) typified cottonwood reforestation 5 to 9 years after planting. Rates of daily nest survival did not differ between reforestation strategies. Nest parasitism increased markedly in older cottonwood stands but was overwhelmed by predation as a cause of nest failure. Based on Partners in Flight prioritization scores and territory densities, the value of cottonwood reforestation for avian conservation was significantly greater than that of oak reforestation during their first 10 years. Because of benefits conferred on breeding birds, we recommend reforestation of bottomland hardwoods should include a high proportion of fast-growing early successional species such as cottonwood.

Amarasinghe, Upali S.; Welcomme, Robin L.				Environmental Biology of Fishes	65	3		327-339	November 2002	2002				English	1	31	There is a growing recognition of the need to conserve biodiversity that has been conceptualised in the Convention of Biological Diversity. Maintenance of fish species richness is particularly important, because habitat degradation in inland waters continues to accelerate on a global scale. Here we develop empirical models for predicting fish species richness in natural lakes in various geographical regions of the world. In tropical lakes where fish biodiversity is richer than in temperate lakes, fish species richness can be predicted by a few variables such as lake area and altitude. Low fish species richness in most temperate lakes might be due to the effect of glaciation on colonisation and speciation of fishes. In US, Canadian and northern European lakes, lake acidification is one of the important factors influencing fish species richness. Although limnological characteristics influence fish species richness in temperate lakes, lake area and altitude have greater predictive power. This is in contrast to fish species richness in rivers, which can be reliably predicted by basin area. In the power curves, which describe the relationship between fish species richness and habitat size in lakes and rivers, the exponent is always greater in tropical regions than in temperate regions. Because fish biodiversity is greater in the tropics threats to fish biodiversity through habitat degradation are greater than those in temperate inland waters.

Sekercioglu, Cagan H.				Biological Conservation	107	2		229-240	October 2002	2002				English	1	37	I examined the lingering effects of past timber management practices on the vegetation structure and bird community of Kibale National Park, Uganda. I compared four forest treatments: unlogged native forest (UL), two that were selectively logged at low (LL) and high (HL) intensities in the 1960s, and a conifer plantation (PL). Forest-dependent birds were best represented at UL. LL was similar to UL in both vegetation structure and bird community composition, although some forest-dependent bird species were missing from the former. HL had significantly less canopy closure and lower tree density than other plots as a result of the combination of extensive secondary damage and natural disturbance patterns that prevented the reclosure of the forest canopy. Thirty-one percent of the forest-dependent bird species observed during the study were not detected at HL. At PL, bird species richness and bird abundance were about a third of those observed in other plots. There were significant correlations between heterogeneity of tree distribution (horizontal heterogeneity) and abundance and species richness of birds across plots. Abundance and species richness of all, forest-dependent, and forest generalist birds were highest in plots with intermediate measures of horizontal heterogeneity, which were mostly unlogged or lightly logged. If reduced-impact logging practices are not implemented during selective logging operations in tropical forests, consequent long-term changes in vegetation structure may result in significant declines in the populations of some forest-dependent species, as was observed in Kibale National Park.

Biological Conservation	107	3		273-281	October 2002	2002				English	0	7	Altough peatlands in southern Quebec are facing increasing pressure, neither specific nor substantial protection measures have been implemented, partly due to a lack of information on this ecosystem. We determined the contribution of peatlands to bird regional diversity by measuring the difference between peatland and associated regional avifaunas. We sampled 112 peatlands located along the Saint Lawrence River during one breeding season. We used data on regional nesting bird assemblages from the Quebec breeding bird atlas. Peatland bird species contrasted increasingly with regional avifauna from north to south or from undisturbed to managed landscapes. Of the 17 bird species found significantly more often in peatlands than in surroundings, some preferred peatlands in the whole study area and others preferred peatlands only in particular regions. Peatland avifaunas within regions were more similar to each other than to their regional avifauna, and differences between regions probably reflected changes in peatland physiognomy. We conclude that peatlands contribute to enrich local and regional avian diversity, particularly in the lowlands of the Saint Lawrence River, where industrial pressure on peatlands is highest.

Poulin, B.; Lefebvre, G.; Mauchamp, A.				Biological Conservation	107	3		315-325	October 2002	2002				English	2	45	Reedbeds have high conservation value in Europe. In southern France, they are the major breeding habitat of five passerine species. Yet, habitat management is done primarily by water control to serve socio-economic rather than conservation interests, because we lack information on the species' ecological requirements. Determinants of passerine abundance were assessed through a comparative analysis of water regime, plant structure, and arthropod (food) distribution at 12 sites consisting of at least 10 ha of marsh densely covered with common reed (Phragmites australis). Overall bird abundance estimated through standardised mist netting was positively correlated with food availability (sweep-netted arthropods weighted by their occurrence in birds' diet), which was in turn negatively correlated with duration of ground dryness between June and December. Abundance of four of the five bird species was associated with specific vegetation parameters (reed diameter, dry reed density, growing reed height, etc.), which could be associated with particular management practices, especially with regard to water levels and salinity. Potential impact of socioeconomic activities through their water management is addressed, as well as possible ways to minimise these impacts.

Smyth, Anita; Mac Nally, Ralph; Lamb, David				Environmental Management	30	4		547-559	October 2002	2002				English	0	6	We examined the impact of single-tree selective logging and fuel reduction burns on the abundance of hollow-nesting bird species at a regional scale in southeastern Queensland, Australia. Data were collected on species abundance and habitat structure of dry sclerophyll production forest at 36 sites with known logging and fire histories. Sixteen bird species were recorded with most being resident, territorial, obligate hollow nesters that used hollows that were either small ([<]10 cm diameter) or very large ([>]18 cm diameter). Species densities were typically low, but combinations of two forest management and three habitat structural variables influenced the abundances of eight bird species in different and sometimes conflicting ways. The results suggest that habitat tree management for biodiversity in production forests cannot depend upon habitat structural characteristics alone. Management histories appear to have independent influence (on some bird species) that are distinguishable from their impacts on habitat structure per se. Rather than managing to maximize species abundances to maintain biodiversity, we may be better off managing to avoid extinctions of populations by identifying thresholds of acceptable fluctuations in populations of not only hollow-nesting birds but other forest dependent wildlife relative to scientifically valid forest management and habitat structural surrogates.

Calladine, John; Baines, David; Warren, Philip				Journal of Applied Ecology	39	5		772-780	October 2002	2002				English	2	30	1. The maintenance or modification of grazing regimes is frequently advocated to deliver conservation targets in pastoral landscapes, but there are few quantitative studies of the effects of grazing on upland birds. This is particularly true with respect to grazing management in agri-environmental schemes. 2. Numbers of black grouse Tetrao tetrix and their breeding success were therefore monitored at 20 sites in the north of England from 1996 to 2000. Ten treatment sites included areas where grazing was reduced before and during the study to [<]1.1 sheep ha-1 in summer and [<]0.5 sheep ha-1 in winter. Each was paired with a reference site that held sheep at two (summer) to three times (winter) the density on the experimental sites. The reduced grazing sites ranged from 0.4 to 3.2 km2 in size and most were part of existing agreements within agri-environment schemes that had been in place for 1-5 years before 1996. 3. Numbers of black grouse males displaying increased by an average of 4.6% (SE = 2.1) year-1 at the 10 sites with reduced grazing. Displaying male trends differed significantly between treatment and normally grazed reference sites, where numbers declined annually on average by 1.7% (SE = 1.4). 4. Summer black grouse hen densities showed the greatest rate of increase where grazing was restricted on smaller areas of ground (0.4 km2). Declines occurred at sites where the area of restricted grazing exceeded about 1 km2. The rates of change in population density, as indicated by numbers of displaying males, peaked in the early years of grazing reduction and then declined after c. 5-7 years. 5. The proportion of females that retained broods during the late chick-rearing period was 54% (SE = 0.06) at sites with reduced grazing, significantly greater than the 32% (SE = 0.06) at normally grazed reference sites. There was no difference in the size of broods between grazing treatments. 6. This study demonstrates that agri-environment schemes, which encourage extensive management of grazing land, can benefit at least some organisms of conservation importance and lead to some recovery of populations. There is a need, however, for further understanding of how such benefits can be maintained at a landscape scale and over the greater time scales involved in vegetation dynamics and bird population processes.

Fletcher, Robert J., Jr; Koford, Rolf R.				Journal of Wildlife Management	66	4		1011-1022	October 2002	2002				English	2	73	In the midwestern United States, less than 1% of the original tallgrass prairie ecosystem remains. State and federal agencies have responded to this habitat loss with programs and land acquisition that have increased the amount of grassland on the landscape by restoring grassland from other land-use practices. We assessed the effects of habitat restoration and the relative contribution of local habitat and landscape factors on breeding grassland birds in northern Iowa. During the 1999 and 2000 breeding seasons, we surveyed grassland birds in 10 tallgrass prairies and 10 restored grasslands that contained a wide diversity of habitat and landscape conditions. Densities of common bird species were similar between habitat types, except for grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), which were 4 and 9 times more dense in restored grasslands, respectively. Species richness of breeding birds was similar between habitat types. Habitat structure was different in prairies and restored grasslands; restored grasslands had 7% less total vegetation cover and 3% more bare ground. A nested, multiscale analysis indicated that habitat structure explained some variation in species richness and bird density of all common species, yet addition of landscape structure improved models for species richness and for density of 4 of 8 species considered, explaining an additional 10-29% of the variation. Edge-density metrics were the most common variables entering into landscape models; most species had lower densities in landscapes with high edge density. Our results indicate that restored grassland habitats contain bird communities generally similar to those in native prairie habitats in northern Iowa, suggesting that restored grasslands may provide similar habitat suitability for most grassland birds. In addition, both local habitat and landscape factors can be important for managing breeding grassland birds.

Journal of Wildlife Management	66	4		1031-1039	October 2002	2002				English	1	11	We compared northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) abundance and habitat characteristics in unmanaged mixed shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)-hardwood stands and restored pine-grassland stands managed for the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) on the Ouachita National Forest, Arkansas, USA. To determine northern bobwhite (hereafter, bobwhite) population response in untreated control, thinned, and thinned and burned stands either 1, 2, or 3 growing seasons (Mar to mid-Oct) post-burn, we used whistling-male counts and covey-call counts as indices of population abundance. We estimated woody stem density, understory and overstory canopy cover, conifer and hardwood basal area, and the disc of vulnerability to characterize habitat response. Relative abundance of whistling males in the spring was greatest in thinned stands 3 growing seasons post-burn and in thinned but unburned stands. These stands had the smallest disc of vulnerability and the greatest understory shrub cover <2 m in height compared with other treatments. A threshold-like increase in bobwhite abundance was observed as a function of woody structure <2 m. Pine-grassland restoration provided suitable structure for bobwhites in spring, summer, and fall, but may not be adequate in winter. Further, data suggested that bobwhite density within a stand also was related to the amount of suitable habitat surrounding the stand. Bobwhite management efforts in similar shortleaf pine forests should include thinning to reduce midstory and overstory cover and frequent fire to maintain open woodland conditions-i.e., low basal area stands with limited midstory.

Poulsen, Bent Otto				Biodiversity and Conservation	11	9		1551-1566	September 2002	2002				English	2	42	Many studies on avian diversity and forest structure have focused on finer scale forest variables such as foliage height diversity, foliage diversity, foliage density, vertical distribution of vegetation and horizontal vegetation density. From a conservation and forestry operational point of view it would be of great interest if tree variables influenced directly by forestry management decisions also had significant influence on avian richness and abundance. The species, age and size of a tree are examples of such tree variables. A great number of studies also have focused on avian diversity indices to reveal relationships with vegetation variables. However, it may be more appropriate for foresters and conservation officers to operate with richness and abundance measures directly, because indices complicate interpretations on the relative importance of the two variables (richness and abundance) constituting the index. Fourteen managed temperate forests in Denmark were investigated for avian species richness and abundance and related to measures on different tree variables influenced directly by forestry management decisions. A rapid assessment method of avian richness and abundance was employed. It consisted of point-counts of bird richness and abundance within 1 km2 of forest. General linear models were tested by analyses of variance statistics to reveal the tree variables most important to avian richness and abundance. It was found that more old trees, more tree species and more tree size-classes correlated with more bird species and individuals. However, some variation in bird richness and abundance was also related to site quality and/or chance colonization. Moreover, it was shown that the guild of cavity-nesting birds correlated positively to age of tree stand. The potential number of bird species in Danish forest is similar to that in nearly pristine forest in Poland, and much larger than that recorded in any of the forests investigated. Together with the results above, this indicates a high potential for squeezing in more avian species in a higher quality forest from a biodiversity point of view. Modern Danish forestry affects tree variables influenced directly by forestry management decisions. Such tree variables have great influence on avian richness and abundance, but simple measures in forestry practices can be taken to enhance the conservation of bird richness and abundance.

Poulin, Brigitte; Lefebvre, Gaetan				Biodiversity and Conservation	11	9		1567-1581	September 2002	2002				English	1	14	Common reed is increasingly harvested from the Mediterranean region to provide thatching material to north European countries. The impact of these management practices on the fauna is poorly known. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of reed cutting in the Mediterranean region through a comparative analysis of water regime, vegetation structure, arthropod distribution and passerine assemblage at cut and uncut reedbeds in southern France. Cut reedbeds were characterised by a lower salinity, higher water level in spring, and higher reed biomass than uncut reedbeds. Arthropod distribution differed consistently between cut and uncut sites, leading to a higher index of food available to passerines in cut reedbeds. Cut reedbeds had a similar bird species richness but a lower bird abundance, due to the significant decrease in Moustached Warblers and Bearded Tits at cut sites. The mild Mediterranean winter favoured early growth of reed in spring, making harvested reedbeds suitable for breeding of long-distance migrants such as the Great Reed Warbler and Reed Warbler. However, for the resident species that breed earlier in the season, cut reedbeds presumably lack sufficient vegetation cover to provide adequate nesting and feeding sites. Although biennial cutting (double wale) is considered as a good compromise between conservation and commercial interests in the UK, the juxtaposition of annually cut and never cut reed patches appears as the only sustainable alternative for the Mediterranean region. We further hypothesise that an optimal mosaic design of cut/uncut reed patches could provide as high a conservation value as unmanaged reedbeds.

Corax	19	1		67-92	September 2002	2002				German	0	0	In the Lundener lowlands a ca. 1.000 ha nature reserve will be created. The intensity of agricultural usage will be reduced and a lake will be restoredby re-flooding. In 1999 a ca. 320 ha area of the almost completely drained Motjen lake was flooded to a level of 30-50 cm. In winter reed is cut onthe lake. Meadows are still used for low intensity grazing. Surveys were carried out in 1997 and 2001 on a total of 1.025 ha in order to comparebreeding, feeding and roosting bird numbers before and after restoration. 79 breeding bird species (including previous observations) and 92non-breeding species were recorded; half of these are wet-meadow species. The breeding population before and after restoration were estimatedfor the total survey area. After restoration wetland birds especially waterbirds returned, settled for the first time in the area or increased in numbers. Declines in breeding numbers after restoration were recorded for the Skylark. The low intensity agricultural usage of the wet meadowsthat led to short vegetation was advantageous to numerous wet-meadow waders. Areas with higher vegetation proved, during the breeding season,to be inadequate as breeding sites. Numerous bird species that use the meadows as feeding habitat (waders, selected passerines and to a lesser extent gulls) avoided the less grazed meadows with higher vegetation and preferred areas with a larger proportion of short permanent pasture. The entire survey area in the Lundener lowlands displays - as do other valley-bog and meadow areas bought by the state of Schleswig-Holstem and developed in a similar fashion - a more species rich breeding fauna than conventionally run agricultural areas in the region. The restoration had apositive effect on the avifauna after only a short time. The low intensity agricultural use of the meadows must be optimised, if the areas favourable for meadow breeding waders and for further species are also to be good feeding habitat.

Schmid, Hans; Pasinelli, Gilberto				Ornithologische Beobachter	99	3		187-204	September 2002	2002				German	0	1	Are breeding bird communities beyond the Swiss border more diverse than those in Switzerland? We tested this hypothesis with data compiled for the second atlas project on the distribution of breeding birds in Switzerland. Based on 243 Swiss an 183 foreign 1 -km squares laying within maximally 15 km on each side of the border at similar altitude, we compared species composition, distribution and density in the 1-km squares for 125 "widespread" species. Overall, we found (1) a smaller average number of bird species, but the same territory density, and (2) fewer species of the Swiss Red List as well as a smaller territory density of Red List species in the Swiss horde squares compared to those abroad. These differences hold for the borderland of western Switzerland an France and northern Switzerland and Germany, respectively. In contrast, no differences at all were found be tween southern Switzerland and Italy, whereas eastern Switzerland differed from Austria only in having higher territory density. Species composition of domestic and foreign 1-km squares, measured with th Sorensen index, were highly similar and ranged from 90.1 to 99.5%. We conclude that the differences note above are not due to basically different types of habitats along the border, but that they rather reflect dissimilarities in land use and management practices of these habitats. This is further corroborated by a compariso of the distribution and abundance of selected habitat specialists, indicating more favourable conditions for species of open and semi-open habitats in German and French than in Swiss border 1-km squares.

Intensive management for pine specialists such as the Red-cockaded Woodpecker may negatively impact both Nearctic-Neotropical and Temperate Zone migrants associated with hardwood vegetation. To evaluate possible positive and negative associations, we surveyed avian communities from 1995-1997 using point counts within managed Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavity tree clusters and mature forest control sites in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and loblolly (P. taeda)-shortleaf (P. echinata) pine habitats. In general, sites managed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers supported more diverse and numerous bird populations than mature forest control sites. During the breeding season in loblolly-shortleaf and longleaf pine habitats, respectively, species richness was 47% and 23% greater, avian abundance was 57% and 65% greater, and bird species diversity was 25% and 21% greater within managed Red-cockaded Woodpecker cluster sites than within control sites. During winter, species richness and avian abundance each were 52% higher within managed Red-cockaded Woodpecker cluster sites than control sites in loblolly-shortleaf pine habitat.

Lambert, F.R.; Collar, N.J.				Forktail	18			127-146	August 2002	2002				English	0	4	The lowland forests of the Sundaic region are disappearing at immense speed, and whatever survives of them will inevitably suffer the effects of internal degradation (from logging in particular) and of fragmentation. A review of the various studies of the impact of logging and fragmentation on the avifaunas of forested sites throughout the region consistently indicates that large areas of logged forest retain the majority of species present prior to logging, but that forest fragments - apparently even relatively large patches with a high proportion of primary forest - lose a significant number of species. Of 274 resident forest bird species confined to the lowlands of the Sundaic region (excluding Palawan), 83 (30% of the avifauna) are adversely affected by fragmentation and 26 (9.5%) negatively affected by logging, with forest-interior sallying insectivores, terrestrial insectivores and woodpeckers being particularly susceptible to both threats. In total, available data suggest that at least 91 and possibly 132+ species, or 33-50% of the lowland forest avifauna, respond negatively to the effects of these processes in some parts of their range. In the Sunda region, however, fragmentation would seem to be a much more serious threat to the survival of certain forest bird species than the selective logging of continuous forest. This conclusion suggests that the area of forest estate set aside for the production of timber is likely to have important (albeit secondary) conservation potential if (but only if) strict management regimes eliminate/ minimise fire, further clearance and penetration by settlers and hunters (and possibly only if contiguous areas of primary lowland forest are left intact).

Machmer, Marlene				U S Forest Service General Technical Report PSW	181			121-133	August 2002	2002				English	0	1	Long-term fire suppression and cessation of aboriginal burning has resulted in forest ingrowth and associated structural and functional changes to dry, fire-maintained forests of southeastern British Columbia. In this experimental study, effects of ecosystem restoration treatments (prescribed fire, partial harvesting, prescribed fire and partial harvesting, and untreated controls) on cavity-nesting birds, their habitat, and their insectivorous prey were investigated. Pre- and post-treatment data on the nesting density of cavity-nesters, the availability of wildlife trees, the foraging intensity of woodpeckers, and the relative abundance and species diversity of insects each breeding season were gathered, beginning in 1996. Preliminary results (1996 to 1998) indicate that harvested treatments were associated with a decline in the nesting density and species richness of cavity nesters over the short term; snag densities decreased in harvested and burned treatments; the number of trees per hectare with fresh woodpecker foraging sign did not differ significantly comparing pre- and post-treatment; and large increases in the relative abundance of selected insect species in some families were apparent in the treated units. Insect response was most pronounced in the burn only treatment, followed by the harvest and burn, and the harvest only treatments. Management implications for future ecosystem restoration efforts are discussed.

Drapeau, Pierre; Nappi, Antoine; Giroux, Jean-Francois; Leduc, Alain; Savard, Jean-Pierre				U S Forest Service General Technical Report PSW	181			193-205	August 2002	2002				English	0	0	In boreal forests, several bird species use standing dead trees for feeding or nesting and depend on them for their survival. Studies on wildlife use of snags have shown that their availability is greatly influenced by the age of the forest and the type of perturbation (natural versus anthropogenic). Accordingly, cavity-nesting birds seem largely affected by these changes in availability of snags. In North American boreal forests, relationships between birds and dead wood availability have predominantly been documented in western forests. The dynamics of dead wood and the distribution patterns of birds associated with this habitat feature remain largely unknown in eastern black spruce forests. Distribution patterns of birds associated with dead wood were documented in the eastern black spruce forest of northwestern Quebec, Canada. Study areas were composed of four forest landscapes (50-100 kmz) that were naturally disturbed by different fire events (1 year, 20 years, 100 years and > 200 years) and two logged landscapes (20 years, 80 years). Birds were surveyed by point counts. Overall, 348 point counts were distributed over the six forest landscapes. Vegetation plots centered at each point count were used to sample live trees and dead wood. In naturally disturbed forest landscapes, species richness and abundance cavity-nesting birds reached a peak in early post-fire and in mature forest landscapes. Standing dead wood availability and abundance patterns of cavity-nesting birds were significantly less in 20-year-old managed forests landscapes than in those of naturally disturbed forests landscapes. This pattern was persistent in mature forests comparisons between 80-year-old horse-logged second-growth forests and mature forests of post-fire origin. Our results suggest that old-growth forests in this portion of the eastern black-spruce forest ecosystem do not play a key role for cavity- nesting birds. Mature and over-mature stands are, however, key habitats for many species of secondary cavity nesters, whereas early post-fire stands are key habitats for primary cavity-nesting birds and represent the main source of recruitment for standing dead wood in this ecosystem. Changes in silvicultural practices designed to maintain specific structure of over-mature stands (increased partial cutting) may provide a means for maintaining cavity-nesting birds at the landscape scale. Intensification of salvage cutting in early post-fire landscapes is another serious concern in black spruce forests. Reduction in the overall availability of dead wood through such forest practice may affect populations of some primary cavity nesters that are restricted to this specific forest type.

PCE birds selected large diameter, broken top snags for feeding and nesting. They selected western larch and Douglas-fir for feeding excavations and ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir for nest cavity snags. Grand fir were also utilized as available on managed plots. Soft snags with advanced wood decay were particularly important for nest sites. Species composition of PCE birds varied significantly in different forest management treatments, with unique species groups associated with unmanaged and heavily managed sites. Total population densities of PCE birds were most closely associated with snag density, particularly large diameter snags (> 25 cm DBH).

Hardwoods are highly preferred as cavity sites, are preferred foraging sites for several bird species, encourage insectivorous mammals and amphibians, and provide preferred substrate for many cryptogams and invertebrates. In the Pacific Northwest, two cavity-nesting species choose hardwoods for 70 percent or more of their nest sites, while many prefer hardwoods, even in coastal forests where hardwoods are scarce. Because many forest-dwelling species in the Pacific Northwest show strong preferences for hardwoods, hardwoods should be retained and managed as desired trees.

Giuliano, William M.; Daves, Sudie E.				Biological Conservation	106	1		1-9	July 2002	2002				English	0	22	Populations of most avian species associated with grasslands have declined in North America over the last few decades. These declines may be related, in part, to changes in species composition and management of pastures and hayfields. The incorporation of native, warm-season grasses into pasture and hayfield management has been suggested as a means of providing suitable habitat for birds in agricultural areas. To examine this, we compared avian abundance, richness, and reproductive success in warm- [i.e. switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii)] and cool-season grass [i.e. orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata)] fields on private farms in southwest Pennsylvania. Point counts, nest monitoring, and vegetation sampling were conducted on nine pairs (warm- and cool-season grass) of fields in 1996, and 12 pairs of fields in 1997. Compared with cool-season grass fields, warm-season grass fields supported a greater abundance and richness of birds, including several declining species [e.g. song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and vesper sparrows (Pooccetes gramineus)]. Additionally, due to lower nest destruction and depredation rates, birds in warm-season grass fields had greater nest success and fledge rates. The positive response of birds to the use of warm-season grasses in pastures and hayfields appears to be due to the increased availability of undisturbed cover. Thus, the establishment of warm-season grasses in pastures and hayfields should be an avian conservation and management priority. Convincing farmers to use warm-season grasses in their fields should not be difficult, as several state and federal programs fund their establishment, and the use of these grasses increases forage production and farm income.

Johnson, Greg A.M.; Freedman, Bill				Canadian Field-Naturalist	116	3		475-487	July-September 2002	2002				English	0	12	We studied the populations of breeding birds in five reference stands of natural mixedwood forest and 11 conifer plantations up to 21-years old in southern New Brunswick, Canada. Variations of the distribution and abundance of birds were related to changes in the plant-species composition and structural attributes of their habitat. Bird species occurred in plantations in levels of abundance and diversity similar to that of reference forest, although community composition was highly dissimilar. Species of reference stands were typical of mature, mixedwood forest. Species of younger plantations were typical of open, early successional, upland habitats. Once the plantations became older than 13 years and the tree height exceeded about 5 m, birds typical of conifer forest began to invade the habitat, resulting in a mixed-species composition. Although cavity-containing snags were rare in the plantations, if they did occur in them or near their edge they were used by hole-nesting birds. Although we could not study a complete rotation, the field data and habitat trajectory suggest that the plantations will not support some elements of the avian biodiversity of the natural forest in the study area. The mature plantations will be highly depauperate in coarse-woody debris, snags, and cavities, and will not support species dependent on these critical habitat elements. In addition, birds requiring habitat containing trees of larger size and of various species, including hardwoods, will not find the mature plantations to be suitable. To accommodate the needs of species potentially at risk from the extensive development of plantations, the following changes in forestry management practices should be instituted: (1) retention of natural cavity-trees, snags, coarse-woody debris, and hardwood trees and shrubs in residual non-harvested "islands" within clear-cuts and plantations; (b) retention of a patchy angiosperm component by leaving some areas untreated during herbicide applications; and (c) setting aside large areas of natural forest as non-harvested protected areas. Although we believe that these mitigations would help sustain elements of indigenous biodiversity that are at risk in an extensive industrial forest, we stress that these predictions would have to be tested through additional research and monitoring.

Collins, Christopher S.; Conner, Richard N.; Saenz, Daniel				Forest Ecology and Management	164	1-3		211-220	1 July 2002	2002				English	0	6	Arthropod density on the boles of loblolly pines (Pinus taeda) was compared between a stand with and stand without hardwood midstory and between a stand of loblolly and shortleaf pines (P. echinata) in the Stephen F. Austin Experimental Forest, Nacogdoches Co., Texas, USA from September 1993 through July 1994. Arthropod density was greatest (t = 5.67, 10 d.f., P [<] 0.001) in an open pine stand nearly devoid of hardwood midstory than in a pine stand with dense hardwood midstory. Loblolly pine had greater (t = 2.34, 10.9 d.f., P = 0.040) arthropod densities than shortleaf pine. Vegetative characteristics within a pine stand rather than bark rugosity appear to be the dominant factor determining arthropod density on the boles of pines. The red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) should benefit from greater abundances of arthropods on the boles of pines particularly during the nesting season. In order to provide prime foraging habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker, land managers should consider the vegetative community structure within foraging habitat.

Imbeau, Louis; Desrochers, Andre				Forest Ecology and Management	164	1-3		249-256	1 July 2002	2002				English	0	22	Given the extensive progression of industrial forestry in boreal regions that reduces the area of old-growth forests and considerably increases the amount of sharp edges, important declines are to be expected among old-forest specialists area-sensitive or edge-avoiding boreal birds. The Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) is likely to be one of the species most negatively affected by boreal forestry and is possibly sensitive to forest area and edges. In this study, we quantify the area sensitivity and edge-avoidance of the Three-toed Woodpecker by analyzing its pattern of occurrence at 100 playback stations that had from 8 to 100% forest cover within a 300 m radius. Behavioral observations were also conducted to further investigate its response to edges in logged forests using foraging locations in relation to the nearest clear-cut border. Moreover, we document their foraging movement patterns in two contrasting landscapes (continuous versus shredded forests after logging). Although the occurrence of Three-toed Woodpeckers was highly related to the area of suitable habitat around the playback station, this relationship was quasi-linear and no critical threshold was found within the range of forest cover sampled. The amount of edge did not provide additional information on woodpecker occurrence. Individual woodpeckers in shredded forests did not select foraging trees further away from clear-cut edges than available ones. However, based on the results of the movement path analysis, continuous forests might provide better nesting habitat than residual, shredded forests. Indeed, spatial configuration of residual forest seemed to highly constrain foraging movements of this species because of its strong avoidance of open areas. Considering other studies conducted on forest birds, such modified movement patterns could be particularly harmful while both adults must feed their nestlings and behave as central place foragers. Therefore, even if no pattern of area-sensitivity or edge-avoidance were found, harmful consequences of forest shredding following forest logging may still occur for boreal species such as the Three-toed Woodpecker. However, residual forests strips are essential to maintain this species within managed areas, its population density within such residual forests being comparable to the one obtained in continuous forests.

McCarty, John P.; Levey, Douglas J.; Greenberg, Cathryn H.; Sargent, Sarah				Forest Ecology and Management	164	1-3		277-291	1 July 2002	2002				English	2	35	We monitored production and removal rates of fruit from 22 common plant species over 2 years in five habitats of a managed landscape in South Carolina (USA). Our long-term goal is to determine the importance of fruit as a resource for vertebrates and to provide recommendations for management of key species and habitats. This study lays the foundation for that goal by documenting fruit production and availability, variation in use by wildlife, and how these factors vary by plant species, habitat, and season. Six species produced [>] 1 kg dry mass of pulp per hectare per year. Vertebrates consumed [gtoreq]50% of fruits in 17 of the 22 plant species. Fruit loss to insects and microbes was generally small and varied significantly among seasons, being lowest in fall and winter. The length of time ripe fruit survived on plants varied among species from 3 to 165 days. Survival time of fruits did not vary significantly among habitats but was significantly shorter in the summer than in fall or winter. Approximately, half the species produced fruit in the fall and winter and these fruits were primarily consumed by over-wintering wildlife. This pattern is inconsistent with the general belief that fruit production in the eastern United States is timed to correspond with periods of high bird abundance during fall migration. Production and consumption of winter fruits deserves further attention from forest managers, as relatively little other food is available in winter, energy demands of overwintering birds are high, and current management practices often reduce fruit availability of key species (e.g., Myrica cerifera). We suggest that fruit is more important than generally realized in maintaining vertebrate diversity in temperate forests and that the focus of managers on hard mast production should be broadened to include fruiting plants.

Poysa, H.; Poysa, S.				Journal of Applied Ecology	39	3		502-510	June 2002	2002				English	1	22	1. Hole-nesting birds are frequently faced with a shortage of suitable nest sites in regions of intensive forest management. Nest boxes are sometimes provided to alleviate nest-site limitation in cavity-nesting waterfowl and are also recommended for several rare and endangered species. However, the impacts on effective breeding numbers and breeding success have rarely been considered, particularly in instances where density dependence might operate. 2. We experimentally manipulated nest sites to assess limits on the population size of a secondary cavity-nesting species, the common goldeneye Bucephala clangula, living on freshwater lakes. We also examined density dependence in their reproductive output. 3. Breeding pairs were counted in experimental and control areas over a 12-year period; for 4 years (1988-91) before nest box addition (1992-94 in the experimental area) and for 5 years (1995-99) afterwards. Broods were counted each year between 1988 and 1999 to study reproductive output. 4. Mean number of pairs per lake increased after the addition of nest boxes in the experimental area but not in the control area. However, neither the mean number of broods per lake nor the mean number of fledged birds per lake increased significantly in the experimental area. 5. When the whole period of 1988-99 was considered and data pooled from all the lakes, the numbers of broods and fledged birds showed negative density dependence of reproductive output. 6. Our results indicate that nest sites limit the population size of breeding common goldeneye, but show also that density-dependent factors operate to limit reproductive output. The possibility that density dependence may negate management actions directed at increasing breeding numbers in cavity-nesting waterfowl should be considered carefully before taking these actions. This also applies to nest box provisioning programmes aiming to manage populations of endangered species.

A preliminary checklist containing the records of 375 species in 60 families of fishes is provided. A semi-quantitative census method was used to assess the abundance of fish species at 26 stations from 15 reef sites. Fish community structure is compared between reef flat and reef slope stations using both a direct comparison of population parameters and multivariate statistical techniques, i.e. classification and MDS ordination. In general, reef slope supports higher species richness and abundance of fishes than does the reef flat. Multivariate methods indicate a clear distinction between the assemblages of fishes in the two reef zones. Characteristic fish fauna in each reef zone is described and the striking difference in composition of fishes between the two zones is emphasized with respect to their trophic structures. These reveal the supportive roles of habitat zones in coral reefs to a range of ecological niches of fishes. Attention has also been drawn to a need for establishment of multiple use management for the Adang-Rawi Islands group. Logical criteria (i.e. biological diversity, reef conditions and geomorphological features of the reefs) for choosing suitable coral reef reserves are recommended.

Kirkpatrick, Chris; DeStefano, Stephen; Mannan, R. William; Lloyd, John				Southwestern Naturalist	47	2		282-292	June 2002	2002				English	0	16	We examined short-term trends in relative abundance and species richness of breeding and wintering grassland birds before (1996) and after (1997, 1998) a prescribed burn in a mesquite-invaded, desert grassland at Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona. We surveyed birds and sampled vegetation along 1-km line transects bisecting 14 (7 control, 7 burn) 25-ha plots located randomly within a burn and adjacent control unit. Following a spring burn that was moderate in intensity and patchy in areal extent, we observed that ground cover was affected more strongly by burning than mesquite (Prosopis) cover, smaller mesquite were affected more strongly by burning than larger mesquite, and mortality of mesquite was low. No change in total abundance of birds was detected on the burn unit following fire for either wintering or breeding birds; however, species richness of breeding birds decreased in the first year post-burn. During the breeding season, mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) increased, whereas Botteri's sparrows (Aimophila botterii), Cassin's sparrows (Aimophila cassinii), and cactus wrens (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus) decreased in relative abundance following fire. During the wintering season, ladder-backed woodpeckers (Picoides scalaris) and vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) increased and cactus wrens decreased in relative abundance following fire. Beyond species-level trends, we found stronger evidence of trends and greater magnitudes of relative change for breeding species associated with open grasslands compared to those associated with shrubs. The use of spring burns on the Refuge will likely improve conditions for open-grassland species that were historically more abundant by killing smaller mesquite and reducing mesquite recruitment. However, more intense and extensive fires will be required to reduce the presence of larger mesquite. Such fires would likely have a greater impact on birds associated with shrubs, and consequently, a greater impact on the avian community as a whole.

Habitat characteristics (water depth, vegetation height and density, and plant-species composition) and abundance of all passerine species were measured at each of the 68 sampling points. The sampled area included most of the reedbeds in the Ebro Delta. Sampling points were classified according to the habitat parameters measured using cluster analysis. The resulting four habitat types differed in the composition and attributes of their passerine communities. The abundance of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) was greatest in tall, permanently inundated and almost monospecific Phragmites reedbeds. In contrast, the numbers of the reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and Savi's warbler (Locustella luscinioides) were greatest in areas of drier soils and a denser basal stratum. Finally, the fan-tailed warbler (Cisticola juncidis) showed no clear habitat association. In the Ebro Delta, reedbed management includes freshwater inputs and burning of standing reeds. These practices promote tall, permanently inundated reedbeds with minimal detrital accumulation. Bird species richness and diversity were greater in less intensely managed habitats, but only diversity was significant (p < 0.001). We conclude that, since reedbeds are important habitats for several scarce bird species, and the abundance of these species seem to be influenced by vegetation structure, bird conservation considerations should be incorporated into future reedbed management practices	Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi; Centre de Recerca Ecologica i Aplicacions Forestals (CREAF), Facultat de Ciencies (Edifici C), Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra (Barcelona), Spain, Spain.	j.martinez@miramon.uab.es	Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi/D-3385-2014	Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi/0000-0002-2332-7298; Bertolero, Albert/0000-0002-6834-2600			Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation	0277-5212		Conservation; Conservation measures; Ecology; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe	Acrocephalus arundinaceus; Acrocephalus scirpaceus; Cisticola juncidis; Emberiza schoeniclus; Locustella luscinioides [Habitat management / Reedbed management / Recommendations based on habitat selection analysis in nesting populations] [Habitat preference / Habitat selection / Analysis in nesting populations & management implications; reedbeds] [Semiaquatic habitat / Reed bed habitat / Habitat selection patterns in nesting populations & management implications] [Spain / North east, Ebro Delta / Habitat selection in nesting populations & management implications].

Species richness (21, 23, and 25 species, respectively) within small (n = 19; 1.0-4.4 ha), medium (n = 17; 6.0-34.4 ha), and large (n = 6; 65-560 ha) hardwood islands within the pine matrix was the same, but the trend was for richness to increase with island area. Forest interior, neotropical migrants dominated all hardwood stand areas. Most species were common to all areal classes, with only a few restricted to a particular areal class. Thus, there was little evidence that these hardwood islands, embedded in a managed pine landscape context, harbored unique bird communities. Species richness (40) was greatest within the matrix of pine stands of all ages, intermediate (32) in hardwood stands, and least (27) in rotation-age pine stands. Hardwood stands supported the highest total bird densities as well as the highest densities of neotropical migrants. Pine stands hosted high densities of both resident and early successional neotropical migrants. We concluded that the presence of hardwood stands embedded within a matrix of different age classes of pine likely allowed forest-interior neotropical migrants typical of hardwood stands to "spill over" into adjacent, structurally similar pine stands and vice versa.

Anderson, Stanley H.; Crompton, Bradley J.				Forest Science	48	2		365-372	May 2002	2002				English	0	9	The Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota are characterized by a complex history of both natural and human disturbance regimes. Historically, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities were characterized by frequent, cool ground fires. Intensive fire suppression and timber harvest throughout the past century have drastically altered the structure of existing forests. Today, much of the area has been harvested using shelterwood logging resulting in open even-aged stands. The goal of this study was to compare bird communities in treated (areas that have recently been harvested) and untreated (areas receiving minimal silvicultural treatment) in the past 40 yr. Of the 20 commonly observed bird species, 3 species [red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta Canadensis), brown creeper (Certhia Americana), and ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus)] were conspicuously less abundant in treated than in untreated stands. Eleven other species were more abundant in treated stands, while six species showed no response to treatment. Although bird species diversity and the abundance of birds were highest in treated stands, this does not imply that logging is beneficial to the entire bird community. The abundance of particular bird species may appear to have increased, but the composition of the bird community has been altered. As more of the forested areas are harvested, the bird community will shift from one with birds typical of both open pine and dense pine forest to one dominated by ground foraging species.

Forest Science	48	2		381-390	May 2002	2002				English	2	30	Numerous studies have documented that forest edges affect habitat use and reproductive success of forest birds, but few studies have considered edges created by narrow breaks in the forest canopy. We compared predation rates on artificial nests placed within forest habitat along edge transects, 10 m from unpaved roads, and along interior transects, 300 m from forest-road boundaries. Local factors, such as nest concealment, and landscape factors, such as the degree of forestation in surrounding areas, were accounted for when testing for edge effects on nest predation. We conducted fixed-radius point counts to compare relative abundance of 34 bird species on edge and interior transects. Also, seven study plots were established adjacent to unpaved roads to map the distribution of bird territories within edge areas, 0-150 m from unpaved roads, and interior areas, 150-300 m from roads. Rates of nest predation on artificial nests did not differ between edge and interior transects, but the distribution of forest birds was influenced by unpaved roads. Four of 18 forest-interior species had lower relative abundance or territory density adjacent to roads, while four of six species categorized as edge nesters had higher relative abundance on edge transects. Our results suggest that narrow openings within forested landscapes may affect habitat use but not nest predation levels, emphasizing the need to frame definitions of "edge effects" within the context of multiple ecological processes.

Vickery, Juliet; Carter, Nick; Fuller, Robert J.				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	89	1-2		41-52	April 2002	2002				English	3	51	Many farmland bird populations have exhibited marked declines in the last 20-30 years and there is growing evidence to link these declines to agricultural intensification. Field margin management is frequently proposed as a way of enhancing bird populations but there have been few attempts to assess the relative value of different management options. This paper aims to provide a preliminary assessment of the relative value of six different cereal field margin management practices in providing foraging habitats for farmland birds. It also briefly compares these with the benefits afforded by field and whole farm approaches such as set-aside and organic farming, to wildlife conservation on arable land. The field margins considered are: grass margins (separated into grass-only strips and grass/wildflower strips), naturally regenerated set-aside margins, uncropped wildlife strips, game cover crops and conservation headlands. Sympathetically managed field margins can provide a range of plant and invertebrate food resources for birds both in summer and winter. In general, the best winter food supplies (mainly seeds) will be provided by game cover crops and naturally regenerated rotational set-aside strips. The most abundant summer food supplies (invertebrates and seeds) will be provided by a diverse sward; grass/wildflower strips, uncropped wildlife strips and naturally regenerated rotational set-aside strips followed by conservation headlands. Field margin swards that are less diverse in terms of species composition and structural heterogeneity and that consequently support fewer invertebrates, can, nonetheless, provide higher quality foraging habitats for birds than an intensively managed crop up to the hedge base. A number of bird species such as yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) and tree sparrow (Passer montanus), prefer to forage in margins in winter and summer and many of the benefits of whole field approaches such as set-aside, overwinter stubbles and undersown cereals, could be gained from margins under the same management. Whole-field approaches are, however, required for boundary-avoiding species such as skylark (Alauda arvensis) and lapwing (Vanellus vanellus). Less is known about the use other birds make of margins, relative to their use of field centres in winter. Whole farm approaches such as organic farming, whilst being highly beneficial to birds, are likely to remain rather localised in the UK, whereas field margin management can be relatively easily incorporated into the farmed landscape on an extensive scale.

Herrando, Sergi; Brotons, Lluis				Ecography	25	2		161-172	April 2002	2002				English	0	27	Fire is a key mechanism creating and maintaining habitat heterogeneity in Mediterranean landscapes by turning continuous woody landscapes into mosaics of forests and shrublands. Due to the long historical role of fires in the Mediterranean, we hypothesised a moderate negative effect of this type of perturbation on forest bird distribution at a landscape level. We conducted point bird censuses in Aleppo pine forest patches surrounded by burnt shrublands and studied the relationships between three ecological groups of bird species (forest canopy species, forest understorey species, and ubiquitous species) and the features of local habitat, whole patch and surrounding landscape. We used a multi-scale approach to assess the effects of landscape variables at increasing spatial scales on point bird richness. Regarding local habitat components, canopy species were positively associated with tall pines while understorey species with the cover of shrubs and plants from holm-oak forests. Forest birds were positively related to patch size and irregular forest shapes, that is, with high perimeter/size ratios. Thus, these species did not seem to perceive edges as low quality but rather favourable microhabitats. We did not detect any negative effect of isolation or cover of woodlands in the landscape on the presence of forest species after local habitat factors had been accounted for. Finally, only local habitat factors entered the model for ubiquitous species. We suggest that mosaic-like landscapes shaped by fires in the Mediterranean basin are not strongly associated with negative effects fragmentation on forest birds other than those related with habitat loss.

Aubry, Keith B.; Raley, Catherine M.				Journal of Wildlife Management	66	2		392-406	April 2002	2002				English	1	20	Providing adequate habitat for the pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) is a key component of federal management plans in the Pacific Northwest, yet information is extremely limited on characteristics of trees selected by this species for nesting or roosting in coastal forests. We investigated selection by pileated woodpeckers of both individual tree and site characteristics for nesting and roosting in coastal forests, and evaluated the efficacy of current management prescriptions for these woodpeckers on federal lands. From 1990 to 1995, we used call surveys, ground searches, and radiotelemetry to locate 25 nest and 144 roost trees used by 31 adult pileated woodpeckers (16 females, 15 males) in western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) forests located about 20 km east of the Pacific coast in Washington, USA. Nesting pairs typically excavated nest cavities in different trees each year, and individual birds used an average of 7 different roost trees during the nonbreeding season. Pileated woodpeckers used decadent live trees as often as snags for both nesting and roosting. They selected Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis) for nesting and western redcedar (Thuja plicata) for roosting, and selected against western hemlock for both activities. For nesting, pileated woodpeckers used only trees 65-154 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) but were not selective within this range; for roosting, they selected trees 155-309 cm dbh and selected against trees [<]125 cm dbh. For both nesting and roosting, pileated woodpeckers selected trees [gtoreq]27.5 m tall and selected against trees [<]17.5 m tall. Decay characteristics of trees used by pileated woodpeckers for nesting differed strongly from those used for roosting. Site characteristics also influenced selection of nest and roost trees by pileated woodpeckers; 0.4-ha plots around nest and roost trees contained a higher diversity of tree species and higher densities of decadent trees [gtoreq]20 cm dbh and snags [gtoreq]50 cm dbh than availability plots. The Northwest Forest Plan specifies the retention of 1 large, hard snag per 17 ha of harvested forest to provide nest trees for pileated woodpeckers. Our results indicate that providing adequate habitat for pileated woodpeckers in coastal forests of the Pacific Northwest may require a more comprehensive management strategy that also includes provisions for roost trees and that emphasizes retention of both snags and decadent trees, especially those infected with heart-rot decay fungi.

Veraenderungen der Brutvogelfauna in einem oberbayerischen Moorkomplex.	Nitsche, Guenther; Rudolph, Bernd-Ulrich				Ornithologischer Anzeiger	41	1		13-30	April 2002	2002				German	0	1	This paper presents data from the changes of breeding bird populations in a moor complex in Upper Bavaria over the last 50 years, focussing mainly on the development since 1993. Draining and nutrification of fen meadows as well as drainage and industrial mining of parts of the peat bogs are the main landscape changes since 1960. In the last years the first steps of regeneration of exploited peat bogs have taken place. Characteristic birds like Black Grouse, Grey Shrike and meadow breeding birds have disappeared, birds like Teal or Meadow Pipit profit from the landscape change. A regional peculiarity of the study area is the Stonechat, which immigrated in the early 80ies and which is now reaching population densities of 1.3-1.5 breeding pairs/10 ha in the extended heathlands of drained bogs. For the first time the Grey-headed Woodpecker has been documented as a breeding bird of moor woodlands in southern Germany. Waterbirds from wetlands have settled the area since the beginning of the rewetting of exploited bogs, especially Little Grebe, some ducks, Water Rail and Bluethroat are reaching high numbers. This process is not yet finished. Perspectives for the future of the moorlands taking into account the further rewetting measures are discussed.

We hypothesized that bird communities undergo greater seasonal changes in burnt areas than in unburnt ones. Using the point-count method we assessed bird species composition and abundance in three zones (unburnt, burnt in 1982, and burnt in 1994) during the breeding and wintering seasons of 1997 and 1998. From the breeding to the wintering seasons, burnt zones showed an increase in forest species, whereas the bird community of the unburnt zone remained stable in the gradient open-forest species. Moreover, the seasonal turnover of communities was higher in burnt zones than in the unburnt ones, although this did not imply that the former varied in richness through the year. The pattern of bird abundance in the unburnt zone was similar during the two study years, in contrast with that of burnt zones, suggesting higher annual cyclicity in resource availability in unburnt areas. These findings suggest that fire increases the seasonal variability of bird communities.

Jansson, Gunnar				Forest Ecology and Management	157	1-3		77-86	1 March 2002	2002				English	0	2	The study of the relevant scales for use in landscape biodiversity management involves several difficulties, like small sample sizes at large scales and varying trends between species. I studied richness in a pool of 25 bird species in relation to the amounts and coverage proportions of four forest habitats over eight scales based on data from forty-two 10km transects. By adding habitat amounts from the transects, the accumulated species pool flattened out when about 400ha of older forest was included. Transect pooling gave plot sizes that reflected plots ranging in size 10-80km2, and the correlation's between bird species richness and the proportions of two good and two poor habitats were calculated at eight scales. For three of the habitat proportions, respectively, species richness was significantly influenced only at the smallest scale (10 km2), while for old forest also at 20km2. These regressions changed slopes (positive or negative) from the smaller to the larger scales for three of the habitats. However, in areas of 10km2 bird diversity was significantly predicted (positive or negative) by the proportion of any single habitat (suitable or poor), while in areas of 20-80km2 it was not, which may suggest that to reach comparably high levels of species richness in large areas, a mixture of several habitats is decisive. Thus, management of forest bird diversity may not be efficient over broad areas if the proportions of only one or a few habitats are used.

Darling, Laura M.; Booth, Barry; Merkens, Markus; Gebauer, Martin				Wildlife Working Report	WR-104			i-xii, 1-66	March 2002	2002				English	0	1	From 1992 to 1999, we assessed species diversity, relative abundance and community dominance of forest songbirds and small mammals in mature (control) and recently harvested, aspen forests near Chetwynd, B.C. Resident owls were surveyed during March-April 1997. We also assessed vegetation cover, security cover, woody debris and wildlife trees in the harvested and control stands. This report focuses on results of the songbird and small mammal study components and highlights the results of the other surveys. The reader is referred to details presented in unpublished annual progress reports. Small mammal species richness and abundance varied between years and between mature and harvested stands. Multi-year population cycles and stochastic weather events likely accounted for much of the between-year variation. Several mammal species encountered within mature stands during this study were never captured in clearcut areas. Some species were captured exclusively within clearcuts. Only Deer Mouse and Meadow Vole were significantly affected by clearcutting, though the effect of clearcutting was not consistent over the duration of the study. Retention patches of sufficient size within clearcuts may provide interior-forest species with suitable habitat or corridors. Our forest songbird results are based on "presence" of apparently breeding (i.e., singing or calling) individuals of a species, not whether they are successfully reproducing. Analyses of point-count data indicate that there were significant differences in species abundance between years for 15 of 24 bird species recorded in seven mature stands monitored from 1993 to 1997. However, fluctuations in abundance in mature stands appeared to be part of the normal variation in songbird abundance rather than population trends. Variations in diversity, abundance and dominance patterns were recorded among mature stands and among harvested stands of various age classes. The magnitude of these variations has potentially significant implications for interpretation of short-term "control-versus-treatment" studies. The number of bird species recorded in mature stands and clearcut stands did not differ within a given year, but numbers varied between years. In all mature stands and clearcuts, there were a few dominant bird species that provided about 80% of the observations, while many species were uncommonly recorded; however, the dominance order (rank) of the species in harvested stands differed from mature stands, reflecting songbird habitat preferences. Abundance of bird species after clearcutting followed established patterns: (1) no significant change in abundance of some species; (2) a lower abundance of species usually associated with older forests; (3) detections of mature-forest species in the clearcuts, primarily in leave-tree patches; (4) early successional bird species in clearcuts, and (5) significant annual changes in abundance of various species in clearcuts. Management recommendations stemming from this study include: (1) large, unfragmented mature stands must be distributed across the landscape and over time; (2) retention patches in clearcuts must be large (> 5 ha), connected to intact forest, representative of the intact forest, and include critical elements such as large-diameter live aspen with visible signs of heart rot to maintain nesting habitat for cavity-nesting wildlife; (3) long, large-diameter woody debris and small woody debris must be retained in slash piles and scattered throughout the harvested block where feasible; (4) longer harvest rotations should be scattered across the landscape. Additionally, managers must recognize that significant annual fluctuations in species abundance are normal and may result in misleading interpretation of short-term studies, and that the presence of an apparently breeding songbird does not imply successful breeding. Further study is required on the size and configuration of leave patches, particularly in reference to the role of patches in small mammal and songbird population dynamics and reproductive success. Stands 20 to 60 years old need to be studied to determine at what stand age forest-associated species re-colonize regenerating stands. v	Darling, Laura M.; Parks and Protected Areas Branch, Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection, P.O.

From all species 29 breeding species, 37 hospites species and 30 permigrants were registered. From 38 waterfowl and water living species are only 4 breeding species (10.8 %). It is extremely few and indicates absence of bank and littoral vegetation. Ratio of water breeding bird species and permigrants (4:30) is very unequal in comparison with the ratio of these ecological groups i.e. at the water body Ruzina, where this ratio is 23:28. The studied water dam is most important for waterfowl mainly during the migration period and winter. In total 14 waterfowl and water living species were found in winter. The species Anas platyrhynchos, Ardea cinerea, Cygnus olor, Fulica atra and Podiceps cristatus. Lams ridibundus, in winter also Mergus albellus, Bucephala clangula, Phalacrocorax carbo, Aythyaferina and A.fuligula belonged to the characteristic and most abundant species. The maximum number of species and specimens of waterfowl showed two peaks of these variables during the year (in spring - February through April and autumn - November). High abundance of waterfowl was found also during the winter period, when the water was not frozen. Proposals for locality revitalisation and increase of species diversity are discussed.

Middle Spotted Woodpecker tends to dominate Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) in oak forest managed for the production of quality timber for a long time. At the mature timber forest stage, trees with large trunks dominate: oaks with a trunk diameter of 45 cm represent over 80% of all trees. These mature plots guaranty the presence of high- density Middle Spotted Woodpecker population nucleus, and this despite all standing dead wood being removed. As for the study species other cavity-nesting birds are found in densities much than those recorded in primary forest in Poland. Starlings are especially numerous with the breeding population supplemented by a large number on non-breeding birds, this does not affect Middle Spotted Woodpeckers nor Nuthatches (Sitta europaea) which can be found at densities higher than 7 territories per 10 ha. We still need to assess the actual breeding population and monitor breeding success in this modified forest.	Lovaty, Francois; 83, rue Pablo Neruda, F-03410 Domerat, France, France.

Findlay, Stuart E.G.; Kiviat, Erik; Nieder, W. Charles; Blair, Elizabeth A.				Aquatic Sciences	64	2		107-117	2002	2002				English	0	34	Wetlands are increasingly becoming the target of efforts to restore or mitigate past and current loss of area and other impacts on their function. Tidal wetlands serve an array of functions deemed beneficial (ecosystem services) but there are relatively few efforts to provide verified indicators of these functions or assess variability in function among wetlands. We assessed twelve functions ranging from wave energy dissipation to fish species richness in tidal freshwater wetlands on the Hudson River. These functions were assessed along with potential "indicators" of function at fifteen marshes selected to span hydrogeomorphic classes as well as expected level of function. Functions varied dramatically among wetland sites, with scores summed across functions ranging from 16% to 70% of the maximum possible. Some of the functions were positively associated such that improvement in one would probably be accompanied by improvements in others. Some functions (e.g., surface water exchange and breeding bird habitat) were negatively correlated indicating that one site cannot maximize all potential functions. A verified reference data set allows more objective selection of targets and sites for restoration as well as establishing realistic goals for what might be achieved. The validated indicators of function are valuable tools for extrapolating from a few intensively studied sites to the larger, unsampled, population of wetland sites in a region.

Boros, Emil				Aquila	107-108			15-35	2000-2001(2002)	2002				Hungarian	0	0	Migrating and breeding shorebird population was studied in correlation with potential food resources on two sodic grassland fields in the Kiskunsag National Park. The first site was a restored flooded sodic wetland, and the eutrophic water used for inundation originated from the Danube. The area was mowed after the breeding season as soon as it became dry. The second study site was a typical sodic grassland around a sodic lake without artificial flooding, and the only influence of the area was extensive grazing by sheep. Both shorebird and invertebrate density on the surface of wet grasslands and bare ground were significantly higher on the first flooded site, but diversity of invertebrates was higher on the second grazed site. The migrating shorebird density in May and density of breeding pairs had correlated with food density on both fields. This result suggests that at the beginning restoring of water levels and cutting is very good for food abundance but the natural sodic wetland is more diverse with extensive grazing. Nevertheless, artifical water supply may cause emergence of marsh vegetation without grazing, while bare sodic vegetation is an endemic community and important shorebird habitat in Hungary.

Provencher, Louis; Gobris, Nancy M.; Brennan, Leonard A.				Auk	119	1		71-87	January 2002	2002				English	1	17	Reversing decades of fire exclusion by hardwood midstory reduction is now used to recover populations of the federally endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest ecosystems. The effects of Red-cockaded Woodpecker management on winter birds in longleaf pine sandhill forests are largely unknown. Examining habitat use of winter migrants, some of which are declining, may influence the selection of habitat management techniques used for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers to benefit overwintering migrants. During the winters (December-February) of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999, we tested experimentally the effects of hardwood reduction treatments applied in 1995 on winter birds at Eglin Air Force Base in fire-excluded northwest Florida longleaf pine sandhills. Treatments were (1) prescribed spring burning, (2) herbicide application, (3) mechanical felling and girdling, and (4) a control where decades of fire exclusion was maintained. We also sampled winter bird flocks in frequently burned, nonexperimental reference plots to measure management success. Hardwood reduction techniques had no effect on flock species richness, which averaged 7.9 and 7.2, respectively, during 1997-1998 and 1998-1999. Larger flocks in felling and girdling and in herbicide plots were primarily due to significantly higher numbers of overwintering Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina), as well as resident Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and an influx of temperate migrant Pine Warblers (Dendroica pinus). In contrast, flocks in control plots were smaller (flock size and species composition in spring burn plots were intermediate) and composed of hardwood-associated species, such as Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) and Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). The relative uses of longleaf pines and hardwoods by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, Pine Warblers, and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) during both winters best explained that winter birds present in herbicide, felling and girdling, and reference plots were more likely to forage on the same tree species and substrates than birds in spring-burned plots, and least likely to forage on the same species and substrates as birds in the control plots. Those differences corresponded to the following increasing order of hardwood stem mortality among treatments: control, spring burn (41%), felling and girdling (62%), and herbicide (92%). Repeated burning is recommended to restore the reference foraging condition because it was eight times less expensive than other techniques, which favored mostly Chipping Sparrows.

Shane; Maher, Ron				Canadian Field-Naturalist	116	1		42-50	January-March 2002	2002				English	1	26	The abundance and distribution of breeding waterfowl in the Great Clay Belt of northern Ontario was determined through helicopter surveys of 117 fixed plots (2x2 km each) during the nest initiation periods from 1988 to 1990. This area has higher fertility, flat topography, high water table and better access than the surrounding Boreal Forest, and therefore has greater potential for increased waterfowl production through habitat management. Overall breeding density averaged 112.5 indicated breeding pairs per 100 km2, 68% being of the four most common species [Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Ring-necked Duck (Aythya collaris), American Black Duck (Anas rubripes), and Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula)]; 13 other species were encountered. The average total of breeding waterfowl for the region was estimated at 59330 pairs. Distributions of the species were related to ecodistrict and to surficial geology. The more northerly of the two main ecodistricts had higher densities of American Black Ducks, Ring-necked Ducks, Common Goldeneyes, and Canada Geese (Branta canadensis). Mallard and Hooded Merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus) distributions correlated with presence of surficial clay and moraines, respectively. Less common species including Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca) and American Wigeon (Anas americana) appeared to be concentrated in smaller-scaled habitat features (beaver pond sequences and estuarine marshes, respectively). Results generally agreed with those of earlier Clay Belt surveys. Total breeding density of waterfowl is slightly higher than that of surrounding regions.	Ross, R.

A study of the Eastern Arc Mountains.		Newmark, W.D.				Ecological Studies	155			i-xii, 1-197	2002	2002				English	0	11	The Eastern Arc Mountains are for their size, biologically the richest site in Tanzania and Kenya. Yet, what is particularly striking about the Eastern Arc Mountains is the unusually high number of endemic plant and animal species. The Eastern Arc Mountains and adjacent coastal forests have the highest known ratio of endemic plant and animal species to area of any site worldwide. In the Eastern Arc Mountains, more than three quarters of the original 20,300 km2 of natural forest has been lost and much of this loss has occurred over the last 200 years. The remaining forest is highly fragmented with most fragments being small - the median forest patch size is 11.5 km2. Currently, natural forest cover in the Eastern Arc Mountains is approximately 5708 km2, of which 1452 km2 is closed forest. In Tanzania and Kenya, populations and demand for arable land are increasing rapidly and human pressures on the Eastern Arc forests will almost certainly increase in the future. As a result of the unusually high concentration of endemic species, the significant loss in forest cover, and the many threats facing these forests, the Eastern Arc Mountains and adjacent coastal forests have been identified as one of the 25 most globally threatened ecosystems or biodiversity "hotspots". A continuing loss of natural forest in the Eastern Arc Mountains would adversely affect local communities, because residents use many forest plant and animal species as food, medicines, building materials, and fuel. The Eastern Arc forests also provide many important regional benefits including the maintenance of water quality, the reduction in soil erosion, the storage and sequestering of carbon, the generation of foreign exchange and employment through forest product utilization and nature-based tourism, and provision of educational and research opportunities for national and international scientists and students. Many of these latter ecosystem services are, however, not adequately valued because they are not included in the market system. The most immediate threats to biodiversity in the Eastern Arc Mountains are deforestation, forest fragmentation, forest degradation, over-exploitation of species, and exotic invasives. Past deforestation and fragmentation in the Eastern Arc Mountains has resulted in the documented local extinction of many understory bird species and the global extinction of a tree species. Based upon species-area relationships, the loss of 76 % of the original forest cover in the Eastern Arc Mountains implies that approximately 30 % of the original plant and animal species found in these forests have become extinct or are in jeopardy of future extinction. Moderate to heavy levels of logging have has been shown in many forests in Africa to adversely affect many primate and bird species as well as alter small mammal and plant communities. In the Eastern Arc Mountains, forest degradation resulting from selective logging and pole cutting has significantly reduced, in disturbed sites, the relative abundance of selected bird guilds, specifically ground-feeding insectivores. Over-exploitation threatens selected plant and animal species in the Eastern Arc Mountains. The Tanzanian government has banned the harvesting of 15 tree species that grow in the Eastern Arc Mountains because of past over-exploitation. Studies in Kenyan coastal forests have shown that the current offtake by local hunters of many large forest mammal species is unsustainable. Similar patterns of exploitation of large mammals most likely exist in the Eastern Arc Mountains. Exotic plants and animals represent a further threat to biodiversity in the Eastern Arc Mountains. Many exotic plant species have naturalized Eastern Arc forests. In the East Usambara Mountains, Maesopsis eminii, an exotic invasive tree species, has altered the local ecology of many sites. The Eastern Arc forests are probably highly susceptible to exotic invasives because of their highly isolated nature. The most immediate threat in the future to the conservation of biodiversity in the Eastern Arc Mountains maybe fire. With the expansion of small-scale agriculture in the Eastern Arc Mountains, the incidence of fire spreading from agricultural lands into the forest will almost certainly increase. Global warming and climatic change could further facilitate an increase in the incidence of fire. Biogeographic patterns of plant and animal species diversity in the Eastern Arc Mountains have important implications for conservation. In Eastern Arc forests, montane bird species richness is positively correlated with closed forest area while the number of endemic bird species is positively correlated with precipitation. Montane bird species richness is also positively correlated with precipitation, after accounting for closed forest area. On many mountains in the tropics, species diversity is highest at mid-elevation. In the Usambara Mountains, the number of plant and bird species as well as the number of plant species endemic to the Usambara Mountains are highest at mid-elevation and decline at lower and higher elevations. Precipitation is also highest at mid-elevation here suggesting that plant and animal species diversity along elevational gradients in the Usambara Mountains are influenced by patterns of productivity. A mid-elevational peak in species diversity is not, however, universal in the Eastern Arc Mountains. In the Udzungwa Mountains, linypiid spider diversity is highest at high elevations and lowest at mid-elevations. This unusual pattern, however, is most likely a result of area effects. Reducing human pressures on the remaining natural forest and enhancing protected area management and coverage is central to conserving biodiversity in the Eastern Arc Mountains. Improving agricultural practices and expanding fuelwood and hardwood plantations in the Eastern Arc Mountains are activities that can greatly reduce human pressures on forests and forest resources. Furthermore, upgrading the management capacity of protected area institutions in the Eastern Arc Mountains can greatly assist in resolving many local community-protected area conflicts. Given the small size of the Eastern Arc forests, the remaining non-protected forest on public lands in the Eastern Arc Mountains should be given protected area status. Additionally, because of the highly fragmented nature of the Eastern Arc forests, ecological connectivity between the largest remaining fragments should be enhanced through the establishment of wild-life corridors in selected areas.

Hausner, Vera H.; Yoccoz, Nigel G.; Strann, Karl-Birger; Ims, Rolf A.				Ecoscience	9	4		470-481	2002	2002				English	0	15	Coastal birch forests in northern Norway have over the last 50 years gradually been replaced with non-native spruce plantations. To investigate possible changes in bird communities, we compared species richness and composition in six forest types (mature spruce plantations, ecotones, mixed forests, and three birch forest types) in two regions over two years. In the southern region, birch forests tended to host a higher number of species than spruce plantations, but species composition differed between forest types. The species composition in rich birch forests was particularly distinguished from spruce plantations, but also from the less productive birch habitats. Furthermore, there were dissimilarities in species richness and composition between regions. Ground nesters and species nesting on their northern margins occurred most frequently in the southern region, whereas cavity-nesters were most abundant in the northern region. Some species declined in abundance from 1998 to 1999, whereas three species shifted their main distribution from birch forests to mixed forests/ecotones. Possible factors underlying these results are discussed. We recommend that researchers and managers pay attention to habitat qualities within forest types (i.e., other than tree species composition in overstory) as well as to regional variations in species assemblages when addressing outcomes of management practices.

Tutkas matsalu niitudel.	Magi, Eve				Hirundo	15	1		3-18	2002	2002				Estonian	0	0	Numbers of the ruff (Philomachus pygnax) have decreased in whole Europe. In Estonia, the ruff was a widely distributed breeding bird some decades ago, occupying areas islands, western and northwestern coast as well as alluvial meados on bigger rivers. In the beginning of the 1990s the breeding number was estimate at about 2000 pairs, and the trend for 1971-90 was stable (Lilleleht & Leibak 1993).Ten years later the estimate was only 100-200 (Lohmus 2001). Given that Kasari floodplain meadows and the surroundings of Matsalu Bay (Fig. 1) have continuously held the highest number of Ruffs in Estonia, this article (1) gives a historical overview about the status of the subpopulation, (2) describes its breeding habitats, and (3) reviews the history of grassland management and its possible impact on Ruff numbers in the area. Most of the data (inci, about 150 nest descriptions) comes from the systematic censuses of breeding birds since 1958. Earlier data have been collected by Eerik Kumari and some other researchers. In the 1870s, the Ruff was among the most numerous non-passerines around the Matsalu Bay. In the 1930s, drainage of the Kasari Delta had started, and E. Kumari stated the Ruff as a common breeder (at least 85 pairs) on the Kasari meadow, eastern part of the coastal hay meadows of Matsalu Bay and on larger islands of the bay (Sits 1937, see Fig. 2). In the 1950s, the species had (again) spread widely on the meadows around Matsalu, Topi and Topu Bays, as well as on islands in the bay and in hay-islands in Moonsund. Its numbers reached 940 pairs (Table 1). After such a big increase, decrease started. First, the Ruff disappeared from juniper-rich coastal meadows, then - after grazing was stopped, and open water areas between reedbed and meadows were lost - also from traditional breeding sites in the inner part of Matsalu Bay. In Kasari floodplain meadows, the number of breeding Ruffs started to decrease since 1986-1987. In the last few years, no breeding Ruffs have been detected there but some pairs might still breed. A few pairs breed almost annually in the middle part of Matsalu Bay meadows. The total population estimate for 1997-2001 is 0-15 pairs in Matsalu, and the total Estonian population is obviously much smaller than the last estimate of 100-200 pairs. On migration, the Ruff is still numerous (although less numerous than in top periods) and approximately 12,000 specimens have been counted during migration peak: in Kasari meadows, reedbed and on the coast. In the 1930s, when Ruff numbers were low, they bred only in coastal hay-meadows and in the Kasari flood-plain meadows. Pastures were occupied during population increase; this also coincided with the period when many previously mowed areas were changed to pastures. Most nests have been found from wet meadows with short grass, particularly areas with small ditches. Usually, the nests were in small grass-tufts. Obviously, there are many reasons for the disappearance of Ruffs. One reason could be global warming and northward shift of its distribution range. However, also habitat change is likely to have big impact. For example, Kasari meadow, from which Ruffs almost disappeared, has been continuously used as hay meadow. However, modern mechanised mowing has resulted in ( I ) the decrease of mowing area (to 2 500 ha); (2) higher grass - the lowest 15 cm remains now untouched; (3) dense stub-cover of willows (only upper part of is cut down). These changes alter the insect fauna, and old grass and scrub make foraging harder for short-billed birds (e.g. Lapwing and Ruff) and nestlings. From a distance, the meadow looks well managed but for birds, it could be like any other poorly mowed area.	Magi, Eve; Matsalu Looduskaitseala, Penijoe, 90305 Laanemaa, Estonia, Estonia.

The transects were established in the most typical habitats of this park. One of them, Swiety Krzyz, was in a strict nature reserve, and the other two were in a new fragment, included to the Park in 1996, called Dolina Wilkowska and Bukowa Gora. In total, 43 breeding species with a high mean density of 80.4 pairs/km2 were recorded from the three transects (Tabs. 1, 2, 3). Extremely high densities and proportions in the total community were found for chaffinch, robin, and blackcap. Moreover, coal tit, goldcrest, and chiffchaff dominated on at least one transect. Fairly high densities for this area were found for marsh tit and tree creeper. Rare breeding species comprised stock dove, firecrest, red-breasted flycatcher, nutcracker, and crossbill.

Shane; Murkin, Henry R.; Ingram, Joel W.				Northeast Wildlife	57			45-57	2002	2002				English	0	1	We studied waterfowl habitat use and resource availability on beaver (Castor canadensis) ponds in south-central Ontario. We studied 6 types of natural beaver ponds (aquatic bed, emergent, forested, scrub-shrub, unvegetated, seasonally flooded) and 1 managed beaver pond (dewatered for >1 year to rejuvenate vegetation communities and then re-flooded). Waterfowl use was determined from helicopter surveys for breeding pairs and elevated platforms for broods. Invertebrate and minnow abundance and biomass were determined using sweep net samples. Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) pair densities were higher (P = 0.001) on emergent (0.16 [plus or minus] 0.02 SE) and scrub-shrub (0.20 [plus or minus] 0.03) wetlands than on seasonally flooded (0.08 [plus or minus] 0.02) ponds. Wood duck (Aix sponsa) pair densities were higher (P = 0.0001) on forested (0.20 [plus or minus] 0.04), emergent (0.14 [plus or minus] 0.03) and unvegetated (0.23 [plus or minus] 0.06) wetlands than on seasonally flooded ponds (0.01 [plus or minus] 0.01). Hooded merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus) pair densities were higher (P = 0.0001) on forested (0.10 [plus or minus] 0.02) and unvegetated (0.07 [plus or minus] 0.01) ponds than on scrub-shrub (0.01 [plus or minus] 0.01) and seasonally flooded (0) wetlands. Differences in brood densities were not detected between wetland classes for mallard/black duck (P = 0.08), wood ducks (P = 0.17) and all species combined (P = 0.44). Hooded merganser brood densities were higher (P = 0.02) on forested (0.66 [plus or minus] 0.22) and unvegetated (0.59 [plus or minus] 0.23) wetlands than on emergent (0) wetlands. In June, total invertebrate biomass was higher (P = 0.008) in emergent (0.72 [plus or minus] 0.32), forested (0.78 [plus or minus] 0.30), scrub-shrub (0.75 [plus or minus] 0.24), and managed wetlands (0.70 [plus or minus] 0.17) than in unvegetated ponds (0.08 [plus or minus] 0.05). In July, total invertebrate biomass was higher (P = 0.009) in emergent (1.23 [plus or minus] 0.38) and managed (0.99 [plus or minus] 0.22) wetlands than in unvegetated ponds (0.07 [plus or minus] 0.03). Managed wetlands had similar productivity to natural vegetated wetlands and therefore intensive water level management to increase waterfowl productivity has limited potential. Waterfowl use in the region is primarily affected by wetland availability. Beaver abundance and distribution determine wetland availability and therefore, programs, partnerships, and policy initiatives that consider both forestry and beaver management will positively impact waterfowl in Canada's forested regions.

Data were sought in light of recent ecological changes to the area and a restoration project that sought to recreate former freshwater conditions within the area. Seventy-two species of birds were recorded. Comparison with earlier inventories revealed that about half of the previously recorded swamp species still occur in the marshes. Migrants comprised 30% of all marsh species. Restoration of the marshes involving the exclusion of seawater via impoundments will likely improve on avian species diversity and population sizes, and enhance the ecological value of the wetland habitat.

In total, 70 breeding or probably breeding bird species and 2 more species breeding just next to the reserve were recorded. Compared with previous data some differences were revealed, mostly due to habitat changes: the drastic decline in the number of breeding pairs of Dunlin Calidris alpina schinzii, disappearing of Ruff Philomachus pugnax. Also some new species started to breed in the reserve: Crane Grus grus, Citrine Wagtail Motacilla citreola, Greylag Goose Anser anser. The density of breeding pairs in meadows reached 27p/10 ha. The density in thicket very high - 92 p/10 ha. Higher densities were recorded only in similarly mosaic natural habitats. Also the density of the most numerous species - Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus 20 p/10 ha - was one of the highest recorded in Poland. Due to unfavourable habitat changes in the "Beka" reserve some reconstructional works has been started recently. A constant monitoring is essential for future valuation of those activities.

ZOOREC:ZOOR13900034716					2019-04-10J	ZOOR14112070765	Article	A preliminary risk assessment of cane toads in Kakadu National Park.		van Dam, R.A.; Walden, D.J.; Begg, G.W.				Supervising Scientist Report	164			i-xvi, 1-92	2002	2002				English	1	31	Background and approach Cane toads (Bufo marinus) entered the Northern Territory (NT) in 1980 from Queensland and are rapidly approaching Kakadu National Park (KNP), having recently been reported in the upper Mann River and Snowdrop Creek, approximately 15-30 km to the east of Kakadu National Park. Concern about the invasion of cane toads in Kakadu National Park has been highlighted on a number of occasions, and in 1998 participants at a workshop on the potential impacts and control of cane toads in Kakadu National Park conceded that a strategic approach for assessing and possibly minimising cane toad impacts should be developed. The first stage would be an ecological risk assessment to predict the likely extent of impacts of cane toads in Kakadu National Park and identify key vulnerable habitats and species. This information could be used to develop new monitoring programs and assess existing ones. This assessment is a direct result of Environment Australia's concern about the potential impacts of cane toads in Kakadu National Park. The wetland risk assessment framework developed by eriss for the Ramsar Convention was used to predict key habitats and the species most at risk. The majority of the assessment involved identifying the problem, the potential extent and effects of the problem, the risk, and subsequently making recommendations on monitoring. Major information gaps relevant to predicting impacts and developing appropriate monitoring programs were also identified. The risk assessment was based on information from published and unpublished scientific and anecdotal reports. Information on Kakadu National Park was derived from relevant research projects undertaken in the Park since the early 1980s. A number of relevant Territory and Commonwealth agencies were consulted, as were relevant cane toad, native fauna and/or wildlife management experts from around Australia. Discussions were held with community members in the Borroloola and Mataranka regions to gain an indigenous/cultural perspective of the cane toad issue. Identification of the problem Since their introduction to Australia in 1935 to control sugar cane pests in Queensland, cane toads have spread naturally and with human assistance throughout much of Queensland, northern NSW and the Top End of the NT. The cane toad's preference for certain disturbed areas means that areas of degraded natural habitat have probably helped their spread. They eat a wide variety of prey, breed opportunistically, have a far greater fecundity than native anurans, and develop rapidly particularly in warmer waters. They tolerate a broad range of environmental and climatic conditions, can occupy many different habitats and compete for resources with many native species. Most significantly, they possess highly toxic chemical predator defences, with many experimental and anecdotal reports of deaths of native predators that have attempted to consume cane toads. It is accepted that the cane toad will establish and spread rapidly in Kakadu National Park - a World Heritage area with Ramsar listed wetlands, well known for its spectacular wilderness, nature conservation values, rich diversity of habitats, flora and fauna, and cultural significance. There is serious concern that the World Heritage status of Kakadu National Park could be diminished if any of these attributes were adversely affected by cane toads. The potential extent of cane toads in Kakadu National Park Cane toads are likely to colonise almost every habitat type within Kakadu National Park. The saline regions of the coastal plains and deltaic estuarine floodplains will most likely support some cane toads at various times, although they are not likely to use these habitats on a permanent basis. Other less suitable areas include deep open water and/or flowing channel habitats and tidal regions of larger rivers (excluding riparian zones) which extend 70 to 80 km inland during the Dry season. The steady range expansion over the last ten years indicates that most wetland habitats are probably suitable as breeding habitat and also as Dry season refuges. Patterns of dispersal within Kakadu will probably rely on the transport corridors and the major rivers and creeks. Dispersal rates within a catchment could be up to 100 km y-1. The current location of cane toads would indicate an initial progression down the South Alligator River catchment via its sub-catchments (eg Jim Jim Creek, Deaf Adder Creek). Invasion of other areas of the Park will likely depend on which waterways' headwaters are colonised first (eg Mary River, East Alligator River). Maximum population densities of various cane toad life stages for limited areas of suitable habitat in Kakadu could be expected to be in the order of: 4000 to 36 000 eggs per metre of shoreline; [approximately]15 to 60 m-2 for tadpoles; 2.5 m-2 for metamorphlings; and 2000 ha-1 for adults, depending on temporal and spatial factors. The Dry season will see a gradual retreat of many cane toads from seasonally inundated wetlands. The vegetation and cracks in the black soils on the floodplains should offer sheltered, moist habitat during the mid Dry season. In the late Dry season, adult cane toadswill congregate near permanent water with adequate shelter. Few cane toads would be present in the drier areas of the tall, open eucalypt forest and woodland habitats of the lowland plains. The first rains of the Wet season will stimulate dispersal and increased breeding activity. With the progression of the Wet season, cane toads will disperse into terrestrial habitats, namely the open forests and woodlands. When large areas of the floodplains are inundated, cane toads will be concentrated on the remaining dry ground, which may make them highly visible to Park visitors. The potential effects of cane toads on Kakadu National Park The potential effects of cane toads upon Kakadu National Park are outlined in six sections of this report: effects on predator species; effects on prey species; effects of resource competition; cultural effects; economic effects; and other potential effects. Predators The majority of information on cane toad impacts relates to toxic effects on predators. A substantial amount of literature exists on effects on individuals, but little scientific information is available on population effects. The degree of susceptibility of potential cane toad predator species in Kakadu National Park was determined using three criteria: Definite: documented adverse effects upon populations of this species have been reported in the literature; Probable: documented in the literature as having eaten cane toads or their early life stages and adverse effects on individuals reported, but not on populations; Possible: documented in the literature or through expert consultation as eating, or thought likely to eat, native frogs or their early life stages, but effects of eating cane toads unknown. A total of 151 species or species groups were identified under these criteria, covering a broad taxonomic range including aquatic invertebrates, fish, frogs, lizards, snakes, birds and mammals. Eleven species were considered definitely susceptible to cane toads, comprising 5 lizard, 3 snake and 3 mammal species. Sixteen species or species groups were considered probably susceptible to cane toads, while 124 species or species groups were considered possibly susceptible to cane toads. Prey Little information was available on effects of cane toads on prey species. Cane toad tadpoles have been observed preying on the eggs of some native frogs, though they are thought not to be significant predators of native anuran early life stages. Rather, cane toad tadpoles have been observed to feed mainly on cane toad eggs, algae and detritus, as well as scavenging upon dead animals and animal material which they will consume in preference to plant material. Juvenile and adult cane toads are generalist feeders, consuming almost any type of terrestrial animals, with ground-dwelling ants, termites and beetles usually dominating the diet. Some small mammals, birds, reptiles and frogs are consumed in very small numbers. No study has specifically investigated the impact of cane toads on communities of ground dwelling arthropods. One general impact study reported a decline in beetle (Coleoptera) numbers, possibly due to cane toads. It is impossible to determine how many of the undescribed invertebrate species in Kakadu, many of which may be endemic, could be affected by cane toads. Competition Little information was available on competition between cane toads and native animals for resources such as food, shelter and breeding sites. The potential for competition between cane toad tadpoles and native frog tadpoles (eg the ornate burrowing frog) appears to exist, although, several reports suggest considerable segregation of breeding sites. Competition between adult cane toads and frogs appears to be minimal, with the pattern of habitat and food exploitation differing markedly. The major factor separating resource use is the cane toad's heavy reliance on ground-dwelling ants, termites and beetles as major food sources. There has been some indication from the Roper River region of the NT of competition effects. In particular, some species of small reptile were found to decline in areas colonised by cane toads. A competition effect was suspected, but not confirmed. Two frog species (the brown tree frog and green tree frog) have possibly been linked to competition-related declines, although the evidence is not strong. It is possible that many other species within Kakadu, including endemic aquatic invertebrates, could be subject to competition by cane toads. Cultural effects Concerns for the decline in numbers of bush tucker species such as monitor lizards, snakes and turtles have already been noted by several Aboriginal communities in the NT. This decline is likely to have very significant impacts upon Aboriginal communities within Kakadu. Some traditional ceremonies in the Borroloola region have been altered to request the spirits to return these foods, and in some cases, totem species (eg freshwater crocodile). From experience elsewhere in the NT, it appears that Aboriginal people, by necessity, eventually grow accustomed to the presence of cane toads, although this does not necessarily diminish the underlying concerns of these people. Areas of human habitation in Kakadu including the township of Jabiru, Aboriginal communities, Ranger stations, tourist accommodation and camping grounds are expected to have high densities of cane toads. This will impact on outdoor recreational activities and, in some areas, increase the likelihood of pets being poisoned from mouthing or ingesting cane toads. Economic effects Cane toads are unlikely to have an adverse impact on the general economy and tourism income of Kakadu National Park. The reactions to cane toads in the NT have ranged from disinterest to dismay. International tourists do not recognise toads as an invasive species, while visitors from Queensland are well accustomed to toads. However, tourists from other states express deep concern about cane toads, especially in World Heritage sites such as Kakadu. Tour operators in Kakadu share a similar concern. However, the major attributes of Kakadu continue to attract tourists, and are likely to overshadow any concerns about adverse economic impacts of cane toads. Cane toads do have an economic value as dissecting specimens for research and education purposes, and as a supply for medicinal and leather products. Such industries exist in Queensland and will probably become established in the NT once cane toads are present in sufficient numbers. Other potential effects Another potential effect is the contamination of water supplies with rotting toad carcasses and the subsequent release of the toxins. There have been many reports of the poisoning of pets and poultry from drinking contaminated water. Experimental water-borne exposure of the toxin to various organisms has resulted in toxicity, but generally only at high concentrations. The issue of potential impacts of cane toads on granivorous prey insects and resultant repercussions on Kakadu's native plants has been raised, although this is highly speculative. There is evidence, for example, that high densities of harvester ants can significantly reduce the density of speargrass (Sorghum intrans). In terms of plant-animal interactions, it is possible that subtle ecological changes could occur amongst other biota, and other flow-on effects. Feral cats and pigs have been known to die from mouthing or ingesting cane toads. These animals cause damage to the native fauna and landscape of Kakadu, and any decline in their numbers would be considered a benefit. The reduction in numbers of predators such as varanids (goannas) and snakes could be of benefit to the several species of grounddwelling/ nesting birds in Kakadu, in addition to crocodiles and turtles whose eggs are preyed upon by other large reptiles. Cane toads are known to feed on human faeces, and as a result they may harbour human strains of Salmonella and other bacteria. The eggs of human parasites are also spread via toad faeces. In areas where modern sanitation practices are lacking, the presence of large numbers of cane toads could represent a health hazard. Another health-related issue is the potential for substance abuse of the cane toad toxin, a habit forming practice that is established in northern Queensland and in countries such as Fiji. Identification of the risk The data on cane toad effects, distribution and densities are mostly inconclusive and/or show great variability. In addition, information on distributions and abundance of Kakadu animal species are deficient. Nevertheless, it is still possible to identify key habitats and also prioritise particular species based on the likelihood that they will be at greater risk from cane toads than other species, and their importance to the ecological and/or cultural values of Kakadu. Identification of key habitats Aquatic stages In Kakadu, cane toads will breed in both temporary and permanent waterbodies and so their aquatic stages will be found in a variety of aquatic habitats. They will concentrate their breeding activity during the wetter periods, although they are also known to breed during the Dry season. During the Wet season, when many of the major wetland habitats are inundated, cane toad breeding may be concentrated in the wetland habitats associated with the open forests and woodlands of the lowland plains. Terrestrial stages As the Dry season progresses, cane toads will move progressively from sites of temporary water to permanent water. The floodplains and sheltered habitats on the margins of floodplains and temporary or shallow billabongs will provide ideal cane toad habitat during the early to mid Dry season. The late Dry season will see high densities of cane toads near permanent water or moisture, including permanent billabongs and patches of monsoon rainforest. The Wet season will probably see the highest numbers of cane toad metamorphlings, mainly around the moist margins of the waterbodies they emerged from. Wet season inundation of the major wetland habitats will see the majority of adult cane toads dispersing into the woodlands and open forests of the lowland plains. The vegetation within the woodlands will provide suitable shelter for cane toads during the Wet season. Identification of species at risk Predators The initial susceptibility ranking of each of the 151 predator species identified as being definitely, probably or possibly susceptible to cane toads was further refined to a ranking of risk using exposure (ie available habitat overlap, feeding ecology, behaviour) and ecological/cultural importance status information. Four risk categories - likely, possible, uncertain and unlikely - were defined, being adapted from the original susceptibility criteria. Within these categories, different priorities were assigned. The original 151 predator species were allocated a risk ranking accordingly. Ten species were considered likely to be at risk of experiencing population level effects, with the northern quoll being assigned the highest priority. The 9 remaining species including 5 lizards, 3 snakes, and one mammal were assigned high priority. Twelve species or species groups were considered to be at possible risk of experiencing population level effects, although none were listed as endangered or vulnerable, or thought to be notable (rare, or have restricted range, outstanding taxonomic interest, or uncertain or declining status) or flagship (ecological/cultural importance to Kakadu) species. Thus, all species were assigned moderate priority status. Represented in this category were two groups of aquatic invertebrates, 3 frogs, one lizard, 3 snakes, freshwater crocodile and 2 birds. Due to a lack of information, the risk of population level effects was considered to be uncertain for 98 species or species groups, although 21 of these were assigned high priority. These species include 3 fish, 3 frogs, 6 lizards, one snake, 4 birds and 4 mammals. The remaining species in this risk category were assigned moderate priority. These include two groups of invertebrates, 4 fish, 17 frogs, 9 snakes, 42 birds and 3 mammals. A total of 31 species were considered unlikely to be at risk of experiencing population level effects (based on relevant ecological, feeding or behavioural information) and were assigned low priority. These included 11 fish, 18 birds and 2 mammals. Prey Quantitative data on impacts to prey species are scant, and very little can be concluded about the species or species groups at risk. Cane toads occasionally consume small vertebrates, but populations of these are not likely to be at risk. There is little doubt that termites, beetles and ants will be heavily exploited by cane toads in Kakadu. Due to the potentially high cane toad densities, and an individual cane toad's ability to consume up to hundreds of prey items in one night, ground-dwelling arthropods are at greatest risk. The potential impact of cane toads on endemic invertebrates is unknown. The only species known to suffer long-term population decline or extinction from the impact of cane toads is a tapeworm found in the intestines of a snake. Competitors The available experimental information suggests that some native frog tadpoles (eg L. ornatus) may be at risk through competition with cane toad tadpoles. However, observations suggest that native frogs rarely share breeding habitats with cane toads. Although adult native frogs do not appear to compete with cane toads, the potential risk to native tadpoles represents a risk to native frog populations. Some of the smaller insectivorous reptile species of Kakadu may be at risk from competition for food resources by cane toads, but nothing more can be concluded. Cultural, socio-economic and other risks The major impacts on Aboriginal communities within Kakadu National Park will be a decline in some traditional foods and, in some situations, the alteration of ceremonies following declines of food and totem species. Aboriginal people elsewhere in the NT have accepted the presence of cane toads but still express concern regarding the impacts. Aboriginal communities within Kakadu may also become accustomed to cane toads albeit most likely sharing the same concerns. Cane toads will congregate in areas of human habitation within Kakadu, and will be of nuisance value in these places, and will also represent a risk to domestic and semi-domestic dogs.1 Tourism, the major economic activity of Kakadu, is not at risk from the presence of cane toads, and visitor numbers will not decrease as a result. With predicted high numbers in Kakadu, there may be an opportunity to harvest them for commercial benefit. Other potential effects of cane toads have been hypothesised, including the contamination of water supplies, secondary effects on vegetation communities, the spread of human diseases, and the substance abuse of cane toad toxin. Details of these potential effects and hence the risks posed by them are essentially unknown. Uncertainty and information gaps This assessment has highlighted that there are major information gaps contributing to a large degree of uncertainty about the potential extent and impacts of cane toads in Kakadu. These include: uncertainty about densities of cane toads in Kakadu, effects of fire and burning regimes, degree of land/habitat disturbance, and the extent to which the Arnhem Land escarpment and plateau will act as a barrier and/or be colonised; the lack of quantitative data on the impacts on animal populations, particularly in the long-term, quantitative data on Kakadu fauna populations and distributions as well as dietary information; incomplete knowledge of Kakadu's invertebrate fauna, many being undescribed and possibly endemic; unknown response and susceptibility of most Kakadu fish species; unknown competitive interactions with native frogs; unknown chemoreceptive response in snakes and their ability to detect cane toad toxins; conflicting and unclear information on freshwater turtles; insufficient information on conservation listed species; the lack of experimental or anecdotal evidence regarding effects on bats; and impacts to as yet unidentified endemic species. Recommendations for additional surveys and monitoring Priority habitats for monitoring Seven major habitat types were identified for future monitoring: floodplain communities; swamp communities; monsoon forest; riparian communities; woodland and open forest communities; springs, soaks and waterholes; and escarpment/plateau pools. Priority species for monitoringThe species of most concern, and therefore a priority for monitoring, include the northern quoll, sandstone antechinus, red-cheeked dunnart, brush-tailed phascogale, dingo, all of the varanid lizards, northern death adder, king brown snake, western brown snake, ghost bat, black-necked stork, comb-crested jacana, Oenpelli python and freshwater crocodile. These are based on their risk rating, notability or listing as vulnerable, and also importance to Aboriginal people. Given that many species assigned to risk category 3 were done so due to a lack of information about effects of cane toads, it is possible that further information could result in the reprioritisation of some species. Although risks to prey species are unknown, beetles, termites and ants should be considered for inclusion in monitoring programs. Monitoring the possible effects of competition between cane toads and native aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates should be given high priority, particularly in escarpment/plateau pools where endemic species are known to exist. Similarly, monitoring for competitive effects between adult cane toads and insectivorous reptiles should also have high priority. Priorities for addressing information gaps A number of information gaps require addressing before more confident estimates of risks can be derived. Monitoring programs assessing the effects of cane toads upon Kakadu species will allow greater understanding of the risks. There is a need for appropriate baseline data, not just for cane toads but to monitor and assess other management issues that will arise in the future (eg other invasive species, fire and tourism). In addition, surveys should be conducted to identify and map the distribution of the endemic species of Kakadu, particularly in the escarpment and sandstone regions. All survey and/or monitoring programs should concurrently measure cane toad abundances and habitat preferences. Other information gaps that could be addressed but are less of a priority, include the effects of fire on cane toads and the lack of information for particular species or species groups (eg freshwater turtles, red goshawk). Evaluation of past and present monitoring programs As it may be several years before all of Kakadu is occupied by cane toads (eg some escarpment/plateau habitats), it is possible that some new monitoring programs may have sufficient time to accumulate pre-cane toad (ie baseline) data. It is highly unlikely that new monitoring programs will have time to provide similar data for many floodplain and lowland habitats. Data from major past and present monitoring programs within Kakadu may provide an alternative, noting that they were developed with objectives other than cane toad impacts in mind. Broad scale surveys The two major fauna surveys of the last 20 years provided information on abundances, distribution and habitat preferences of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians in a range of habitats similar to those identified in this report. The information from these surveys is not appropriate to use as current baseline. However, the established sites provide the opportunity for re-sampling before cane toads arrive. Not all habitat types were included in these surveys. A proposed representative re-sampling of the Stage 3 Wildlife Survey, which is hoped to be undertaken next Dry season could possibly provide one season of pre-cane toad data. Ongoing monitoring programs The only major ongoing fauna monitoring programs in Kakadu National Park are those associated with assessing potential environmental impact downstream of ERA Ranger Mine and the Jabiluka lease area. Monitoring programs are being conducted by eriss and ERA/EWL Sciences (Energy Resources of Australia Ltd/Earth Water Life Sciences). Aquatic macroinvertebrates are monitored at sites in the Magela Creek system (since 1988) and a number of control sites elsewhere in the Park. Sites from other areas have also been monitored regularly in the past (ie upper South Alligator River and Baroalba, Nourlangie and Gulungul Creeks). Though these studies were not designed for detecting cane toad impacts, inferences would be enhanced if cane toad invasion/distribution was monitored. Billabongs sampled in the Magela and Nourlangie Creek systems may provide information on (potentially vulnerable) freshwater snails. Fish communities in the Magela, Nourlangie and upper East Alligator systems have been monitored annually since 1994, and data exist for fish migration patterns in Magela Creek from 1985 to 1996. 'Whole-ecosystem' monitoring by ERA/EWLS has also been conducted at sites in Swift, Magela and Nourlangie Creek systems. Zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, fish, frogs, reptiles, bushbirds, waterbirds and mammals were surveyed in 1994/95 and again in 2000/01. Other surveys or monitoring programs Other past programs may also contribute to background information, including surveys of waterbirds on the Magela and Nourlangie floodplains. It has been proposed to re-survey the original Magela floodplain sites, in order to update/add to the existing information on birds. Information from the CSIRO Kapalga fire study from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s will provide a useful basis for detecting and assessing impacts once cane toads arrive there. Mammals, reptiles and insects were sampled originally and were re-sampled for small mammals in 1999. It will be very difficult to obtain adequate baseline data for a cane toad impact monitoring program. While the ongoing programs will be of some use, they are not necessarily targeted at the priority species identified in this report. Risk management and reduction Given the outcomes of the assessment, some relevant issues can be discussed that may assist Park managers in developing a risk management strategy. Parks Australia North has already been active with regards to management of cane toad issues, having initiated a cane toad identification training program and rapid response strategy to manage human assisted incursions of cane toads. Additionally, frog recording stations have been established at four sites in Kakadu (and more are planned). Baseline data have been collected for the past two Wet seasons. Very little will be able to be done to reduce cane toad numbers in Kakadu. Particular measures may prove effective in localised areas (eg townships, caravan parks), but efforts would need to be ongoing. Management of areas damaged by feral pigs may help reduce the densities of cane toads in pig-affected areas. Chemical and biological control methods are insufficiently developed at this stage. It is recommended that Parks Australia North manage the invasion of cane toads initially by i) ensuring that monitoring efforts are underway to assess the impacts of cane toads upon the natural and cultural values of Kakadu, and ii) investigating measures by which cane toads can be managed on a localised basis. The preliminary risk assessment provides a starting point from which Parks Australia North can determine the monitoring requirements for fauna. In addition, it provides an overview of the potential cultural and socio-economic impacts, which could be studied in greater detail by appropriate expe	van Dam, R.A.; Sinclair Knight Merz, 100 Christie St., St. Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia, Australia.

Thompson, Leigh; Jansen, Amy; Robertson, Alistar	Thompson, Leigh; Jansen, Amy; Robertson, Alistar			The responses of birds to restoration of riparian habitat on private properties.				i-ii, 1-34	2002	2002				English	0	6	Riparian areas provide vital habitat for bird species. Since settlement 150 years ago, the Murrumbidgee Catchment in south-eastern Australia has suffered extensive clearing and the effects of grazing practices. The introduction of non-native livestock to riverine areas has resulted in severe reduction in riparian habitat quality because livestock activity is concentrated near water and shade. Restoration efforts within the Murrumbidgee Catchment currently focus mainly on the exclusion of livestock by fencing-off riparian habitats. This study used 27 sites in the south west slopes region of the Murrumbidgee catchment to investigate whether the number of years since riparian areas were fenced-off (range of years 1-10+yrs) and the size of the fenced areas (range of sizes 1-4+ha) affected 1) the probability of occurrence of the Superb Fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus) and the Brown Treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus), and 2) the species composition of riparian bird communities. The number of years since riparian areas were fenced to exclude livestock was a significant factor in the probability of occurrence of the Superb Fairy-wren and the Brown Treecreeper. Within-site habitat features such as fallen logs, branches and the amounts of leaf litter were also significant factors in the probability of occurrence of the two bird species. Restoration may be accelerated by the artificial enhancement of woody debris stocks in fenced-off areas. The total bird community also varied significantly with time since fencing of the riparian areas, with grazing-sensitive species increasing and grazing-tolerant species declining in diversity with time since fencing. The size of the fenced-off areas was generally not a significant factor in the probability of occurrence of the Superb Fairy-wren, nor did it appear to affect bird community composition. However, Brown Treecreepers were unlikely to occur at most sites of <4 ha, and were significantly more likely to occur at larger sites if they had been fenced >10 years ago. Thus, it appeared that the Superb Fairy-wren was responding mainly to changes in habitat quality while the Brown Treecreeper was also responding to the area of habitat available. Fenced-off remnants and plantings of riparian vegetation provide vital habitat for avifauna. As habitat quality increased with time since riparian areas were fenced off, the probability of occurrence of grazing sensitive bird species like the Superb Fairywren and the Brown Treecreeper increased. Currently, fenced riparian areas are scattered on private lands across the landscape. Management of these fenced riparian areas should now aim at connecting these remnants to form a continuous habitat withreduced exposure to intensive agricultural practices. As woodland bird species abundance and diversity steadily decrease in southern Australia, the continued fencing-off of riparian areas to exclude livestock is essential in helping to increase habitat quality and subsequently halt the decline of woodland bird species.

U S Forest Service General Technical Report NC	227			147-160	2002	2002				English	0	0	This study was designed as an experiment to test how bird populations in an extensively forested landscape respond to small (group and single-tree selection) and large (clearcut) openings. Our objectives are to test the landscape-level effects of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management relative to no-harvest management on population density and reproductive success for forest-interior and early-successional bird species. Pre-treatment data were gathered during the period 1991 through 1995, treatments were applied in 1996 and early 1997, and post- treatment data have been collected from 1997 through the present. Immediately following treatment, populations of forest-interior species declined on all study sites. Post-treatment, forest-interior species responded both positively and negatively to the even-aged and uneven-aged treatments. For early successional species, changes in density were positive in response to both even-aged and uneven-aged treatment types. Neither nest predation rates nor nest parasitism rates increased following treatment. From a landscape-level perspective, our findings indicate that the short- term effects of even-aged management are mixed, positive, and negative, for forest-interior species and that the response by early-successional species is greater for even-aged than for uneven-aged management.

Petsjorahavet - viktig myteomrade for andefugl i Nordvest-Russland.	Isaksen, Kjell; Strom, Hallvard				Var Fuglefauna	25	4		194-198	Vinter 2002	2002				Norwegian	0	0	The Pechora Sea (the southeastern part of the Barents Sea) in Northwest Russia is known to be a very important area for many species of birds (especially swans, geese and ducks) during the breeding, moulting and migration periods. The bird life in large parts of the area is, however, poorly documented, especially with respect to birds at sea. The Pechora Sea is also very rich in hydrocarbon resources, and there are plans for extensive petroleum activity in both onshore and offshore areas. As marine birds are very vulnerable to oil spills in their environment, these plans raises concern for the well-being of the bird populations in the area. To evaluate the potential impacts of petroleum activity, information on the spatial distribution of marine birds at sea and in coastal areas is needed. An aerial survey conducted in the area in August 1998 focused on this need for information, with emphasis on moulting ducks. As the Pechora Sea is a huge area to cover and the time and resources available in the study were limited, the survey was designed to attain a rough picture of the relative distribution of birds in the area. Both an aeroplane as well as a helicopter were used to carry out aerial surveys. A combination of predefined transect routes covering the study area and flights in areas with supposedly high density of birds were used. Observations were also made during excursions on foot in areas around Amderma on the northern Yugorskiy Peninsula. The distribution of ducks found during the aerial surveys was very patchy. A minimum of 40 000 ducks, mainly King Eiders Somateria spectabilis and scoters Melanitta spp., was observed during the surveys. The highest number of ducks (King Eiders) was found in the areas around the Dolgiy Island in the eastern Pechora Sea. High numbers were also found in the areas off the west coast of the Yugorskiy Peninsula and in the shallow coastal areas of southern Kolguev. The study provides the first quantitative information, as well as more detailed distribution patterns, on ducks at sea in the Pechora Sea. The results show that the Pechora Sea is a very important area for post-breeding ducks. More detailed studies are needed to more more accurately estimate the size of the populations present.

Bird surveys were also conducted to assess some of the habitat values of the vegetation surveyed. The objectives of the surveys were to 1) provide baseline information, 2) identify conservation priorities and 3) provide broad guidelines for the management of native woody vegetation in order to improve its conservation values. Woody vegetation covered only 27% of the 180,000 ha catchment, with the majority of this woody cover occurring on hilltops and ridges, and only 2% cover on footslopes plus riparian strips. Six percent of the catchment was covered by grassy box woodlands on gently undulating plains. Vegetation and habitat assessment surveys were conducted within 50 remnants that varied in size and position in the landscape, from hilltops to riparian strips. Hilltop vegetation had the greatest understory cover of callitris pines and shrubs though also the greatest amount of bare ground. Footslope woody cover was only found in small remnant patches, and contained the highest number of dead trees and fallen timber. Woodland vegetation on the plains had the lowest canopy cover, but relatively high shrub cover and the fewest trees showing signs of dieback. In contrast, riparian zone trees had the poorest health, had few shrubs in the understory but the largest trees and the least amount of bare ground. No evidence of regeneration of trees were found at any of the sites within these four broad vegetation types. A total of four 1 ha fixed-plot bird surveys were conducted at each remnant site assessed for vegetation structure and health. Significantly more bird species were found within the larger remnants sites and riparian sites had significantly more bird species and a greater abundance of birds than any other vegetation type. In particular, more increaser species (e.g. farmland birds) were found in riparian sites. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences between vegetation type on woodland and declining bird species richness. The structure of woodland vegetation had a significant effect on woodland bird species richness; more bird species were found within remnants with a high cover of callitris pines, many large trees and a high shrub cover. At a catchment scale, riparian and footslope vegetation types have a particularly high conservation value since so little of it is left. At a local (landscape) scale, increasing remnant size and increasing connectivity between remnant is a priority. At a patch scale (individual remnant), control of grazing is a high priority in order to increase natural regeneration of trees and improve understory cover. Removal of fallen timber should be discouraged as this in an important habitat for many organisms including woodland birds.

Deferrari, Guillermo; Camilion, Carolina; Martinez Pastur, Guillermo; Peri, Pablo Luis				Biodiversity and Conservation	10	12		2093-2108	December 2001	2001				English	0	8	Human activities, such as logging, modify the forest structure and the microenvironments of the original Nothofagus forests. The aims of this work were to evaluate changes in the diversity and relative abundance of birds and to analyze their trophic relationships with insect and plant communities along the Nothofagus pumilio forest management cycle. Data was collected using a point sampling method along transects located in different forest structures during the summer season, by direct (sight) and indirect (hearing) recognition following sunrise. Bird diversity and abundance significantly varied along the forest management cycle. Seven new species appeared after harvest, but the total number did not vary by the end of the forest management cycle, and there was no significant loss of species. Bird abundance was directly related to the insect abundance and plant biomass. Relationship between groups (lower plants, monocotyledons and dicotyledonous) is also discussed. Major studies in bird ecology are necessary to develop new silvicultural alternatives based on the more sensitive species to harvest. Forest management strategies and mitigation alternatives must be incorporated into forest planning in order to maintain the original structure of bird communities and the equilibrium with other forest species.

Tittler, Rebecca; Hannon, Susan J.; Norton, Michael R.				Ecological Applications	11	6		1656-1666	December 2001	2001				English	0	21	Retention of residual trees in "cutblocks," logged blocks of forest, has been proposed as a method to conserve songbirds in landscapes fragmented by clear-cut logging. We examined songbird communities in the boreal mixed-wood forest of Alberta, Canada, to investigate the effect on songbird abundance of (1) logging and (2) retaining variable densities of residual trees in cutblocks (10-133 trees/ha or basal area of 0.50-10.65 m2). We surveyed songbirds in logged and forested, aspen-dominated, mixed-wood stands in the year before, the year after, and three years after logging. We analyzed changes in abundance of 27 common songbird species: 23 present in the forest prior to logging and four that appeared after logging. Ten species declined with logging and were termed "forest species." Ten more species did not change with logging and were called "habitat generalists." The seven species that increased with logging were called "cutblock species." When the effect of residual tree retention was examined in terms of basal area (rather than density) of residual trees, more songbird species were found to be both positively and negatively affected by residual tree retention, despite the fact that the two tree measures were highly correlated. In the first year after logging, four bird species (two forest, one generalist, and one cutblock) increased, and none decreased with increasing residual tree retention in cutblocks. In the third year after logging, again four species increased with increasing retention, but these were different species than in the first year after logging (one forest and three generalist species). Furthermore, four cutblock species decreased with increasing retention. Based on these findings, we conclude that retention of residual trees may be beneficial to some species, although conservation of unlogged reserves is also important. Most importantly, we recommend that research be continued to examine a larger range of tree retention and longer term effects on the avifauna.

Ecological Applications	11	6		1667-1679	December 2001	2001				English	0	17	Many federal and state management agencies have shifted from commodity-based management systems to multiple resource-based management systems that emphasize sustainable ecosystem management. Long-term sustainability of ecosystem functions and processes is at the core of ecosystem management, but a blueprint for assessing sustainability under different management strategies does not exist. Using the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP) as a case study, we present one approach to evaluating the landscape scale, short-term (one and two years posttreatment) consequences of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management treatments on community-level biological diversity. We chose changes in density of ecological species groups, representing groups of species with similar resource requirements, as our response variable. Changes in density are detectable before species completely disappear from an area, and these changes may be an early indicator of significant alterations to community structure and ecosystem function. Meta-analysis was used to statistically combine changes in densities across multiple species groups and assess the overall impacts of management treatments on the animal community. We also separately examined changes in density for each ecological species group. Our findings demonstrated that, in the short-term, even-aged and uneven-aged forest management treatments caused changes in animal community density in Missouri Ozark forests. Even-aged management sites showed greater changes than uneven-aged management sites after harvesting, and changes in species' densities were larger two years posttreatment (1998) than one year posttreatment (1997). Evaluation of treatment effects on individual ecological groups revealed that toads, forest interior birds, and edge/early successional birds were significantly affected by management treatments. We did not expect most species groups to exhibit treatment effects because relatively little forest biomass was removed per experimental site (only 10%), forest cover at the regional landscape level did not change and was generally high during the study, and the time scale was relatively short. The challenges facing ecosystem management evaluation parallel the challenges of ecological science in general: identifying appropriate variables, spatial and temporal scales, and experimental/management treatments. The integrative approach demonstrated in this paper is a first step toward the analysis of the effects of management treatments on multiple organisms within an ecosystem.

Thorstrom, Russell				Ornitologia Neotropical	12	4		337-343	23 November 2001	2001				English	0	0	The Barred Forest-Falcon (Micrastur ruficollis) and Collared Forest-Falcon (M. semitorquatus) are cavity nesters with similar geographic distributions but differences in body size. For Barred and Collared forest-falcons, nest height averaged 17 and 20 m above ground, nest tree dbh averaged 95 and 167 cm, and nest depth averaged 81 and 47 cm, respectively. Most forest-falcon nesting attempts were in Cedrela mexicana: 33% for Barred and 44% for Collared forest-falcons. Nesting attempts in live trees were more successful than those in dead trees or snags. Inter-nest distances averaged 1.04 and 3.28 km for Barred and Collared forest-falcons, respectively. The breeding density calculated from inter-nest distance yielded estimates of 1 territorial pair/0.98-1.08 km2 for Barred Forest-Falcons and 1 territorial pair/9.6-10.5 km2 for Collared Forest-Falcons.

Hansson, Lennart				Biodiversity and Conservation	10	11		1865-1873	November 2001	2001				English	1	26	Species richness of vascular plants and birds were examined in relation to five types of management (including abandonment) of oak-hazel woodland in south-central Sweden. The biodiversity of this type of woodland is affected by lengthy management in contrast to present emphasis on the fragmentation of more or less pristine forests. The woodlands derive from old deciduous forests but were a source of agricultural commodities from medieval time to end of the 19th century. Vascular plants and birds were censused during spring-summer for four years. Total number of plant species, species of field layer forbs, breeding birds and migrant birds were more numerous at simulated original management with mowing of small interior grasslands than at mechanical clearing or abandonment. Summer grazing led to intermediate numbers. Exotic plants were more common at long-time abandonment. Species richness of trees and shrubs, graminoids, all spring birds, resident birds and non-passerine birds did not exhibit any difference between treatments. Inter-site variation in species richness was usually smaller at abandonment than at true management. Species richness of plants and birds showed positive correlation in the particularly large sites examined. The general findings were in accordance with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Original management would secure most potential plant and bird species but extensive cattle grazing would also retain many species.

Chettri, N.; Sharma, E.; Deb, D.C.				Biological Conservation	102	1		1-16	November 2001	2001				English	0	15	Bird community structure was studied in the Yuksam-Dzongri trekking corridor of the Sikkim Himalaya, India. Nineteen transects with a total of 266 samplings were made in the forests along the corridor during June 1997 to June 1999. Human utilised forest (open canopy forest) and relatively unutilised forest (closed canopy forest) were designated for the study at two ecological zones, i.e. lower forest (1780-2350 m a.s.l.) and upper forest (2350-3600 m) depending on the natural resources utilisation pattern by local community living in the area and for tourism purposes. There were visible changes in the open and closed canopy forests in diameters at breast height class distribution of trees leading to distinct variation in the habitat types. Among the 143 species of birds observed during the study, a handful of species were found as habitat specific and about 40% were common to all the four habitat types. Both bird species richness and diversity were higher at the open canopy conditions compared with closed canopy, but the differences were not statistically significant. On the other hand, both the indices showed strong and significant negative relationship with the elevation. These diversity indices were also significantly higher during the summer compared with the winter season. The open canopy conditions exhibited comparatively more species of birds that were perturbated by human settlements than those species found at the closed canopy (mostly forest interior) and vice versa. Though the study could not trace out the effect of patch size brought about by human caused disturbances, the Yuksam-Dzongri trekking corridor possesses diverse habitat types as well as bird species resulted from heterogeneous habitat conditions. It is therefore important to emphasize disturbance study for threshold level assessment so that generalists as well as forest interior species could be managed through conservation efforts.

Freemark, Kathryn E.; Kirk, David A.				Biological Conservation	101	3		337-350	October 2001	2001				English	0	67	Population declines of farmland birds over recent decades in Europe, Canada and the USA have been attributed to more intensive agricultural management. We counted birds during the 1990 breeding season on 72 field sites in southern Ontario, Canada, paired between 10 organic and 10 conventional farms for local habitat to enhance our ability to detect effects of agricultural practices. Of 68 species recorded, 58 were on organic sites, 59 on conventional. Species richness and total abundance were significantly greater on organic than conventional sites based on log-linear regression. Of 43 species analyzed with log-linear regression, eight (18.6%) were significantly (P[<]0.05) more abundant on organic than conventional sites and four (9.3%) approached significance (0.05[<]P[<]0.10). Eight of these 12 species had negative population trends for 1967-1998 Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS) in this region. Two of the 43 species analyzed (4.7%) were significantly more abundant on conventional than organic sites and three (7.0%) approached significance. Two of these five species had negative BBS population trends. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of 13 practices and 13 habitat variables explained 44% of total variation (TV) accounted for in a detrended correspondence analysis of bird species composition and abundance. Practices contributed 23.7% of TV, habitat 26%; habitat and practices shared 5.7% with each other and 12% with farm ownership (i.e. clustering of field sites within farms). CCA ordinations indicated considerable mixing of organic and conventional sites across a gradient from sites with many birds species associated with greater habitat heterogeneity and more pasture, winter grain, farmstead and other non-crop habitats (hedgerow, woodland) to sites with few bird species associated with larger fields, more rowcrop and spring grain, more passes and tilling, and use of herbicides and chemical fertilizers. Our results re-emphasize the importance of non-crop habitats, more permanent crop cover, and less intensive management practices to the conservation of avian biodiversity on farmland.

Clergeau, Philippe; Jokimaki, Jukka; Savard, Jean-Pierre L.				Journal of Applied Ecology	38	5		1122-1134	October 2001	2001				English	2	147	1. The species diversity of adjacent landscapes influences the conservation or restoration of several animal groups in urban areas, but the effect on birds is unclear. To address this question, we compared bird species richness (BSR) and community composition between periurban (area surrounding the town) and urban (suburban and centre areas) landscapes across three spatial scales. 2. At a large biogeographical scale (temperate and boreal climatic zone), relationships between the BSR of urban areas and their surrounding landscapes were examined in a meta-analysis of 18 published studies. In general, BSR was negatively correlated with latitude and urbanization. The BSR of suburban and centre landscapes correlated positively with the BSR of periurban landscapes. However, latitudinal effects were also involved, as BSR in urban and periurban landscapes declined as town latitude increased. Similarity indices were low (50%) between periurban and centre bird communities. 3. At a regional scale, we assessed winter bird data from several towns within three regions of temperate and boreal countries (western France, northern Finland and eastern Canada). The type of periurban landscape, number of inhabitants and town diameter did not affect BSR. BSR was similar between the cities of a given biogeographical area. Bird communities were more similar between similar habitat types of different cities than between different habitats of the same city. 4. At a local scale, we tested the influence of proximity to the periurban landscape on BSR in parks of western French towns of different size. Neither BSR nor community similarity changed in relation to the distance of the park from the periurban landscape. 5. Guild composition according to diet and feeding habitat did not vary between urban and periurban locations at regional or local scales. 6. We conclude that, at regional and local scales, urban bird communities are independent of the bird diversity of adjacent landscapes, and that local features are more important than surrounding landscapes in determining BSR. Whatever the biodiversity quality of the periurban landscape, site-specific actions such as shrub and tree planting, water restoration and increasing vegetation diversity can change bird diversity in towns and improve the quality of human-wildlife contacts.

Schochat, Eyal; Abramsky, Zvika; Pinshow, Berry				Journal of Applied Ecology	38	5		1135-1147	October 2001	2001				English	1	16	1. Afforestation of the Northern Negev, Israel, from 1956 resulted in patches of primarily coniferous trees that fragmented large scrubland areas. This alteration in landscape pattern was followed by immigration of mediterranean bird species to the Negev. 2. We counted breeding birds, and measured various environmental variables in scrubland and planted forest patches, to test whether bird assemblages were random subsets of the regional species pool, and whether area or habitat structure was the major correlate with species abundance and distribution. 3. Of 22 bird species recorded, only three appeared in both scrub and forest, showing that these two habitats were occupied by different species assemblages. In both habitats, species richness increased with area at a rate greater than that expected by random sampling. In the scrub this increase was related to area per se, while in the forest it was related to habitat diversity in terms of stand age and tree type. 4. The density of forest species was unaffected by area, but specialist scrubland species declined as area decreased. We suggest that edge effects might reduce species abundance in small scrubland patches. 5. Nested subset analysis indicated that, at the community level, species composition was not random. However, at the species level, the distribution of three forest-dwelling species appeared as random, as it was associated with habitat rather than with patch size. 6. Our results indicate that increased diversity of breeding birds in the Northern Negev will require scrub patches larger than 50 ha among the increasingly forested landscape. In contrast, increasing forest area would hardly increase species diversity in the whole landscape. Future forest management regimes should also aim to increase habitat diversity by adding foliage layers, especially in the understorey. Exotic coniferous forests support fewer species than deciduous forests in mediterranean zones around the world. The suggested management regime may improve such forests as habitat for species-rich bird communities.

Wetlands were widely distributed, but restored- and natural-wetland pairs were from the same geographic locale and had similar characteristics, including wetland size. We conducted paired comparisons between restored and natural wetlands for wetland-bird density, waterfowl-breeding pairs, and wetland-avian abundance, species richness, and diversity. We also compared abundance, species richness, and diversity of birds on upland areas adjacent to wetlands. Canada goose (avian scientific names in Appendix A), mallard, redhead, and ruddy duck had higher densities on restored wetlands. We failed to detect differences in overall avian abundance, species richness, or diversity between restored and natural wetlands. We conclude that restored wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region supported similar avian communities with equal or higher abundances than those of natural wetlands.

Sanz, Juan Jose				Ecological Research	16	3		387-394	September 2001	2001				English	3	23	The indirect effect of insectivorous breeding-bird density on Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) through consumption of leaf-damaging caterpillars in a temperate deciduous forest was examined. Caterpillar abundance, caterpillar body mass and the resultant leaf damage were compared between a plot with nest-boxes and a plot without nest-boxes within the same forest. First, the installation of nest-boxes led to an increase in the breeding population of insectivorous birds. Second, the present study reports experimental evidence, under natural conditions, that a high breeding-bird density depresses the numbers of free-living defoliating caterpillars. Third, caterpillars reached significantly lower body masses in the nest-box plot than in the control plot. Finally, caterpillar damage to oak leaves was significantly less in the nest-box plot compared with the control plot. Therefore, the installation of nest-boxes is an effective means of decreasing insect damage to oak leaves. These results suggest that breeding-bird predation (the third trophic level) can be important in the regulation of interactions between oak and caterpillars (the first and second trophic levels, respectively).

Bellocq, M. Isabel; Smith, Sandy M.; Doka, Margaret E.				Journal of Insect Conservation	5	3		187-196	September 2001	2001				English	0	10	Arthropods play a key role in the functioning of forest ecosystems and contribute to biological diversity. However, the influence of current silvicultural practices on arthropod communities is little known in jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forests, a forest type comprising a major portion of the Canadian boreal forest. In this study, the effects of silvicultural treatments on arthropod communities were compared to identify those treatments that minimize ecological impacts on arthropods. The influence of harvesting techniques and mechanical site preparations on insect family richness and abundance of arthropods (total, by orders and by trophic groups) was examined in young (three-year-old) jack pine plantations of northern Ontario. Each of the following treatments were conducted in three plots: (1) tree length harvest and trenching; (2) full tree harvest and trenching; (3) full tree harvest and blading; and (4) full tree harvest and no site preparation. Arthropods were collected using sweepnets and pitfall traps over two years. Blading significantly reduced insect family richness, the total abundance of arthropods, abundance of Orthoptera, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, insect larvae, and plant feeders when compared to the other treatments. The use of either full tree or tree length harvesting had similar short-term effects on family richness and the abundance of arthropods. Arthropod diversity declined with increasing post-harvest site disturbance. These results suggest that arthropod communities in the understory and on the ground are reduced most on sites mechanically prepared by blading, but are similar under conditions immediately following either full tree or tree length harvesting. The implications for regenerating jack pine in the boreal forest are discussed.	Bellocq, M.

Jansen, Amy; Robertson, Alistar I.				Biological Conservation	100	2		173-185	August 2001	2001				English	0	21	Bird communities are declining in south-eastern Australia and riparian woodlands are critical habitats for birds in this agricultural region. We investigated how terrestrial bird communities varied with different land management practices (levels of grazing by domestic livestock and extent of clearing) and with habitat quality on the floodplains of the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers. Bird community composition in ungrazed and lightly grazed sites was significantly different to that in more heavily grazed sites, and these differences were related to tree and shrub cover, as well as tree species diversity and abundance of standing dead trees. Grazing appeared to have an effect on bird communities separate from that caused by clearing. Indicator species were identified for the effects of grazing and clearing. Grazing by livestock has had negative impacts on riparian birds through degradation of habitat quality. A combination of lower stocking rates, strategic placement of off-river watering points for stock, and the introduction of rotational grazing practices may be used to restore riparian habitat quality. The grazing-sensitive species we identified could be used as indicator species for the success of rehabilitation efforts.

Perhaps the greatest potential to diversify future forests lies in the vast areas of young second-growth stands which may be managed silviculturally to accelerate ecosystem development. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that large-scale precommercial thinning, at ages 17-27 yr, to various stand densities would, over the 10-yr period since treatment, enhance: (1) productivity of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) crop trees, (2) stand structure attributes, and (3) species richness and diversity of forest floor small-mammal communities. Study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada, in three forest ecological zones. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of [approximately]500 (low), [approximately]1000 (medium), and [approximately]2000 (high) stems/ha, with an unthinned juvenile pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison. Understory vegetation was measured in all stands in 1990, 1993, and 1998, and coniferous tree layers were measured in 1998. Small-mammal populations were sampled intensively in 1990, 1991, and 1998. Mean diameter increments of trees in the low-density stands were significantly higher than those in the medium- and high-density stands at all study areas. Mean height increments of trees were similar in the medium- and high-density stands and significantly higher than that in the low-density stands at Penticton and Prince George. Crown volume index (biomass) of herbs was highest in the thinned stands by 1998, but there was no difference among stands for shrubs and trees; volume of mosses was highest in the old-growth stands. Mean species richness and diversity of herbs, shrubs, and trees were similar among stands at 2, 5, and 10 yr after thinning. However, mean species diversity and structural diversity of coniferous trees were significantly higher in the low- and medium-density stands than in the high-density and unthinned stands 10 yr after thinning. Total structural diversity of all vegetation in the low-density stands was significantly greater than that of the medium-density, unthinned, and old-growth stands in 1998. Mean total abundance of all small mammals was similar among stands in 1990-1991, but the low-density and old-growth stands had the most mammals in 1998. Mean abundance of southern red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi) was consistently higher (2.1-3.3 times) in the old-growth stands than in unthinned stands. In seven of nine cases, mean abundance of red-backed voles was similar among old-growth and thinned stands. Mean species richness and species diversity of small mammals were highest in the low-density and medium-density stands. Heavily thinned lodgepole pine stands developed structural attributes such as large diameter trees, large crowns, and structurally diverse vegetative understories. Forest floor small-mammal communities reflected the compositional and structural diversity of these managed stands.	Sullivan, Thomas P.; Applied Mammal Research Institute, 11010 Mitchell Avenue, R.R.

Brand, L. Arriana; George, T. Luke				Auk	118	3		678-686	July 2001	2001				English	2	21	The response of passerine birds to forest edge was examined in old-growth and mature second-growth coast redwood (Sequoia sempivirens) forest in northern California. The study objectives were to determine which common passerine species are sensitive to edges during the breeding season and to estimate edge width for forest interior species. Response to edge was measured along twelve 100[x]400 m plots extending from the edge into the forest interior to obtain relative density of birds. Plots were surveyed 4 to 5 times in 1996 and 8 to 10 times in 1997. We found that 14 common passerines showed a gradient of edge sensitivity. Steller's Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri) and Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) had higher relative densities near edges than in the forest interior (P[<]0.05) and were categorized as edge species. Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), Pacific-slope Flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis), and Varied Thrush (Ixoreus naevius) had lower relative densities near edges (P[<]0.05) and were categorized as interior birds. Based on exponential regression models, estimated edge widths were 140 m for Varied Thrushes, 85 m for Brown Creepers, 120 m for Winter Wrens, and 125 m for Pacific-slope Flycatchers. Creation of edges would probably benefit Steller's Jays (which may be a nest predator), may not benefit Swainson's Thrushes, and may be detrimental to species that avoid edges. We recommend that edge effects be taken into consideration when planning for the conservation of bird species in the region.	Brand, L.

Pasinelli, Gilberto; Hegelbach, Johann; Reyer, Heinz-Ulrich				Journal of Wildlife Management	65	3		432-441	July 2001	2001				English	1	14	Knowledge of the ranging behavior and spatial requirements of a species is fundamental for establishing meaningful conservation strategies. Such information is lacking for the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius), a species endangered throughout its westpalearctic range. By radiotracking, we studied spacing behavior of this habitat specialist in a lowland oak forest of northeastern Switzerland from 1992-1996. Home range and core area size decreased from winter to late spring, with males and females having home ranges of similar size. Overlap of male home ranges was highest in winter (up to 40%) and lowest in late spring, whereas core area overlap remained low. For both home ranges and core areas, overlapping parts were used randomly in winter but more often than expected in early spring. Overlap of female ranges and of core areas did not change from early to late spring, and the shared parts of these home ranges were used as expected in both seasons. Aggressive interactions were most common in March and April and occurred mainly between individuals of the same sex. Our results suggest that the middle spotted woodpecker is not territorial in winter but defends nearly exclusive territories during spring, with both sexes participating to similar degrees in territorial defense. Based on this seasonal territoriality, we propose consideration of core areas in early spring (Mar and Apr) as a reliable estimate of the area requirements of the species to be used in management plans.

Twedt, Daniel J.; Wilson, R. Randy; Henne-Kerr, Jackie L.; Hamilton, Robert B.				Journal of Wildlife Management	65	3		450-460	July 2001	2001				English	2	21	In the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, flood control has led to a drastic reduction in the area of forest habitat and altered the patchwork of forest cover types. Silvicultural management of the remaining fragmented forests has changed to reflect the altered hydrology of the forests, current economic conditions of the area, and demand for forest products. Because forest type and silvicultural management impact forest birds, differences in avian productivity within these forests directly impact bird conservation. To assist in conservation planning, we evaluated daily nest survival, nest predation rates, and brood parasitism rates of forest birds in relation to different forest cover types and silvicultural management strategies within this floodplain. Within bottomland hardwood forests, nest success of blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea, 13%), eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus, 28%), indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea, 18%), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis, 22%), and yellow-billed cuckoo (Cocyzus americanus, 18%) did not differ from that within intensively managed cottonwood plantations. However, average daily survival of 542 open-cup nests of 19 bird species in bottomland hardwoods (0.9516 [plus or minus] 0.0028, [approximately]27% nest success) was greater than that of 543 nests of 18 species in cottonwood plantations (0.9298 [plus or minus] 0.0035, [approximately]15% nest success). Differences in daily nest survival rates likely resulted from a combination of differences in the predator community[-]particularly fire ants (Solenopsis invicta)[-]and a marked difference in species composition of birds breeding within these 2 forest types. At least 39% of nests in bottomland hardwood forests and 65% of nests in cottonwood plantations were depredated. Rates of parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were greater in managed cottonwoods (24%) than in bottomland hardwoods (9%). Nest success in planted cottonwood plantations for 18 species combined ([approximately]14%), and for yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens, 7%), eastern towhee (14%), indigo bunting (14%), and northern cardinal (17%) did not differ from nest success in cottonwood plantations that were coppiced from root sprouts following pulpwood harvest. Within bottomland hardwood forests, uneven-aged group-selection timber harvest reduced the combined daily nest survival of all species from 0.958 to 0.938, which reduced nest success by about 14%. Specifically, timber harvest reduced nest success of species that nest in the forest midstory and canopy, such as Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens)[-]from 32% before harvest to 14% after harvest. Conversely, those species that nest primarily in the shrubby understory[-]such as northern cardinal[-]were not affected by timber harvest and maintained an overall nest success of about 33%. Thus, birds nesting in the understory of bottomland hardwood forests are not adversely impacted by selective timber harvest, but there is a short-term reduction in nest success for birds that nest in the canopy and midstory.

Kirk, David A.; Hobson, Keith A.				Forest Ecology and Management	147	2-3		217-243	30 June 2001	2001				English	2	33	We made counts of 42 bird species at 217 points in 44 jack pine Pinus banksiana stands in the boreal region of north-central Saskatchewan, Canada because of concerns about the impact of forestry on avian biodiversity. Using multivariate analyses we describe the main patterns of bird species abundance and composition in relation to local habitat variables. According to canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), 17 of 43 explanatory variables accounted for significant variation in the bird species matrix: stand age, tamarack Larix laricina canopy cover, percentage shrub Alnus glutinosa, canopy closure (6-30%), percentage herbs, maximum canopy height, percentage shrub Alnus viridis, percentage moss, percentage shrub Betula nana, minimum and mean shrub height, percentage litter, white birch Betula papyrifera canopy cover, white spruce Picea glauca canopy cover, mean canopy height, canopy closure (71-100%), and zero shrub canopy closure. Habitat and stand identity (clustering of sites within stands) explained 55.5% of the total variation; 16.3% was unique to habitat alone (29.4% of the total variance explained [-] TVE) and 17.2% (31.0% TVE) was shared with stand identity. Stand identity accounted for 22.0% (39.6% TVE) of the variation. Neotropical migrants associated with "overmature" mixed-wood stands included Cape May Dendroica tigrina, bay-breasted D. castanea and Tennessee Vermivora peregrina warblers. Conversely, orange-crowned V. celata, palm D. palmarum, and Nashville V. ruficapilla warblers were found in young stands. The presence of several Neotropical migrants was associated with mixed-wood attributes (ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus with aspen, red-eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus with shrub alder, and Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus with canopy white birch). Jack pine stands older than commercial rotation age must be maintained in a managed landscape because their bird communities differ from younger stands. Because of the limited avian diversity in pure jack pine stands, sufficient mixed-wood stands must be regenerated to sustain populations of characteristic bird species. We recommend that jack pine mixed-woods be managed using shelterwood or selective cuts, and that rotation age of some stands be increased. Without the extensive fires necessary for regeneration, cutting patterns at the landscape level should approximate natural disturbance patches both in size and frequency of disturbance.

Aunins, Ainars; Petersen, Bo Svenning; Priednieks, Janis; Prins, Erik				Acta Ornithologica (Warsaw)	36	1		55-64	Summer 2001	2001				English	0	1	This point-count based study (1995-99) provides information on the avifauna of different farmland habitats in Latvia. Ordinations identify the main gradients within the species composition pattern: from arable land to natural habitats and from woodland across open, dry areas to wet meadowlands with rivers and ponds. Regression models describing the relationship between species richness and habitat show that the best positive predictors of species richness are woodland, scrub, natural meadows, unfarmed patches such as piles of stones or brushwood, and ponds. Regression models of the habitat affinities of the 30 most frequently recorded bird species are used to describe the present-day situation and to predict the effects of possible changes in Latvian farmland. The current high bird diversity is largely upheld by a non-intensive agriculture and large set-aside areas. Both further abandonment and development towards western standards of agricultural production may have adverse effects on populations of several species of conservation concern. Environmental considerations should therefore become an integral part of the development of Latvian agriculture.

Pearson, Scott F.; Manuwal, David A.				Ecological Applications	11	3		840-853	June 2001	2001				English	1	49	We examined the relative importance of riparian vs. upland habitats to breeding birds by comparing species abundance, richness, and similarity of bird communities in managed Douglas-fir forests in western Washington State, USA. We also examined whether forested buffer strips along second- and third-order streams effectively maintain the pre-logging riparian breeding bird community by comparing species abundance, richness, and turnover among three treatments: (1) unharvested controls; (2) sites that were clear-cut, leaving a narrow ([approximately]14 m) forested buffer on both sides of the stream; and (3) sites that were clear-cut, leaving a wide ([approximately]31 m) forested buffer along both sides of the stream. Deciduous trees, berry-producing shrubs, and other deciduous shrubs less common in adjacent upland forest characterized streamside zones. Despite different vegetation features, riparian and upland habitats did not differ in any measures of bird species richness and composition. No species or species group was more abundant in the upland. Neotropical migrants, resident species, and species associated with deciduous trees and shrubs in forested habitats were more abundant in riparian habitats than in adjacent uplands. Total bird abundance and abundance of four species (American Robin [Turdus migratorius], Pacific-slope Flycatcher [Empidonax difficilis], Black-throated Gray Warbler [Dendroica nigrescens], and Winter Wren [Troglodytes troglodytes]) were higher in riparian habitats. Abundance of these riparian associates was correlated with percent cover of berry-producing shrubs and the number of deciduous trees in the canopy. We found that the number of breeding bird species on sites with narrow buffers increased from slightly fewer than controls before harvest to an average of 10 more species than controls after harvest, a change reflected in an average 20% increase in species turnover on narrow-buffer sites relative to controls. Total bird abundance did not differ between treatments and controls. Resident species, those species associated with shrubs in forested habitats and conifer trees, declined on both buffer treatments. Species associated with upland and riparian forests (Black-throated Gray Warbler, Golden-crowned Kinglet [Regulus satrapa], and Brown Creeper [Certhia americana]) decreased in abundance on riparian buffer treatments relative to controls, whereas species associated with open, shrubby habitats (Dark-eyed Junco [Junco hyemalis], Cedar Waxwing [Bombycilla cedrorum], and Song Sparrow [Melospiza melodia]) increased in abundance on one or both riparian buffer treatments. High species turnover on narrow-buffer treatments indicated that buffers [<]14 m on each side of the stream did not maintain the pre-logging bird community. There was little difference in species turnover or species richness between the wide-buffer treatment and the control, indicating that a 30-m buffer on both sides of second-order and third-order streams maintains most of the pre-logging bird community in the first two years postharvest. The Black-throated Gray Warbler was the only riparian associate to decline on both the narrow- and wide-buffer treatments; its abundance was positively correlated with buffer width, and a buffer [gtoreq]45 m wide on each side of second- and third-order streams was needed to support populations at densities found on unharvested controls. To maintain the entire breeding bird community associated with forested riparian habitats in the coastal Northwest, we recommend a minimum buffer of 45 m along both sides of second- and third-order streams. Habitat features such as deciduous trees (Alnus rubra and Acer macrophyllum) and berry-producing shrubs (especially Rubus spectabilis) appear to be important and should be maintained within forested riparian buffer strips. This study documents short-term effects of riparian treatments on the breeding bird community, which may take several years to respond to habitat manipulations. Thus, we recommend continued monitoring to assess long-term effects of buffer width reduction.

Vickery, J.A.; Tallowin, J.R.; Feber, R.E.; Asteraki, E.J.; Atkinson, P.W.; Fuller, R.J.; Brown, V.K.				Journal of Applied Ecology	38	3		647-664	June 2001	2001				English	15	307	1. The effects of agricultural intensification on biodiversity in arable systems of western Europe have received a great deal of attention. However, the recent transformation of grassland systems has been just as profound. 2. In Britain, the management of grassland has changed substantially in the second half of the 20th century. A high proportion of lowland grassland is managed intensively. The major changes include a doubling in the use of inorganic nitrogen, a switch from hay to silage, and increased stocking densities, particularly of sheep. Structurally diverse and species-rich swards have been largely replaced by relatively dense, fast-growing and structurally uniform swards, dominated by competitive species. 3. Most of these changes have reduced the suitability of grassland as feeding and breeding habitat for birds. 4. The most important direct effects have been deterioration of the sward as nesting and wintering habitat, and loss of seed resources as food. Short uniform swards afford poor shelter and camouflage from predators, whereas increased mowing intensities and trampling by stock will destroy nests and young. Increased frequency of sward defoliation reduces flowering and seed set, and hence food availability for seed-eating birds. 5. The indirect effects of intensification of management on birds relate largely to changes in the abundance and availability of invertebrate prey. The effects of management vary with its type, timing and intensity, and with invertebrate ecology and phenology, but, in general, the abundance and diversity of invertebrates declines with reductions in sward diversity and structural complexity. 6. Low input livestock systems are likely to be central to any future management strategies designed to maintain and restore the ecological diversity of semi-natural lowland grasslands. Low additions of organic fertilizer benefit some invertebrate prey species, and moderate levels of grazing encourage sward heterogeneity. 7. There is now a need to improve understanding of how grassland management affects bird population dynamics. Particularly important areas of research include: (i) the interaction between changes in food abundance, due to changes in fertilizer inputs, and food accessibility, due to changes in sward structure; (ii) the interaction between predation rates and management-related changes in habitat; and (iii) the impact of alternative anti-helminithic treatments for livestock on invertebrates and birds.

Marsden, Stuart J.; Whiffin, Mark; Galetti, Mauro				Biodiversity and Conservation	10	5		737-751	May 2001	2001				English	1	35	Little of Brazil's remaining Atlantic forest is protected, so it is important to assess how well the region's wildlife can persist in areas/habitats outside reserves. We studied bird diversity and abundance during 546 point counts in the Sooretama/Linhares reserve, 200 point counts in 31 forest fragments (10-150 h), and 50 point counts in [<]30-year-old Eucalyptus plantations, within 7 km of the reserve. Only eight bird species were recorded in Eucalyptus, and this impoverishment, as compared to some Eucalyptus plantations elsewhere in Brazil may be a result of intensive clearance of understory vegetation. Species diversity in forest fragments was significantly lower than in the reserve. Twelve, mostly non-forest or edge species, were significantly commoner in the fragments, but nineteen species were frequent in the reserve but rare or absent in forest fragments. These included two Pyrrhura parakeets, a Brotogeris parakeet, a trogon Trogon, a jacamar Galbula, woodpeckers Piculus and Campephilus, Myrmotherula antwrens, and Hemithraupus and Tachyphonus tanagers. Bird species richness at points in forest fragments did not decline with fragment size, distance from the reserve, or forest quality. However, forest in fragments was more heavily degraded than forest within the reserve and poor forest quality may be the cause of declines in some species. Whilst protection of forest within reserves is a priority, management of forest fragments may aid conservation of some threatened species.

Jobin, Benoit; Choiniere, Line; Belanger, Luc				Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	84	2		131-143	April 2001	2001				English	0	28	Habitat structure and bird use of field margins were studied in intensive farmlands of southern Quebec, Canada. The main objectives were: (1) to assess the value of field margins for conserving avian diversity in agricultural landscapes, (2) to document their potential as breeding habitats for bird species particularly those considered as nuisance for crops, and (3) to describe habitat variables that best explained bird use of field margins. Three types of field margins were distinguished: (a) natural hedgerows (n=27) with well developed tree and shrub strata, (b) planted windbreaks (n=17) mostly composed of coniferous trees and generally devoid of a well structured shrub stratum, and (c) herbaceous field margins (n=17) with isolated shrubs. A total of 42 bird species were recorded. Bird use of hedgerows and windbreaks was similar, herbaceous field margins having fewer bird species and individuals than the other two types of field margin. Field margins did not contribute significantly as breeding habitats of bird species that may damage crops, but offered shelter to a broad range of species potentially useful for biological pest control. Bird use of field margins was mostly related to hedges' structural complexity and dimension. Conserving natural hedgerows, minimising mechanical and chemical control of the vegetation in field margins, and planting a mix of deciduous and coniferous species in windbreaks represent efficient conservation strategies both from a wildlife and an agronomic point of view.

Larison, Brenda; Laymon, Stephen A.; Williams, Pamela L.; Smith, Thomas B.				Auk	118	2		432-442	April 2001	2001				English	0	10	Riparian habitats typically support high diversity and density of both plants and animals. With the dramatic loss of riparian habitats, restoring them has become a priority among conservation practitioners. Diversity and density of avian species tend to increase following riparian restoration, but little is known about how restored habitats function to meet particular species' needs. Habitat structure is an important factor affecting species diversity and density and can influence nest-site selection and reproductive success. To evaluate habitat restoration, we examined interactions between habitat structure, nest-site selection, and nesting success in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) nesting in restored, mature, and young naturally regenerating stands of riparian forest. We found that stand types differed markedly in structure, and that habitat structure influenced both nest-site selection and rates of nest loss to predation. Comparison of habitat structure among the three stand types indicated that restored stands offered fewer acceptable nest sites and poorer protection from nest predation. Concordant with those differences in habitat structure, Song Sparrows showed trends toward less density in restored stands than in mature forest, and had poorer nesting success as a result of predation.

Di Giulio, Manuela; Edwards, Peter J.; Meister, Erhard				Journal of Applied Ecology	38	2		310-319	April 2001	2001				English	4	46	1. During the last few years a variety of methods have been applied in Switzerland to preserve and enhance biological diversity in agricultural systems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate grassland management techniques in respect of their effectiveness within a managed area and to examine how these areas contribute to species diversity at a landscape scale. 2. We examined insect diversity in grasslands subject to different management in a heterogeneous landscape in part of the Swiss Jura. Four study areas with varying landscape structure were selected and, in each area, meadows of two grassland management types were investigated. 3. The true bugs (Heteroptera) were chosen as an indicator group for insect diversity on the basis of previous work that had shown that the richness of the bug fauna correlates strongly with total insect diversity. 4. The variance of the heteropteran species data was partitioned into spatial (area) and management components. Area accounted for 35.4%, management for 29.7% and the interaction management [x] area for 7.2% of the species variance. The species diversity was greater in extensively managed meadows than in intensive ones; extensive sites had more individuals and showed a more even rank abundance distribution. 5. Individual species differed in their responses to management. Two species benefited from intensification whereas six species were affected negatively by intensive management. Two main groups of species did not appear to respond to management; these were mostly widespread species occurring in a variety of habitats, and polyphagous species which live in a wide range of grasslands but which show a certain affinity to managed meadows. 6. Our study indicates that extensive management of grasslands can enhance both local and regional insect diversity in agricultural landscapes. Extensively managed meadows were species-rich habitats that supported some rare and specialized species. In contrast, the bug community of intensive meadows was dominated by more widespread and less specialist species.

Smith, A.A.; Redpath, S.M.; Campbell, S.T.; Thirgood, S.J.				Journal of Applied Ecology	38	2		390-400	April 2001	2001				English	0	31	1. The abundance of meadow pipits appears to be a good indicator of the breeding density of hen harriers on moorland managed for red grouse in Scotland. High densities of hen harriers can limit grouse populations at low density and reduce shooting bags, with repercussions for grouse moor management and conservation. We therefore examined the habitat characteristics of managed grouse moors, asking whether changes in vegetation could alter the ratio of pipits, and thus harriers, to grouse. 2. We examined grouse abundance and habitat on 69 sites of 1 km2 in upland Britain, of which pipit abundance was studied on 36. Similar data were collected on 73 sites of 25 ha within the Langholm estate in south-west Scotland, in order to make a within-estate and among-moor comparison. 3. The distribution of pipit abundance on the Langholm estate was similar to that seen in the extensive among-moor study. Pipit and grouse abundance were related to habitat in similar ways in the two data sets. 4. Pipits were the most frequent passerine, but their abundance was not related to grouse abundance. Pipit abundance declined with increasing muirburn and heather, but increased with grass cover. In a linear regression model Calluna, Sphagnum and muirburn cover accounted for 42% of the variation in pipit abundance across Britain. 5. Grouse abundance was influenced by the regional location of the grouse moor and to a lesser extent by its altitude. There were more grouse on English moors with less patchy habitats. Bird species declined with increasing Calluna and Sphagnum cover and habitat patchiness. Bird species diversity increased from west to east and on moors with more muirburn. 6. This study provides evidence that meadow pipits are influenced by habitat characteristics on moorland managed for grouse. This work also illustrates how habitat management may be able to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts: long-term increases in heather cover and management of this habitat by muirburn on grouse moors may reduce pipit numbers and thus reduce the ratio of hen harriers to grouse. However, the effects of such vegetation change on other components of the upland bird assemblage requires further investigation.

Tharme, A.P.; Green, R.E.; Baines, D.; Bainbridge, I.P.; O'Brien, M.				Journal of Applied Ecology	38	2		439-457	April 2001	2001				English	5	59	1. Breeding birds, vegetation and moorland management were surveyed in 320 1-km squares on 122 estates in upland areas of eastern Scotland and northern England where red grouse shooting is a widespread land use. We assessed whether population densities of 11 species of breeding birds differed between heather-dominated moorland managed for red grouse shooting and other moorland with similar vegetation. 2. We classified estates that had a full-time equivalent moorland gamekeeper as grouse moors. The mean density of red grouse shot per year was four times higher and the mean density of gamekeepers was three times higher on grouse moors than on other moors. Rotational burning of ground vegetation covered a 34% larger area on grouse moors than on other moors. 3. Selection of heather-dominated squares resulted in similar composition of vegetation on grouse moors and other moors (about 76% heath, 12% grass, 8% bog, 2% flush and [<] 1% bracken on both types). However, grouse moors tended to have less tall vegetation than other moors and differed significantly in some other characteristics of the vegetation, topography and soil type. 4. Densities of breeding golden plover and lapwing were five times higher and those of red grouse and curlew twice as high on grouse moors as on other moors, while meadow pipit, skylark, whinchat and carrion/hooded crow were 1.5, 2.3, 3.9 and 3.1 times less abundant, respectively, on grouse moors. The differences in density between moorland types remained significant (P [<] 0.001) for golden plover and crow and approached significance (P [<] 0.10) for lapwing and meadow pipit after allowing for variation among regions. 5. We used Poisson regression models to relate bird density to vegetation cover, topography, climate and soil type. After adjusting for significant effects of these habitat variables, significant differences in bird density between the two moorland types remained for six species, although their magnitude was reduced. 6. Correlations of adjusted bird density with measures of different aspects of grouse moor management provided evidence of a possible positive influence of predator control (assessed using crow density) on red grouse, golden plover and lapwing. The control of crows by gamekeepers is the most probable cause of the low densities of crows on grouse moors. There was evidence of a positive effect of heather burning on the density of red grouse and golden plover and a negative effect on meadow pipit. Multiple Poisson regression indicated that predator control and heather burning had significant separate effects on red grouse density. Significant relationships between adjusted breeding bird densities and the abundance of raptors and ravens were few and predominantly positive. 7. The results provide correlative evidence that moorland management benefits some breeding bird species and disbenefits others in ways that cannot readily be explained as effects of differences in vegetation type or topography. However, experimental manipulations of numbers of some predators and heather burning are required to test these findings.

Wilson, Andrew M.; Vickery, Juliet A.; Browne, Stephen J.				Bird Study	48	1		2-17	March 2001	2001				English	0	24	This paper presents the results of the BTO/RSPB survey of breeding Northern Lapwings Vanellus vanellus in England and Wales carried out in 1998. Numbers of breeding Lapwings and land-use types were recorded by volunteers in 1312 randomly selected tetrads using identical methods to those adopted in a previous survey in 1987. The results suggest a population of 62 923 breeding pairs (95% confidence intervals 55 268 to 74 499), representing a 49% decline in 11 years. The declines were greatest in southwest England and Wales, resulting in a marked contraction in range. Both arable and pastoral farmland was found to be important for Lapwings, highlighting their vulnerability to changes in a range of agricultural systems. Recent major changes in land management practices, including the switch from spring to autumn sowing and the conversion of rough to intensively managed, improved grassland is likely to have reduced both the area and the suitability of these habitats for Lapwings. Grassland within arable areas is known to provide important chick rearing habitat, and spring tillage with adjacent grassland was significantly more likely to hold Lapwings than spring tillage that did not abut grass fields. The prevalence of grass and spring tillage fields in close proximity has declined in recent years with the loss of traditional mixed farming and the polarization of pastoral systems in the west of Britain and arable in the east. The implications of these results for the conservation of Lapwings are discussed and it is recommended that, in the light of the scale of the decline recorded, Lapwings should be afforded much higher conservation priority in Britain than they are at present. The range contraction has resulted in high numbers being concentrated on reserves, highlighting the importance of sensitive management of these areas for this species. However, wider countryside measures should also be considered, such as specific options within agri-environment schemes, designed to enhance farmland habitats for Lapwings.

Fairbairn, Steve E.; Dinsmore, James J.				Wetlands	21	1		41-47	March 2001	2001				English	2	44	Bird species richness and individual species densities were measured in wetland complexes in 1998. These values were then related to habitat variables within the complexes and to area of wetland habitat in the surrounding landscape. The percentage of wetland area within a complex that was covered with emergent vegetation and the total area of wetland habitat in the 3 km surrounding each complex were significant predictors of species richness. A perimeter-to-area ratio was the most frequently selected variable for inclusion in species-density models, being selected for 8 of 15 models. Five species' densities were related to the percentage of the wetland area that was covered by emergent vegetation, and 4 densities were related to the area covered by weak-stemmed wet-meadow vegetation. Densities of 5 species, as well as the overall species richness, were associated with a measure of the amount of wetland habitat within a 3-km buffer surrounding the wetland complexes. This indicates that the presence and abundance of some wetland bird species may be influenced by the amount of wetland habitat nearby. Thus, programs that encourage restoration of tracts of land that contain multiple wetland basins should be emphasized to maximize benefits to the wetland bird community.

Renjifo, Luis Miguel				Ecological Applications	11	1		14-31	February 2001	2001				English	3	57	The nature of the landscape matrix can control the capacity of forest organisms to move among forest patches. Some matrices may constitute foraging or breeding habitat and, as a result, could influence the local abundance of forest organisms and their persistence in fragmented landscapes. This study represents a first approach to examining the effect of natural vs. anthropogenic landscape matrices on the abundance of neotropical birds in forest sites. The influence of three contrasting matrices on the relative abundance of 113 birds species in a subandean region was evaluated. Species were grouped into categories showing the same response to the matrix, and these groups were then examined to determine whether ecological characteristics or taxonomic affinities were associated with responses to surrounding matrices. The abundance of individual species in forest plots within a continuous forest matrix was compared with their abundance in forest fragments embedded in pastures or exotic-tree plantations. The matrix surrounding forest areas was a major factor influencing bird abundance: 65.5% of the species showed significant differences in abundance among sites surrounded by different matrices. The most important explanatory factors in the variation in abundance within fragments were: abundance within continuous forest, presence in the anthropogenic matrices, migratory strategy, and habitat association. Species with small geographic ranges and species of terrestrial insectivores had low tolerance to fragmentation. Responses were highly species specific and largely independent of foraging strata, trophic group, and taxonomic affinities. Several lines of evidence indicate an increased connectivity among forest remnants surrounded by exotic-tree plantations compared to pastures. Landscape supplementation by the exotic-tree plantation matrix was observed for a hummingbird species. These results suggest that structurally complex anthropogenic matrices have potential as management tools for bird conservation by complementing habitat protection and restoration.

Flaspohler, David J.; Temple, Stanley A.; Rosenfield, Robert N.				Ecological Applications	11	1		32-46	February 2001	2001				English	2	64	Using natural nests of eight bird species, we provide one of the first multi-species tests for edge effects on reproductive success in a forested landscape. Our primary objective was to assess whether distance to the edge of recent clearcuts was related to nesting success in intact northern hardwood forests. Estimated nest success was generally lower for the two ground-nesting species than for the six canopy-nesting species. Brood parasitism was [<]3% for species which typically accept eggs of the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), and nest predation was the most common cause of nest failure. Probability of nest failure was influenced by distance to forest edge for the ground-nesting Hermit Thrust (Catharus guttatus) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), but not for six canopy-nesting species. For the Hermit Thrush and Ovenbird, nest success relative to decreasing distance to the edge was reduced during the nestling stage, but not the incubation stage. Nest density appeared to be higher in forest zones near the clearcut edge for ground-nesting and for several canopy-nesting species. Our data suggest that the effect of proximity to edge on nest success for ground-nesting species may penetrate 300 m into intact forest, while the effect of proximity to edge on nest density may penetrate farther. These data suggest that the creation of openings in forested landscapes reduces nest success and increases nest density for some species of migratory birds in a zone adjacent to the opening. This pattern supports the notion that "ecological traps" may exist for ground-nesting birds in areas near recently created forest openings. Because areas of contiguous forest (e.g., publicly owned forest) in the Upper Great Lakes remain relatively intact, they may serve as source habitat for regional songbird metapopulations.

Ford, Hugh A.; Barrett, Geoffrey W.; Saunders, Denis A.; Recher, Harry F.				Biological Conservation	97	1		71-88	January 2001	2001				English	4	104	This paper reviews the reasons why so many species of birds have declined in the eucalypt woodlands and associated habitats across the agricultural zone of southern Australia. The extent of habitat lost, over 90% in some regions, has led to the local extinction of some bird species, simply through random sampling effects. Habitat specialists and those that move sequentially among several habitats, are especially at risk, as some habitats have been lost disproportionally. Fragmentation introduces additional problems by subdividing populations into small, isolated sub-populations. Whereas some of the remaining species of birds appear able to move through highly fragmented landscapes, it is possible that they suffer high mortality while doing so. Some species that have been lost regionally may have had difficulty dispersing, but there have been few detailed studies of the demography of Australian birds in fragmented landscapes. Such studies are necessary before we can assess the value of corridors, or other means, to assist dispersal of birds. Fragmentation also leads to edge effects, which, when compounded by habitat degradation, may alter the intensity of a number of ecological processes. There is circumstantial evidence suggesting that loss of nest sites and increased predation on nests and free-living birds have contributed to the decline of woodland birds. Increased interspecific competition, for instance with noisy miners Manorina melanocephala, may also have a major impact on smaller insectivores and honeyeaters. Effects of parasites and disease have barely been studied in Australia, though brood parasitism could account for local losses. Dieback of eucalypts and loss of understorey are common in fragmented and degraded landscapes and are associated with a greatly reduced diversity of birds. The effect of fragmentation and degradation on food has received minimal attention. We propose further research that tests the importance of some of these ecological processes in causing the decline and loss of bird species in agricultural woodlands. Although management should proceed immediately, including a cessation of any further clearing of native vegetation, it should be conducted in conjunction with research. We suggest how the findings of research can inform managers, which will make management more effective in achieving conservation of regional avifaunas.

Whelan, Christopher J.				Ecology (Washington D C)	82	1		219-231	January 2001	2001				English	2	35	Preferences for foraging in particular tree species have been well documented in a variety of bird species, but underlying reasons remain little investigated. Understanding the causal bases for such patterns of habitat use can help to elucidate mechanisms of habitat selection and, therefore, community organization and structure. I experimentally tested the hypothesis that fine-scale foliage structure of two deciduous tree species influences the foraging behavior of three small, insectivorous bird species. On sugar maple (Acer saccharum), with its orbicular levels elevated above the branch, Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens) and American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) captured prey predominantly from lower leaf surfaces, whereas Black-throated Green Warblers (Dendroica virens) captured prey predominantly from upper leaf surfaces. In contrast, on yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), with its oblong-ovate leaves held within the plane of the supporting branch, all three bird species captured prey disproportionately from upper leaf surfaces. Overall, aerial maneuvers were used more frequently to capture prey from upper than from lower leaf surfaces on sugar maple, but the opposite occurred on yellow birch, where non-aerial maneuvers were used more frequently to capture prey from upper than from lower leaf surfaces. Those results indicate that the leaf surface from which prey are more easily captured (with less energetically costly non-aerial maneuvers) differs between those tree species. Experimental manipulation of leaf dispersion and distance to prey demonstrated that leaf dispersion is the chief determinant of prey capture location (upper vs. lower leaf surfaces), and that distance to prey is the chief determinant of prey capture maneuver (aerial vs. non-aerial). When foraging on artificial branches in which vertical distance between branches was systematically increased experimentally, Black-throated Green Warblers captured a significantly smaller proportion of prey from lower surfaces of leaves on the upper branch than did Black-throated Blue Warblers. Taken together, these results indicate that different tree species, as well as different locations within tree species, present insectivorous birds with distinct foraging environments and, therefore, constitute distinct foraging microhabitats. Furthermore, even closely related bird species that are generally similar morphologically respond in behaviorally unique ways to differences in foliage structure. For those reasons, forest management practices that enhance tree species diversity could concomitantly enhance foraging opportunities (niche diversity) for forest insectivores and may thus help to promote high bird species diversity and maintain abundant populations.

Juni, Sarah; Berry, Charles R.				Proceedings of the South Dakota Academy of Science	80			185-200	2001	2001				English	1	7	Wetland mitigation is the practice of avoiding, reducing, or compensating for human-caused impacts to wetlands. Compensatory mitigation in South Dakota usually consists of creating, restoring, or enhancing wetlands. Wetland restoration and creation can be successful in the Prairie Pothole Region, but few studies have assessed wetlands that were used for compensatory mitigation. Our objective was to compare biodiversity among restored, created, enhanced, and natural wetlands in eastern South Dakota. We used a rapid biodiversity assessment technique to determine bird, fish, amphibian and reptile, mammal, and aquatic invertebrate species richness and bird and aquatic invertebrate species diversity in 17 compensatory and natural wetlands. The wetlands were sampled twice each summer in 1999 and 2000. There were few statistically or biologically significant differences in biodiversity among wetland types or sample times. Aquatic invertebrate taxa richness was significantly different among some wetland types (F=3.54, df=3, P=0.0268); there were more invertebrate taxa in restored than in created or enhanced wetlands and more in natural wetlands than in created wetlands. Though not statistically signifi- cant, there appeared to be more bird species in restored than in other wetland types and more fish species in created than in natural wetlands. The similarities among wetland types for several animal groups indicate that compensation wetlands have biodiversity comparable to one another and to natural wetlands. These findings disagree with studies in other regions that showed limited success of compensatory mitigation wetlands. However, compared to studies of restored and created prairie wetlands not used for mitigation, it is clear that the wetlands we evaluated support the normal faunal assemblages in this region.

Buskness, Natoma A.; Murphy, Robert K.; Higgins, Kenneth F.; Jenks, Jonathan				Proceedings of the South Dakota Academy of Science	80			247-258	2001	2001				English	0	8	To help sustain prairie wildlife habitat on privately owned lands in North Dakota, prescribed rotational grazing (RG) systems have been implemented as part of the Prairie Pothole Joint Venture (PPJV) of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. However, impacts of these systems on nongame breeding birds are unmeasured. During 1996 and 1997 we assessed the relative abundance, species richness, and habitat of breeding birds especially passerines on five PPJV-prescribed RG pastures in central and northwestern North Dakota. Each RG pasture was paired with a nearby traditional, continuous- grazed (CG) pasture for comparison. Using 5-minute point counts on 100-m radius plots to survey breeding birds, we recorded 30 species in 1996 and 29 species in 1997. We detected no differences in relative abundance or species richness between grazing regimes in 1996 (P = 0.29 and 0.58), but relative abundance and species richness were greater on RG pastures than on CG pastures in 1997 (P = 0.08 and 0.04), a relatively dry year. A group of five species (savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Baird's sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii)) considered sensitive to heavy grazing in previous studies had a higher collective mean abundance on RG than on CG in 1997 ([overhead single bar]x = 4.29 and 2.75 breeding pairs/point count, P = 0.03). Litter depth also was greater on RG than on CG in 1997 (x= 2.4 and 1.4 cm, P = 0.04). PPJV grazing systems help conserve nativeprairie by improving its economic viability without diminishing habitat values for grassland passerines, and in dry years may enhance breeding bird habitatcompared to that on traditional grazing systems especially for grazing-sensitive species such as bobolink and Baird's sparrow.

Waarnemingen van roofvogels op de grens van primair regenwoud in Zuidoost-Nigeria.	Bijlsma, Rob G.				Takkeling	9	3		235-262	2001	2001				Dutch	0	9	From 31 January through 24 February 2001, the vicinity of Ebbaken (6[degree]38[minute]N, 9[degree]05[minute]E, Boji-Ebok village complex, Cross River State, southeastern Nigeria) was visited to trap and study Barn Swallows Hirundo rustica at the huge roost (1.0-1.5 million birds) in elephant grass Pennisetum in the foothills of Afi Mountain. The area is wedged in between the primary rainforest of Afi Mountain and the high forest with small plantations and fields in the nearby valleys and hills. It is fairly thinly populated, although human impact is increasing (farming, hunting, clear-cuts, selective logging, bush fires). During much of the period, the Harmattan was blowing (steady winds with force 3-4 B), which -together with smoke from bush fires-reduced visibility to 800-1500 m in February. Temperatures during daytime ranged between 31 and 40[degree]C in the shade. Raptors were observed from a high vantage point in the foothills about 3 km from Ebbaken during 82 hours between 31 January and 21 February (Table 4); time of the day, species, sex and age, moult, individual plumage characteristics and behaviour were recorded. The area covered from this vantage point encompassed c. 600 ha, measuring some 2x3 km of mainly high forest backed by the primary rainforest of Afi Mountain. During swallow trapping, i.e. the first and last 1-5 hours of daylight each day, systematic observations were kept of avian predator activities and hunting success of species involved (mainly African Hobby Falco cuvieri). At least 12 raptor species showed territorial and/or nesting behaviour in the 600 ha observation area (Table 2). Many pairs had apparently recently finished breeding (end of the dry period) and were seen with fledglings or begging juveniles. Highest densities were reached by African Cuckoo-falcon Aviceda cuculoides, Red-necked Buzzard Buteo auguralis and African Harrier-hawk Polyboroides typus (nearest neighbour distances of 800-1000 min the latter). The majority of raptor species seen involved local birds, but several Palearctic migrants were also present, i.e. Western Honey-buzzard Pernis apivorus (34 observations, regarding at least 20 individuals among which 7 adult males, 4 adult females, 1 2nd-year female with green-yellow cere and yellow iris and 14 juveniles; a detailed description of this important wintering site is given in Bijlsma in prep.), Western Marsh-harrier Circus aeruginosus (adult male present at swallow roost in early morning hours of 4-18 February, predating on departing swallows and probably roosting in local Pennisetum fields) and Booted Eagle Hieraaetus pennatus (light phase with moult in outermost primaries seen 17, 18 and 20 February, dark phase moulting in primaries, secondaries and rectrices seen on 13 and 20 February; both showing large home ranges and restricted to valleys). The Pennisetum-fields (c. 25 ha surveyed intensively) were also much favoured by other Palearctic migrants like Nightingales Luscinia megarhynchos (full song and calls in early morning of tens of individuals, 1 trapped), Great Reed Warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus (>5 singing, several trapped), European Reed Warblers A. scirpaceus (4 trapped), Whinchats Saxicola rubetra (>100, of which 26 trapped), Willow Warblers Phylloscopus trochilus (100s present, 24 trapped), Garden Warblers Sylvia borin (1 trapped), Yellow Wagtails Motacilla flava (150-400 roosting in Pennisetum, 3 trapped), Tree Pipits Anthus trivialis (tens present, 2 trapped), Sand Martins Riparia riparia (I trapped, few among Barn Swallows) and Red-rumped Swallows Hirundo daurica (2 trapped, ditto). Near Camp II in the bushes bordering the Pennisetum-fields, a territorial Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata and ditto Melodious Warbler Hippolais polyglotta were present. For reasons of comparison, the results of a road count from Lagos to Ogoja (densely populated) are presented in Table 1. During this road survey, generalist raptors commensal with human activities dominated the scenery, especially Yellow-billed Kites Milvus migrans parasitus and Hooded Vultures Necrosyrtes monachus. This is very different from the raptor fauna near Afi Mountain in southeastern Nigeria (thinly populated), as shown by the following overview of raptors observed there. African Cuckoo-falcon Aviceda cuculoides: 3 territories located on 600 ha, with persistent calling from each in early morning and late afternoon. Bat Hawk Machaeramphus alcinus: a single observation at dawn on 12 February, when bats were still abundant both at low and high altitudes. The bird was flying high in a southwesterly direction, probably heading for its roost. Yellow-billed Kite Milvus migrans parasitus: one of the commoner species (Table 2, 4), typically associated with human activities (village) and bush fires. The first to show up when the Pennisetum fields caught fire on 7 February, feeding on fleeing insects and small mammals. On later days, one bird was seen with scorched rectrices. At the end of the Hannattan, when the weather changed and cloud formation started, some movements were noticed on 18 and 19 February (for example, 4 heading NNE on 18 February), together with large numbers of Swifts Apus apus and Palm Swifts Cypsirius parvus. Palearctic Black Kites M. m. migrans were not recorded. Palm-nut Vulture Gypohierax angolensis: probably local breeding bird. Two adults, 1 immature and 1 juvenile roosted in the hills nearby. Departure from the roost was well before sunrise (Table 3), the birds passing already at a considerable height using flapping flight and gliding. The birds returned in late afternoon. During daytime, several observations were made of birds of unknown identity (same as roosting birds?) (Table 4).Snake Eagle Circaetus sp.: seen on 16 and 20 February, but specific identity unknown. African Harrier-hawk Polyboroides typus pectoralis: the commonest species observed, with at least 6 pairs on 600 ha of high forest interspersed with small cultivated fields. Two pairs were accompanied by a juvenile and a begging juvenile, respectively. Between 11 and 13 hrs local time, most pairs intensively displayed, showing elaborate undulating and meandering flights at medium and great heights. Wings were partly contracted during steep dives and upward swoops (sometimes followed by a sideways roll or looping at its zenith), with the hand performing 4-6 fast and shallow wing beats. Display flights were highly visible, even with the naked eye at long distance. Sometimes, displays were accompanied by a repeated high, bisyllabic 'he-heeee'. The begging call of the recently fled youngster was also two-toned, but with a throaty first part and a high, short-pitched second part: 'gjuuu-le'. Red-chested Goshawk Accipiter toussenelii: more Sparrowhawk- than Goshawk-like. A second calender-year male was caught during swallow trapping on 11 February 2001. Measurements, mass and colouration of soft parts are detailed in Table 5. The differences in tail-banding between a first- and second-year bird can clearly be seen from Photographs 4 and 5; see also moult scores in Table 6. An adult female was seen still-hunting from cover bordering cultivated fields, using perch heights of 3-6 m, on 17 February. Black Sparrowhawk Accipiter melanoleucus: distinctly Goshawk-like in appearance and behaviour, not Sparrowhawk-like. Two pairs and solitary birds were seen soaring in late morning (Table 4), the pairs displaying exclusive territories. A juvenile focused on chickens during hunts at Ebbaken, making dashes from the forest at the edge of the village. Presumably this juvenile was captured and eaten by villagers on 7 February. An adult female showed moult in the centre of her left secondaries on 19 February. Shikra Accipiter badius: a male was caught during swallow trapping on 18 February, almost having completed its moult from first- to second-year plumage (compare old outermost rectrices with fresh other tail-feathers; Photographs 6 and 7). Measurements, mass and colouration of soft parts are given in Table 7. Lizard Buzzard Kaupifalco monogrammicus: almost entirely restricted to edges of high forest on hill sides near Ebbaken, with only a single pair in the study plot of 600 ha. Most recordings refer to calling individuals. Red-necked Buzzard Buteo auguralis: highly territorial within 200 m from nest sites. One pair was tending a nestling of 16-17 days old (16 February: primaries just emerging from blood shafts) on an old Yellow-billed Kite nest in a huge cotton wood. Feeding times were 8.59, 10.45, 12.08 and 14.47 hr (6 February: between 8.00 and 16.00 hrs), 9.32, 10.10, 11.41 and 13.49 hr (16 February, between 8.00 and 15.00 hrs) and 11.12, 11.22 and 13.08 hr (19 February, between 10.00 and 14.00 hrs). Identified prey items were lizards (2x) and cane rat (lx). Other pairs were present with begging fledged juveniles. Wahlberg's Eagle Aquila wahlbergi: two pairs resided in the 600 ha plot, activities above tree-level being confined to the few hours around noun (Table 4). Parallel flights of both pairs were frequently seen, indicating exclusive home ranges. Display, seen on 1 February, is reminiscent of that of Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina, with steep undulations at great heights accompanied by a high-pitched, hoarse 'cheee-cheeeeee'. African Hobby Falco cuvieri: the swallow roost attracted many African Hobbies (up to 7 seen simultaneously), but numbers declined after bush fires had destroyed large sections of Pennisetum on 7 February and the swallows started to switch to another site near Enyi. In late February, when only 100s of Barn Swallows were still using the Ebbaken-site, the local breeding pair with one juvenile was still in attendance. Activities of African Hobbies peaked from just before swallow departure/arrival till the majority of swallows had left the roost or had settled. The birds used several hunting strategies: low quartering, very low speeding, cruising at medium heights and diving, hot pursuits at low level or in mid-air, and cooperative hunting. During daytime, observations were less frequent, involving birds soaring at great heights. Once an African Hobby was observed while catching insects in mid-air (2 successful catches in 4 minutes, 20 February, 11.13 hr), suggesting a mainly vertebrate diet. Despite careful observations, European Hobbies Falco subbuteo were not recorded.Lanner Falcon Falco biarmicus: an adult was recorded on 21 February near Enyi, a village close to Ebbaken, with extensive Pennisetum areas to which the swallow roost had switched after fires had raked important sections of the roost near Ebbaken. The raptor fauna near Afi Mountain shows distinct characteristics of high forest in transition from primary to secondary forest. Typical raptor species of primary rainforest were not recorded (probably partly because of biased method of recording, with insufficient attention and inadequate census methods for primary rainforest), whereas species typical of secondary rainforest abounded (Tables 2 and 4). With an increasing pressure from human settlement, including increase in number of farms, frequency and extent of bush fires, logging and hunting, the raptor fauna will continue to change. The high density and species composition of the raptor fauna lend further support to the need of active protection of the Afi River Forest Reserve and its surroundings. The importance of this area, as shown by the presence of populations of Mountain Gorilla Gorilla gorilla, Drill Mandrillus leucophaeus, Chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, Grey-necked Picathartes Picathartes oreas and many turaco species (including the Great Blue Turaco Corythaeola cristata), is also clearly shown by the diverse raptor fauna. The high density of Honey Buzzards Pernis apivorus associated with high forest also has serious consequences for our conception of its habitat requirements in Africa, and the possible impact of rainforest destruction on its winter survival and population dynamics.

Wildlife Research	28	1		17-31	2001	2001				English	2	9	This study investigated the effects of habitat clearance and fragmentation on birds of coastal heathlands in subtropical eastern Australia. Abundance and species composition were compared among two types of cleared habitat (residential suburbs and sugar cane cropland) and four sizes of heathland remnant (1-2 ha, 5-10 ha, 20-50 ha and [>]500 ha) in summer and winter. Cleared land contained a distinctly different bird species assemblage from heathland remnants. Residential sites contained a distinct suite of species consistent with that described for 'open/developed land' habitat elsewhere in the region. In contrast, cane cropland supported very few species. Heathland remnants [>]500 ha contained high densities of 'natural-vegetation-dependent' species, whereas species of open/developed land were absent. Remnants of 1-2 ha had lowered densities of many natural-vegetation-dependent species, and a relatively high abundance of open/developed land species. Some of the avifaunal differences in the [>]500-ha remnants and 5-50-ha range are probably due to confounding of remnant size with habitat, resulting from selective clearing of the landscape. Most of the heathland birds were intolerant of the matrix habitat (residential and cane cropland), but tolerant of decreased remnant area, down to a threshold of about 5 ha. However, the distinctive floristic associations of heathland vegetation are dependent on an environmental regime (low nutrient, low pH, fire, in some cases inundation) that is unlikely to persist in remnants tens of hectares in size, and longer-term declines in heathland birds, are predicted.

We selected the five most representative environments: a coihue-roble forest (CRF), a pure lenga forest (PLF), a shrub-coihue sapling (CS), a nirre shrub (NS) and the Niblinto River (NR). In the CRF we registered 27 species being the Thorn-tailed Rayadito, White- crested Elaenia and Green-backed Firecrown the most frequent. In this habitat, we detected four species with conservation concern: Chilean Pigeon, Magellanic Woodpecker, Rufous-legged Owl and Chilean Bicolored Hawk. In the PLF we observed 10 species being Thorn-tailed Rayadito and Blue and White Swallow odominants. Twenty species were found in the CS being the Black-chinned Siskin dominant. In the NS we discovered 18 species being Thorn-tailed Rayadito the most frequent. Within this habitat, we registered five exclusive species: Bar-winged Cinclodes, Cinnamon-bellied Ground Tyrant, Ochre-naped Ground Tyrant, Rufous-backed Negrito and Yellow-bridled Finch. Along the Niblinto River we detected 10 species being Black-crowned Night Heron, Torrent Duck and Dark-bellied Cinclodes typical river-dwelling. The CFR, vegetationally the most complex, habitat had also the highest in bird richness. Total number of species was 41. In adittion, we added new occasional records of birds made in later expeditions, giving a total of 63 species for this Andean site.

Miller, James R.; Cale, Peter				Ecological Applications	10	6		1732-1748	December 2000	2000				English	0	41	Effective conservation and habitat restoration strategies in human-dominated landscapes must be based on an understanding of the ways that habitat loss and fragmentation affect native species. We studied avian foraging behavior and patterns of occurrence in the highly fragmented agricultural landscape of the Kellerberrin district of Western Australia to better understand the factors underlying species declines and losses. We conducted three surveys of 30 wandoo woodland patches that ranged in size from 1.3 to 101.3 ha. Some patches were part of larger remnants of native vegetation, ranging in size from 3.5 to 1204.8 ha and including other habitat types. We examined the extent to which patterns of species richness, the occurrence and composition of foraging guilds, and the occurrence of individual species varied with features of woodland patches, remnants, and the surrounding landscape. Using multiple regression analyses, the best model for species richness included terms for the log of remnant area, the patch diversity of each remnant, and woodland patch condition. We delineated eight foraging guilds based on similarities in the substrate/method dimension and also using multidimensional scaling analyses. The best model for the number of foraging guilds present in a patch included a single variable representing shrub density. Analyses of nestedness based on guilds and on individual species were both significant; and for the latter, 11 of 13 species made a significant contribution to the overall pattern. We derived separate models for the occurrence of each of eight species and one guild using multiple logistic regression. Significant models included, either separately or in combination, the following variables: the log of remnant area, patch area, the total area of woodland in a remnant, and the distance to other woodland patches. For four species that had sufficient records to examine shifts in foraging behavior, we observed significant differences in both foraging methods and substrates with changes in remnant size and/or the presence of other species or guilds. Our analyses indicated that remnant area was the best single variable for measures of community structure, in part because it was strongly correlated with other variables, such as total woodland area, patch area, remnant patch diversity, number of corridor connections, and measures of isolation. For foraging guilds and for individual species, variables other than remnant area assumed greater importance. The strong patterns of nestedness for foraging guilds by remnant area may reflect the diminished availability of certain prey items in small, degraded remnants. This notion is reinforced by the relatively high species and guild richness recorded in small patches that were either fenced from grazing or embedded in large remnants. The nested pattern of species within some foraging guilds, however, indicates the importance of additional aspects of their ecology. A focus on richness alone may mask the unique responses of bird species to fragmentation and may divert attention from important considerations in the development of land-use policy and reserve acquisition.

Leslie, David M., Jr; Wood, G. Keith; Carter, Tracy S.				Southwestern Naturalist	45	4		483-489	December 2000	2000				English	0	5	We monitored breeding activities of endangered least terns (Sterna antillarum athalassos) to determine effects of hydropower and flood-control operations of Keystone Dam on the 94 km of the Arkansas River from Tulsa to Muskogee, Oklahoma. Our objectives were to determine numbers and productivity of least terns and flow management needs to reduce losses of nests and chicks from flooding and enhance nesting habitat. After breeding colonies of least terns were located, nest locations were mapped from 19 May to 26 August 1992 and 14 May to 30 August 1993. Both years had periodic high flows on the Arkansas River. Unlike 1992, bank-full flows in May 1993 reached a discharge of [>]140,000 cfs (cubic feet per second) through Keystone Dam before least terns initiated nesting. Flows in 1993 scoured and elevated existing sandbars and created new sandbars, resulting in an expansion of nesting habitat that was associated with an increase from 12 breeding colonies in 1992 to 20 colonies in 1993. Estimates of adult least terns increased from 125-166 breeding pairs in 1992 to 212-299 in 1993. Least terns produced 192 nests, 118 chicks, and 80 fledglings in 1992 compared with 345 nests, 285 chicks, and 143 fledglings in 1993. Loss of nests to flooding was greater in 1992 (46% of 77 nests lost) than 1993 (9% of 133 nests lost). Overall loss of chicks was greater in 1993 (50%) than 1992 (32%). Benefit to nesting habitats by periodic high flows before the nesting period was exemplified by a larger population of least terns and fewer losses of nests and chicks to flooding in 1993 than 1992 along the Arkansas River below Keystone Dam.

Field observations were conducted at three forested locations on coastal cheniers for three years (1993-95) in the spring and at one location for three years (1996-98) in autumn to determine species presence and diet. One hundred and twenty-eight species were present during the spring and 103 species in autumn. The majority of these species were migrants (103 species in spring and 89 species in autumn) and the majority of these were Nearctic/Neotropical species (73 species in spring and 66 species in autumn). The diet of these migrants was more variable than expected. Many insectivorous species were observed to consume seeds, fruit and nectar as well as insects. Because of these varied diets, many species serve as seed dispersers, occasional pollinators and important predators of herbivorus insects. Wooded areas were found to be important in providing food, cover and water for migrating species. A review of historical changes in the landscape of this area is presented and management practices designed to restore wooded habitat to this area are proposed.	Barrow, Wylie C., Jr; U. S.

Forest Ecology and Management	136	1-3		121-134	1 October 2000	2000				English	2	29	Timber harvest projections for aspen-dominated forests in the prairie region of Canada include a truncation of the current age distribution, whereby old stands of fire origin will become rarer on the landscape, while young, post-harvest stands will increase in abundance. To determine the effects this harvesting strategy might have on communities of breeding forest birds, we conducted point counts in young forests regenerated from clear-cutting (15-25 years), and mature (50-60 years), and old (80-110 years) forests regenerated from fire. Avian species richness was highest in old stands at the point-count station, forest stand, and landscape level. Increased species richness with forest age was associated with increases in the relative abundance of canopy- and cavity-nesting species. At local scales (station and stand), species richness of ground- and shrub-nesting birds was similar among forest age-classes. However, as determined by rarefaction analyses appropriate at the landscape scale, ground-nesting species were more common in young and old forests, while shrub-nesting species were more common in young and mature forests. Density of deciduous shrubs was an important factor influencing the abundance of species like American redstart, Canada warbler, and chestnut-sided warbler. An increase in conifer in old stands resulted in greater use by conifer- or mixedwood associated species such as bay-breasted warbler, magnolia warbler, and ruby-crowned kinglet. Our data indicate that vegetation and structural characteristics such as shrub density should be considered when prescribing sustainable forestry objectives.

Eraud, C.; Boutin, J.M.; Roux, D.				Game & Wildlife Science	17	3		147-163	September 2000	2000				English	0	0	We studied the breeding habitat of the skylark, Alauda arvensis, in the Sault and Saint-Christol d'Albion districts of the Vaucluse departement (France) between May and July in 1996 and April and June in 1998. In 1996, the density of breeding pairs and the sizes of their territories were determined by a territory mapping method in four sampling areas, each about 100 ha in size. In 1998, we investigated 46 listening points in two sampling regions, 600 and 1,000 ha in size. The number of breeding pairs per listening point and 11 environmental variables within a 250-m radius circle around the listening point were recorded. Correspondence analysis of the data obtained at the listening points and circles showed that skylarks were more abundant in the cultivated habitats, where the landscape was more open. The density of breeding pairs was 0.73 to 3.68 pairs per 10 ha from May to July 1996, depending on the sampling area. The absence of hedges in one of the sampling areas was associated with a relatively low density (1.74 pairs/10 ha). The highest density of breeding pairs was recorded in a sampling area in which 32% of the usable agricultural land was left fallow. The density of breeding pairs was also calculated for each type of habitat. The density of breeding pairs was highest in fallow land (4.2 pairs/10 ha), then in sage (3.7 pairs/10 ha), lavender (2.86 pairs/10 ha), hay meadows (0.75 pairs/10 ha), winter cereals (0.68 pairs/10 ha) and wooded sward (0.29 pairs/10 ha). Unweeded lavender, which accommodated a variety of herbaceous plants between the rows, was more attractive to birds than weeded lavender. A comparison of land use and availability (Jacobs' index) revealed that the birds showed an increasing aversion to hay meadows, winter cereals and wooded sward from May to July. This aversion is probably associated with the increasing height of the vegetation. Conversely, the observed preference of the skylarks for fallow land, lavender, legumes and sage is associated with the requirement of herbaceous plants, 15 to 25 cm high, for nesting and rearing of the young. The size of territory of a breeding pair was negatively correlated with habitat diversity (Shannon-Weaver index of diversity) in one sampling area, but not in the other three. This shows that crop type affected the nesting behaviour of the breeding pairs. We recommend that habitats favourable to skylarks, such as fallow and sage, should be developed and that lavender fields should not be weeded, to help increase the density of skylarks and to decrease soil erosion.

Whitlock near Wilson Inlet in the period 1905-19 (mostly 1907, 1909 and 1910), hitherto unpublished, were collated from museum specimens and archives. Whitlock noted 94 species comprising 65 landbirds, 10 waterbirds, 7 seabirds, and 12 non-breeding waders. Records of bird species made by other ornithologists from 1889 to 1913 indicate that the original avifauna of this region comprised 81 landbird species. In the past century four of these species (Burhinus grallarius, Pezoporus wallicus, Atrichornis clamosus and Dasyornis longirostris), as well as the waterbird Ixobrychus flavicollis, appear to have become locally extinct. Deforestation for agricultural development, with the subsequent creation of parkland and pasture, has allowed 10 landbird and 8 waterbird species to colonize the area. Whitlock's records of the seabird species Eudyptula minor and Pterodroma macroptera nesting on islands in Wilson Inlet are otherwise unreported in the literature. A comprehensive synthesis of eyewitness accounts of Aboriginal burning practices in the period 1791-1840 indicates that anthropogenic fire was frequent, prevalent in summer, and spatially extensive but in patches varying in area from c. 10-2000 ha, with a tendency for riparian vegetation to be burnt less often than uplands. Such fires could be set at the hottest part of the day, with multiple ignitions on the one day, and under windy conditions. Three bird species that are sensitive to frequent fire and now considered to be extinct locally are presumed to have had patchy distributions confined to those limited parts of the landscape naturally protected from frequent burning (vegetation along higher order streams, on steep south-facing slopes, or surrounded by expanses of granite).

Lindenmayer, David B.; Margules, Chris R.; Botkin, Daniel B.				Conservation Biology	14	4		941-950	August 2000	2000				English	13	271	The conservation of biological diversity has become one of the important goals of managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. Ecologists and forest resource managers need measures to judge the success or failure of management regimes designed to sustain biological diversity. The relationships between potential indicator species and total biodiversity are not well established. Carefully designed studies are required to test relationships between the presence and abundance of potential indicator species and other taxa and the maintenance of critical ecosystem processes in forests. Other indicators of biological diversity in forests, in addition or as alternatives to indicator species, include what we call structure-based indicators. These are stand-level and landscape-level (spatial) features of forests such as stand structural complexity and plant species composition, connectivity, and heterogeneity. Although the adoption of practices to sustain (or recreate) key characteristics of forest ecosystems appear intuitively sensible and broadly consistent with current knowledge, information is lacking to determine whether such stand- and landscape-level features of forests will serve as successful indices of (and help conserve) biodiversity. Given our limited knowledge of both indicator species and structure-based indicators, we advocate the following four approaches to enhance biodiversity conservation in forests: (1) establish biodiversity priority areas (e.g., reserves) managed primarily for the conservation of biological diversity; (2) within production forests, apply structure-based indicators including structural complexity, connectivity, and heterogeneity; (3) using multiple conservation strategies at multiple spatial scales, spread out risk in wood production forests; and (4) adopt an adaptive management approach to test the validity of structure-based indices of biological diversity by treating management practices as experiments.

Vander Haegen, W. Matthew; Dobler, Frederick C.; Pierce, D. John				Conservation Biology	14	4		1145-1160	August 2000	2000				English	1	31	The landscape of the intermountain west has changed dramatically in the last 150 years, particularly in the state of Washington, where over half the native shrubsteppe ecosystem has been converted to agricultural lands, resulting in a fragmented landscape with few extensive tracts of shrubsteppe. We examined the historical and current distribution of shrubsteppe on different soil types in eastern Washington, and we censused bird communities at 78 sites in shrubsteppe from 1991 to 1993. We compared abundance of species among soil types and range conditions and developed models of species occurrence using site-specific vegetation and landscape variables. The pattern of shrubsteppe conversion has resulted in a disproportionate loss of deep soil communities. Eight bird species showed strong relationships with soil type and three with range condition. These associations likely resulted from the influence of soil type and range history on the vegetation of these communities. Brewer's Sparrows (Spizella breweri) and Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli) reached their highest abundances in deep, loamy soils, whereas Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) were most abundant in deep, sandy soils. Sage Sparrows occurred more frequently in landscapes dominated by shrubsteppe, indicating a negative relationship with fragmentation. Our results suggest that fragmentation of shrubsteppe and the pattern of agricultural conversion among soil types have had detrimental effects on numerous shrubsteppe species. The landscape for species with an affinity for deep, loamy soil communities has changed considerably more than the overall loss of shrubsteppe would indicate. Conservation practices that emphasize retention of shrubsteppe communities on deep soils and that reduce further fragmentation will be critical to the maintenance of avian biological diversity in this system.

Mason, C.F.; Macdonald, S.M.				Journal of Zoology (London)	251	3		339-348	July 2000	2000				English	3	36	The relationships between landscape, land-use and the number of territories of eight species of birds, most with declining populations, were studied over 3 years in an area of largely arable agriculture in eastern England. Two species, skylark Alauda arvensis and yellow wagtail Motacilla flava, established territories within crops. More than half of skylark territories were in autumn-sown cereals, but densities were higher in set-aside and spring-sown crops, while a conservation grassland cut for hay in late July held the highest density. Skylarks did not switch territories in winter cereals for other crops as the breeding season progressed. Weak preferences were found for spring-sown crops and weak avoidance of autumn-sown crops (i.e. there were fewer territories than expected from the area under autumn-sown crops). Skylarks showed preferences for set-aside and conservation grassland but other grassland was avoided. Skylark numbers were negatively associated with hedgerow length within tetrads. Most yellow wagtails nested in spring-sown crops, especially potatoes, for which there was a strong preference; most territories were in the largest fields. More than 75% of territories of turtle dove Streptopelia turtur were associated with residential areas, scrub and woodland, with hedges used much less often than expected from their occurrence. Grass was a strongly preferred land-use. Linnets Carduelis cannabina were mainly located in small areas of scrub and there was an association with winter oil-seed rape. Common whitethroats Sylvia communis showed preferences for hedges, especially for tall hedges, though many territories were situated in field boundaries with only scattered shrubs. Lesser whitethroats S. curruca preferred only tall hedges. Both species had more territories adjacent to grass than expected, with common whitethroat also showing a preference for winter oil-seed rape. Yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella declined over the 3 years of the study.

Wardell-Johnson, G.; Williams, M.				Forest Ecology and Management	131	1-3		1-21	1 June 2000	2000				English	2	24	The impact of logging operations on bird species abundance and diversity was studied over an eight-year period using a variable-circular plot bird survey procedure and a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design in karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forest in south-western Australia. The magnitude and spatial extent of impact was assessed from sample points in five bands parallel to the edge between clearfelled areas and mature forest (unburnt-forest, burnt-forest, forest-edge, gap-edge and gap). A total of 24 748 birds of 53 species were detected within 30 m of the observer during the study. Bird species abundance, and diversity, were similar in the five bands prior to treatment, and observed differences could be attributed to spatial patterns of flowering in the overstorey. Following logging, 19 of the 40 species that were detected more than five times showed changes in relative abundance (including both, increases and decreases) in one or more bands. Gaps showed the greatest number of significant changes (15) and these were typically of the greatest magnitude over the four years studied post-treatment. Gap-edges showed fewer changes (six), while both, the burnt-forest (three) and forest-edge (nil) bands showed few changes in relative abundance. Both, the number of species detected (for a given sampling effort), and species diversity declined in gap and gap-edge bands following logging. Nevertheless, variation in bird counts between successive seasons and years necessitates considerable replication before changes can be reliably assigned to disturbance impacts. In addition, the long period before maturation of the overstorey suggests that the local impact of logging and burning is likely to extend well beyond the life of experimental studies. Our results support the implementation of a well-dispersed system of retained mature forest along road, river and stream zones within the regeneration mosaic.

Passell, Howard D.				Restoration Ecology	8	2		112-118	June 2000	2000				English	1	18	Bird species richness and individual abundances were recorded in old, unrestored tin strip mine plots, in mined plots restored 1, 2, and 3 years before the study, and in adjacent, unmined, natural secondary forest plots on the 11,340-km2 Indonesian island of Bangka (2degreeS, 106degreeE). The objective was to assess the ecological recovery of unrestored and minimally restored mine plots compared with surrounding reference forest. Unrestored mines had not been mined or used for any other purpose for 14-30 years; plots in their first, second, and third year since restoration were old mines planted with Acacia mangium (Leguminosae) at a density of 400 trees/ha. Natural secondary forest plots 20 or more years since the last disturbance were immediately adjacent to both unrestored and restored plots. Bird surveys on 4-ha plots were performed during the 1995 breeding season. A comparison of data from unrestored plots of widely varying ages showed no significant differences among them for species richness, diversity (Shannon-Wiener index, H'), or individual abundance, indicating that little natural bird community recovery had occurred over time in the plots. However, increases did occur in restored sites over only 3 years for both species richness (r2 = 0.29, p = 0.04) and diversity (r2 = 0.45, p = 0.009). All values for third-year restored plots, however, were still significantly lower than corresponding values for adjacent natural secondary forest plots. The quick return of bird activity on the plots after minimal efforts at restoration supports the idea that simple, inexpensive restoration can be effective for "jump starting" degraded systems at large scales. Such a restoration strategy might be of particular value for degraded land in developing nations, where scientific, professional, and financial resources might be in short supply.

Whitaker, Darroch M.; Carroll, Allan L.; Montevecchi, William A.				Canadian Journal of Zoology	78	5		740-747	May 2000	2000				English	1	37	We compared the abundances of flying insects along undisturbed lakeshores and riparian buffer strips in balsam fir (Abies balsamea) forests in western Newfoundland. Insects were collected in pan traps placed on the forest floor and tanglefoot (sticky) traps suspended within the live canopy. Significantly greater numbers of insects were captured in riparian buffer strips than in undisturbed shorelines for four of five size classes in the canopy and two of five size classes in the understory. Collections were dominated by adult Diptera and Hymenoptera. Mean capture rates along buffer strips were 120-200% of the mean capture rates along undisturbed shorelines. This increase was greatest for large-bodied insects. A likely explanation for our observations is that buffer strips act as windbreaks, collecting airborne insects blown in from adjacent clearcuts and lakes. This phenomenon has been widely documented in agricultural landscapes. Understory wind speed was generally greater along buffer strips than controls, which is a reflection of increased exposure caused by clear-cutting. A concurrent parallel study conducted at the same sites investigated the effects of riparian buffering on breeding bird assemblages. Ubiquitous insectivorous birds, including the yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) and blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata), were more abundant along buffer strips than undisturbed shorelines, possibly in response to increased prey availability. Increased food availability may in part explain the high numbers of insectivorous birds typically observed in riparian buffer strips in boreal forests.

King, David I.; DeGraaf, Richard M.				Forest Ecology and Management	129	1-3		227-235	17 April 2000	2000				English	1	24	Bird species distribution and predation rates on natural and artificial nests were compared among unmanaged mature, shelterwood, and clearcut northern hardwoods forest to evaluate the effect of these practices on bird populations. Twenty-three of the 48 bird species detected during the study differed significantly in abundance among unmanaged mature forest, shelterwoods, and clearcuts. Results of multiple regressions of bird abundance and habitat variables suggest that differences in bird species distribution among treatments were the result of differences in habitat structure among treatments. Bird species diversity and species richness were significantly higher in shelterwoods than either mature forest or clearcuts, although there were bird species that occurred exclusively, or nearly so, in each of the three treatments. Predation rates on artificial nests were lowest in mature forest, and predation rates on natural nests was highest in mature forest, although neither of these differences was statistically significant. We conclude that use of partial cutting exclusively would result in the decline of several species of mature forest and clearcut specialists, and, consequently, a decrease in species diversity at the landscape scale. The use of a variety of silvicultural techniques is recommended to maintain bird species diversity in forested landscapes.

Relations between habitat structure and home range size of the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius).		Pasinelli, Gilberto				Biological Conservation	93	2		227-235	April 2000	2000				English	1	21	Maintenance of viable populations requires detailed knowledge of a species' area demands and of the mechanisms influencing them. From 1992 to 1996, I examined, in northern Switzerland, the relations between habitat factors and home range size of 33 radio-tracked middle spotted woodpeckers (Dendrocopos medius), an endangered species confined to mature oak forests. Stepwise backward multiple regression revealed that home range size decreased from winter to late spring; furthermore, range size was inversely correlated to the densities of large oaks (gtoreq 36 cm dbh) and of potential cavity trees. Neither intra- nor interspecific competition seemed to influence home range size. Jackknife and cross-validation procedures indicated good predictive capability of the habitat model. Therefore, both the availability of large oaks, being related to potential food abundance, and of potential cavity trees, being related to reproduction, appear to be used as proximate cues to determine home range size. Management decisions concerning the endangered middle spotted woodpecker have focused on the conservation and promotion of large oaks; in the future they should consider the supply of trees suited for cavity excavation as well.

Soderstrom, Bo; Part, Tomas				Conservation Biology	14	2		522-533	April 2000	2000				English	1	36	Little attention has been paid to fragmentation effects on organisms living in open habitats in which species may have high mobility and generalized habitat use. We investigated landscape effects on 23 farmland bird species breeding in 72 semi-natural dry pastures distributed equally among three landscape types (agricultural-dominated, mosaic, and forest-dominated) in southcentral Sweden. There were generally higher local abundances of farmland birds in pastures located in agricultural-dominated and mosaic landscapes than in forest-dominated landscapes. Species feeding on a mixed diet as well as resident species and temperate migrants were most numerous in pastures located in agricultural-dominated landscapes and least numerous in forest-dominated landscapes. While controlling for the effects of local pasture area and vegetation structure, we found that the local abundance of 18 (78%) farmland bird species was significantly associated with the composition and structure of the surrounding landscape. The landscape distance that explained the largest part of local variation in abundance varied among species according to the size of their breeding territories or foraging home ranges. Our results suggest that habitat use of farmland birds breeding in pastures is affected both by suitable foraging habitats in the surrounding landscape and by nest sites within local pastures. Despite the generally higher abundances of farmland birds in pastures located in agricultural-dominated landscapes, most species of European and Swedish conservation concern had higher abundance in pastures located in more forested landscapes. Thus, the rapid loss of semi-natural dry pastures in forest-dominated landscapes is a serious threat to the future of these species in Sweden.

Cornelius, Cintia; Cofre, Hernan; Marquet, Pablo A.				Conservation Biology	14	2		534-543	April 2000	2000				English	1	27	We analyzed the structure and composition of a bird assemblage in a fragmented relict temperate forest located in northcentral Chile (Fray Jorge National Park). In terms of species composition, the bird assemblage we found in Fray Jorge was more similar to southern temperate forest sites, located more than 1200 km south of Fray Jorge, than to localities found in nearby scrub habitats. The relict character and long-term isolation of the Fray Jorge forest provides a natural experiment with which to establish the potential long-term effects of fragmentation and isolation on southern Chilean temperature forest. Between May 1996 and March 1997, we conducted seasonal surveys of birds in six forest fragments, ranging in size from 0.5 to 22.5 ha, at Fray Jorge. The number of bird species at each forest fragment was positively correlated with fragment area during all seasons. The relict forest system had a steeper species-area slope that reported for similar temperate-forest bird assemblages in forest fragments with Chiloe Island and for islands across the Chiloe Archipelago in southern Chile. In this regard, this bird fauna resembled a depauperate oceanic archipelago. This difference in area effects is likely a consequence of the minimization of rescue effects because of the absence of large source forest areas nearby and the long-term isolation of the system. In addition, the distribution of species among forest fragments in Fray Jorge was not random, showing a nested subset pattern. Thus, some species occur across all fragments, regardless of their area, and therefore are less affected by habitat fragmentation and less prone to local extinction. These results suggest that, for south-temperature forest birds, large fragments (or reserves) should afford better protection against extinction than small forest patches.

Mancke, Ralph G.; Gavin, Thomas A.				Ecological Applications	10	2		598-611	April 2000	2000				English	0	12	A model is presented that describes the breeding bird density of a species in a woodlot, given that this density may change from edge to interior. The primary variable is a measure of depth in the woodlot that depends on distances to four woodlot edges. The model applies to forest-interior species and to edge species, and it also accounts for different degrees of threat or attraction at different edges. During 1993-1996, we collected bird abundance data using point counts at 387 sample plots in 176 woodlots, including two big woods (>5000 ha), in eastern Pennsylvania, USA. Models were developed for 36 species by using nonlinear regression guided by tests of residuals against other variables measured at each sample plot. Densities of 20 of the 36 species were affected by the depth in the woodlot. The density of one forest-interior species, Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), decreased farther away from the big woods, which can be explained qualitatively by dispersal dynamics. Densities of 21 of the 36 species were affected by buildings near the woodlots: 10 species increased, and 11 decreased. One preliminary conservation conclusion is that it is important to preserve big woods (>5000 ha) because at least one common forest species (Ovenbird) might disappear from nearby woodlots if the big woods were to become fragmented. A second conservation conclusion is that certain species can persist only in the absence of nearby buildings. Perhaps these species would persist near buildings if the negative biotic interactions associated with buildings were removed, but more information is needed before this possibility can be evaluated. Our model-building procedure and statistical approach might be useful for modeling a number of variables concerning birds or other animals in various habitats where edge effects are important.

Henderson, Ian G.; Cooper, Jonathan; Fuller, Robert J.; Vickery, Juliet				Journal of Applied Ecology	37	2		335-347	April 2000	2000				English	0	38	1. Set-aside is arable land rested from normal intensive operations, usually providing, in summer, a relatively sparse, weedy or grass-dominated sward without pesticide or fertilizer inputs. Set-aside is therefore potentially attractive to breeding and foraging birds and is predicted to contribute to increased avian biodiversity on arable or mixed farmland. Set-aside mimics low intensity farmland within the heart of the industrial farm landscape, thereby allowing direct comparison with intensive crops regarding their respective values for the bird fauna. 2. In this study, bird abundance was compared between set-aside and nearby crops or grassland. A particular focus of the study was to identify the breadth or generality of any preferences across a suite of farmland species, using data from a broad representation of English farms. Thus, an extensive survey of birds utilizing fields, including set-aside, was conducted on 92 arable farms in England during 1996 and 1997. Each farm was visited four times in each summer, habitat details were recorded, and all birds seen or heard were mapped using a standard technique. 3. Field type preferences were examined across bird functional groups representing gamebirds, pigeons, crows, skylark Alauda arvensis, thrushes (Turdidae) and granivorous passerines (Passeridae, Fringillidae and Emberizidae). The relationship between bird abundance and field type was analysed using log-linear Poisson regression and compositional analysis. 4. Both analyses revealed that bird abundances were significantly higher on set-aside than on winter cereals for all six functional groups, and were highest on rotational set-aside for all functional groups except crows (which preferred grassland). Winter cereals or grassland were generally the least preferred habitat. 5.

Setterington, Michael A.; Thompson, Ian D.; Montevecchi, William A.				Journal of Wildlife Management	64	2		335-345	April 2000	2000				English	0	25	Availability of the oldest age-class of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) forest, the major forest type of western Newfoundland, is declining through logging, insect effects, and management for a 60-year harvest rotation. Loss of old-growth balsam fir forests may limit the availability of woodpecker habitat if nesting trees and feeding substrates are most abundant in these later successional stages. We assessed abundance of black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), downy woodpeckers (P. pubescens), and hairy woodpeckers (P. villosus) in 10 stands in each of 3 forest age classes (40-59, 60-79, and >80 yr) of balsam fir in western Newfoundland. For each stand, we quantified 10 habitat variables that may have influenced habitat use by woodpeckers. Black-backed woodpeckers were almost exclusively found in >80-year-old forests. Density of black-backed woodpeckers was significantly related to number of large snags, but negatively to the total number of dead stems. Downy woodpeckers were common and similarly distributed among the 3 forest age classes, and hairy woodpeckers were uncommon and only observed in the 40- and 60-year age classes. Downy and hairy woodpeckers were significantly associated with the number of white birch snags in the stands, a resource that declined with forest age. A reduction in the amount of forest in the oldest age class is probably reducing the population of black-backed woodpeckers in western Newfoundland. We recommend a series of fixed-width transects, coupled with point counts using call broadcasts, as an effective means of surveying woodpeckers. Forest managers must maintain large areas of old forests, temporally and spatially, to maintain black-backed woodpeckers in Newfoundland.	Setterington, Michael A.; AXYS Environmental Consulting, P.O.

Klop, Erik; Curio, Eberhard; Lastimoza, Lucia L.				Bird Conservation International	10	1		17-27	March 2000	2000				English	0	5	Monitoring of nests of the Visayan Tarictic Hornbill Penelopides panini panini on the Philippine island of Panay revealed thus far undescribed information on the breeding biology of this species. Females occupied nest holes in March-April, after which two or three eggs are laid. Although cooperative breeding is suspected for the genus, at two nests no helpers were recorded. Nest-concealment behaviour was observed in the adult male. After a nestling period of 55-58 days, the adult female and one juvenile left the nest simultaneously. Immature birds resemble their respective sex. Nest site characteristics of 24 nests of the Tarictic Hornbill and two of the Writhed-billed Hornbill Aceros waldeni, respectively, were recorded on Mt Balabag, Panay Mountain Range. Tarictic Hornbill nests were situated in living as well as dead trees, at an average height of 11 m. Cavity compass direction was uniformly distributed around the circle. Nests are aggregated within the habitat, with a mean nearest-neighbour distance of 190 m. Writhed-billed Hornbills may require larger trees for nesting than Tarictic Hornbills. Nest density was calculated to be around three Tarictic Hornbill nests and 0.2-0.3 Writhed-billed Hornbill nests per square kilometre. Given a total amount of suitable hornbill habitat on Panay of 225-450 km2, about 750-1,000 Tarictic Hornbill breeding pairs and 60-100 Writhed-billed Hornbill breeding pairs may remain on Panay.

Lariviere, Serge; Messier, Francois				Canadian Journal of Zoology	78	3		366-372	March 2000	2000				English	4	22	During 1993-1994, we radio-tracked 21 female and 5 male striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) in south-central Saskatchewan, Canada, to assess their patterns of habitat selection. Home ranges of both sexes contained more areas managed for nesting waterfowl and less woodland than the overall study area. When foraging within their home ranges, striped skunks used more wetland and woodland and less cropland relative to other habitat types (managed nesting areas, rights-of-way, farmsteads). Patterns of habitat selection by striped skunks were significantly but weakly correlated with abundance of insects and small mammals. Striped skunks selected undisturbed habitats where ground litter can accumulate, possibly because such habitats also harbor a greater abundance of prey. Our results support the restoration of grasslands for nesting waterfowl. Furthermore, the use of large habitat patches by striped skunks decreased away from edges, suggesting that large patches may serve as refuges for ground-nesting birds.

Costello, Christine A.; Yamasaki, Mariko; Pekins, Peter J.; Leak, William B.; Neefus, Christopher D.				Forest Ecology and Management	127	1-3		41-54	1 March 2000	2000				English	1	13	Clearcutting creates habitat for many species of early successional songbirds; however, little information is available on bird use of small forest openings created by group selection harvests. Group selection harvests are increasing on the White Mountain National Forest due to negative public response to clearcutting. The objective of this study was to determine if avian species richness and composition differ between clearcut and group selection openings, and between mature stands and the uncut portions of group selection stands. Point count surveys were conducted during the 1992 and 1993 breeding seasons within six study blocks in the White Mountain National Forest, NH. Each block consisted of a clearcut stand, a group selection stand and a mature stand. Species richness per stand was significantly higher in clearcut openings (p = 0.010) than in group selection openings. Forested areas surrounding group selection openings were similar to mature stands in species richness (p = 0.848) and composition. Our data suggest that, relative to avian use, the group selection system does not provide habitat similar to that created by clearcutting in extensive northern hardwood stands. The group selection system appears to retain much of the mature forest bird community while providing for a limited number of early successional bird species. Gradual replacement of clearcutting with group selection harvests could result in reduced avian diversity across large forested tracts.

Mills, Todd R.; Rumble, Mark A.				Journal of Field Ornithology	71	2		187-206	Spring 2000	2000				English	0	12	Birds with both eastern and western distributions occur in the Black Hills of western South Dakota. This forest is mostly ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and is managed for timber. Logging alters forest characteristics and the bird community. We studied habitat relations of breeding songbirds at the stand- and site-level scales in ponderosa pine and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides)/paper birch (Betula papyrifera) forest. Sixty bird species were observed ltoreq50 m from count points. Species richness was greater in aspen/birch than in ponderosa pine. Species richness was generally lower in ponderosa pine with >40% over-story canopy cover (OCC) than in ponderosa pine with ltoreq40% OCC and than aspen/birch of any structural stage. Seven bird species were associated with the ponderosa pine, while four species were associated with aspen/birch. Bird associations at the stand-level were further refined by OCC and diameter-at-breast-height (DBH) structural stage of each forest type. Habitats for most birds in the Black Hills can be managed using current forest inventory descriptions that include OCC and DBH. However, Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), Red-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta canadensis), White-breasted Nuthatches (S. carolinensis), Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), and Western Tanagers (Piranga ludoviciana) were strongly associated with site-level vegetation characteristics. Snag density, snag condition, and deciduous trees beneath the ponderosa pine canopy should be included in forest inventories to better quantify habitats for these birds.

Rangen, Sheila A.; Hobson, Keith A.; Clark, Robert G.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	28	1		110-118	Spring 2000	2000				English	0	9	Reproductive behaviors have been used to estimate relative reproductive success for songbirds in grasslands, but little is known about the ease of detecting these behaviors in more complex habitats such as forests. We evaluated the feasibility of detecting differences in reproductive effort and success, using songbird behavior and number of fledglings observed, and investigated the relationship of indices of reproductive behaviors and fledgling frequencies versus species densities in 2 age-classes of forest. We used spot-mapping to determine breeding bird densities, whereas behavioral censuses and spot-mapping documented reproductive activity. Eighty-three percent of species did not differ in density between young and old stands. Census coverage totalled 4.3 hour/ha (SE=0.12, n=6) for young (25 years) and 4.1 hour/ha (SE=0.13, n=6) for old stands (76-100 years), when we combined behavioral observations obtained from late morning surveys and early morning spot-mapping on the same grids. Two of 7 ground and 1 of 5 above-ground nesting species showed greater productivity in young than old stands and 1 of 7 ground-nesting species had greater reproductive success in old than young stands, using indices of reproductive behavior. However, differences between forest age-classes in detections of fledglings were found only for white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis). Lack of differences in indices of reproductive behavior between stand ages was related to low statistical power and poor visibility of birds in forests, particularly in stands with high canopies. Power analysis indicated that 126 spot-mapping grids/treatment are required to attain 80% power with a hypothesized difference in the index reproductive behavior of 50% (i.e., effect size=0.5) and alpha=0.05.

Armstrong, K.N.; Nichols, O.G.				Forest Ecology and Management	126	2		213-225	10 February 2000	2000				English	2	12	Alcoa of Australia Limited rehabilitates areas in the jarrah forest of south-western Australia following bauxite mining. One of the aims of the company's rehabilitation programme is to re-establish the faunal communities which existed prior to mining. In the summers of 1981, 1987 and 1993, company biologists conducted bird surveys as part of a case study to determine the extent of avifaunal recolonisation in representative mined areas. Analysis of monitoring data collected during the three surveys of the same areas showed considerable variation in the avifaunal communities of three rehabilitated sites. Numbers of bird species and bird diversity in a site seeded with dense understorey continued to increase, and by 1993 all avifaunal community parameters measured in this site were equal to or greater than those recorded in healthy unmined forest. Bird species numbers increased in a site given fresh topsoil but not seeded between 1981 and 1987; however, all parameters showed little further change by 1993. The oldest site, which was not seeded or given fresh topsoil, showed the greatest degree of change. In 1981, it supported only one bird species, but by 1993 all bird community parameters were similar to those recorded in the site which received fresh topsoil but no seed. Species composition of all rehabilitated sites' avifauna also changed. The similarity of bird community composition increased over time. By 1993, the healthy forest communities were more similar to those of some rehabilitated sites than to those of forest degraded by dieback disease. The study demonstrated that development of the vegetation community is a key factor controlling the composition of bird communities in rehabilitated mine sites. Recommendations are given to further promote avifaunal recolonisation following mining.	Nichols, O.G.; Alcoa of Australia Limited, P.O.

Schieck, Jim; Stuart-Smith, Kari; Norton, Michael				Forest Ecology and Management	126	2		239-254	10 February 2000	2000				English	0	11	We evaluated bird community response to type, amount, and dispersion of trees, snags, and shrubs that were retained at harvest in mixedwood boreal forests of Alberta, Canada. We also evaluated whether the degree of similarity between bird communities in harvest and old-growth areas was related to the type and amount of materials retained at harvest. We combined data from three separate studies to generate a large data set covering a wide range of cut-block structures. Birds were surveyed using point counts and line transects. Residual vegetation was surveyed partially on the ground, and partially from aerial photographs. Bird species commonly associated with parkland and open country habitats had high densities in harvest areas that contained abundant shrubs and few residual trees or snags. Within harvest areas where more trees, particularly large deciduous trees, were retained, and when those trees were retained in clumps, bird communities were more similar to those found in old-growth forests. Thus, by retaining clumps of large trees and snags in harvest areas managers may be able to create habitats that are used by old-growth forest bird species. However, for many forest birds, density was lower in cut-blocks with residual trees and snags than it was in old-growth forest. Results should be interpreted cautiously because survival and reproductive success of forest birds in cut-blocks with residual trees and snags was not determined.

Borges, Sergio Henrique; Carvalhaes, Andre				Biodiversity and Conservation	9	2		201-214	February 2000	2000				English	0	8	We compared the relative contribution of blackwater inundation forest (igapo) and unflooded (terra firme) forest for regional bird species diversity in the lower Rio Negro region. For analyses of habitat preference we used mist-net samples and an unpublished bird species check-list. The igapo forest had lower bird species diversity than the terra firme forest. However, some 14% of the forest bird species in the region are restricted to igapo forest. Species composition was found to be distinct between the understories of the two forest types. Common forest bird guilds in the Neotropics such as ant-following birds avoid igapo forest. The differential habitat selection among birds in the inundated and unflooded forest is likely to result from vegetation structure and biological interactions such as aggressive behaviour. Since the inundated forest has a typical biota, conservation efforts needs to be directed to protect these habitats. Unfortunately, inundation forests are threatened by several human actions, especially dam construction. The extent of protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon is insufficient for the adequate protection of the inundated habitats, because it includes only 3% of the total area.

Savignac, Carl; Desrochers, Andre; Huot, Jean				Canadian Journal of Zoology	78	2		219-225	February 2000	2000				English	0	13	To study the multiple spatial scale pattern of habitat use by Pileated Woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus L.), we compared the vegetation characteristics at used sites with those at unused sites at macrohabitat (154 ha radius plots) and microhabitat (ca. 0.04 ha radius plots) scales in the La Mauricie region of Quebec. Used macrohabitats were those in which woodpeckers were detected at playback stations. Used microhabitats corresponded to sites showing signs of foraging (i.e., excavated cavities). Pileated Woodpeckers responded to vegetation structure at both scales sampled. Macrohabitats used by woodpeckers had relatively low percentages of mixed shade-intolerant hardwood stands, coniferous stands, and stands of relatively low stem density and tree height, but included high percentages of 51- to 90-year-old stands. Microhabitats used by woodpeckers were characterized most strongly by a high density of large snags but also by a high density of small-diameter snags and a low density of shade-intolerant hardwood trees and coniferous trees ltoreq30 cm diameter at breast height. The concordance between the observed and predicted use of micro- and macrohabitat plots was independent of spatial scale (logistic regression, chi0.05,12 = 1.8, P = 0.18, n = 429), suggesting that habitats use by woodpeckers was influenced to a similar extent by habitat features measured at both spatial scales. Because Pileated Woodpeckers are likely to require specific habitat features at different spatial scales, forest-management guidelines intended to conserve this umbrella species should consider a multiple spatial scales approach.

Thirgood, Simon; Redpath, Steve; Newton, Ian; Hudson, Peter				Conservation Biology	14	1		95-104	February 2000	2000				English	5	79	Recovering predator populations may present problems for conservationists if their prey are of economic or conservation value. We address this issue by examining the conflict between raptor conservation and management of Red Grouse (Lagopus 1. scoticus) in Britain. Heather moorland is a distinctive habitat that supports an important assemblage of breeding birds. Large areas of moorland are managed by private landowners for shooting grouse. Although grouse shooting benefits conservation by retaining heather moorland, it is currently unclear whether grouse management directly benefits other upland birds. Human persecution has greatly restricted the range and abundance of most raptor species in Britain. Following the introduction of bird protection laws, the decline in gamekeeping, and the restriction of organochlorine pesticides, raptor populations have started to recover. Persecution of raptors on grouse moors is widespread and limits the range and abundance of Hen Harriers (Circus cyaneus), Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus), and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). In some circumstances, raptor predation can reduce both the breeding density and productivity of Red Grouse. Limitation of grouse populations through raptor predation is most likely to occur where raptors are at high density because of the abundance of alternative prey, and grouse are at low density either because of poor management or the cyclic nature of some grouse populations. In the long term, habitat management may reduce densities of alternative prey, leading to reductions in raptor densities and their predation on grouse. More active intervention may be required, however, if grouse moors are to remain viable in the short-term. Current research is focused on manipulating harder diet through diversionary feeding. Complementary research is needed to investigate methods to reduce raptor numbers locally while ensuring their national status.

Gunn, John S.; Hagan, John M., III				Forest Ecology and Management	126	1		1-12	1 February 2000	2000				English	4	25	We studied abundance and tree use (foraging and drumming) of the cavity-nesting woodpecker guild (7 species) in northern Maine to assess effects of uneven-aged forest management (an irregular shelterwood system) on woodpecker populations. Woodpecker abundance in managed and unmanaged hardwood stands showed no difference. Abundance in managed softwood stands was greater than in unmanaged softwood stands. Woodpeckers preferred (use greater than availability) to forage and drum on large-diameter (>30 cm) living trees (hardwood and softwood). Living trees used by woodpeckers, however, were commonly in a state of decline, with characteristics such as fungal conks, broken limbs, and broken tops. When dead trees were used, woodpeckers preferred large-diameter, recently-dead trees. Although we identified tree types preferred by woodpeckers, the abundance of preferred trees in a stand was a poor predictor of woodpecker abundance. The uneven-aged management we studied did not reduce the number of preferred trees or snags to a level that affected woodpecker abundance.

Cooper, John M.; Beauchesne, Suzanne				Wildlife Working Report	WR-100			i-vii, 1-30	February 2000	2000				English	0	0	The East Kootenay Trench was surveyed for nesting Lewis's Woodpeckers (Melanerpes lewis) in June and July of 1997 and 1998. Forty-seven active nests were found the first year, and 85 were found the following year. These nests occurred in four habitat types: burned coniferous forest, open mature ponderosa pine forest, range land with isolated veteran ponderosa pines, and riparian cottonwood. Distribution of nests found was clumped, perhaps suggesting that preferred habitat was not randomly distributed. Nest trees were mainly burned ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir snags, large and dead veteran ponderosa pines, or live mature ponderosa pines; although western larch, black cottonwood, trembling aspen, paper birch, and utility poles were also used. Most nests were on Crown land, but in two areas (Wycliffe and Fairmont) nests were found predominantly on private land. The authors estimate that 100 to 150 pairs nest in the East Kootenay Trench, and suggest that good habitat is rare, that concentrations of nesting birds occur in burns, and that enhancement of habitat is feasible.

Journal of Wildlife Management	64	1		11-23	January 2000	2000				English	0	21	Loss and alteration of breeding habitat have been proposed as causes of declines in several Neotropical migrant bird populations. We conducted a 4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning and forest thinning on breeding wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR) in Georgia. We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates, and apparent annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry, and mist netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities (P = 0.25); wood thrush density ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/10 ha. No radiomarked male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4 years, but female weekly survival was 0.981 +- 0.014 (SE) for females (n = 63) and 0.976 +- 0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual adult survival was 0.579 (SE = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed burning did not reduce adult or juvenile survival during the breeding season or apparent annual adult survival. Annual population growth (lambda) at PNWR was 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.32-1.63), and the considerable uncertainty in this prediction underscores the need for long-term monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants. Population growth increased on experimental compartments after the burn and thin (95% CI before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05), while control compartment lambda declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after = 0.87-0.92). We found no evidence that the current management regime at PNWR, designed to improve red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat, negatively affected wood thrushes.

Hanula, James L.; Franzreb, Kathleen E.; Pepper, William D.				Journal of Wildlife Management	64	1		60-70	January 2000	2000				English	0	20	Red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) forage on the boles of living pine trees for a variety of arthropods. To assess the availability of prey under differing stand conditions, we sampled arthropods that crawled up the boles of 300 living longleaf pine trees (Pinus palustris) ranging in age from 20-100 years with passive traps over a 1-year period. We identified, counted, ovendried, and weighed >50,000 arthropods in 22 orders and 470 genera. The most diverse orders were the Coleoptera (beetles), Araneae (spiders), and Hymenoptera (ants, wasps and bees). The most abundant orders were the Homoptera with large numbers of aphids (Aphididae) and the Hymenoptera with large numbers of ants (Formicidae). The Coleoptera and Araneae accounted for the greatest available biomass. Overall, arthropod biomass/tree increased with increasing stand age up to approximately 65-70 years, but arthropod biomass/ha was highest in the youngest stands. Abundance and biomass of arthropods on each tree bole were positively correlated with bark thickness and tree diameter, and negatively correlated with basal area (m2/ha). Arthropod biomass differed among seasons, with the highest arthropod biomass occurring in winter and spring. We found no correlation of diversity, abundance, or biomass of arthropods on the tree bole with site index, the numbers of herbaceous plant genera in the understory, the number of herbaceous plant stems, or the percentage of ground covered by herbs. Stand characteristics, such as average bark thickness and diameter, associated with increased arthropod abundance and biomass on the bark are positively correlated to tree age, but these relationships would change with management practices that either accelerated or slowed tree growth.

Northeast Wildlife	55			39-46	2000	2000				English	1	4	Bird species and vegetation characteristics were recorded on two plots subject to different intensities of post-burn salvage logging. We compared those numbers with pre-logging data on those plots and with adjacent burned but unlogged controls. Succession increased the crown cover of shrubs on a post-burn clear-cut, but a post-burn selective cut showed no difference in vegetation characteristics. Because numbers of ground nesters and feeders (dark-eyed junco, white-crowned sparrow, white-throated sparrow) increased, clear-cut salvage logging increased total bird density. However, species richness was reduced due to the loss of snag-associated northern flickers and hermit thrushes. The selectively logged plot (40% remaining volume) conserved bird species but supported fewer total birds than both the pre-cut plot and a control. Our data suggest that leaving 40% volume as residual snags during post-fire salvage logging is sufficient to conserve bird species that benefit from snags.

Kouki, Jari; Vaananen, Anne				Ornis Fennica	77	4		145-154	2000	2000				English	2	15	Fennoscandian conifer forests have experienced a major landscape transformation during the 1900s. Currently, only scattered patches of old semi-natural forests exist in eastern Finland. However, on the Russian side old and mature forests still cover large tracts. We aim to show how the proximity of protected areas to the Russian border affects their species assemblages. We also ask how well the multi-scoring procedure applied by governmental ministries to design reserve networks performs in terms of bird protection. Censuses were conducted in fifteen old-growth forest areas located at varying distances (0-120 km) from the Finnish-Russian border in 1997. Data were gathered on ten non-migratory species that are mostly associated with old-growth or mature forests, many of which show decreasing population trends in Finland during the 1900s. Both the total density and number of species decreased as distance from the Russian border increased. Of the individual species, the Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) showed the highest decrease in its relative population density. The Siberian Jay (Perisoreus infaustus) and the Treecreeper (Certhia familiaris) occurred only in the areas closest to the Russian border. The number of species peaked close to the border: the average number of species in the standardized 50 ha area decreased from 5.0 to 2.0 as distance increased from 0-10 km to 80-120 km. The results support views of the negative impact of isolation on old-growth specialist bird species. However, the habitat quality within the remaining patches [-] such as the amount of coarse woody debris [-] may also affect local bird assemblages. The ranking procedure applied in the old-growth areas in Finland turned out to be non-informative for birds. The ranks were not related to the population densities or number of resident species.

Imbeau, Louis; Savard, Jean-Pierre L.; Gagnon, Rejean				Canadian Journal of Zoology	77	12		1850-1860	December 1999	1999				English	1	36	Comparisons of the effects of logging and fire as disturbance agents on the composition of bird assemblages in boreal ecosystems are still lacking or are limited to the short-term impacts of clear-cutting. In Quebec, where the boreal forest is largely dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands, we surveyed 140 point-count stations in 3 postlogging and 4 postfire development stages determined according to the height of the regenerating spruce trees. Species richness did not vary among forest development stages, but bird abundance was higher in recent clearcuts. Recently disturbed areas were characterized by open-land bird assemblages dominated by Neotropical migrants, which reached their highest abundance in clearcuts. Moreover, logged stands were distinguished from burned sites by the absence of cavity-nesting birds. Forest-bird assemblages reestablished themselves as soon as young spruces reached the sapling stage. However, the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), and Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) were restricted to mature stands or recent burns and are thus likely to be negatively affected by modern forestry, which involves fire suppression and short logging rotations. We suggest that retention of larger areas of continuous mature forest might be essential to maintain these species in managed regions.

Pacific Conservation Biology	5	3		163-178	December 1999	1999				English	0	4	Passive recovery of land formerly used for agricultural production may be an inexpensive and rapid method of ecosystem recovery, and may provide an alternative method to active revegetation. Passive recovery may also contribute to sustainable agriculture (soil salinity). For undisturbed and disturbed areas of the central wheatbelt of Western Australia, this paper reports the effects of farming history (clearing only, cultivation, duration of farming, and time since farming ceased) on the soil nutrient content, plant floristics (richness and composition) and structure, and the abundance, species richness and species composition of birds and arthropods. Only one site was cultivated for >6 years. We summarize as follows: (1) Previous clearing and cultivation has left no residual effects on the nitrogen or phosphorus content in the sandy soils. (2) There were no significant differences in terms of plant species richness but some differences in cover of woody plants, grass cover and plant species composition for farming history or time since farming ceased. (3) There were no significant differences in bird species richness but differences in species composition for time since farming ceased. (4) Arthropods showed few (and low) significant differences in their abundance, richness or species composition across different farming histories and time periods since farming ceased. Farming of these shrublands has left only minor changes in the composition and structure of the vegetation, and in the abundance, species richness and species composition of the passerine bird and arthropod assemblages. Abandoned parcels of land on the sandy soils which support shrubland may yield useful conservation benefits with relatively little input.

Wildlife Society Bulletin	27	4		904-914	Winter 1999	1999				English	1	5	Aspen (Populus spp.) woodland is increasing within native grasslands in north-central North Dakota, and this increase concerns land managers. We examined avian associations in aspen groves of various sizes on and near J. Clark Salyer National Wildlife Refuge in 1995-96 to predict how bird communities change as woody plant cover increases within a grassland-dominated landscape. Avian species richness increased as aspen grove size increased, particularly for bird species classified as forest interior, neotropical migrant, ground nesting, or insectivorous. Large (i.e., >100-ha) aspen groves provided suitable habitat for 12 area-sensitive species while also meeting the requirements of more ubiquitous habitat generalists. Conversely, small aspen groves did not support the number or diversity of avian species and were occupied by edge-associated species. None of 53 species recorded in the study were restricted to small aspen groves. We conclude that limiting the spread of aspen woodland into native grassland and eliminating small (i.e., <5-ha) aspen groves where feasible will not adversely impact woodland breeding bird communities. Many avian species occur with greater frequency in aspen woodlands than in eastern deciduous forest. Large woodlands contribute to local avian diversity and may provide habitat for forest species that have shown regional or continental population declines.

Rodgers, James A., Jr; Schwikert, Stephen T.				Florida Field Naturalist	27	4		141-149	November 1999	1999				English	0	2	Least Bitterns (Ixobrychus exilis) were found to be common residents of the littoral zone of many central Florida lakes but rare or absent at other wetlands, presumably because of lack of suitable emergent vegetation in the littoral zone. Nesting occurred most frequently in cattail (Typha sp., 38.2%) and bulrush (Scirpus validus, 52.1%). Water depth under nests averaged 107.16 +- 29.35 cm (range = 38-168 cm, n = 207 nests) but varied among lakes. Nest height above the water averaged 46.8 +- 21.2 cm (range = 5-135 cm, n = 207 nests) and was similar among lakes. Clutch size averaged 4.08 +- 0.59 eggs/nest (range = 2-5, n = 104 nests) and ranged from 3.69 +- 0.48 to 4.35 +- 0.49 among lakes and years. Number of young surviving to 2-weeks of age averaged 1.05 +- 1.62 nestlings/nest (range = 0-4) and was similar among lakes. Only 47.4% of nests survived to produce nestlings gtoreq2-weeks of age. Many nests failed due to wind/wave effects (24.3%) or nest abandonment (23.1%) for unknown reasons. Average hatching date was 29 May on both Lakes Kissimmee and Tohopekaliga. Significant interyear variation in mean hatch dates occurred on Lake Tohopekaliga. Because cattail appears to be an important nesting habitat for Least Bitterns and other nesting birds, lake management programs should re-examine the wildlife value of cattail and make accommodation for emergent stands of herbaceous marsh vegetation in the littoral zone of central Florida lakes.

Joubert, D.F.; Ryan, P.G.				Journal of Arid Environments	43	3		287-299	November 1999	1999				English	0	18	Small mammal and bird assemblages were compared across fence-lines between one communal and three adjacent commercial range-lands in Namaqualand, South Africa. The communal area has twice the recommended stocking rate of sheep and goats, and has less perennial plant cover and more annual plants than neighbouring commercial rangelands. Commercial rangelands supported a larger and more diverse assemblage of small mammals and birds. Small mammal species composition on communal lands was a subset of that on adjacent commercial rangelands, with only one species equally abundant in both treatments. Diurnal mammals were scarce in communal rangelands, apparently due to the lack of cover for predator avoidance and herbivory. Management to maintain a diversity of small mammals requires a minimum level of effective cover. Bird richness and diversity was also reduced on communal rangelands, with many species, especially insectivores, less abundant. A few bird species, notably granivores, were more abundant on communal rangelands, probably because of the increase in annual plant cover. The absence of some large bird species regularly found in Namaqualand, but absent from both treatments (e.g., bustards), suggests that neither management practice is optimal.

Moreira, Francisco				Aquatic Ecology	33	3	(Special Issue)	301-309	October 1999	1999				English	0	4	The use of intertidal areas of the Tagus estuary by birds was re-analysed, based on data from 1990 to 1993, to describe (i) the temporal and spatial patterns of use of intertidal areas, (ii) the diet of birds during winter and (iii) the habitat selection patterns of feeding birds, during winter. The most common birds in the estuary were gulls, waders and ducks. Highest densities were recorded for most species in autumn and winter. The spatial distribution of birds in the intertidal areas of the estuary did not vary significantly across seasons, although broader distributions occurred when bird populations were present in high numbers. In autumn, use of intertidal areas was highly variable. Specific areas in the estuary were identified as holding important densities of birds, or having a high species richness. The most abundant species selected feeding areas according to sediment type, although the presence of channels, saltmarsh or humans also influenced the distribution of birds. The invertebrates Carcinus maenas, Hediste diversicolor and Scrobicularia plana were identified as key prey species. Plant material was important as food for ducks. Implications of these findings for the management of the estuary are discussed.

Madden, Elizabeth M.; Hansen, Andrew J.; Murphy, Robert K.				Canadian Field-Naturalist	113	4		627-640	October-December 1999	1999				English	4	43	To more effectively manage remaining native grasslands and declining populations of prairie passerine birds, linkages between disturbance regimes, vegetation, and bird abundance need to be more fully understood. Therefore, we examined bird-habitat relationships on mixed-grass prairie at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in northwestern North Dakota, where prescribed fire has been used as a habitat management tool since the 1970s. We sampled bird abundance on upland prairie at 310 point count locations during 1993 and 1994 breeding seasons. We also measured vegetation structure and composition at each location. Complete fire histories were available for each point, with over 80% having been burned one to four times in the previous 15 years. Post-fire succession generally transformed vegetation structure from short, sparse, and grassy with few forbs and low litter immediately after fire, to increasing and moderate amounts of forbs, litter, and shrubs two to eight years postfire, to tall, dense, shrubby prairie with little forb, grass, or litter understory when fire was absent (>80 years). Most grassland birds (six of nine species examined) at Lostwood NWR were absent from prairie untreated with fire. Species richness and abundances of Baird's Sparrows (Ammodramus bairdii), Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum), Le Conte's Sparrows (A. leconteii), Sprague's Pipits (Anthus spragueii), and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) were positively related to an index of amount of fire, and these species were absent from unburned units. In contrast, Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) and Clay-colored Sparrows (Spizella pallida) both reached highest abundance on unburned prairie. To provide maximum grassland bird diversity, managers of mesic, mixed-grass prairie generally should provide areas with short (2-4 year), moderate (5-7 year), and long (8-10 year, or more) fire return intervals.

Part, Tomas; Soderstrom, Bo				Biological Conservation	90	2		113-123	September 1999	1999				English	0	27	Semi-natural dry grasslands have almost disappeared in the modern farmland of southwestern and central Europe. In the northern and eastern parts of Europe, however, this species-rich habitat is still relatively common, albeit in a phase of rapid loss. To halt this decline the Swedish government started a large-scale subsidy scheme for the management and restoration of semi-natural pastures mainly aimed at increasing botanical values. We compared and contrasted the current management prescriptions with habitat preferences of 23 farmland bird species breeding in 88 dry semi-natural pastures in south-central Sweden. Semi-natural pastures showed very high breeding densities of several farmland birds underlining the importance of this habitat to the conservation of farmland birds. A TWINSPAN classification of all birds identified two groups of pastures with different bird communities. Eleven (48%) of the bird species were significantly more common in a group of pastures situated in open farmland, while only five (22%) species occurred in higher densities in pastures characterised by a high proportion of forest along the borders. Fifteen (83%) of the 18 species occurring in both pasture groups showed significant habitat-abundance relationships related to the management of semi-natural pastures, although in different directions and to different extents. Our results suggest that many farmland bird species require two important factors for their choice of breeding habitat, namely safe nest sites close to good foraging areas. Both factors are partly under the control of farmers and should be invoked in conservation strategies since many farmland birds are declining across Europe. To benefit the conservation of farmland birds in Sweden one should, in contrast to the present botanical-based subsidy scheme, retain gtoreq 10% cover of shrubs within pastures and preferentially select pastures in open farmland (i.e.	Part, Tomas; Department of Conservation Biology (SLU), Box 7002, S-750 07 Uppsala, Sweden, Sweden.

Dieni, J. Scott; Anderson, Stanley H.				Journal of Field Ornithology	70	4		491-503	Autumn 1999	1999				English	0	7	Fire is an important disturbance that stimulates aspen regeneration and expansion in the western United States. We investigated the impacts of burning aspen-dominated habitats on landbird community structure in the western foothills of the Wind River Range, Wyoming. Habitat structure, breeding bird species composition, richness, and relative abundance were compared in 1994 and 1995 between six independent pairs of sites, each pair consisting of a recently burned aspen site and a control site. Burned sites typically had lower canopy cover and depth, greater snag densities and aspen regeneration, and less shrub growth. We observed 45 diurnal woodland bird species overall. Western Wood-Pewees (Contopus sordidulus) and Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus) were detected significantly less often in the burned sites, while Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) and Pine Siskins (Carduelis pinus) were detected significantly more often in the burned sites. Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivoracelata), Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), and chickadees (Poecile spp.) were significantly less abundant in the burned aspen when burn size or year was factored into the analysis. For many other commonly detected species, we had relatively low power to detect meaningful differences in abundance between recently burned and unburned aspen stands. Bird species richness was similar between treatments. Bird species composition differed consistently among burned-control pairs, but our data suggested that intersite variability in species composition in aspen is the norm in the absence of burning.

Hines, Martina				Journal of the Kentucky Academy of Science	60	2		78-86	Fall 1999	1999				English	0	1	Breeding-bird communities were surveyed on the Daniel Boone National Forest, Kentucky, using point counts, in mid May, late May, and early June 1994 and 1995. Twenty-eight stands of Appalachian pine-oak forest were surveyed of which 14 were managed for red-cockaded woodpeckers (RCWs). Management involved removal of midstories (2.5-17.5 cm dbh) and repeated prescribed burns. Results indicate that these management practices appear to have effects similar to that of timber harvests on species composition and abundance of breeding birds. Prescriptions for RCWs were beneficial to several species associated with early successional and edge habitat, including at least some neotropical migrants whose numbers are decreasing in eastern North America (e.g., indigo bunting, hooded warbler, and prairie warbler). Management for RCWs appears to decrease habitat quality for other neotropical migrants, particularly those associated with forest interiors.

Waterhouse, F. Louise; Harestad, Alton S.				Vancouver Forest Region Forest Research Technical Report	TR-001			Unpaginated	September 1999	1999	http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/rco/research/Publications_list.htm			English	0	1	During the breeding bird season of 1994 we studied bird communities in riparian and upland habitats along 20-40 m wide S1 rivers (Forest Practices Code; Government of BC 1995). We used point count surveys to detect birds in old-growth forest (>250 years) and we mapped territories of breeding birds both in old-growth forest and in pre-Code riparian forest buffers of young plantations. The study sites were distributed between a watershed in the Submontane Very Wet Maritime Coastal Western Hemlock variant (CWHvm1) and a watershed in the Very Dry Maritime Coastal Western Hemlock subzone (CWHxm), both on northeastern Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The abundance and diversity of species was not consistent between the two watersheds, and these differences may in part reflect differences between the prevailing ecosystems of the watersheds. Overall, in the old-growth forest, Hammonds Flycatchers were associated with the riparian edge, but we did not identify any bird species as being dependant on the river for habitat. Winter Wrens, Red Crossbills, and Varied Thrushes were in greater abundance in upland habitats. Total number of individuals and number of species (species richness) were significantly greater in the upland. These differences may in part be attributable to some species having home ranges that extend beyond the riparian area, some species selecting habitats at a finer scale (e.g., using riparian habitats on smaller streams in the upland), or sampling limitations in detecting rarer species in the narrow riparian zone. The maximum number of species detected in the old-growth was within 350 m of the rivers, suggesting wider buffers may better maintain the old-growth bird community. Many species used both riparian and upland habitats, and this overlap of species assemblages further supports the suggestion that riparian and upland should be managed together to provide bird habitat. In addition, the one-sample comparison in our study between a wide riparian forest buffer (mean 85 m) and the narrower buffers (<30 m) also indicates that wider buffers likely support more of the old-growth associated species. We found that young plantations with riparian forest buffers, narrow or wide, only retained a portion of species associated with the old-growth forest. Yet in these young plantations, species richness compared to that in old-growth was maintained because new species occupied the newly created buffer edge and open habitats. Furthermore, we found that old-growth associated bird species were more likely to occupy those riparian forest buffers isolated within plantations on both sides of the river, than those buffers limited to one side of the river across from old-growth. We suggest that these isolated double buffers may provide poorer quality habitat for some bird species but are used because the availability of old-growth forest is limited, whereas single buffers are not as likely to be used with birds accessing higher quality habitat across the river. If so, the habitat potential of riparian buffers may be enhanced for birds without exceeding Forest Practices Code regulations on riparian management area widths - if single buffers are used in conjunction with old-growth or mature second-growth stands across the river. In summary, the protection of both the riparian edges in buffers along the river provides for important habitat over the long term, although only a portion of the old-growth associated bird community will be retained at the stand level, at least in the short term. Present regulations for riparian reserve zones (50 m) and adjacent riparian management zones (20 m) on these S1 rivers will likely provide better bird habitat than the pre-Codebuffers (<50 m) that we studied because wider buffers appear to maintain more bird species associated with old-growth.
