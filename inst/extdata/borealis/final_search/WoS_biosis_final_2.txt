Total 37 species of birds were recorded in both Study sites. Luscinia cyane, Uroshena squameiceps, and Emberiza tristrami were most dominant species. In natural forest, 115 individuals of 32 species were observed and bird species diversity (H') was 3.13. Sixty two individuals of 29 species were recorded and bird species diversity was 3.12 in fired forest. Bush and Canopy nesting guilds were higher in natural forest than in fired forest. But hole nesting guild was higher in fired forest. In foraging guilds, canopy foraging guild was most dominant in both study site. Air and bush foraging guilds were higher in natural forest. The differences of bird communities would be caused by differences of habitat conditions between Study sites.

I Studied how the hydrologic restoration of off-channel wetlands (plugging gullies that drain off-channel wetlands) affects the diversity, abundance, and nesting success of birds breeding within forested wetlands within the Cache River watershed in Illinois. I compared surface area, water depth, bird diversity, bird densities, and nesting success between treatment (gully plugs added) and control (gully plugs not added) wetlands pre- and post-treatment. During the breeding season of birds, treatment wetlands retained more flooded area and greater depths of water compared to,control wetlands. Bird diversity was unaffected by the installation of gully plugs. The density and nesting success of prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea) was higher in treatment wetlands than in control wetlands. Documenting changes in the bird community in response to this conservation action provides a means to measure the success of restoration activities in the Cache River watershed and inform conservation plans and restoration. efforts in other bottomland forest ecosystems.

The Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma-the largest remaining tallgrass prairie-is important for grassland bird conservation despite supporting a major cattle industry. In 2004 and 2005, we assessed the community, population, and demographic responses of grassland birds to the predominant management practices (grazing, burning, and haying) of the region, including grasslands restored under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). We targeted 3 species at the core of this avian community: the Dickcissel (Spiza americana), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna). Bird diversity was higher in native prairie hayfields and grazed pastures than CRP fields, which were dominated by Dickcissels. Although Dickcissel density was highest in CRP, their nest success was highest and nest parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Moluthrus ater) lowest in unburned hayfields (in 2004). Conversely, Grasshopper Sparrow density was highest in grazed pastures, but their nest success was lowest in these pastures and highest in burned hayfields, where cowbird parasitism was also lowest (in 2004). Management did not influence density and nest survival of Eastern Meadowlarks, which were uniformly low across the region. Nest success was extremely low (5-12%) for all 3 species in 2005, perhaps because of a record spring drought. Although the CRP has benefited grassland birds in agricultural landscapes, these areas may have lower habitat value in the context of native prairie. Hayfields may provide beneficial habitat for some grassland birds in the Flint Hills because they are mowed later in the breeding season than elsewhere in the Midwest. Widespread grazing and annual burning have homogenized habitat-and thus grassland-bird responses-across the Flint Hills. Diversification of management practices could increase habitat heterogeneity and enhance the conservation potential of the Flint Hills for grassland birds.

To reduce the risk of uncharacteristic stand-replacing. res in the southwestern United States, land managers are implementing restoration and fuels treatments ( e. g., mechanical thinning, prescribed. re) in progressively larger stands of dry, lower elevation ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa) forest. We used a Before-After/Control-Impact experimental design to quantify the multi-scale response of avifauna to large (similar to 250-400 ha) prescribed. re treatments on four sites in Arizona and New Mexico dominated by ponderosa pine. Using distance sampling and an information-theoretic approach, we estimated changes in density for 14 bird species detected before (May-June 2002-2003) and after (May-June 2004-2005) prescribed. re treatments. We observed few site-level differences in pre- and posttreatment density, and no species responded strongly to treatment on all four sites. Point-level spatial models of individual species response to treatment, habitat variables, and. re severity revealed ecological relationships that were more easily interpreted. At this scale, pretreatment forest structure and patch characteristics were important predictors of posttreatment differences in bird species density. Five species ( Pygmy Nuthatch [Sitta pygmaea], Western Bluebird [Sialia mexicana], Steller's Jay [Cyanocitta stelleri], American Robin [Turdus migratorius], and Hairy Woodpecker [Picoides villosus]) exhibited a strong treatment response, and two of these species ( American Robin and Hairy Woodpecker) could be associated with meaningful. re severity response functions. The avifaunal response patterns that we observed were not always consistent with those reported by more common studies of wildland. re events. Our results suggest that, in the short term, the distribution and abundance of common members of the breeding bird community in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests appear to be tolerant of low- to moderate-intensity prescribed. re treatments at multiple spatial scales and across multiple geographic locations.

In light of climate change and the effects of fire exclusion, single and repeated high-severity (stand-replacement) fires have become prominent land management issues. We studied bird communities using point counting in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of Oregon, USA at various points in time after one or two high-severity fires. Time points included 2 and 3 years after a single fire, 17 and 18 years after a single fire, 2 and 3 years after a repeat fire (15 year interval between fires), and >100 years since stand-replacement fire (mature/old-growth forest). Avian species richness did not differ significantly among habitats. Bird density was highest 17 and 18 years after fire, lowest 2 years after fire, and intermediate in repeat burns and unburned forest. Bird community composition varied significantly with habitat type (A = 0.24, P < 0.0001) with two distinct gradients in species composition relating to tree structure (live to dead) and shrub stature. Using indicator species analysis, repeat burns were characterized by shrub-nesting and ground-foraging bird species while unburned mature forests were characterized by conifer-nesting and foliage-gleaning species. Bird density was not related to snag basal area but was positively related to shrub height. Contrary to expectations, repeated high-severity fire did not reduce species richness, and bird densities were greater in repeat burns than in once-burned habitats. Broad-leaved hardwoods and shrubs appear to play a major role in structuring avian communities in the Klamath-Siskiyou region. In light of these results, extended periods of early seral broadleaf dominance and short-interval high-severity fires may be important to the conservation of avian biodiversity.

The historic town of Concord, Massachusetts, home of the philosopher and naturalist Henry David Thoreau, provides a unique opportunity to examine how well conservation areas preserve biodiversity in a suburban landscape. About 35% of total land area in the town has been protected, and botanists, including Thoreau, have surveyed plants in Concord five times over the last 170 years. We spent 5 years (2003-2007) re-surveying a subset of Concord's flora for species presence and abundance. Of the species seen by Thoreau in the mid-19th century in Concord, we could not locate 27%, and an additional 36% persist in one or two populations where they are vulnerable to local extinction. Most species losses appear to have occurred in the past three to four decades. Certain groups, such as orchids, have shown particularly severe losses. More native species are declining in abundance than are increasing. Non-native species represent an increasing percentage of the flora, with many increasing in abundance. The flora has experienced a net loss of species over the past four decades, with 82 species gained and 236 species missing. Because many species are rare on a local scale, persisting as one or two small populations, local extinctions will likely continue in coming decades. Habitat management, primarily to prevent tree establishment, appears to have allowed many rare species of open habitats to persist and recover. Active management of existing sites will likely be the key to protecting the species diversity of the Concord flora and maintaining the living connection to the writings of Thoreau.

Estimates of species richness based on counts can be biased by variation in the probability of detection among different species. We quantified the effects of livestock exclusion on riparian bird communities using mark-recapture models to account for variation in species detection rates. Specifically, we estimated species richness and other community parameters for fenced and grazed sites with robust design models where closed-captures were treated as mixtures, and then used transition rates to calculate derived vital rates for avian communities. Estimates of species richness based on unadjusted counts were correlated with estimates from robust design models, but counts failed to detect important temporal changes in species richness. Estimates of species richness from robust design models increased at fenced and grazed sites over an 8-year period, but community vital rates were unaffected by cattle exclusion. We examined qualitative changes in abundance of birds in four nesting guilds, and concluded that temporal changes may have been driven by regional dynamics in avian communities. Our mark-recapture analysis allowed us to compare standardized estimates of community parameters between habitats, observers, and time periods after accounting for variation in detection rates. Robust design models are a useful tool that will facilitate accurate assessments of community dynamics following future restoration efforts. Received 12 March 2007. Accepted 29 June 2008.	Johnson, T.

The impacts of postfire management, including salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5-6 snags retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon. We used analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three hypotheses concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage on densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds, and two hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage logging on relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined the relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species. We did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities or relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P. villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment. We detected significant differences between years for four species of birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting robust patterns that transcend particular locations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bird-habitat relationships were investigated by comparing vegetation characteristics, and bird species richness, diversity, abundance, and guild structure of birds (determined according to food type, foraging and nesting sites) between mature (60-100 years old) and over-mature (>120 years old) Macedonian pine forest stands. Studied forest age-classes differed mainly by the density, height and diameter of trees, and the amount of dead wood. The first one of these parameters decreased and the latter two parameters increased with the forest succession. The difference in the vegetation structure affected the abundance of bird-guilds and thus, the overall bird abundance and the structure of avian assemblages within Macedonian pine forests. There was no significant difference in bird diversity among studied forest age-classes, but the overall bird abundance increased with forest maturation. Analyzed by study plots, species richness was higher in over-mature forests, but at cluster level, there was no significant difference between mature and over-mature forest age-classes. Half of the studied (insectivorous, hole- and ground-nesters, bark- and canopy-foraging bird species) guilds were more abundant in over-mature forests, while there was no bird-guild exhibiting a preference for mature forest stands. The abundances of bird-guilds were correlated with tree height, diameter at breast height and the amount of dead wood between the studied forest age-classes and this might explain their preferences for over-mature pine forests. Therefore, for future sustainable management of these endemic forests and the conservation of their avifauna, efforts should focus on protecting the remaining native old-growth forest stands and the importance of the structure of Macedonian pine forests on their bird assemblages should be considered in forestry practices.

Natural disturbances impact shoreline forests and upland areas at similar rates. However, shoreline forests are generally protected from harvest through the retention of treed buffer strips. We examined bird community responses to forest management guidelines intended to approximate shoreline forest fires by comparing bird community structure in early (1-4 years) post-burned and harvested boreal riparian habitats and the adjacent shoreline forest. We sampled riparian areas with adjacent: (1) burned merchantable shoreline forest (n = 21), (2) burned non-merchantable shoreline forest (n = 29), (3) 10 m treed buffer with 25% retention in the next 30 rn (n = 18), and (4) 30 m treed buffer (n = 21). Only minor differences were detected in riparian species' abundance and bird community composition between treatments with greater differences in these parameters occurring between post-fire and post-harvest upland bird communities. Indicators of all merchantable treatments were dominated by upland species with open-habitat species and habitat generalists being typical upland indicator species of burned merchantable habitats and forest specialists typical upland indicators of harvested treatments. Riparian species indicative of burned riparian habitats were Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii) and Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus) and indicators of 30 m buffers were Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum) and Wilson's Warbler (Wilsonia pusilla). Multivariate Redundancy Analysis (RDA) of the overall (riparian and upland birds) community showed greater divergence than RDA with only riparian species suggesting less effect of fire and forestry on riparian birds than on upland birds. Higher natural range of variability (NRV) of overall post-fire bird communities compared to post-harvest communities emphasizes that harvesting guidelines currently do not achieve this level of variability. However, lack of a large negative effect on common riparian species in the first 4 years post-disturbance allows for the exploration of alternative shoreline forest management that better incorporates bird community composition of post-fire riparian areas and shoreline forests.

Forest Ecology and Management		2009	JAN 20 2009	257	1	151-159	151	159	English						0	33	Large wildfire events in coniferous forests of the western United States are often followed by postfire timber harvest. The long-term impacts of postfire timber harvest on fire-associated cavity-nesting bird species are not well documented. We studied nest-site selection by cavity-nesting birds over a 10-year period (1994-2003), representing 1-11 years after fire, on two burns created by mixed severity wildfires in western Idaho, USA. One burn was partially salvaged logged (the Foothills burn), the other was primarily unlogged (the Star Gulch burn). We monitored 1367 nests of six species (Lewis's Woodpecker Melanerpes lewis, Hairy Woodpecker Picoides villosus, Black-backed Woodpecker P. arcticus, Northern Flicker Colaptes auratus, Western Bluebird Sialia mexicana, and Mountain Bluebird S. currucoides). Habitat data at nest and non-nest random locations were characterized at fine (field collected) and coarse (remotely sensed) spatial scales. Nest-site selection for most species was consistently associated with higher snag densities and larger snag diameters, whereas wildfire location (Foothills versus Star Gulch) was secondarily important. All woodpecker species used nest sites with larger diameter snags that were surrounded by higher densities of snags than at non-nest locations. Nests of Hairy Woodpecker and Mountain Bluebird were primarily associated with the unlogged wildfire, whereas nests of Lewis's Woodpecker and Western Bluebird were associated with the partially logged burn in the early years after fire. Nests of wood-probing species (Hairy and Black-backed Woodpeckers) were also located in larger forest patch areas than patches measured at non-nest locations. Our results confirm previous findings that maintaining clumps of large snags in postfire landscapes is necessary for maintaining breeding habitat of cavity-nesting birds. Additionally, appropriately managed salvage logging can create habitat for some species of cavity-nesting birds that prefer more open environments. Our findings can be used by land mangers to develop design criteria for postfire salvage logging that will reserve breeding habitat for cavity-nesting birds. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Four land-use types on 47 mixed farms across nine regions, derived from several of Australia's 56 natural resource management regions, were surveyed in autumn and spring 2006 and 2007. Surveys of birds, surface invertebrates (beetles, ants, spiders), vegetation and soils were undertaken on four land classes on each farm; crop, 'rotation' (break crop/pasture phase), perennial pasture and remnant vegetation. Data were collected by participating regional staff, using a standard protocol, which were sent to a central collection point for collation, analysis and interpretation.Species richness, functional diversity and vegetation structure were assessed. This introductory paper focuses on results relating to species richness, which for most taxa was greater in remnant vegetation than other land-use classes and declined along a disturbance gradient (remnant, pasture, rotation, crop). Properties with a greater proportion of perennial pastures recorded higher species richness than properties that were dominated by crop. Properties that recorded high wheat yields (t/ha) also recorded lower species richness for spiders and birds. The presence of insectivorous birds and beneficial invertebrates (spiders, beetles and ants) in all land-use classes suggests the potential to apply integrated pest management approaches to mixed-farming systems across the country.Site and system features were found to be important determinants of biodiversity, with their relative importance varying with the scale of investigation and the taxa. At the landscape scale, bird species richness was correlated with the amount of remnant vegetation within a 5-km radius of the farm boundary, and with the condition of native vegetation on the farm. The average size of remnant vegetation patches was 5 ha or less on nearly half of the properties surveyed. At the farm scale, ant species richness was correlated with site features, while beetles were correlated with management/system features such as the presence and fertility of perennial pastures.Analyses at the functional group level will provide more detailed information on relationships between different land-use types. Further experimental work needs to be undertaken to qualify the suggested impact of land management practices on different taxa, while repeated surveys will allow for the collation of datasets over time, from which population dynamics may be determined.

I expected that WbW would use plots with higher amount of dead wood in more advanced decay stage, with higher amount of birches Betula spp. and aspen Populus tremula, and with more large trees. Within 50, 0.25-ha plots (25 used by WbW and 25 random) tree-species composition, tree condition, tree diameter at breast height DBH and characteristics of dead trees were measured. WbW and random plots were similar in overall structure; only the volume of fallen timber was significantly larger in WbW than in random plots (65.3 and 47.4 m(3)/ba, respectively). There was also a tendency for the occurrence of more snags of 11-20 cm DBH within WbW plots. Thus, the amount of fallen timber might determine WbW choice of the foraging habitat. However, due to the relatively high similarity of WbW vs. random plots, the sections of Bialowieza National Park that are covered with old-growth deciduous stands represent high-quality habitat for WbW foraging.

Large reserves have potential to provide important refugia for fragmentation-sensitive species as they lack many aspects of habitat degradation associated with fragmented regions. However, large reserves often have a history of deleterious management practices that may affect the restoration of biological diversity. One significant symptom of habitat fragmentation and disturbance in Australia is the increased occurrence of the aggressive noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). In Queensland, however, even large continuous areas of woodland appear to be dominated by the noisy miner.Aims. We examined the severity of this phenomenon by identifying the interactions between habitat structure, noisy miner abundance and avian assemblages in a private and a public conservation reserve in central Queensland. We investigated potential constraints on restoration of avian diversity including: (1) how changes in habitat structure as a result of grazing by feral animals and burning regimes affect bird assemblages; and (2) how the noisy miner impacts on avian assemblages in these unfragmented woodlands.Methods. Bird surveys and habitat assessments were conducted in 49 sites on three separate occasions. Fire history and intensity of grazing pressure were determined for each site with direct and indirect observations. Sampling for lerp from insects of the family Psyllidae was also undertaken during the survey periods. A Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach was used to model avian response to each of the habitat variables.Key results. The noisy miner dominated most of the study area, reducing small passerine abundance and species richness. Noisy miners were advantaged where shrub cover was low and feral grazing impacts were evident. Disturbance factors including recent wild. re and heavy grazing strongly reduced small passerine bird richness and abundance.Conclusions. Reducing the abundance of this 'reverse keystone' species requires control of feral herbivore populations and modi. cation of. re regimes to achieve a mosaic including patches with a dense shrub layer.Implications. Deleterious interactions with competitive native species, such as noisy miners, are obstacles to bird conservation not only in fragmented landscapes but also in large, continuous woodland areas. Land mangers of protected areas need to be aware of shifts in interactions among native species driven by habitat disturbance, which may ultimately affect conservation outcomes.

We assessed changes in the relative abundance of cavity nesting birds in two intensities of partial cutting, compared to uncut and clearcut stands, 9 years post-treatment. We then examined the relationship between forest structure and nesting abundance (stand scale) and compared characteristics of used nest and forage trees to unused trees (tree scale). The relative abundance of most species was highest in either heavy removal or light removal treatments 9 years post-harvest. Brown creepers were most abundant in uncut, and red-breasted sapsuckers were most abundant in clearcut and heavy removal treatments. The proportion of deciduous trees and the density of dead trees were the best predictors of nest abundance. Individual nest tree use was predicted by the presence of large deciduous trees with broken tops and early to advanced stages of decay. Forage tree use was predicted by the presence of large conifer trees in advanced stages of decay. To maintain breeding habitat for cavity nesters, we suggest that forest managers retain the specific structural attributes required for nesting, but also the diverse forest conditions required for foraging.

Predicting the response of biota to disturbance is therefore important, but it nevertheless remains difficult to make accurate forecasts of response. We tested predictions from disturbance-related theories and concepts in 10 vegetation types at Booderee National Park (southeastern Australia) using a retrospective study of bird responses to. re history (over 35 years) on 110 sites and a prospective study following a single wild. re event in 2003 at 59 of these sites. Our data did not support predictions from the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis; observed bird species richness at a site was significantly (F-1,F-99 = 6.30, P = 0.014) negatively related to the number of fires since 1972 and was 8.7% lower (95% CI, 1.8 -15.1%) for each additional. re. In contrast to. re history effects, we found that after the 2003. re, the vast majority of individual species and the bird assemblage per se in most vegetation types recovered within two years. Thus, recovery after a single. re did not reflect long-term effects of multiple fires on overall bird species richness at a site. We postulated that the recovery of bird species richness and bird assemblage composition after the 2003. re would be fastest in structurally simple vegetation types and slowest in structurally complex vegetation, but observed the opposite. Although observed bird species richness in vertically heterogeneous forest and woodland had returned to prefire levels by 2006, bird species richness in structurally simple vegetation types (e. g., sedgeland) had not. Post. re vegetation regeneration, together with a paucity of early-successional specialists, would explain the speed of recovery of the bird assemblage and why it changed relatively little during our investigation.

Age of woodland and amount of dead wood were found to be positive parameters and density of roads/paths and altitude to be negative parameters. In the montane mixed woodland zone, analysis of management types indicated significantly higher numbers of cavities in old woods and in non-intervention trial areas compared with managed areas. At higher altitudes also, supply of cavities is better in nonintervention areas. Use of a regression tree showed that presence of 5 cavities per hectare led to approximately double the number of cavity-breeding species. The analyses substantiate not just the outstanding role of old woods in providing an abundance of cavities, but also that of the non-intervention areas. Although management in the latter stopped only a few decades ago, they are developing into natural woods, with better conditions for woodpeckers and cavity-breeders.

The portion of Planalto Meridional Brasileiro that corresponds to northeast Rio Grande do Sul and south-southeastern of Santa Catarina holds a high bird species richness that represents about 55% of all birds known for Rio Grande do Sul and a little more than 45% of the birds for Santa Catarina. Great portion of this environment is characterized by highland grasslands also known as Campos de Cima da Serra. The grassland avian fauna of the highlands are actually under minor number of published research than the forest avifauna of the Atlantic Forest Biome - Atlantic Forest sensu stricto and Araucaria Forest. Despite this an important parcel of the threatened or near-threatened birds (33%) are grassland species. It may reflect the situation of their habitats, which are under intensive anthropogenic pressure due to, for example, extensive monocultures plantations of Pinus spp., for timber or other uses; hydroelectric dams; roads, inappropriate field management with fire and other kind of human environmental modifications. Based on almost all literature produced about the region and the field work done along the last 10 years focusing on the highlands and their species, we elaborated a brief diagnostic of the knowledge produced until here. We also described the situation of conservation considering the diversity and composition of birds and their habitats. We concluded that the number of published papers about stricted grassland birds is four times lower than the ones that involve birds of forested habitats. We presented 42 new records and/or distribution extensions of birds for the studied region, which reflects the current lack of knowledge about its specific diversity. We emphasized the necessity of conservation initiatives that consider important areas to grassland birds. We indicated four biodiversity conservation priority areas.

In the Pampa biome cattle raising and agriculture expansion are the main threats to the avifauna associated to open habitats. In this study I assess the presence of grassland bird species in four grassland patches of different sizes (20 ha, n = 1; 1 ha, n = 3) in a farmland in the west-central State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. I established six sampling points (three in the largest patch and one in each of the small patches) and conducted monthly samplings from April 2005 to March 2006. Cattle were excluded from these fragments for four years to enable habitat restoration. I also calculated similarity indexes between pairs of sampling points and made some observations on the use of adjacent agricultural fields by birds. Fifty five bird species were recorded, 31 of them exclusively in the largest patch, which harbored more species (n = 53) than the smaller ones (n = 16, 18 and 15). Threatened and data deficient species, such as Porzana albicollis, Culicivora caudacuta, Gubernetes yetapa and Sporophila bouvreuil were recorded mainly in the largest patch during the survey. Additionally, in this same patch, Synallaxis albescens, Polystictus pectoralis, Sporophila cinnamomea, Sporophila palustris and Cistothorus platensis were recorded outside surveys. Highest similarity indexes were found among sampling points of the larger patch. Finally I observed 35 species using agricultural fields in the vicinity of grasslands patches, including Bartramia longicauda and G. yetapa. Most of them frequently move between grassland patches and agricultural fields.

It has been shown that the replacement of primary dark conifer-deciduous forests by secondary forests is accompanied by a significant decrease in bird population density, with some species being lost and the composition of the dominant species group being changed. On the other hand, fires lead to increasing patchiness of the environment, which can sometimes provide for an increase in biological diversity.	Kolbin, V.

I examined vegetation and bird abundance at three locations within a highly fragmented Polylepis forest landscape in the Cordillera Vilcanota, southern Peru. Across the landscape, there was significant variation in the vegetation structure of Polylepis forest patches of different size categories, especially in terms of tree girth, tree height, tree density, and canopy vegetation structure. Principal Component Analysis extracted five factors of habitat quality, which together accounted for 74.2% of the variability within 15 habitat variables. Polylepis bird species differed in their responses to habitat quality but, overall, variation in Polylepis bird abundance was not fully captured by the range of habitat quality variables. Tall, dense vegetation cover was clearly important for 11 conservation-important species, a high density of large trees was important for 10 species and primary forest ground cover was important for eight species. Habitat quality exhibited no significant influence on the abundance of only one species - Asthenes urubambensis. The abundance of seven species was associated with lower elevation forest, but only one species was associated with higher elevation forest. Management of habitat quality in large and medium remnant forest patches throughout the Cordillera Vilcanota, particularly in the 3800-4200 m elevation range, will be a cornerstone in ensuring the persistence of the majority of conservation-important bird species populations.

During the 2001 and 2002 breeding seasons, we examined the relationship between bird communities and environmental variables, including vegetation characteristics and site prescribed-burn frequencies. across a habitat gradient in dry oak savannas in central Minnesota. The habitat gradient we studied went from: (1) prairie to (2) remnant oak savanna to (3) oak woodland undergoing savanna restoration via fire or mechanical removal of woody vegetation to (4) oak woodland. We conducted fixed-radius point Counts (n = 120) within habitats with either prairie groundcover or predominately oak canopy. We described canopy and groundcover characteristics at a sub-sample (n = 28) of non-prairie points. and collected canopy and woody species richness data and prescribed-burn frequencies over the past 20 years for all points. Observed bird communities were most strongly correlated with canopy cover and burn frequency and, to a lesser extent, attributes of the shrub component. Most savanna points had bird communities that were distinct from those found at oak woodland or oak woodland points undergoing restoration via burning. Savanna points similar to oak woodland points were in areas managed by periodic cutting rather than burning. Remnant savanna bird communities were more strongly associated with prescribed burning than those in other habitat types. but it appeared that most oak woodlands that had undergone 20 year's of prescribed burning remained ecologically distinct from remnant savannas. This suggests that some savannas that have converted to oak woodlands may exist in an alternative, or,table. ecological state even following extended restoration efforts.

The white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) is one of several specialised forest species whose populations have declined. Conservation management directed at this species' habitat has made it a de facto umbrella species for conservation of the biodiversity associated with forests rich in deciduous trees and dead wood. We assessed empirically the value of the white-backed woodpecker as an indicator and umbrella species in central Sweden. Occurrence of the woodpecker in breeding bird atlas squares (5 x 5 km(2)) indicated high species richness of forest birds, particularly species of special conservation concern, which included on average 13% more species in squares with than without the woodpecker. The number of red-listed cryptogam species expected to benefit from conservation actions directed at white-backed woodpecker habitats was higher in squares where the woodpecker bred compared to where is was absent. However, no such pattern was found for red-listed beetles, a group with very few records in the studied squares. White-backed woodpecker occurrence was positively associated with the current area of deciduous and mixed forest of high conservation value. Considering its indicator value, its specialised habitat requirements and its potential as a communication tool, using the white-backed woodpecker as an umbrella species may provide a coarse filter for the conservation of several other deciduous forest species. However, focusing solely on white-backed woodpecker habitat may not provide for the conservation of all such species, which stresses the need for a suite of complementary planning approaches.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2008	SEP 2008	72	7	1596-1604	1596	1604	English						1	24	Grassland birds have declined more than any other North American habitat-associated bird community. Because most species of grassland birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines, especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an alternative grassland management practice known as patch-burning has been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296 dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures. Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides further evidence that this practice can he a useful tool for grassland bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation, patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g., trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects of grazing, which are not available under traditional management. Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains.

One such regime is use of the selective herbicide Imazapyr (Arsenal Applicators Concentrate) and prescribed burning, which is permitted on CRP lands and cost share payments are available. This study quantified combined effects of Imazapyr and prescribed fire on the breeding season avian community characteristics and pine volume growth in thinned, midrotation afforested loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations in Mississippi. Herbicide treatments were applied in fall of 2002 and winter burns were conducted during winter and early spring of 2002-2003. ES bird species richness was significantly greater in the treated plots compared with controls for both 2003 and 2004. Ten individual species exhibited treatment effects.

We have limited knowledge about the effects of human activities on native species in these landscapes and which, if any, management practices might enhance the conservation of native biodiversity within them. Through a citizen volunteer bird-monitoring project, we compared bird abundance and species richness in northern Californian riparian zones surrounded by vineyards, urban areas, and natural areas. We assessed both local and landscape-level variables that may enhance native bird diversity in each land use type. We also demonstrate a new statistical approach, generalized estimating equations, to analyze highly variable data, such as that collected by volunteers. Avian abundance was highly correlated with both landscape context and local habitat variables, while avian richness was correlated with local habitat variables, specifically shrub richness, and percent of tree cover. In particular, shrub species richness has a strong positive correlation with riparian-preferring bird species. This suggests that active local management of riparian zones in human-dominated landscapes can increase our ability to retain native bird species in these areas.

Fuel-reduction treatments did not affect species richness or evenness, and effects on density of 5 commonly detected species varied among species. Populations of some species, such as the western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), increased following burning treatments, whereas others, such as the mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli), decreased in response to thinning treatments. Our results also identified a temporal response component, where avian community composition and structure changed synchronously on all treatments over time. Given the modest effects these small-scale fuel-reduction treatments had on avian composition and the specific density responses of particular species, our results suggest that land managers should consider implementing prescribed surface fire after thinning projects, where appropriate.

Bird community and abundance measures revealed that there was considerably variation in bird species richness, diversity and mean encounter rates between large, medium, and small forest patches. Densities of Polylepis-dependent bird species (including five globally-threatened and eight restricted-range species) were greater in larger forest patches and differed significantly between different patch size categories. Density estimates for matrix-dependent species were higher in smaller Polylepis patches indicating that the matrix exerts an influence on bird species composition and abundance in remnant Polylepis forests, particularly smaller patches. Comparison of lowland forest habitat specialists using three categories of rarity revealed that between 19-22% of all Polylepis-dependent species were intrinsically rare within larger forest patches, and a greater number (34-74%) were rare in smaller forest patches. Population estimates for all species, in particular for all threatened species, were extremely low, numbering <= 10 individuals at nine of the ten sites examined. The results suggest that declines in the densities of certain Polylepis birds may be predictable following habitat loss and that these patterns of rarity should govern population recovery goals through appropriate habitat restoration strategies. Such strategies are urgently required and must be designed to prevent further habitat loss, and to increase Polylepis habitat quantity to boost threatened bird populations in the Cordillera Vilcanota.

We analyzed data following a diversity/dominance approach that ranks the species in order of their abundance, to obtain rank/abundance diagrams ('Whittaker plots'). Although it is generally accepted that fire may induce structural changes in forest communities of breeding birds, we observed more evident effects when considering the assemblage of forest-specialist species. When considering the whole community of birds, ordinate intercepts of the regression between rank and relative abundance of species were not significantly different between unburnt and burnt plots in any of the three years of study. However, when considering only the forest-related species, there was a significant difference between unburnt and burnt plots in all the years of study. Evenness showed lower values that were explicited by the diversity/dominance diagrams (lower collocation of the curves of burnt pinewoods if compared to unburnt ones). Overall, the patterns observed in this study suggest that the effects of fire disturbance were more evident at the ecological level than at the taxonomic-level assemblages. The gradual decline of the more sensitive species due to fires and the proportional increase of edge/generalist species may induce a species turnover in burnt woods with cascade and relaxation effects which could be evidenced by diversity/dominance diagrams. Consequently, it is useful to separate the effects of fires at community-level and at assemblage-level when studying bird communities in areas subjected to fires.

Because Cerulean Warblers tend to nest in large deciduous trees, they are especially at risk due to deforestation of mature tree stands. Few studies have examined the effects of specific silvicultural practices (i.e., group and single tree selection harvesting methods) on the distribution and abundance of the Cerulean Warbler. During the summers of 2005 and 2006, Cerulean Warblers were surveyed within the Morgan-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests, as well as the Hoosier National Forest in southern Indiana. Three treatment types were surveyed: unharvested reference sites (stands 35-100+ years old) were compared with single tree selection treatments and treatments where a combination of group and single tree selection was used (stands 2-30 years old). Mean bird abundance was estimated from bird surveys to determine if trends exists between silvicultural regimes and Cerulean Warbler abundance. Cerulean Warblers were located in all treatment types, with no significant differences (p = 0.654) in abundance among treatment types examined (unharvested - 0.36, single tree - 0.46, group and single tree combination - 0.36). These results suggest that uneven-age management practices, such as single tree and group selection harvesting, provide suitable breeding habitat for Cerulean Warblers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

One reason for limited effectiveness of AESs may be their application to small and scattered patches of land. This study presents the evaluation of a scheme adopted by the canton of Aargau, Switzerland, which seems to be unique in its consequent focus on entire farms, aiming at increasing quality and quantity of ecological compensated areas (ECAs). In vascular plants and snails, the species richness increased during a period of 5 years on plots with AES, but not on control plots without AES. In butterflies and birds, no significant differences were found between AES plots and control plots in the change of species richness over time. While butterfly species numbers generally decreased, bird species numbers increased on both AES plots and control plots. It appears that agri-environment schemes can be effective in protecting and promoting biodiversity, but the effect may depend on the group of organisms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, there is a remarkable lack of information on the impact of forestry on native biodiversity. We analyzed the effect of Pinus ponderosa plantations on bird communities, considering different stand management practices (dense and sparse tree covers), and different landscape contexts where they are planted (Austrocedrus chilensis forest and steppe). Ultimately we wished to assess in which way plantations may be designed and managed to improve biodiversity conservation. Bird richness and abundance did not change significantly in the steppe, although community composition did, and was partially replaced by a new community, similar to that of ecotonal forests. In contrast, in the A. chilensis forest areas, species richness decreased in dense plantations, but bird community composition remained relatively constant when replacing the native forest with pine plantations. Also, in A. chilensis forest, stand management practices aiming at maintaining low tree densities permit the presence of many bird species from the original habitat. In the steppe area in turn, both dense and sparse plantations are unsuitable for most steppe species, thus it is necessary to manage them at higher scales, maintaining the connectivity of the native matrix to prevent the fragmentation of bird populations. We conclude that pine plantations can provide habitat for a substantial number of native bird species, and this feature varies both with management practices and with the landscape context of areas where afforestation occurs.

We developed compositional, structural and functional indicators of biodiversity for five taxonomic groups-bryophytes, vascular plants, spiders, hoverflies and birds-using data from 44 Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) plantation forests in Ireland. The best structural biodiversity indicator was stand stage, defined using a multivariate classification of forest structure variables. However, biodiversity trends over the forest cycle and between tree species differ among the taxonomic groups studied. Canopy cover was the main structural indicator and affected other structural variables such as cover of lower vegetation layers. Other structural indicators included deadwood and distances to forest edge and to broadleaved woodland. Functional indicators included stand age, site environmental characteristics and management practices. Compositional indicators were limited to more easily identifiable plant and bird species. Our results suggest that the biodiversity of any one of the species groups we surveyed cannot act as a surrogate for all of the other species groups. However, certain subgroups, such as forest bryophytes and saproxylic hoverflies, may be able to act as surrogates for each other. The indicators we have identified should be used together to identify stands of potentially high biodiversity or to evaluate the biodiversity effects of silvicultural management practices. They are readily assessed by non-specialists, ecologically meaningful and applicable over a broad area with similar climate conditions and silvicultural systems. The approach we have used to develop biodiversity indicators, including stand structural types, is widely relevant and can enhance sustainable forest management of plantations.

The study was conducted within the context of two alternative vegetation management treatments applied to pastures on a tallgrass prairie site in northcentral Oklahoma from 2001 to 2003. The brown-headed cowbird, a brood parasite, and the grasshopper sparrow, a common grassland obligate species, were most abundant in areas managed under a traditional treatment in which entire pastures were annually burned. Conversely, Henslow's sparrow, a grassland obligate of conservation concern, was completely absent from traditional treatment pastures. Total bird species diversity and grassland obligate richness was highest in the patch-burn treatment, in which only discrete portions of each pasture were burned each year to create a mosaic of vegetation 'patches' in various stages of recovery from disturbance. Models of bird abundance reflected not only species-specific vegetation preferences, but also the often negative influence of structural features such as woody edges, roads, and ponds on breeding bird use of grasslands. Our study demonstrated that both disturbance-derived vegetation attributes and structural features contribute to heterogeneity and influence subsequent use by and composition of grassland bird communities.

Four of the 11 bird species, the American robin (Turdus migratorius L., 1766), the chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina (Bechstein, 1798)), the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis Latham, 1790), and the western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana (A. Wilson, 1811)), showed responses to the treatments. Species richness did not differ between the silvicultural or the burn treatments. The general lack of response of the bird community to the silvicultural and burn treatments is likely a result of the relatively large size of the trees and snags retained on both silvicultural treatments, the low intensity of the prescribed burns, and the lack of a strong contrast in tree density between the silvicultural treatments.

While critical for birds, this river is vulnerable to salt cedar (tamarisk, Tamarix spp.) invasion, woody encroachment into grassland, and alteration of hydrologic regime resulting from groundwater pumping. Bird species richness and community composition metrics provide a means to assess effects of management or conservation efforts. To estimate these metrics, we used methods that incorporated species detection probabilities from data collected at 160 points at 23 sites on the San Pedro River during 1998-2001. Species richness, co-occurrence, and uniqueness were estimated as a function of four riparian vegetation types (cottonwood-willow [Populus-Salix], salt cedar, mesquite [Prosopis spp], and grassland), three hydrologic regimes (perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral), and riparian location (floodplain and terrace). We found significantly higher species richness in cottonwood and mesquite compared with salt cedar and grassland. Intermittent and perennial flow sites had higher species richness compared with ephemeral. Cottonwood and mesquite supported more unique species compared with grassland and salt cedar, and cottonwood or perennial sites supported canopy or water-dependent species, for which habitat is rare on the landscape. Within the intermittent class, salt cedar maintained all estimated 0-2 unique species compared with native woody vegetation types, while cottonwood and mesquite contributed all estimated 20-21 unique species compared with salt cedar. Thus, while maintaining relatively high species richness, salt cedar contributed little to regional avian diversity compared with native woody riparian vegetation. This research has important implications for regional conservation planning and riparian restoration efforts.	Brand, L.

Little is known, however, about specific structural characteristics of Gambel oak trees, clumps, and stands that may be important to birds in ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (hereafter pine-oak) forests. We examined associations among breeding birds and structural characteristics of Gambel oak at a scale similar in size to individual bird territories in pine-oak forests in northern Arizona and western New Mexico, USA. Avian species richness and occurrence of some bird species were associated with specific growth forms of Gambel oak. Estimated probability of Virginia's warblers (Vermivora virginiae), black-headed grosbeaks (Pheucticus melanocephalus), and red-faced warblers (Cardellina rubrifrons) occurring at points increased with increasing density of pole-sized Gambel oak 715 cm in diameter at breast height. We also found evidence that large Gambel oak trees (>= 23 cm dbh) were associated with increased occurrence of yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata) at points. Some avian associations with oak were influenced by characteristics of ponderosa pines. For example, bird species richness was positively associated with the abundance of large Gambel oak when density of large pine trees >= 23 cm in diameter at breast height was low. Because large oak trees are rare and their numbers are thought to be declining, efforts should be made to retain and promote growth of additional oaks in this size class. Forest management practices that maintain forest openings, such as prescribed burning, could promote growth of pole-sized Gambel oak, which appears important to some bird species in pine-oak forests.

As suggested by recent studies on hatching success, however, Redshank reproduction is spatially variable and cannot reliably explain the population trend mentioned above. From 2004 to 2006, a telemetry study on Redshank chicks was conducted in Petersgroden (mainland) and on the island of Wangerooge to record annual breeding success and its spatial variability and to derive predictions on future population trends. Due to lower predation, birds on Wangerooge achieved considerably higher hatching success than birds at the mainland (2005/06: 64 and 93 of clutches vs. 4 to 15 %, 2004-2005). Apart from total losses due to weather conditions in 2004 at the mainland, chick mortality was relatively constant between regions and years (70-80 %). Derived from chick mortality, breeding success was 0.51 (2005) and 1.0 (2006) chicks per pair on Wangerooge and constantly 0.15 chicks per pair at the mainland. Considering published estimates of annual subadult (35 %) and adult (25 %) mortality, breeding success achieved during this study should not be sufficient to maintain the regional population of the mainland study site. In contrast, the Wangerooge population produced more chicks than needed to sustain its local population. The assumption of spatially varying reproduction of Redshanks breeding in the Wadden Sea could be confirmed by this study. However, it still has to be clarified whether Redshank population dynamics is explained by this varying breeding success. Due to a lack of knowledge in annual survival rates, the necessity of initiating an integrated population monitoring project is discussed. As additionally revealed by chick telemetry, non-fledged chicks were found up to only about 200 m from its former nest site and used about 0.4 ha of the respective saltmarsh habitat. Small home range sizes of Redshank broods within the saltmarsh suggest a potential vulnerability to agricultural habitat management, especially to mowing. Derived from these results, it is unlikely that agriculture is an appropriate way of managing saltmarsh for breeding birds.

Canopy height, total foliage cover, tree density, total basal area of tree, total basal area of snags, foliage height diversity, and tree species richness all increased with successional age. However, shrub cover peaked in intermediate successional stages. The vertical profile of foliage cover was more diverse in later successional forests, which had more breeding bird species and ecological guilds. All the breeding bird species recorded in early and intermediate stages were also found distributed in the late successional forests. Because Taiwan has high precipitation and humidity, and most forest fires in Taiwan are caused by human activities, forest fires and large areas of early successional vegetation were probably rare in the mountain areas of Taiwan prior to the arrival of humans. Therefore, bird species have not had enough time to adapt to areas with early or intermediate successional vegetation. Moreover, late successional forests host all the major plant species found in the early and intermediate stages and have higher foliage height diversity index, which was positively correlated with the bird species richness and bird species diversity index in this study. As a result, all breeding bird species and guilds in the area can be found in late successional forests. Efforts for conserving avian diversity in Taiwan should focus on protecting the remaining native old-growth forests. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The increased spatial extent of commercial timber harvesting is modifying forest structure across the land base and may thus compromise the availability of large trees at the landscape scale. In this study, our objectives were to (1) characterize the availability of large living and dead trees in old-growth stands dominated by different tree species and surficial deposits that encompass the range of natural cover types of eastern Quebec's boreal forest; (2) analyze the distribution of trees among decay-classes; and (3) compare the availability of large trees in unharvested, remnant, and harvested stands for the entire range of decay-classes. A total of 116 line transects were distributed across unharvested forests, remnant linear forests, and cutblocks in cutover areas. Unharvested forest stands (black spruce [Picea mariana], balsam fir [Abies balsamea]-black spruce, balsam fir-white spruce [Picea glauca] and balsam fir) reflected a gradient of balsam fir dominance. The remnant forests selected were isolated for 5-15 years. Analyses were performed at two diameter cut-off values. Trees with DBH > 20 cm were considered for availability of total trees whereas trees with DBH > 30 cm were considered for availability of large trees. Forest stands comprised high proportions of standing dead trees (33% of all stems, 8% were large dead stems). Availability of total and large standing trees increased with the dominance of balsam fir in stands. Forest stands located on thick surficial deposits showed higher densities of large dead trees for every stand type suggesting a higher productivity on those sites. Availability of stems according to decay-classes showed a dome-shaped distribution with higher densities of snags in intermediate decay stages. However, for large stems, black spruce stands showed a significantly lower availability that was consistent across all decay-classes. In linear remnant forests, pure balsam fir stands were absent. Remnant stands thus showed a much lower availability in large trees when compared with unharvested balsam fir stands. Clearcuts had the lowest densities of dead trees across sampled stands. Current even-aged management practices clearly affect availability and recruitment of large trees, therefore forest-dwelling wildlife relying on these structures for breeding is likely to be affected by large-scale harvesting in coniferous boreal forests.

However, the role of such features in habitat selection and demography of individual species has not been established. Understanding the mechanisms of habitat selection requires both experimental manipulation of habitat structure and detailed estimation of the behavioral and demographic response of animals, e. g., changes in movement patterns and survival probabilities. Such studies have not been conducted in natural tropical forest, perhaps because of high habitat heterogeneity, high species diversity, and low abundances of potential target species. Agroforestry systems support a less diverse. ora, with greater spatial homogeneity which, in turn, harbors lower overall species diversity with greater numerical dominance of common species, than natural forests. Furthermore, agroforestry systems are already extensively managed and lend themselves easily to larger scale habitat manipulations than protected natural forest. Thus, agroforestry systems provide a good model environment for beginning to understand processes underlying habitat selection in tropical forest animals. Here, we use multistate, capture-recapture models to investigate how the experimental removal of epiphytes affected monthly movement and survival probabilities of two resident bird species (Common Bush-Tanager [Chlorospingus ophthalmicus] and Golden-crowned Warbler [Basileuterus culicivorus]) in a Mexican shade coffee plantation. We established two paired plots of epiphyte removal and control. We found that Bush-Tanagers were at least five times more likely to emigrate from plots where epiphytes were removed compared to control plots. Habitat-specific movement patterns were not detected in the warbler. However, unlike the Golden-crowned Warbler, Common Bush-Tanagers depend upon epiphytes for nest sites and (seasonally) for foraging. These dispersal patterns imply that active habitat selection based on the presence or absence of epiphytes occurs in C. ophthalmicus on our study area. Survival rates did not vary with habitat in either species. Interestingly, in both species, survival was higher in the nonbreeding season, when birds were in mixed-species flocks. Movement by Common Bush-Tanagers into areas with epiphytes occurred mostly during the breeding season, when mortality-driven opportunity was greatest.

Wetlands enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) provide many ecological functions but may be particularly important as habitat for migrant and resident waterbirds; however, use of, and factors associated with use of, CREP wetlands as stopover and breeding sites have not been evaluated. We surveyed a random sample of CREP wetlands in the Illinois River watershed in 2004 and 2005 to quantify use of restored wetlands by spring migrating and breeding waterbirds. Waterbirds used 75% of wetlands during spring migration. Total use-day abundance for the entire spring migration ranged from 0 to 49,633 per wetland and averaged 6,437 +/- 1,887 (SE). Semipermanent wetlands supported the greatest total number of use-days and the greatest number of use-days relative to wetland area. Species richness ranged from 0 to 42 ((x) over bar = 10.0 +/- 1.5 [SE]), and 5 of these species were classified as endangered in Illinois. Density of waterfowl breeding pairs ranged from 0.0 pairs/ha to 16.6 pairs/ha ((x) over bar = 1.9 +/- 0.5 [SE] pairs/ha), and 16 species of wetland birds were identified as local breeders. Density of waterfowl broods ranged from 0.0 broods/ha to 3.6 broods/ha and averaged 0.5 +/- 0.1 (SE) broods/ha. We also modeled spring stopover use, waterbird species richness, and waterfowl reproduction in relation to spatial, physical, and floristic characteristics of CREP wetlands. The best approximating models to explain variation in all 3 dependent variables included only the covariate accounting for level of hydrologic management (i.e., none, passive, or active). Active management was associated with 858% greater use-days during spring than sites with only passive water management. Sites where hydrology was passively managed also averaged 402% greater species richness than sites where no hydrologic management was possible. Density of waterfowl broods was 120% greater on passively managed sites than on sites without water management but was 29% less on sites with active compared to passive hydrologic management. Densities of waterfowl broods also were greatest when ratios of open water to cover were 70:30. Models that accounted for vegetation quality and landscape variables ranked lower than models based solely on hydrologic management or vegetation cover in all candidate sets. Although placement and clustering of sites may be critical for maintaining populations of some wetland bird species, these factors appeared to be less important for attracting migrant waterbirds in our study area. In the context of restored CREP wetlands, we suggest the greatest gains in waterbird use and reproduction may be accomplished by emphasizing site-specific restoration efforts related to hydrology and floristic structure.

Several differences were apparent in patterns of relative abundance compared to the 1980s. In particular marked declines of Tree Sparrow and Corn Bunting were apparent. The national distribution of cereal stubbles was localized. A large proportion of most species was found in grassland. Positive associations at the patch scale were apparent for improved grassland by invertebrate feeders and cereal and maize stubbles and farmyards, mostly by granivores.Conclusion Many farmland passerines are highly aggregated, even within particularly favoured field types. These results are consistent with winter food resources being highly localized and the need to create more food-rich patches if declines are to be reversed.

Restoration Ecology		2008	MAR 2008	16	1	155-167	155	167	English						0	31	Many of the world's large river systems have been greatly altered in the past century due to river regulation, agriculture, and invasion of introduced Tamarix spp. (saltcedar, tamarisk). These riverine ecosystems are known to provide important habitat for avian communities, but information on responses of birds to differing levels of Tamarix is not known. Past research on birds along the Colorado River has shown that avian abundance in general is greater in native than in non-native habitat. In this article, we address habitat restoration on the lower Colorado River by comparing abundance and diversity of avian communities at a matrix of different amounts of native and non-native habitats at National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona. Two major patterns emerged from this study: (1) Not all bird species responded to Tamarix in a similar fashion, and for many bird species, abundance was highest at intermediate Tamarix levels (40-60%), suggesting a response threshold. (2) In Tamarix-dominated habitats, the greatest increase in bird abundance occurred when small amounts of native vegetation were present as a component of that habitat. In fact, Tamarix was the best vegetation predictor of avian abundance when compared to vegetation density and canopy cover. Our results suggest that to positively benefit avian abundance and diversity, one cost-effective way to rehabilitate larger monoculture Tamarix stands would be to add relatively low levels of native vegetation (similar to 20-40%) within homogenous Tamarix habitat. In addition, this could be much more cost effective and feasible than attempting to replace all Tamarix with native vegetation.	van Riper, Charles, III; Univ Arizona, US Geol Survey, SW Biol Sci Ctr SDRS, 125 Biol Sci E, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA						Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation	1061-2971	1526-100X	10.1111/j.1526-100X.2007.00354.x		Biogeography (Population Studies); Ecology (Environmental Sciences); Conservation; Biodiversity	00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 50528, Botany: general and systematic - Floristics and distribution; 62800, Animal distribution	Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Tamaricaceae [26835]; [Tamarix]					Arizona; USA, North America; Nearctic region/Colorado River; USA, North America; Nearctic region				species abundance; habitat restoration; riverine ecosystem				2019-04-10	J	BIOSIS:PREV200800329449	PREV200800329449		Article		Bird community responses to reduced-impact logging in a certified forestry concession in lowland Bolivia		Felton, Adam (adamf@cres.anu.edu.au) ; Wood, Jeff (jeff.Wood@anu.edu.au) ; Felton, Annika M.

The logged forest was harvested using reduced-impact logging techniques between one and four years previously We used canonical correspondence analysis to describe the relationship between selected environmental variables and bird species abundance data, and the indicator Value procedure to test for associations between bird species and the logged and unlogged habitats. Approximately one-third of birds were restricted to either the logged or unlogged areas, with 20% of all species only encountered in, or significantly more abundant in, the unlogged areas of the concession. The majority of birds found in significantly higher abundance in the unlogged areas of the concession were associated with forest habitats dominated by large trees, or a high diversity of trees, providing dense canopy cover and deep leaf litter, with an understorey dominated by ferns. Over 40% of bird species that were significantly associated with the unlogged areas of the concession are of conservation concern. In contrast, the majority of birds associated with the logged areas of the concession are known to be relatively resilient to human disturbance. The majority of species which exhibited significant lower abundances in the logged areas of the concession belonged to insectivorous or frugivorous feeding guilds. We discuss whether current management practices within this certified concession are sustainable and how our results can be used to guide future research and inform better practice.

Our objectives were to examine nesting densities, reproductive parameters, and species-specific habitat selection of woodpeckers in a recently burned region of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, between 2001 and 2004. Postfire nesting densities were greatest in areas dominated by high prefire canopy cover, and reproductive success averaged >70%. For some species of woodpeckers, factors such as diameter at breast height, burn severity, and distance to unburned patches were important for nest-site selection. Our data indicated that nesting densities of many woodpeckers in the Black Hills were lower than what has been recorded elsewhere following recent, large wildfires in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. Management activities that simulate mixed-severity fire effects and retain higher numbers of large snags are likely to benefit cavity nesters in this region.

Cumulative pesticide applications over a large geographic-area have generated concerns about arsenic loading in the environment and potential toxicity to nontarget wildlife. We investigated woodpecker foraging patterns in infested stands with and without MSMA treatment using a combination of tree debarking indices, point count surveys, and radiotelemetry methods in addition to insect flight traps to measure mountain pine beetle emergence. Debarking indices indicated woodpecker foraging of MSMA-treated trees was significantly lower than nontreated trees in all sampling years. However, similar to 40% of MSMA trees had some evidence of foraging. Focal observations of foraging woodpeckers and point count surveys in MSMA treatment areas further confirmed that several species of woodpeckers regularly used MSMA stands during the breeding season. Radio-tagged Hairy (Picoides villosus) and Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) Woodpeckers spent on average 13% and 23% (range 0-66%) of their time, respectively, in treated stands, despite the fact that these areas only comprised on average I2% of their core home range ( 1 km(2)). MSMA strongly reduced the emergence of several bark beetle (Coleoptera, Scolytidae) species including the mountain pine beetle, and there was a highly significant positive relationship between Dendroctonus beetle abundance and Three-toed Woodpecker abundance. This study identifies the potential negative impact that forest management practices using pesticides can have on woodpecker populations that depend on bark beetles and their host trees.

Ibis		2008	JAN 2008	150	1	69-79	69	79	English						0	13	Predicting how bird populations may respond to climate change is a major challenge which could be addressed by understanding how past environmental processes have driven the variations of breeding population size and productivity. In inhabited regions, this issue may be complicated by the interference associated with heterogeneous levels of habitat management. Here, we have explored how several hydrological variables influenced the breeding of the Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus in the Camargue (Rhone delta, southern France) over a 28-year period (1974-2001). In this region, Flamingos breed in a commercial salt pan. They forage in both salt pans and adjacent brackish lagoons. We hypothesized that breeding numbers, productivity and body condition of chicks at fledging were influenced positively by water levels of the Vaccares, the main lagoon of the delta, in spring (water and food availability) and the Rhone discharge in winter (nutrient availability in the salt pans). We controlled for variations of the flooding date of the breeding salt pan by the salt company and the size of the breeding island. We first found the Vaccares water levels and Rhone discharge to be negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Secondly, the number of Flamingo breeding pairs (range 3560-22 200) increased by 1767 +/- 1418 (95% CI) with a 10-day advance of the flooding date of the breeding salt pan and by 1146 +/- 1081 per 10-cm water level rise in the Vaccares. Productivity was 0.46 +/- 0.41 chicks per pair and could not be explained by any of the variables considered. Finally, chick body condition decreased with the number of breeding pairs and Rhone discharge. Our results show that (1) this intensely managed system remains sensitive to large-scale climate variations, (2) the breeding of the Greater Flamingo is affected by both climate variations and management of the salt pan, and (3) the expected enhancement of delta productivity by high river discharge was absent, probably prevented by dykes and embankments along the river. The response of bird populations to climate variations can thus be complex in intensely managed biological systems as found in the Mediterranean. We encourage pursuing such analyses incorporating anthropogenic variables explicitly in order to expand our capacity to make inference on the future of these systems.

Canopy cover and width of woody riparian vegetation, both easily determined from remotely sensed data, were investigated as indicators of riparian quality. High correlations between field measurements of canopy cover and width of woody riparian vegetation with several other vegetation attributes indicative of vegetation quality (weed abundance, debris, human disturbance, native species richness) demonstrated that these two habitat attributes were suitable field vegetation quality surrogates. Desktop quality analysis combined GIS measurement of riparian width with aerial photographic analysis of canopy cover. Desktop quality equalled field quality in 78% of cases, with a further 13% showing errors due to clearing or thickening of vegetation after aerial photographs were taken.Bird communities in higher vegetation quality areas comprised mainly rainforest-dependent species, whereas poor quality areas mostly supported birds of open habitats. Bird community diversity and rainforest-dependent bird diversity increased significantly both with increasing levels of canopy cover and greater riparian width, but a combination of these factors explained more variance than each factor separately. Desktop riparian vegetation quality therefore proved a satisfactory indicator of habitat quality for birds in rainforest riparian zones.This quick and efficient desktop method of riparian habitat quality assessment can determine conservation values of rainforest riparian areas with minimal field validation, thereby allowing more effective targeting of appropriate management practices, identification of areas of conservation concern and prioritisation of revegetation and rehabilitation efforts.

Five weeks after the fire we surveyed 12 sites (six burnt, six unburnt); each pair of sites was closely matched for soil type and vegetation. The species richness and abundance of mammals and reptiles was greater at unburnt sites, especially for mammals (with a 4-fold difference in abundance between burnt and unburnt sites). There was an indication that reptiles immigrated into unburnt patches, but mammals did not. There were also species-specific responses to the fire: Rattus tunneyi and Pseudomys nanus were much more abundant in unburnt sites, whereas Pseudomys delicatulus was caught in equal numbers at burnt and unburnt sites. Diurnal reptiles were more abundant at unburnt sites, but nocturnal reptiles were equally common at burnt and unburnt sites. Avian species richness and overall abundance was similar between burnt and unburnt patches, although a few species showed preferences for one state or the other. The overall high trapping success for mammals (18% across all sites; 28% in unburnt patches) contrasts with the well documented mammal collapse in parts of northern Australia and seems paradoxical given that our study area has experienced the same increase in fire frequency and extent that is often blamed for species collapse. However, our study area has fewer pressures from other sources, including grazing by large herbivores, suggesting that the effects of these pressures, and their interaction with fire, may have been underestimated in previous studies.

We explored in four site types (ranging from dry nutrient-poor to wet nutrient-rich) in Estonia how the retention of live and dead trees affects post-cut abundance and species richness of birds. The whole bird communities and harvest-sensitive species groups responded differently: while the total abundance and relative species richness of birds increased along with the abundance of dead trees, the species of national conservation concern occurred more frequently at higher densities of live trees. Hence, although the species of conservation concern and hole-nesters preferred the cuts having the generally densest and most species-rich avian communities, this co-variation was obviously insufficient for using the total community characteristics (particularly density) as indicators of forestry impacts on bird biodiversity. In contrast to expectations, tree retention always influenced birds independently of forest type. This may be related to the particular study system (notably low retention levels) but future studies should nevertheless explicitly address to what extent forest species are adapted to natural disturbances, and in which cases that knowledge can be used for forestry planning.

Overall, avian community composition was changed as a result of the treatments. Cassin's Finch, Chipping Sparrow, and Yellow-rumped Warbler were found at higher densities in treated stands, whereas Mountain Chickadee, Western Tanager, and Red-breasted Nuthatch had higher densities in untreated stands. White-headed Woodpecker and Western Bluebird were only detected in the treated stands. Brown-headed Cowbird showed no response to treatments. We detected changes in the density of four of five foraging guilds in response to restoration treatments. Tree seedeaters, low understory and ground insectivores, and aerial insectivores all increased in density in treated stands. Overall, bark insectivores showed no density response to treatments. Tree foliage insectivore density was lower in treated than in untreated stands. Overall avian density, density of neotropical migrants, and density of some focal species were higher in treated stands. Monitoring should be continued to understand the longer-term (5-10 year) responses of land birds and to guide future forest restoration efforts.

Ants were sampled using pitfall traps in 6 sites for the elevation study and in 2 sites for the tree cover study, representing paired burn and control sites in a ran domized block design. Vegetation and ground cover variables were also sampled to determine how variation in ant populations was correlated with differences in vegetation and ground cover. Ant species richness remained unchanged for all treatments. Tree cover had no significant effect on ant populations. Significantly more ants were trapped after the burn treatment on burn plots. Variation in ant populations was not directly correlated with any of the vegetation or ground cover variables. According to ANOVA and multivariate analyses, elevation had the greatest effect on changes in ant communities, likely due to increased moisture availability Our results suggest that management for conservation of sagebrush-steppe ecosystems in this and similar watersheds should include a range of elevations to ensure maximum ant species diversity.

Home range size for 4 adult males during the post-fledging period was 115.6-420.9 ha using the 95% fixed-kernel method, and 150.4-766.1 ha using the 100% minimum convex polygon method. Smoothed bootstrap estimates (95%) were 130.0-521.9 ha. Home range sizes were significantly smaller 6 years after fire than 8 years after fire. Each male had from 2 to 8 areas of concentrated use within his home range. We provide recommendations for estimating area requirements of Black-backed Woodpeckers in post-fire ponderosa pine / Douglas-fir forests.

These species are now common in upland sites as a result of past land use and disruption of fire regimes. We investigated the effect this invasion had on breeding bird diversity in upland mixed pine (Pinus spp.) stands based on 90 point counts conducted in spring 2005. Half of these stands had no water oak or sweetgum (open stands) and half had a minimum of 25% of their basal area as water oak and/or sweetgum (invaded stands). Bird species richness and abundance were 42 and 41 % lower, respectively, in invaded stands. Thirty-five bird species had more than 20 records and were tested for an association with invaded stands. No species were positively associated with invaded stands while 10 were negatively associated with invaded stands; these were mostly grassland pine savanna and shrubland bird species of high conservation value. Invasion of upland pine forest by these native tree species is similar to invasion by exotic species, and appears to disrupt ecosystem function causing declines in bird diversity.

We applied bootstrap procedures to evaluate whether the observed data were true or just produced by chance, and then examined the emerging patterns at three levels: community, guild and species levels. At the community level, fire acted on breeding bird communities by altering especially the total abundance patterns: the species abundance decreased in the burnt pinewood compared to the residual one, but other parameters were not significantly affected by fire. As a consequence of fire, the destruction and structural simplification of the canopy and shrubby component, as well as the increase of edge habitat and patchiness at landscape scale, induced a turnover in species between pinewoods. Species turnover was higher at the burnt than at the residual pinewoods, during all the 3 years of study. At the guild level, the forest species decreased strongly in terms of richness and abundance in the burnt pinewoods, contrary to the edge and open habitat species which increased in terms of richness, abundance and evenness. Edge species showed the highest turnover in burnt pinewood during the whole period of study. At species level, after an a priori subdivision (based on bibliographic search) of the various species in two ecological guilds (forest versus edge species), it was found that an a posteriori statistical analysis confirmed the expected trend, i.e. that the species which decreased significantly in burnt pinewood were essentially the forest species, whereas the species which increased were essentially the edge/open habitat ones. Overall, in order to investigate the effects of fire catastrophes on birds, the guild approach seems more exhaustive than the taxonomic community approach, where intrinsic confounding trends are present.

Accordingly, it is necessary to work out methodological approaches for the assessment of biodiversity in forests. In the study presented here, we focus on the total plant species pool (563 vascular plant and bryophyte species) of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests in NE Germany to identify indicators for plant species richness. We distinguished several groups like "herb", "grass-like", "woody", "endangered", and "exotic species", for which we detected indicators for low (class #1), intermediate (class #2), and high (class #3) species numbers. From a total of 84 species, which were identified by a three-step procedure, most indicators were found for class #3. Only few indicators have been revealed for intermediate species numbers, i.e. class #2. With help of Ellenberg's ecological indicator values and information on the main occurrence in Central European vegetation types and plant communities, respectively, we characterized the indicator species ecologically. The ecological site preferences of the indicator species in general reflect the fact that species richness is highest in base-rich, light, and anthropogenically disturbed pine forests. On the contrary, species-poor forests were revealed by indicators, which mainly occur on acidic sites. It is concluded that a considerable set of indicators for species richness can help facilitate biodiversity assessments in forestry and ecosystem restoration practice.

We assessed possible associations of bird species with savannas and other threatened habitats in the region by relating fire frequency and vegetation characteristics to seasonal densities of 72 bird species distributed across an open-forest gradient in northwestern Indiana. About one-third of the species did not exhibit statistically significant relationships with any combination of seven vegetation characteristics that included vegetation cover in Five vertical strata, dead tree density, and tree height. For 40% of the remaining species, models best predicting species density incorporated tree density. Therefore, management based solely on manipulating tree density may not be an adequate strategy for managing bird populations along this open-forest gradient. Few species exhibited sharp peaks in predicted density under habitat conditions expected in restored savannas, suggesting that few savanna specialists occur among Midwestern bird species. When fire frequency, measured over fifteen years, was added to vegetation characteristics as a predictor of species density, it was incorporated into models for about one-quarter of species, suggesting that fire may modify habitat characteristics in ways that are important for birds but not captured by the structural habitat variables measured. Among those species, similar numbers had peaks in predicted density at low, intermediate, or high fire frequency. For species suggested by previous studies to have a preference for oak savannas along the open-forest gradient, estimated density was maximized at an average fire return interval of about one fire every three years.

Therefore, management practices that promote healthy populations of this bird will help to conserve cavity-nesting communities as a whole. The objective of this study was to determine patterns in forest type and landscape use by hairy woodpeckers, and thus, provide landscape-level recommendations to forest managers. We documented the ranging patterns and habitat use of 23 hairy woodpeckers on the Olympic Peninsula using radiotelemetry and a Geographic Information System analysis. Use patterns of stand age, type, and size, as well as distance-from-edge analyses revealed that the hairy woodpecker is a relative generalist in its use of the managed forest landscape. However, certain features, such as older stands with large trees, were used more heavily by nesting pairs. Hairy woodpeckers used 61-80-year forest stands significantly (P < 0.05) more than expected relative to their availability within the birds' home ranges. We also documented significant underuse of 6-10-year and 11-20-year stands, whereas the birds used 41-60-year stands, >80-year stands, and clear-cuts (<5 yr) equivalent to their availability. We suggest that hairy woodpeckers select older stands with larger, dying trees for foraging, but also use clear-cuts proportionally due to the residual snags, decaying trees, and remnant dead wood available. Higher use (P < 0.001) by hairy woodpeckers of small forest patches (0-5 ha) and intermediate-sized stands (5-30 ha) than large patches (>30 ha) may be a result of the older, higher-quality habitat available in small stands in the managed forest landscape. We recommend that land managers interested in maintaining healthy managed forest ecosystems with a full complement of cavity-using species in forests of western Washington and northwestern Oregon maintain a landscape mosaic with approximately 45% of the landscape in stands >40 years, and >30% of the landscape in stands >60 years.

Upland dry forest on southerly aspects was dominated by open ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plant associations. Upland mesic forest on northerly aspects was dominated by closed-canopy Douglas-fir or dry grand fir (Abies grandis) plant associations. Riparian overstory vegetation was dominated by black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) plant associations with a prominent hardwood tree and shrub component. We quantified bird assemblages, diversity, and abundance from parallel point transects on riparian and adjacent dry and mesic upslope forests. We detected 80 bird species from >12,000 point-transect observations during 1998-1999. Eighteen species accounted for 75% of all detections. Species richness and evenness were similar in all 3 forest types, with approximately 35 species and high evenness (0.85) in each forest type. Bird species assemblages differed among dry, mesic, and riparian forest types, with the greatest differences between riparian and both dry and mesic upland forests. Riparian forest had the greatest number (9) of strong characteristic, or indictor, species among the 3 forest types. Upland mesic forest was characterized by 7 indicator species. Upland dry forest had 4 indicator species. Our results indicate that current standards and guidelines for riparian buffers zones would allow for avian refuge and corridor functions along these streams. Forest managers could use our indicator species to predict and monitor shifts in upland forest species composition from thinning and prescribed burning practices that are used to reduce fuels in uplands and to reduce continuity of fire effects between riparian and upland zones.

This study compared 39 quantitative or qualitative characteristics and various widely accepted biodiversity indicators of a stand, its understorey and the forest floor in old-growth and conventionally managed mature stands of dry alvar and fresh boreo-nemoral forests. This study has to produce a statistically supported set of indicators for evaluating of forest "naturalness". We examined 154 stands over a wide biogeographical range in Estonia.Many forest structural characteristics, including stand basal area and composition, amount of dead wood, and coverage of understorey layers (shrub, herb and moss layers) followed productivity and/or biogeographical gradients. Old-growth forests had higher proportions of deciduous trees, a larger amount of coarse woody debris (CWD, consisting of logs and snags), a higher frequency of logs in each decay class, a denser understorey and herb layer, and a more heterogeneous pattern of herb layer diversity than mature managed forests. We found a correlation between live trees greater than 40 cm in diameter and forest age. The effects of forest management on the forest floor are both direct and indirect. Anthropogenic disturbance directly decreased shrub and herb layer coverage. Indirectly forest management increased herb layer coverage, proportion of graminoids, and species richness of the herb layer by improving light conditions as stand canopy was opened.The sets of indicators for assessing ecosystem quality in each forest site-type have overlapping features, such as the amount of dead wood, canopy closure of the stand and the presence of woodpeckers and specific lichens. Several other old-growth or disturbance indicators are forest-type specific, related to the composition of shrub and herb layer vegetation.Results suggest that stands managed with an extended rotation can be compositionally very similar to old-growth forests. Stands differ quantitatively in structural features, but these differences are confounded by other environmental factors, such as soil productivity, forest age or biogeography. Mature and old-growth forests still enclose features created by the mid-term (decades) and long-term (centuries) history of forest management practices. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently, installation of erosion control structures (drop pipes) at the riparian zone-agricultural field interface halts gully erosion and simultaneously establishes one of four riparian habitat types. Avian communities were compared among four types of restored habitats and among four seasonal periods in northwestern Mississippi from June 1994 to May 1996. Fifty-seven species were observed among riparian habitats, of which 49% were neotropical migrants. Habitat type and season significantly affected species richness, abundance, and diversity. Species richness, abundance, and diversity increased as habitat area, pool volume, and vertical structure of woody vegetation increased among riparian habitat types. Additionally, species richness, abundance, and diversity increased during spring and fall. The influence of habitat type on avian species richness, abundance, and diversity did not differ among seasons. Present drop pipe installation practices focus on erosion control without consideration of habitat creation. Installation practices can be altered to more effectively incorporate habitat creation to provide the greatest ecological benefits for avian communities within impacted riparian zones.

We examined if any changes in forest vegetation within the eagle home ranges caused this reduced breeding success. The breeding success of three pairs of S. nipalensis in western Hiroshima prefecture was monitored from 1981 to 2005. The presumed environmental factors responsible for breeding success such as vegetation structure, abundance of major avian and mammalian prey, incidence of direct human disturbance, age of pairs, weather conditions, and aggravation of the nesting environment were also monitored. Two of the three pairs exhibited a great reduction in breeding success after the late 1980s. Their low reproductive successes were associated with significant changes in forest vegetation such as an increase in old-aged conifer plantations and a decrease in deciduous forests and young conifer plantations. The third pair of S. nipalensis did not show any marked reduction in breeding success; however, forest vegetation within their home range did not change significantly and was consistently predominated by deciduous forest. Though the forest vegetation within a pair home range shifted from a predominantly young conifer plantation to an old well-grown one, breeding success for that pair did not fall appreciably. This was probably due to greater prey abundance in the appropriately managed forest. A conifer plantation well managed by thinning, pruning and tending would not only support prey population, but would also provide appropriate hunting grounds for S. nipalensis. To improve breeding success, we propose that at least 400 ha of suitable forest vegetation should be sustained for every breeding pair by conducting management practices that ensure well groomed artificial forests.

For at least five months after burns we followed the changes in bird species composition, species richness and densities of two controlled burns and one accidental fire at the Barberspan Nature Reserve in grasslands that had not been burned or grazed in 10 years, Compared with the control areas, species richness and densities increased in the burned areas immediately following the burns, with more species and birds recruited to the burned areas than were lost. Immediate post-burn opportunists tended to be larger species, and the biomass increase mirrored the increases in species richness and densities in burned areas. Avian species richness, densities and biomass tended to return to the initial conditions after a number of months. Although the bird communities from two controlled-burns differed before the burns, they converged to a characteristic immediate post-burn composition. Five months after the burns however, the bird communities reflected a pre-burn composition. Indications were that birds in an area larger than that burned were affected. Mosaic burning, with shifting large and small patches, should be considered on a landscape scale.

South African Journal of Wildlife Research		2007	OCT 2007	37	2	159-178	159	178	English						0	12	The study compared plant and avian diversity and species composition between four habitats to review the potential implications of two distinct management practices on a forestry estate, namely to rehabilitate riparian zones to grasslands or woodlands as the two habitats that historically occurred on the property. The study habitats were Plantation (Pinus trees in riparian zone), Bushland (recently harvested), Grassland (cleared of broadleaf plants), and Woodland (control). At seven sampling sites per habitat, a vegetation assessment was conducted, while birds were caught with mist nests. Plant species richness increased from Plantation to Woodland, whereas most bird species and individuals were found in Bushland. Plant and bird species composition differed significantly between habitats. Bushland and Grassland birds were closely associated with exotic forbs. Grassland attracted birds with diverse habitat and nesting-site associations, and Woodland birds associated with woody plants. It is recommended that the majority of riparian zones be managed as grasslands, although the exact affect of the biennial summer burning and presence of exotic plants on birds needs to be investigated. To attract cavity-nesting birds to the Estate, some suitable riparian zones should be rehabilitated to Woodland by planting Ficus and Acacia trees, as these trees are the most abundant and frequently occurring in this habitat. Rather than manage avian diversity per se, the African stonechat in Grassland and lesser honeyguide in Woodland can be employed as indicators of the rehabilitation state of the riparian zones.

Austral Ecology		2007	SEP 2007	32	6	635-650	635	650	English						2	26	Most of the original forest and woodland cover on the western slopes of New South Wales and the northern plains of Victoria has been cleared for agriculture (wheat, sheep and cattle) and what remains is highly fragmented and modified by a long history of disturbance. Over the past three decades, native eucalypt trees and shrubs have been planted extensively in a part of this region to provide a range of environmental benefits. Our aim was to determine the extent to which these plantings could improve biological diversity in agricultural landscapes in south-eastern Australia and to identify the variables influencing their effectiveness. We sampled birds at 120 sites encompassing the range of available patch sizes, stand ages, floristic and structural conditions, and habitat attributes for revegetated areas and remnants of native vegetation, and we compared these to nearby paddocks. Eucalypt plantings were found to provide significant improvements in bird population density compared with cleared or sparsely treed paddocks, and mixed eucalypt and shrub plantings had similar bird communities to remnant native forest and woodland in the region. Birds displayed a strong response to patch size, with both larger (>= 5-20 ha) eucalypt plantings and larger (>= 5-20 ha) remnants having more species and more individuals per unit area than smaller (< 5 ha) patches of these vegetation types. Older (10-25 years) plantings had more bird species and individuals than young (< 10 years) plantings. The distance from remnant forest and woodland (habitat connectivity) appeared to be an important variable influencing bird species richness in eucalypt plantings. The main differences were due to the greater numbers of species classified as woodland-dependent in the larger-sized patches of plantings and remnants. Eucalypt plantings provided useful habitat for at least 10 declining woodland-dependent species, notably for the Speckled Warbler, Red-capped Robin and Rufous Whistler. The Brown Treecreeper and Dusky Woodswallow appeared to be the species most limited by the extent of remnant forest and woodland in the region. Plantings of all shapes and sizes, especially those larger than 5 ha, have an important role to play in providing habitat for many bird species. Restoration efforts are more likely to be successful if eucalypt plantings are established near existing remnant vegetation.

Because habitat management historically has been focused on the marsh, this study was initiated to determine the effects of spring burning on abundance and species richness of grassland-nesting birds. The effects of years since last bum and location on abundance and species richness were inconsistent among years. Unless additional bird surveys show consistent patterns in bird response to burning, frequency of bums will be determined based on vegetation characteristics rather than abundance of nesting birds.

Wintering Henslow's Sparrow abundance tracks growing-season fires; bird abundance peaks in the winter following burning, then declines in subsequent winters. Fire also determines dominant plant species, suggesting that Henslow's Sparrows may respond to abundance of preferred seeds. To determine diet preferences of Henslow's Sparrows, we tested seeds from eight species of native plants from southeastern Louisiana pine savannas, including species common in the first winter after burning ('fire Brasses') and species that increase in abundance in the second and subsequent winters after burning. Seed consumption by individual birds differed considerably, suggesting that Henslow's Sparrows forage on a variety of resources in the highly diverse savannas. Henslow's Sparrows preferred fire grasses, especially Muhlenbergia expansa (cutover muhly). They also preferred Dichanthelium angustifoliurn (needleleaf rosette grass), a species more common in the second year after burning, but consumed relatively little of the sedges Rhynchospora plumosa (plumed beaksedge) and R. gracilenta (slender beaksedge), species common in the second winter after fire. Birds consumed almost none of the ubiquitous grass Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem). These results suggest that preferred seeds may include those that are most common in the first winter after burning, but that some suitable seeds are available for at least another winter.

Four experimental units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of 3 replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, North Carolina, USA. Treatments were 1) prescribed burn, 2) mechanical understory reduction (chainsaw-felling of shrubs and small trees), 3) mechanical + burn, and 4) controls. We conducted mechanical treatments in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls. Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird species did not detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species richness, total bird density, and some species, including indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year delay; eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus) declined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions, and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open habitat while retaining many forest and generalist species, but may have short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.

The study was based on comparison between six 'disturbed' (extracted) and four 'undisturbed' (non-extracted) sites that were delineated using quantitative disturbance indicators. Birds were sampled seven times over two different seasons utilising the fixed radius point count method. Six different variables related to vegetation structure (canopy cover, basal area, average forest height, tree density, tree height diversity and tree species richness) were quantified, as was tree species composition. There was no significant difference in number of recorded species or bird abundance between disturbed and undisturbed sites. However. bird species diversity was significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Overall, bird species composition also differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Nine of 38 locally abundant bird species (23.6%) showed significant selection for either disturbed or undisturbed habitats. Of these nine species, seven chose undisturbed habitats and two chose disturbed. All seven species adversely affected by disturbance are primarily insectivorous. Canopy cover, tree basal area and height of trees were significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. In both habitats, bird species composition was significantly dependent on these components of altered vegetation structure. Tree species composition was also significantly altered by disturbance in scrub forest. However, altered tree species composition did not significantly affect bird species composition. Partial Mantel's tests confirmed that there were no significant residual effects of tree species composition on bird composition after the effects of vegetation structure were accounted for. Our study indicates that rural biomass extraction can have significant effects upon bird species composition of tropical scrub forest which is caused principally by alteration of vegetation structure, rather than by changes in forest tree composition.

Forest Ecology and Management		2007	JUL 16 2007	246	1	73-80	73	80	English						0	33	Management of dry forests often involves trade-offs between ecological values, particularly those associated with closed-canopy forests, and reduction of severe wildlife risk. We review principles and our ecological research that can be used to design stand- and landscape-level fuel treatments in dry coniferous forests of western North America. The focus of ecological values is on the ecological web that includes the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), its two primary prey species the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) and bushy-tailed woodrat (Neotoma cinerea). and the vegetation (live and dead), mycorrhizal fungi, and arboreal lichens that support those prey species. For the landscape level, we describe an ongoing project to develop the FuelSolve computer tool that optimizes the area and location of a fuel treatment by minimizing p potential fire behavior and minimizing loss of spotted owl habitat from treatment and potential fire. Some species will gain and some species will lose habitat when stand structure or composition is changed during fuel reduction treatments. Stand-level prescriptions might be altered to maintain or create patchiness of closed-canopy habitat elements, such as snags, down wood, mistletoe-infected trees, and large old trees, and open-canopy habitats can be tailored to ensure creation of suitable composition and structure for wildlife. Allocation of treatments across the landscape might be managed to minimize cumulative effects and impacts on target species populations. General approaches to landscape-level planning of ecologically sound fuel treatments include coarse- and fine-filter approaches. A coarse-filter approach would use some definition of the historical or natural range of variability to define the composition and pattern that might reasonably be expected to sustain the forest ecosystem. Three general approaches can inform fine-filter analysis and development of fuel reduction treatments at the landscape level. Population viability analysis provides sound principles based on attributes of the species population structure, life history and behavior, and environment (habitat) for guiding fine-filter analysis. Fine-filter analysis can be informed by operational modeling of treatment alternatives. Research publications can guide dry forest landscape management. Our FuelSolve optimization model described in this paper differs from other fuel planning models in this class by equally considering multiple optimization objectives for fuel treatment and ecologically important resources. We describe the results of FuelSolve prototype development, an evaluation of outputs for field use, and future development efforts. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Jungle rubber gardens are low-input rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforests that structurally resemble secondary forest and in which wild species are tolerated by the farmer. As primary forests have almost completely disappeared from the lowlands of the Sumatra peneplain, our aim was to assess the contribution of jungle rubber as a land use type to the conservation of plant and bird species, especially those that are associated with the forest interior of primary and old secondary forest. Species-accumulation curves were compiled for terrestrial and epiphytic pteridophytes, trees and birds, and for subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds. Comparing jungle rubber and primary forest, groups differed in relative species richness patterns. Species richness in jungle rubber was slightly higher (terrestrial pteridophytes), similar (birds) or lower (epiphytic pteridophytes, trees, vascular plants as a whole) than in primary forest. For subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds, species richness in jungle rubber was lower than in primary forest. For all groups, species richness in jungle rubber was generally higher than in rubber plantations. Although species conservation in jungle rubber is limited by management practices and by a slash-and-burn cycle for replanting of about 40 years, this forest-like land use does support species diversity in an impoverished landscape increasingly dominated by monoculture plantations.

We evaluated the ecological distinctiveness and conservation value of savannas and woodlands by examining bird distributions across a fire-maintained woody-vegetation gradient in northwest Indiana encompassing five habitats-open habitats with low canopy cover, savannas, woodlands, scrublands, and forests-during migration, breeding, and overwintering. Savannas and woodlands were significantly different in overall bird species composition from open and forest habitats but were often intermediate between open and forest in guild densities. Few bird species were consistently and highly concentrated in savannas or woodlands, and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) was the only species significantly more abundant in savannas and woodlands than in open, scrub, and forest habitats. Fire frequency over a 15-year interval was a significant predictor of bird community composition and was positively related to species diversity, spring transient migrant density, and density of the most threatened species. Each habitat type had characteristics potentially important for avian conservation. Scrub had the highest density of transient migrants, which suggests it plays an important role as migration stopover habitat. More species were significantly concentrated in open or forest habitats than in the other habitats. Lack of species concentration and intermediate community composition suggested that birds experienced savannas and woodlands more as ecotones than as habitats distinct from forests or grasslands. However, this intermediate character can benefit conservation, as evidenced by savannas and woodlands having the highest density of the most threatened species along this woody-vegetation gradient.

Habitat structure long has been identified as a primary factor influencing local assemblage composition. Most evidence has been in the form of correlations of species occurrence and assemblage composition over a range of habitats, with experimental verification of relationships being relatively uncommon because of the difficulties of enacting precise manipulations of habitat structure.2. Fallen timber (also known as coarse or large woody debris) is one of the few habitat-structural elements in forests and woodlands that can be manipulated with relatively high precision. We report on manipulations of wood-loads on 30 experimental 1-ha plots in floodplain forests of northern Victoria, Australia, over 4 years (one pre- and three post-manipulation).3. We show that very high wood-loads (80 Mg ha(-1)) and intermediate wood-loads derived from tree crowns (40 Mg ha(-1)) increase species richness (all species and ground-foraging species) and numbers of birds (all species and ground-foraging species) relative to the control plots.4. Three bird species consistently increased most following manipulations: white-plumed honeyeater Lichenostomus penicillatus (Gould 1837) (fam. Meliphagidae), brown treecreeper Climacteris picumnus (Temm. & Laug. 1824) (fam. Climacteridae) and yellow rosella Platycercus elegans flaveolus (Gould 1837) (fam. Psittacidae). The honeyeater is not considered as a ground or fallen timber dependent species, while the treecreeper and rosella both are regarded as being dependent on ground-layer structure.5. Fallen timber management needs to be considered in a landscape and temporal context for improving conservation of avian biodiversity.

There are few reliable data documenting the species diversity and relative importance of bobwhite nest predators in southern Texas, USA. We used infrared video-monitoring systems to document nest fates of 127 bobwhite nests over 4 nesting seasons from 2002 to 2005 in southern Texas. A majority of depredation events (83%) were caused by 4 species: coyote (Canis latrans), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), southern fire ant (Solenopsis xyloni), and badger (Taxidea taxus). Observed bobwhite nest fates for the study period were 0.50 successful, 0.34 depredated, and 0.16 abandoned or undetermined. A universal approach to mitigating nest predation is not likely to be applicable in regions similar to southern Texas, with high nest-predator diversity (e.g., fire ants, rodents, and mammalian carnivores). We believe that infrared video surveillance is a valuable tool for documenting baseline information on predator context and nest fate for many avian species, considering the limitations of past methods (e.g., postfate evidence).

Conversion of established forests of undesirable species composition or structure to a multi-age, native forest community is a common restoration goal. However, for some ecosystems, the complexity of multiple disturbances and biotic factors requires unique approaches to advance community development. We use the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Miller) ecosystem as a model of such a restoration paradigm with an approach that utilizes the undesirable species as a functional or structural bridge to foster ecological processes.2. In the conversion of adult slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) plantations to the biologically diverse longleaf pine forests that once dominated the south-eastern US Coastal Plain, we examine techniques for restoring and maintaining critical structural and functional components. Through partial and variable retention of the undesirable slash pine canopy, establishment of longleaf pine seedlings is facilitated, while maintaining fuels essential for prescribed fire, a necessary management practice for longleaf pine. Furthermore, we project that with subsequent fires, fine fuels and species richness will be encouraged in the ground cover, and with future slash canopy harvest, established longleaf pine seedlings will be released.3. In this study, we present a statistical approach that examines the compositional movement of vegetation in restoration sites over time relative to the reference conditions that are also changing through time.4. Synthesis and applications. Restoration efforts that remove undesirable species initially may actually hinder rather than facilitate restoration. Restoration of fire-maintained ecosystems in which the production of adequate fuels is an important consideration may require the retention of a portion of the existing canopy to provide fuels during the restoration process, even if the canopy is comprised of less preferred species. Individual species often provide similar structural features and influences on function within an ecosystem; thus, systems other than longleaf pine may also benefit from retention of the undesirable species through the restoration process. We conclude that a gradual approach to restoration may be advantageous when legacies of past management have altered complex ecological dynamics and promoted development along a successional pathway strongly differing from that of the reference conditions.

The effects of natural and human-caused disturbance on density of nesting pairs, reproductive success, and traditional home ranges were compared over 30 years in two areas and over 15 years in five additional areas. In one study area, density of nesting pairs of pileated woodpeckers decreased from five to one after extensive regeneration cuts eliminated most of the stands of mature and old-growth grand fir (Abies grandis) and reduced the density of nest and roost trees and foraging substrate since 1990. Density of nesting pairs, reproductive success, and home range location remained fairly consistent over 30 years in a second study area with extensive tree mortality resulting from insect outbreaks but without regeneration harvests. The amount of unharvested stands and closed canopy stands in home ranges were positively correlated with reproductive success, and the amount of area in harvested stands was negatively correlated with reproductive success in 2003-05. High tree mortality and subsequent loss of canopy closure in stands of grand fir and Douglas-fir from insect outbreaks did not appear to be detrimental to pileated woodpeckers provided that dead trees and logs were abundant and that stands were not harvested.

Austral Ecology		2007	MAY 2007	32	3	261-276	261	276	English						0	59	This study reports on the responses of bird assemblages to woodland clearance, fragmentation and habitat disturbance in central Queensland Australia, a region exposed to very high rates of vegetation clearance over the last two to three decades. Many previous studies of clearing impacts have considered situations where there is a very sharp management contrast between uncleared lands and cleared areas: in this situation, the contrast is more muted, because both cleared lands and uncleared savanna woodlands are exposed to cattle grazing, invasion by the exotic grass Cenchrus ciliaris and similar fire management. Bird species richness (at the scale of a 1-ha quadrat) was least in cleared areas (8.1 species), then regrowth areas (14.6 species), then uncleared woodlands (19.9 species). Richness at this scale was unrelated to woodland fragment size, connectivity or habitat condition; but declined significantly with increasing abundance of miners (interspecifically aggressive colonial honeyeaters). At whole of patch scale, richness increased with fragment size and decreased with abundance of miners. This study demonstrates complex responses of individual bird species to a regional management cocktail of disturbance elements. Of 71 individual bird species modelled for woodland fragment sites, the quadrat-level abundance of 40 species was significantly related to at least one variable representing environmental position (across a rainfall gradient), fragment condition, fragment size and/or connectivity. This study suggests that priorities for conservation management include: cessation of broad-scale clearing; increased protection for regrowth (particularly where this may bolster connectivity and/or size of woodland fragments); control of miners; maintenance of fallen woody debris in woodlands; increase in fire frequency; and reduction in the incidence of grazing and exotic pasture grass.

In Spain, Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests are mainly subjected to three sylvopastoral management systems which determine variations in the forest structure: (i) "young forests" subjected to frequent disturbance by fires and clear-cuttings; (ii) "Pyrenean oak dehesas", subjected to a traditional sylvopastoral system exclusive to Spain which favours the development of both old oaks and pasture; (iii) largely undisturbed "mature forests". We examined the effects of these sylvopastoral management systems on habitat use and reproduction of the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius), a forest specialist bird, at the south-western edge of its distribution range. Habitat use was examined at multiple spatial scales. Within the territories, woodpeckers preferred large diameter oaks for foraging and decay oaks with holes for nesting. Within the forest tracts, no significant relationships between territory density and habitat structure in the forest tracts were found. At the landscape scale, dehesas and mature forests, both with high densities of important foraging and nesting trees, were occupied by woodpeckers. Young forests, with low densities of those trees, were avoided. No significant differences in territory density or reproductive success were found between dehesas and mature forests. The maintenance of viable woodpecker populations requires conservation actions at several spatial scales. Within the forest tracts, suitable densities of important foraging and nesting trees must be maintained. At the landscape scale, management decisions must consider the maintenance of traditional sylvopastoral systems in dehesas and mature forests. At the regional scale, taking into account a habitat cover in the landscape of the 7% for the Cantabrian Mountains, we estimated an area of 285,000 ha to be included in the conservation planning unit for the middle spotted woodpecker.

Prescribed burning is a management strategy that has potential for restoring and rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, and through such restoration, might create habitat for birds dependent upon prairies. To provide improved data for management decision-making regarding the use of prescribed fire in tallgrass prairies, we compared responses of plant and bird communities on five burned and five unburned tallgrass prairie fragments at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, Iowa, USA, from 1995 to 1997. Overall species richness and diversity were unaffected by burning, but individual species of plants and birds were affected by year-treatment interactions, including northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), which showed time-delayed increases in density on burned sites. Analyses of species/area relationships indicated that, collectively, many small sites did make significant contributions to plant biodiversity at landscape levels, supporting the overall conservation value of prairie fragments. In contrast, most birds species were present on larger sites. Thus, higher biodiversity in bird communities which contain area-sensitive species might require larger sites able to support larger, more stable populations, greater habitat heterogeneity, and greater opportunity for niche separation.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2007	APR 2007	71	2	411-421	411	421	English						3	14	Riparian forest communities in the southwestern United States were historically structured by a disturbance regime of annual flooding. In recent decades, however, frequency of flooding has decreased and frequency of wildfires has increased. Riparian forests provide important breeding habitat for a large variety of bird species, and the effects of this altered disturbance regime on birds and their breeding habitat is largely unknown. To evaluate effects of high-intensity spring and summer wildfire on the quality of breeding bird habitat in the Middle Rio Grande valley, we measured vegetation structure and composition, avian nest use, and nest success at 4 unburned plots and 4 wildfire plots over a 3-year period. We measured avian nest use and success at nest boxes located in unburned riparian forest plots and plots recently burned by wildfire. Recent wildfire plots (< 7 yr after fire) had a much different vegetation structure than unburned plots; an older (> 7 yr after fire) wildfire plot more closely resembled its paired unburned plot than did recently burned plots. Ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens) and Bewick's wrens (Thryomanes bewickii; hereafter, flycatchers and wrens, respectively) used nest boxes in most of the plots. A model selection procedure applied to logistic regressions showed that frequency of nest box use by flycatchers was positively associated with wildfire, although flycatchers used boxes in unburned plots as well. Wrens showed a preferential use of nest boxes that were in unburned sites and in close proximity to vegetative cover. Growth rates, feeding rates, and fledging mass of flycatchers were similar in wildfire and unburned plots. Growth rates for wrens were slower in wildfire plots, while feeding rates and fledging mass were similar. Nest predation varied between years, was higher for flycatchers than for wrens, and was not directly influenced by wildfire. Model selection showed that predation increased with grass cover, an indicator of forest openness, and decreased with distance to habitat edge. Recovery of dense vegetation appears important in maintaining populations of Bewick's wrens, whereas ash-throated flycatchers were less sensitive to vegetative structure and composition of postfire succession. Postfire management that maintains nest sites in large forest strips would enhance nesting density and success of these cavity-nesting birds in riparian zones.	Smith, D.

The Brigalow Belt forests include some of the largest contiguous areas of native forest in the temperate and sub-humid zones of eastern Australia. Over I million ha of these forests are proposed to be converted from forestry to conservation tenure, yet the impacts on the avifauna of current and potential future forest management practices are not known. We investigated the influence of road edges and habitat type and structure on the avifauna of a 356 000 ha forest. Survey sites were either < 50 m or > 300 m from a road, and in either cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla forest, spotted gum Corymbia citriodora forest with a regenerating cypress pine/buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii understorey or spotted gum forest with an open understorey due to fuel-reduction burning. The avifauma differed significantly among vegetation types but not with proximity to a road, with the greatest differences between cypress pine and both types of spotted gum forest. The noisy miner Manorina melanocephala, an aggressive avian competitor, appears to be the factor mediating these assemblage-level differences. Noisy miners were rare in cypress pine forest but were three times more numerous than any other species in spotted gum forest. Spotted gum forest with a regenerating understorey had fewer noisy miners. Although total bird abundance was highest in open spotted gum forest, the species richness and abundance of passerines smaller than noisy miners was significantly lower in this forest type. Abundance of small passerines was eight times higher in sites where < 3 noisy miners were recorded. Only one species, the eastern yellow robin, was influenced by proximity to a road edge. Cypress pine forest is potentially an important refuge for smaller birds. The results suggest that burning regimes that reduce regeneration of the cypress pine and buloke subcanopy in spotted gum forest potentially are exacerbating the problem of noisy miner domination of the avifauna.

To quantify avian response patterns along a burn severity gradient, we sampled 49 random plots ( 2001 - 2002) at the 17351- ha Cerro Grande Fire ( 2000) in New Mexico, USA. Additionally, pre-. re avian surveys ( 1986 1988, 1990) created a unique opportunity to quantify avifaunal changes in 13 pre-. re transects ( resampled in 2002) and to compare two designs for analyzing the effects of unplanned disturbances: after- only analysis and before - after comparisons. Distance analysis was used to calculate densities. We analyzed after- only densities for 21 species using gradient analysis, which detected a broad range of responses to increasing burn severity: (I) large significant declines, (II) weak, but signi. cant declines, (III) no signi. cant density changes, (IV) peak densities in low- or moderate- severity patches, (V) weak, but signi. cant increases, and (VI) large signi. cant increases. Overall, 71% of the species included in the after- only gradient analysis exhibited either positive or neutral density responses to. re effects across all or portions of the severity gradient ( responses III - VI). We used pre/ post pairs analysis to quantify density changes for 15 species using before - after comparisons; spatiotemporal variation in densities was large and confounded. re effects for most species. Only four species demonstrated signi. cant effects of burn severity, and their densities were all higher in burned compared to unburned forests. Pre- and post-. re community similarity was high except in high- severity areas. Species richness was similar pre- and post-. re across all burn severities. Thus, ecosystem restoration programs based on the assumption that recent severe. res in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have overriding negative ecological effects are not supported by our study of post-. re avian communities. This study illustrates the importance of quantifying burn severity and controlling confounding sources of spatiotemporal variation in studies of. re effects. After- only gradient analysis can be an efficient tool for quantifying. re effects. This analysis can also augment historical data sets that have small samples sizes coupled with high non- process variation, which limits the power of before - after comparisons.

We found that lower species richness, abundance, and diversity in logged plots where were controlled by a typical postfire management. As results of guild analysis for nest sites and food resources, postfire logging reduced densities of ground-shrub nesters, primary and secondary cavity nesters, but was also related to reduction in densities of some foraging groups such as timber drillers and foliage searchers. These results suggest that snag-retention is essential for birds in burned forests and that postfire logging is incompatible with the maintenance of bird populations and communities. Consequently we need to develope guidelines of postfire management for snag-retention in burned forests through intensive researches focused on some target species such as Great spotted woodpeckers Dendrocopos major.

We monitored the use and characteristics of 12 winter roosts used by nine radio-marked Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona that had experienced wildfire in 1996 and 2000. Roost trees were larger in diameter than 95% of non-roost trees and on average 2.5 times larger within burned areas of similar severity. Roost trees were within patches less dense than 95% of measured patches across study sites, which were on average 1.5 times as dense. Two-thirds of roost trees were created by fire and were smaller than those created by other means. Six birds each used one roost and three males each used two roosts. Two-thirds of the roosts were outside or on the edge of estimated home ranges. Maximum straight-line distances traveled, from roost to farthest point of home range, were > 1 km for 8 of 9 birds. Woodpeckers have a significant role in providing cavities for secondary cavity nesters. Thus, understanding habitat requirements for winter roosts could provide managers with essential tools to maintain or enhance populations of this species.

We estimated the relationship between nest density and time since fire, tested for statistical differences in nest densities and nest survival in the partially salvage-logged vs. unlogged wildfires, and tested for differences in nest survival between early (1-4 years after fire) and late (5-12 years after fire) postfire periods. Nest densities of open-space foragers and Northern Flickers generally increased with time since fire, whereas nest densities of Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers peaked 4-5 years postfire. Nest densities of wood-foraging species and Mountain Bluebirds were significantly higher in the unlogged burn, whereas Lewis's Woodpeckers had significantly higher nest densities in the partially logged burn. Kestrels tended to favor the partially logged burn, while Western Bluebird nest densities were nearly equal in both burned areas. For most species, postfire period and treatment (partially logged vs. unlogged) had little influence on nest survival. However, Hairy Woodpecker nest survival was significantly lower in the partially logged burn versus the unlogged wildfire in the early postfire period, and Lewis's Woodpecker nest survival was significantly reduced in the later postfire period versus the early postfire period in the partially logged burn. Importantly, the salvage logging was designed to retain more than half of the snags over 23 cm in diameter, which provided suitable nesting habitat for open-space foragers during the decade following fire.

Species richness is high (34) and breeding densities are high (129.3 pairs per 10 ha) as well as global diversity (SHANNON index of A. 13). These results are analysed then discussed in relation to other non-riverine conifer and broadleaved forests. This richness can be explained by the architectural complexity of the studied forest resulting from the specific dynamics of riverside habitats: diversity of woody plant species, high vertical stratification, horizontal heterogeneity, abundance of large vines and vigour of plant growth are the most striking features of this habitat. Bird populations are similar to that of ordinary European Oak forest with three differences: a very high breeding density (50% higher), an abundance of shrubby habitats species in the heart of the forest, and the presence of species whose ecological optimum in Eastern France is cool montane habitat (Black Woodpecker, Dryocopus; martius, Firecrest Regulus atricapillus, Common Tree-creeper Certhia familiaris, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca). A comparison with the ancient Bialowieza forest has also been drawn: the higher temperatures and a much thicker and abundant woody vegetation explain the higher densities recorder in the Rhine riverine forest. Finally, a critical analysis of absolute population census tools is provided, highlighting weaknesses and suggesting possible alleys of improvement. In conclusion, we must unfortunately accept the fact that deep hydrological changes in European river habitats will modify the typical riverine forest architecture and will lead to the transformation of the Querco-Ulmetum minoris into a yet unknown different type of forest.

The Andean patagonic forests undergo different anthropogenic disturbances, like fires, grazing, wood extraction and substitution by exotic coniferous plantations. These activities cause changes on the vegetation and animal communities, and could be affecting the functioning of the forest ecosystems. In Argentine Patagonia, there is a growing opposition to productive activities, particularly to pine plantations, because of its supposed negative ecological consequences, however their impacts are unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate in which measure different uses of the vegetation of the basin of Foyel river (NO Argentine Patagonia) cause changes on bird communities, especially on the functionally important and the endangered species. Birds counts were conducted from November 2004 to March 2005 (summer) using the variable circular-plot method, in twenty four sites of Nothofagus antarctica native forests and scrubs with different levels of grazing and wood extraction (closed, semiopened, opened), and in eight exotic plantations of Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus spp. Although, the vegetation structure of each site was characterized, to identify structural elements of the forests that could be important for bird habitat. Population densities of birds did not differ between vegetation types (25.4 +/- 8.4 individuals/ha) associated to different disturbances. Bird richness and diversity (Shannon Index), however, were different among the vegetation types, in forestations both were similar to the undisturbed vegetation types, whereas they increased in vegetations with a medium intensity of wood extraction and grazing, and were highest in those sites whit a high intensity of wood extraction and grazing. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis and an analysis of species composition similarity showed that there are two differentiated communities: those of the more altered N. antarctica forests (by grazing and wood extraction), dominated by birds of opened areas; and another community in the rest of the vegetation types, dominated by species characteristic of forests. Among the key species for the Andean patagonic forests processes, foliage insectivores (Elaenia albiceps and Aphrastura spinicauda) were not seriously affected by any of the anthropogenic disturbances; ground insectivores (Scelorchilus rubecula and Pteroptochos tarnii) used the coniferous plantations, but not the areas opened by intense wood extraction and grazing; whereas the wood insectivore species (Campephilus magellanicus) was rare in all types of vegetation. Our results suggest that the structure and composition of the forest bird communities is mainly determined by changes in the structure of the vegetation, and not by changes in the floristic composition. The bird community of the coniferous plantations is similar to the community of the original systems. Intensive wood extraction and grazing, however, cause great changes, incorporating some species to the area, but eliminating others that are forest dependent.

It is even more difficult when the species of interest is also cryptic. We censused a population of one such species, the Western Ground Parrot ( Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), over several years to develop a monitoring protocol to assist in future management, extend understanding of its response to fire, and provide a model that could be used with other cryptic bird species. Abundance of Western Ground Parrots, monitored by means of calling frequencies, varied from year to year at a study site in Fitzgerald River National Park, south- western Australia. Frequency of calling increased significantly from 1996 to 2000. During this time, frequency of calling peaked in 1998 in part of the study site that had been unburnt for more than 40 years, and remained high in 2000. Frequency of calling was similar in a more recently burnt part of the study area except in May 1998, when frequency was lower following a fire that burnt part of this area five months previously. Frequency of calling dropped significantly in both the long unburnt and recently burnt areas between 2000 and 2004; exact reasons for this are unknown. Western Ground Parrots can use recently burnt vegetation where it is immediately adjacent to an established population, but do not need fire to create habitat, at least in the timescale of 40 years. The current monitoring protocol, where eight listening posts are counted approximately three times each, is capable of detecting an annual change in frequency of calling of similar to 13%. The number of listening posts would need to be increased to 14 in order to detect an annual change of 10%, and would need to be increased to 40 in order to detect an annual change of 5%.

Successful restoration requires clearly defined objectives and the means to assess progress in meeting them. Often this includes monitoring population trajectories (changes in population size over time) of focal species. Unfortunately, population trajectories in and of themselves are often ambiguous and open to interpretation. Incorporation of additional information can increase the information content of such monitoring programs. Here we advocate using behavioral indicators, particularly the giving-up density (GUD) of food in experimental foraging patches, to complement more traditional monitoring programs that track changes in population sizes over time. We use the results of two field studies to demonstrate how GUDs reflect changes in environmental quality (background food abundance), changing physiological costs of maintenance over an annual cycle, and risk of predation. We then illustrate, through hypothetical examples, how knowledge of changes in GUDs over time can inform interpretation of actual population trajectories (based on 12 years of monitoring) of four bird species of conservation concern at the United States Forest Service Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois, USA. We conclude with a prospectus providing guidelines for incorporating behavioral indicators like the GUD in monitoring programs. Integrating behavioral indicators with more traditional population monitoring approaches provides an effective means of acquiring useful information in a timely and efficient manner.

Surveyor notes indicated the forest was pine Winus echinata) dominated in 1896 but only 6.4% of the actual witness trees were pine. However the slope position and aspect of survey points suggest that at least 62.9% were on hardwood sites. GLO survey points were resampled in 1994 and of the 96 points revisited, 47 of the original corner stones were located in place with legible etchings. Only 6 of these possible 124 witness trees were found still standing in 1994, suggesting rapid turnover of the dominant trees in this virgin (uncut) forest. Turnover rates were likely influenced by frequent fire until the mid-1950's. Based on GLO data, stand density of trees > 11.4 cm diameter at 1.4 m height increased (P = 0.0001) from 71 trees/ha in 1896 to 615 trees/ha in 1994 and mean diameter at breast height decreased from 29 cm in 1896 to 22 cm in 1994, but likely density estimates from 1896 are underestimated. Dominant and codominant P. echinata increased W = 0.0001) from 73 stems/ha to 93 stems/ha for 1955 and 1990, respectively based on aerial photo sampling. We suggest that densification was a result of near complete fire elimination after the mid-1950's. Diameter distributions from 1896 suggest that the forest was in transition from an earlier frequent fire regime following a period of less frequent fire that coincided with changes in Native American demographics. Evidence of historic high intensity fire was observed in the form of fire scars and cat faces on living trees and charred pine knots on the ground at 95 of the 96 sample points, most of which had not burned in the last 40 years.A comparison of 1955 and 1990 vegetation cover types indicates that MCWA is becoming a more dense and homogeneous landscape. Open hardwood woodlands observed on 1955 photography had completely disappeared by 1990. Species composition of stands has largely shifted to a P. echinata and hardwood mixture, whereas stands of pure P. echinata and pure hardwood have decreased. Increase in midstory and overstory hardwood stem density of suitable open, Pinus-dominated habitat as a result of fire suppression is a probable cause for decline of the endangered Picoides borealis (red-cockaded woodpecker). Management to retain the woodpecker should emphasize a successional trajectory that moves the forest to open conditions similar to that found prior to settlement through restructuring of stands with Picoides borealis clusters by thinning followed by reintroduction of a frequent (< 4-year interval) fire regime.

We tested playback efficiency for five Atlantic Forest birds (White-browed Warbler Basileuterus leucoblepharus, Giant Antshrike Batara cinerea, Swallow-tailed Manakin Chiroxiphia caudata, Whiteshouldered Fire-eye Pyriglena leucoptera and Surucua Trogon Trogon surrucura) for different time of the day, season of the year and species abundance at the Morro Grande Forest Reserve (South-eastem Brazil) and at thirteen forest fragments in a nearby landscape. Vocalizations were broadcasted monthly at sunrise, noon and sunset, during one year. For B. leucoblepharus, C. caudata and T surrucura, sunrise and noon were more efficient than sunset. Batara cinerea presented higher efficiency from July to October. Playback expanded the favourable period for avifaunal surveys in tropical forest, usually restricted to early morning in the breeding season. The playback was efficient in detecting the presence of all species when the abundance was not too low. But only B. leucoblepharus and T surrucura showed abundance values significantly related to this efficiency. The present study provided a precise indication of the best daily and seasonal periods and a confidence interval to maximize the efficiency of playback to detect the occurrence of these forest species.

Here we used the circular plot method to carry out complete bird inventories in undisturbed, once burned (1998) and twice burned forests (1983 and 1998) in East Kalimantan (Indonesia). Additionally, environmental variables were measured within a 25 m radius of each plot. Three years after fire the number of birds and bird species were similar for undisturbed and burned forests, but species diversity and turnover were significantly lower in the burned forests. The bird species composition also differed significantly between undisturbed and burned forests, with a strong decline of closed forest preferring bird species accompanied by a strong increase in degraded forest preferring species in burned forests. These differences were strongly related to differences in environmental conditions such as shifts in vegetation cover and layering and differences in ground and understorey vegetation structure. We also found significant shifts in body mass distribution, foraging height and feeding guilds between the bird communities in unburned and burned forests. Surprisingly, repeated burning did not lead to increasing impoverishment of the avifauna, and both once and twice burned forests still contained most of the bird species that were also present in undisturbed forest, even though their densities were considerably lowered.

The southern Amazonian 'arc of deforestation' marks the boundary of the most aggressive agricultural frontier in tropical forests worldwide. We sampled 21 disturbed and undisturbed primary forest patches, ranging in size from 1.2 to 14,476 ha, to elucidate the synergistic effects of both forest disturbance and fragmentation on bird community structure, and pinpoint which species were the "winners" and "losers" from this process. A number of forest patch metrics, derived from an independent remote sensing approach, explained much of the resulting presence/absence matrix. The bird community exhibited a highly nested structure, with small patches being most dissimilar from one another. Bird species differed in their response to both forest patch size and forest canopy perforation according to their dependence on closed-canopy primary forest. Forest patch geometry, which clearly modulated the shape of species-area relationships accounted for 83-96% of the variation in species richness, but forest habitat quality resulting from logging and surface-fire disturbance was also a significant predictor of species richness for the most forest-dependent taxa.

Condor		2006	NOV 2006	108	4	817-831	817	831	English						3	51	We investigated the effects of postfire salvage logging on cavity-nesting birds by comparing nest densities and patterns of nest reuse over a three-year period in seven logged and eight unlogged patches of mixed-conifer forest in the Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife Management Area, Montana. We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots, but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots. Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in the salvage-logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent species in the northern Rocky Mountains-American Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters, which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots, nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially populations of primary cavity-nesting species.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2006	NOV 2006	70	5	1379-1392	1379	1392	English						0	22	We investigated how changes in vegetation structure and prey resources following wildfire affected the winter ecology of hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona, USA. Using point-counts, radiotelemetry, and focal bird observation, we assessed the relative abundance, home range size and composition, and habitat use by foraging hairy woodpeckers in 3 stands that had experienced wildfire in 1996, 2000, or 2002. Because we conducted the study over 2 years, we used the 1996 fire to represent 6 and 7 years after fire, while we used the 2000 fire to represent 2 and 3 years after fire in a space-for-time substitution chronosequence analysis. We also assessed bark beetle and woodborer density by x-raying bark samples collected from a subset of trees within burned areas. We detected significantly greater hairy woodpecker relative abundance in burned forests representing 1 and 2 years after fire, and bark beetle and woodborer density was highest in these stands as well. Woodpecker home range size increased across stands representing increasing time since fire. Within a burn, hairy woodpeckers used high-severity burned areas more than moderate-severity burned areas representing 2 and 3 years after fire, but not in areas representing 6 and 7 years after fire. Bark beetle and woodborer densities were also higher in high-severity burned stands representing 2 and 3 years after fire. Hairy woodpeckers used edges of high-severity burned areas more than the interior. We hypothesize that an initial increase in bark beetle and woodborer density following fire allowed for higher woodpecker abundance and smaller home ranges, but as burned forests aged, bark beetle and woodborer density within trees decreased, killed trees fell, and, in response, hairy woodpecker relative abundance decreased and home range size increased. These patterns suggest that high-severity burned areas provide important but ephemeral resources to this dominant primary cavity-nester. The higher bark beetle and woodborer densities and greater use of edges of high-severity burned areas by woodpeckers suggests that salvage logging of these areas could remove potential prey and preferred foraging areas for hairy woodpeckers, especially when trees are removed along severely burned edges.

Wildlife Society Bulletin		2006	NOV 2006	34	4	944-956	944	956	English						1	38	Currently over 14.6 million ha of land at an annual cost of US$1.76 billion are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CPP). The habitat benefits of CRP frequently are lauded, but documentation that wildlife is responding as hoped is urgently needed. We evaluated plant and breeding bird responses to 92.4 ha of CPP grasslands at China Farms in northeastern Maryland, USA. In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and facilitate stand establishment. In 6 years cumulative plant species richness increased to 261, 105 of which were species exotic to the region. During the third growing season, we initiated a schedule of prescribed burning on a 3-year rotation to remove accumulated litter and to retard woody succession, and in 2003 we added additional management to control aggressive plant species. Several at-risk bird species colonized the restored grasslands in the first year and established sustainable breeding populations. We implemented a comprehensive observation and banding program, which included mapping male territories for selected bird species and recording nest locations. We marked 1,985 grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; GRSPs) in 7 years. Breeding GRSP populations ranged annually from 70 to 90 socially monogamous pairs with an additional 40 non-territorial males. Annual return rates in the last 5 years were 57% for adult males, 41% for adult females, and 12% for hatch-year individuals. Adults and young birds exhibited high site fidelity, but overgrown fields left unburned for 2-3 years were unpopulated by GRSPs but attracted several shrub-land bird species. Habitat preference for territories was influenced more by vegetation structure than by plant species composition. We recommend the management of grasslands restored for birds include spatial and temporal rotation of prescribed fire and herbicide applications to sustain vegetation physical structure rather than species composition.

Auk		2006	OCT 2006	123	4	1110-1128	1110	1128	English						4	54	We determined the effects of fire history and a riparian-upland gradient on the breeding bird community at Fort Bragg Military Installation in North Carolina, one of the largest remnant areas of the endangered longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. Study sites were classified into two treatments: fire-intense (areas experiencing growing-season burns) and fire-suppressed (areas lacking fires). Within each treatment, bird and vegetation data were recorded at point-count stations positioned at three distances from streamhead pocosins to characterize the riparian-upland habitat gradient: 0, 75, and >= 150 m. Total bird abundance and species richness varied significantly along the riparian-upland gradient, with pocosins contributing greatly to avian biodiversity. Our data revealed strong effects of fire history and riparian-upland gradient on bird species, which we described in terms of breeding-bird assemblages. Members of the open longleaf assemblage (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker [Picoides borealis], Bachman's Sparrow [Aimophila aestivalis]) were most common in fire-intense areas and at upland locations. Members of the fire-suppressed assemblage (e.g., Wood Thrush [Hylocichla mustelina], Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapilla]) were confined to pocosins in fire-intense areas, but became more abundant in fire-suppressed areas. Members of the pocosin assemblage (e.g., Eastern Towhee [Pipilo erythropthalamus], Common Yellowthroat [Geothlypis trichas]) were largely confined to pocosins and, in some cases, were most abundant in fire-intense pocosins. Fire suppression increased structural diversity of vegetation and promoted one breeding-bird assemblage (fire-suppressed), but at the expense of two others (open longleaf, pocosin). Continued management of Fort Bragg to promote longleaf pine restoration is essential for supporting conservation of the open-longleaf bird assemblage; in addition, it will benefit the pocosin assemblage.

We used five treatments: control (no removal), clear-cut (100% removal), and 25, 50, and 75% removal of basal area. Territory mapping was used to quantify bird community between mid-April and July of both 2002 and 2003. Microclimate variables were recorded at each plot. The residual basal area and canopy cover showed three distinct conditions after treatment: closed canopy, open forest, and clear-cut. The microclimate varied among treatments: air temperature was highest in clear-cut plots and lowest in control plots, whereas soil moisture had the opposite pattern. A total of 71 bird species were detected, with 36 of them defending territories. Territory density, species richness, and Shannon diversity index differed among the treatments; the relationship between these bird community indices and the level of basal area removal was quadratic, lowest in the clear-cut plots and highest in the intermediate levels. Although species richness was similar among the control, 25, 50, and 75% removal treatments, species composition varied. The richness difference among treatments became smaller in the second year post-treatment (2003) with an increase in bird density and richness occurring in the clear-cut plots.

Several species of cavity-nesting birds are non-migratory residents and consequently subject to winter conditions. We conducted winter bird counts from 1998 to 2000 to examine the abundance and habitat association of cavity-nesting birds in prescribed burned and unburned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands. Even though bird diversity indices did not differ between burned and unburned stands, species-specific bird abundance was associated with habitat variables in three burned and four unburned stands. Total cavity-nesting bird abundance was greater in burned stands. Most cavity-nesting birds were observed in mixed-species flocks. Individual species of these flocks were associated with different habitat variables within stands. Numbers of woodpeckers were significantly greater in burned stands and numbers of chickadees were significantly greater in unburned stands. Bark foragers such as woodpeckers (Picoides spp.) and pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea) were associated with fewer small trees and recently decayed snags and logs. Foliage gleaners such as the chickadees (Poecile spp.) were associated with small diameter snags. The juxtaposition of burned and unburned stands is important for individual birds reliant upon other members of a mixed-species flock and habitat heterogeneity within stands is important for maintaining a diverse cavity-nesting bird assemblage.

Large-scale restoration efforts are focusing on revegetating the land with native plants. To evaluate restoration success, we conducted surveys of landbirds on revegetated and remnant riparian plots from 1993 to 2003. Our objectives were to estimate population trends of landbirds, compare abundance patterns over time between revegetated and remnant riparian forests, and evaluate abundance in relation to restoration age. Of the 20 species examined, 11 were increasing, 1 was decreasing (Lazuli Bunting [Passerina amoena]), and 8 showed no trend. The negative trend for Lazuli Bunting is consistent with information on poor reproductive success and with Breeding Bird Survey results. There was no apparent guild association common to species with increasing trends. Nine species were increasing on revegetated and remnant plots, four were increasing on revegetated plots only, three were increasing on remnant plots only, the Lazuli Bunting was decreasing on both, and three species were stable on both. Although many species were increasing at a faster rate on revegetated plots, their abundance did not reach that of the remnant plots. For revegetated plots, "year since planting" was a strong predictor of abundance trends for 13 species: positive for 12, negative for 1. Our study shows that restoration activities along the Sacramento River are successfully providing habitat for a diverse community of landbirds and that results from bird monitoring provide a meaningful way to evaluate restoration success.

To assess the effects of recent fires (median time since fire = 6 yr) on the montane forest bird community, we surveyed birds in 8 Sky Island mountain ranges in southeastern Arizona, USA, and examined how the distribution (i.e., presence-absence) of 65 species and relative abundance of 16 species correlated with evidence of severe and less severe fire at > 1,500 survey points. We detected associations between fire and bird presence-absence for 17% of the 65 species analyzed and between fire and bird relative abundance for 25% of the 16 species analyzed. Most species (73%) were positively associated with burned areas and displayed stronger associations (i.e., more extreme odds ratios) with survey points that had evidence of severe as opposed to less severe fire. Positive associations with severe fire were strong (> 3 to 1 odds) for western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and house wren (Troglodytes aedon), and negative associations with severe fire were strong for warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus) and red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis). Although recent fires appear to have had a positive effect on the distribution and relative abundance of several montane forest bird species in the region, these species are not the open-woodland birds that we would have expected to have benefited from fire based on previous research. Nevertheless, our results confirm associations between fire and bird presence-absence and relative abundance reported previously for 7 species of birds. Our results also provide new information for Grace's warbler Dendroica graciae) and greater pewee (C. pertinax), 2 species for which fire data were formerly lacking. Managers can use these data to make and test predictions about the effects of future fires, both severe and less severe, on montane forest birds in the southwestern United States.

Landscape and Urban Planning		2006	JUN 15 2006	77	1-2	39-53	39	53	English						15	230	A functional network of green space is important for the maintenance of the ecological dimension of a sustainable urban landscape. We used avian ecological diversity as a proxy for evaluating the functionality of different types of urban green space. The urban landscape of the municipality of Orebro in Sweden was stratified into four strata (City centre, Residential, Greenway and Periphery). Bird species found in these strata were classified into four ecological groups with decreasing degree of specialisation (woodpeckers, hole-nesters, forest birds and urban birds). Overall there was lower bird species richness in the City centre and Residential areas compared to the Greenway and Periphery. Woodpeckers, hole-nesters and forest birds showed an increasing trend in the number of species as well as individuals from the City centre to the Periphery while urban birds showed the opposite trend. The amount and quality of green space as well as natural vegetation increased from the City centre to the Periphery. Species richness of woodpeckers, forest birds and hole-nesters were positively correlated with tree density while urban birds showed an inverse correlation. There was no dead wood in City centre, Residential and Greenway in contrast to the Periphery, which held some dying trees, stumps and old windthrows. Our findings emphasise the importance of urban green space with natural structures to maintain high ecological diversity. Finally, we discuss how conflicts between habitat for biodiversity maintenance and other functions of green space could be handled by zoning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	Sandstrom, U.

Our research was undertaken between January 2002 and July 2004 at the Reserva Ducke, near Manaus (02 degrees 055', 03 degrees 01'S; 59 degrees 53',59 degrees 59'W) in central Amazonia, to verify how the forest structure affects the occurence and abundance of two bird species: the Plain-brown Woodcreeper Dendrocincla fuliginosa and the White-chinned Woodcreeper Dendrocincla merula. Bird species occurrence was recorded using lines of 20 mist-nets (one sample unit), along 511-km transects distributed along, 9 pararel 8 kin trails covering an area of 6400 ha. Along these transects, we placed 50 x 50m plots where we recorded forest structure components (tree abundance, canopy openness, leaf litter, standing dead trees, logs, proximity to streams, and altitude). We then related these variables to bird occurence and abundance using multiple logistic and multiple linear regression models, respectively. We found that D. fuliginosa frequently used plateau areas being more abundant in areas with more trees. On the other hand, D. merula Occurred more frequently and was more abundant in areas with low tree abundance. Our results suggest iliac although both species overlap in the reserve (both were recorded in at least 68% of the sampled sites). they differ in the way they use the forest microhabitats. help to maintain Therefore, local variation in the forest structure may contribute to the coexistence of congeneric species and may local alpha diversity.

However, relatively little is known about the effects of fire on faunal biodiversity in savannas. We conducted a short-term study to examine the effects of a replicated experimental burn on bird diversity and abundance in savanna habitat of central Kenya. Twenty-two months after the burn, Shannon diversity of birds was 32% higher on plots that had been burned compared with paired control plots. We observed no significant effects of burning on total bird abundance or species richness. Several families of birds were found only on plots that had been burned; one species, the rattling cisticola (Cisticola chiniana), was found only on unburned plots. Shrub canopy area was negatively correlated with bird diversity on each plot, and highly correlated with grass height and the abundance of orthopterans. Our results suggest that the highest landscape-level bird diversity might be obtained through a mosaic of burned and unburned patches. This is also most likely to approximate the historical state of bird diversity in this habitat, because patchy fires have been an important natural disturbance in tropical ecosystems for millennia.

This article discusses how targets for efforts to maintain and restore dead wood in managed forest landscapes should be defined. Several studies suggest extinction thresholds for saproxylic organisms. However, because the thresholds differ among species, the relationship between species richness and habitat amount at the local scale is probably described by a smoothly increasing curve without any distinct threshold. The most demanding species require amounts of dead wood that are virtually impossible to reach in managed forests. This means that unmanaged protected forests are needed. In managed forests, conservation efforts should focus on the landscape scale and on certain types of dead wood, but it is impossible to come up with any particular amount of dead wood that is desirable at the forest stand level.

At SRS, sparrows occurred primarily in two habitats: mature pine habitats managed for Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) and pine plantations 1 to 6 years of age. The mean 95% minimum convex polygon home-range size for males and females combined (n = 14) was 2.95 ha +/- 0.57 SE, across all habitats. Mean homerange size for males in mature pine stands (4.79 ha +/- 0.27, n = 4) was significantly larger than that in 4-year-old (3.00 ha +/- 0.31, n = 3) and 2-year-old stands (1.46 ha +/- 0.31, it = 3). Home-range sizes of paired males and females (it = 4 pairs) were similar within habitat type; mean distances between consecutive locations differed by habitat type and sex. We hypothesize that a gradient in food resources drives home-range dynamics.

The present study addresses the question of the conservation value for birds of clearcutting-related open areas in European temperate forest, in the context of a mixed woodland-farmland landscape. The point count technique was used to census the breeding birds on 300 sampling plots, distributed in the eight main habitat types of the Ardenne region (southern Belgium), including agricultural land, edge habitats, closed forest habitats and open areas in forest. Most of these open areas in forest derive from clearcutting practices, rapidly planted with young Norway Spruce (Picea abies). We quantified the conservation value of a given habitat type by using a "conservation value index", integrating the frequency of occurrence of each species in the considered habitat and their conservation status in Europe or in southern Belgium. Both conservation value index and species richness were higher for edge habitats and open areas in forest, compared to forest interior and agricultural land. Detrended Correspondence Analysis of the plot species lists showed that bird assemblages from open area in forest are not intermediate between forest and agricultural open land, as opposed to external edge habitats. Hence, open areas in forest do not contain bird assemblages composed of forest species mixed with colonizing agricultural species but rather shelter specific bird assemblages. An Indicator Species analysis further emphasized this specificity and identified seven species, which, in the Ardenne context, form a group of species specific to open areas in forest. Due to major changes of land use in the Ardenne during the 20th century, which leads to a tremendous decrease of moor, heath and fallow land areas, clearcut openings in the plantation forest progressively gained high conservation value at the regional scale. Further studies about habitat requirement of the conservation interest species inhabiting these open areas is needed, including a better understanding of how early-successional species react to forest planning. If plantation forestry evolves to an uneven-aged and more permanently closed forest, then other options, including semi-natural habitat restoration, are urgently required to save early-successional bird communities.

Thus, harvesting that is as similar as possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities. We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds) from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies. Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a single forest type.

We considered habitat loss, the breaking apart of habitat patches, and habitat structural alteration critical processes that affect species distribution and abundance. We evaluated the effects of these processes by considering the response of selected indicator species to isolation (landscape scale), patch size and edge effect (patch scale), and habitat structure (plot scale). We used broadleaf forests as our case-study ecosystem and birds as indicator species. Faunal data came from a georeferenced, long-term, breeding-bird database, and environmental data were obtained from field surveys and land-use digital cartography. Birds, grouped according to their sensitivity to patch isolation, patch size, edge effect, and habitat structure, indicated how environmental conditions affected species abundance. The most sensitive group to the above-mentioned processes included the Marsh Tit (Parus palustris), Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), and Short-toed Treecreeper (Certhia brachydactyla). We evaluated the umbrella effect of these species for the conservation of the other co-occurring birds and found that their effectiveness varied according to the criterion used to select sites for protection. Site selection based on indicator species identified forest patches with greater species abundance than an alternative criterion that chose sites based on patch isolation and size, edge effect, and forest structure. The alternative criterion, although not as efficient as indicator species, may nevertheless be useful and effective for conservation when faunal data are lacking and guidelines for habitat management or restoration are needed. Our method is applicable to other ecosystems and taxa because the processes we considered occur in many ecosystems and may have significant effects on species from all taxonomic groups.

The different disturbance treatments had distinct effects on avian guild structure, and fire disturbance and the isolation of forest patches resulted in bird communities that were most divergent from those in continuous, undisturbed forest in terms of their species composition. Although low-intensity logging treatments had the least noticeable effects, the composition of understorey birds was still markedly different from the composition in undisturbed forest. This analysis demonstrates the importance of preventing habitat fragmentation and the spread of fires in humid tropical forests, and highlights the need for more research to determine the long-term suitability of large areas of degraded forest for forest birds.

We examined relationships between prescribed fire history and abundance and habitat of breeding passerines in Drift Plain prairie at Des Lacs National Wildlife National Refuge in northwestern North Dakota. In 2003, we used point counts (n = 79 75 m radius plots) to survey bird abundance on 16 management units that had been prescribe-burned one to three times each since 1992. General habitat composition and structure also were measured at each point count plot. We detected 14 passerine species, six of which were common (occurred on greater than 10 % of plots). Three endemic, historically common passerine species were rare or absent regardless of fire history. Abundances of common bird species were not influenced strongly by fire history, which contrasts with data from research on the adjacent Missouri Coteau physiographic subregion. Vegetation structure (litter depth and plant height-density) and occurrence of an exotic grass species, smooth brome (Bromus inermis), decreased with fire history. However, we detected no relationships between bird species abundances and these particular vegetation variables, perhaps because smooth brome continued to be a pervasive structural influence on all management units. Our findings indicate a need for better understanding of bird-fire relationships on remnant prairies in the vast Drift Plain.

Tree cavity availability is reduced in heavily managed forests, making cavity nesting species particularly vulnerable to the high rates of forest loss and degradation that occur every day in the remaining wilderness areas of the country. We analyzed information about nesting behavior, distribution, and conservation status of resident landbird avifauna from 35 important and protected bird areas of Mexico. The main intention was to determine the proportion of resident bird species that nest in tree cavities and are more sensitive to intensive forest management practices. Our results revealed that 17% (112 species) of the resident landbird avifauna need tree cavities for nesting. Cavity nesters represented a higher proportion of endangered and threatened species than non-cavity nesters. The families Strigidae and Psittacidae represented the highest number of tree cavity nesting species in status. In the 35 avifaunas examined, the mean percentage of cavity nesting species ranged from 17% to 21%. The cloud forest reserve of "El Triunfo" with 43 species, is the area with the highest concentration of cavity nesting species in Mexico. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We tested factors affecting nest survival, parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), and species abundance in shrubland habitat in rural and urban landscapes. We found no support for our hypothesis that nest survival was lower in urban landscapes, but strong support for the hypothesis that survival increased with nest height. We found strong support for our hypothesis that cowbird parasitism was greater in urban than rural landscapes; parasitism in urban sites was at least twice that of rural sites. We found strong support for an urban landscape effect on abundance for several species; Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Brown-headed Cowbirds were more abundant in urban landscapes, whereas Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla) and Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora pinus) were more abundant in rural sites. There was support for lower abundances of Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea) and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) with increased housing density. For six other species, edge and trail density or vegetation parameters best explained abundance. Lower abundances and greater parasitism in habitat patches in urban landscapes are evidence that, for some species, these urban landscapes do not fulfill the same role as comparable habitats in rural landscapes. Regional bird conservation planning and local habitat management in urban landscapes may need to consider these effects in efforts to sustain bird populations at regional and local scales.

Peatlands have suffered great losses following drainage for agriculture, forestry, urbanisation, or peat mining, near inhabited areas. We evaluated the faunal and vegetation patterns after restoration of a peatland formerly mined for peat. We assessed whether bog pools created during restoration are similar to natural bog pools in terms of water chemistry, vegetation structure and composition, as well as amphibian and arthropod occurrence patterns.2. Both avian species richness and peatland vegetation cover at the site increased following restoration. Within bog pools, however, the vegetation composition differed between natural and man-made pools. The cover of low shrubs, Sphagnum moss, submerged, emergent and floating vegetation in man-made pools was lower than in natural pools, whereas pH was higher than in typical bog pools. Dominant plant species also differed between man-made and natural pools.3. Amphibian tadpoles, juveniles and adults occurred more often in man-made pools than natural bog pools. Although some arthropods, including Coleoptera bog specialists, readily colonised the pools, their abundance was two to 26 times lower than in natural bog pools. Plant introduction in bog pools, at the stocking densities we applied, had no effect on the occurrence of most groups.4. We conclude that our restoration efforts were partially successful. Peatland-wide vegetation patterns following restoration mimicked those of natural peatlands, but 4 years were not sufficient for man-made pools to fully emulate the characteristics of natural bog pools.

We used a replicated landscape study to evaluate relationships between forest structure and avian diversity at both stand and landscape-levels. We used data on bird communities collected under comparable sampling protocols on four managed forests located across the Southeastern US to develop logistic regression models describing relationships between habitat factors and the distribution of overall richness and richness of selected guilds. Landscape models generated for eight of nine guilds showed a strong relationship between richness and both availability and configuration of landscape features. Diversity of topographic features and heterogeneity of forest structure were primary determinants of avian species richness. Forest heterogeneity, in both age and forest type, were strongly and positively associated with overall avian richness and richness for most guilds. Road density was associated positively but weakly with avian richness. Landscape variables dominated all models generated, but no consistent patterns in metrics or scale were evident. Model fit was strong for neotropical migrants and relatively weak for short-distance migrants and resident species. Our models provide a tool that will allow managers to evaluate and demonstrate quantitatively how management practices affect avian diversity on landscapes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

For the time being, both significant increase and reduction in species richness was observed, according to the plot. New species of invertebrates have been reported and field methods in epiphytic lichens and deadwood assessment have been tested. Stand structure and soil properties have been identified as significant predictors of vascular plant species richness. For beech plots, N seems to play a significant role. Data quality issues problems and insufficient length of monitoring time window have been reported as major limitations. In future, new data from the repetition of previous survey and from new plots will help the analysis and the interpretation.

Two control plots were monitored in each of 2 yr. Food was Supplemented on five plots over 2 yr with piles of cut oranges distributed around plots, which served as a direct source of carbobydrates and water, and an indirect Source of ground arthropods due to increased above-ground activity. We reduced ants on five plots over 2 yr; however, We found no difference in total ground arthropod biomass between control and reduction treatments, so we pooled these plots For analysis. We selected nine focal resident bird species for study of relative abundance, body condition, and breeding condition. Birds were sampled prior to, and 5 to 6 weeks after the initiation of treatments. Seven of nine species had higher relative abundance following food supplementation. Three species were recaptured more frequently in supplementation plots than in control plots. These abundance and persistence responses did not Cause any changes in body condition. In one species, Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), food supplementation resulted in higher concentrations of individuals in breeding condition. These results demonstrated Functional response to dry-season food availability and suggest a limiting mechanism. This Study helps explain mechanisms by which bird populations respond to resource availibility, and is the first Successful plot-level food supplementation experiment for tropical forest birds.

The consequence was appearance of favourable environmental conditions for the Nightjar. The study plot covered a part of the burnt area situated within the Rudy Raciborskie Forest Division, occupying 4500 ha. In 2003 a single control was performed-in the 2nd and 3rd decade of June, during which 80-85 displaying males (density 17.8-18.9 pairs/10 km(2)) were observed within the study area. During the two 2004 controls (in the 2nd and 3rd decade of June, and the 1st of July) the species abundance was estimated at 80-90 breeding pairs (density 17.8-20.0 pairs/10 km2) and 160-180 pairs on the whole fire-burnt area. The Nightjar territories were distributed evenly about the whole study plot. The birds occupied sites inside dense young pine woods, predominating in the fire-burnt area. The species density within the fire-burnt area in the Rudy Raciborskie Forest Division ranks among the highest in Poland. This results from the size of open space area and occurrence of deciduous tree species (birch, oak) both in the remnants of old tree stand and in the new stands, which is probably conducive to abundance of insects the Nightjar feeds on.

Species richness was 25% greater in forested stands compared to clearcut areas, yet total bird density was 50% greater in clearcut areas. Bird communities ranged from open-habitat assemblages in clearcut areas to forest-obligate assemblages in ST stands. Little overlap of avian community composition was observed between ST stands and clearcut areas. PT and SS stands supported avian communities where most species were observed at intermediate abundance values compared to ST or clearcut areas. Highly fragmented, closed-canopy stands embedded within the silvicultural landscape of HSNF do not support large populations of species traditionally associated with detrimental edge effects on forest-obligate songbirds. Intensively managed PT and SS stands appear to provide suboptimal habitat for forest and grassland species. Land managers in HSNF could maximize regional avian diversity by maintaining a mosaic of large closed-canopy, oak-pine stands, and fire-maintained open areas embedded among other silvicultural stand types.

About 80% of the trees were uprooted. Bird densities were surveyed in spring and the results from a strict forest reserve and a managed forest were compared. The survey was started in 1994, repeated in 1999 previous to the storm and continued in 2000 and 2001. Bird densities, nesting cavities and cavity trees were recorded. In 1994 and 2002, forest structure and composition were recorded using a sampling method; these data have been used for interpretation of the ornithological data. Before the storm, bird diversity and species composition were very similar in the two forest types. Cavity-nesting birds reached higher densities in the strict forest reserve because they used the higher amount of dead wood (snags) and damaged trees for breeding and foraging. After the gale, bird communities of the compared areas evolved differently. The not cleared strict forest reserve had higher bird densities than the cleared forest. In the cleared forest, species composition was found to have changed more than in the strict forest reserve. The differences in the density of cavity-nesting birds between the strict forest reserve and the managed forest increased. Tree species was found to be less important than tree consistency for cavity-nesting birds. Snags and damaged trees became more important for cavity-nesting birds in the strict forest reserve. They were found to breed even in fallen dead tree sterns. Only in the strict forest reserve uplifted tree roots and fallen tree crowns created important nesting habitats for several bird species. Most bird species settled in the forest both before as well as after the storm. Some characteristic forest species disappeared and some species of open land occurred especially in the cleared parts of the managed forest. At these places the managed forest changed temporarily into open grassland with scattered trees. The strict forest reserve remained a forest covered predominantly by trees, either standing or lying on the ground.

Our observations revealed that the subspecies utilises a variety of tree. stands with rough bark, including pure willow-poplar and alder woods. Furthermore, breeding was confirmed in beech-fir and polydominant broad-leaved forests containing large amounts of dead wood. We observed foraging birds up to the tree line at 1200 m. We assume, that the woodpecker inhabits all kinds of broad-leaved forests in the area that feature a sufficient amount of dead wood. These observations are in agreement with new findings from Central Europe, which contradict the traditional opinion of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker being a species strongly dependent on mature oak stands. Furthermore, we present data on population density and differences in voice compared to the nominate race. Using our density data, we calculate a new population estimate for the northwestern Caucasus of 8050 to 9200 breeding pairs.

Out of 24 species inhabiting old pine forests, only three (Tree Pipit, Coal Tit, Scarlet Rosefinch) were still found immediately after the fire; 1 one species (Song Thrush) newly occurred. Bird abundance declined to approx. 20%. Only the Tree Pipit maintained its previous density and continued to predominate. In late summer, nine species were seen, and Great Spotted Woodpecker, Coal Tit, and Willow Tit reached the density they had prior to the fire. Total bird abundance was minimal during that phase (63 ind./kral). Three years after the fire, 12 species were found in early summer, the growth of shrubbery favouring warblers, Siberian Rubythroat, Red-flanked Bluetail, Brown Shrike (all new), and Scarlet Rosefinch. Having dominated the previous communities, the Tree Pipit exhibited a significant decline. The increasing food supply during summer (berries etc.) supported new species (Hazel Grouse, thrushes), which then occurred at high densities. However, the number of species and the total bird abundance were still below the values of the initial communities in old forests.

In this study, spatial patterns of bird diversity in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, were examined and associated with local-scale (habitat structure and heterogeneity) and landscape-scale (logging, slope position and elevation) environmental variables. Within the study area (c. 196 km(2)) local habitat structure and heterogeneity varied considerably, largely due to logging. In total 9747 individuals of 177 bird species were recorded. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) revealed that the best explanatory models of bird community similarity and species richness included both local- and landscape-scale environmental variables. Important local-scale variables included liana abundance, fern cover, sapling density, tree density, dead wood abundance and tree architecture, while important landscape-scale variables were elevation, logging and slope position. Geographic distance between sampling sites was not significantly associated with spatial variation in either species richness or similarity. These results indicate that deterministic environmental processes, as opposed to dispersal-driven stochastic processes, primarily structure bird assemblages within the spatial scale of this study and confirm that highly variable local habitat measures can be effective means of predicting landscape-scale community patterns.

Partners in Flight guidelines recommend painted bunting conservation as a high priority with a need for management by state and federal agencies. Basic information on home range and survival of breeding painted buntings will provide managers with required habitat types and estimates of land areas necessary to maintain minimum population sizes for this species. We radiotracked after-second-year male and after-hatching-year female buntings on Sapelo Island, Georgia, during the breeding seasons (late April-early August) of 1997 and 1998. We used the animal movement extension in ArcView to determine fixed-kernel home range in an unmanaged maritime shrub and managed 60-80-year-old pine (Pinus spp.)-oak Quercus spp.) forest. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we estimated an adult breeding season survival of 1.00 for males (n = 36) and 0.94 (SE = 0.18)for females(n=27). Painted bunting home ranges were smaller in unmanaged maritime shrub (female: kernel (x) over bar = 3.5 ha [95% CI: 2.5-4.51; male: kernel (x) over bar = 3.1 ha [95% CI: 2.3-3.9]) compared to those in managed pine-oak forests (female: kernel (x) over bar = 4.7 ha [95% CI: 2.8-6.6]; male: kernel (x) over bar = 7.0 ha [95% CI: 4.9-9.1]). Buntings nesting in the managed pine-oak forest flew long distances (>= 300 m) to forage in salt marshes, freshwater wetlands, and moist forest clearings. In maritime shrub buntings occupied a compact area and rarely moved long distances. The painted bunting population of Sapelo Island requires conservation of maritime shrub as potential optimum nesting habitat and management of nesting habitat in open-canopy pine-oak sawtimber forests by periodic prescribed fire (every 4-6 years) and timber thinning within a landscape that contains salt marsh or freshwater wetland openings within 700 m of those forests.

Mist-net captures and visual counts were used to assess species richness and bird abundance pre- and post-fire in an approximately 20 ha area. Visual counts along transects were used to survey birds in an approximately 2000 ha area in a nearby area. Results using the same method of ordination analysis (multidimensional scaling) showed significant effects of fire in the 20 ha and 2000 ha areas and strongly suggest direct effects on bird community composition. However, the effects were different at different spatial scales and/or in different years, indicating that the effects of fire vary spatially and/or temporally. Bird community composition pre-fire was significantly different from that found post-fire. Using Multiple regression analysis it was found that the numbers of burned and unburned trees were not significantly related to either bird species richness or bird abundance. Two months after the fire, neither bird species richness nor bird abundance was significantly related to the number of flowering trees (Lafoensia pacari) or fruiting trees (Byrsonima crassifolia). Since fire is an annual event in Alter-do-Chao and is becoming frequent in the entire Amazon, bird community composition in affected areas could be constantly changing in time and space.

An individual-based spatially explicit population model was developed to investigate these factors using the distribution of nuthatches in an area of eastern England as an example. The effects of immigration and increasing the area of breeding quality habitat were explored. Predictions were compared with observed population sizes in the study area. Our model combined a nuthatch population simulator based on individual behaviour with a grid-based representation of the landscape; nuthatch life cycle and immigration parameters were user selectable. A novel aspect of the model is user-selection of habitat perceptual range. Using a realistic set of parameters, the number of breeding pairs predicted by the model matched observed numbers. According to model simulations, the main cause of nuthatch scarcity in the study area was the inability of patches to support viable populations without immigration from elsewhere. Modelled habitat management, which increased breeding quality habitat in existing woods, lowered the threshold above which the study area population became self-sustaining. The existence of a large core habitat area was critical in producing a self-sustaining population in this landscape, the same area in dispersed small woods failed to sustain populations.

We took advantage of a unique opportunity to use a before-after/control-impact (BACI) approach to analyze changes in bird assemblages after the severe fires of 2000 in the Bitterroot Valley, Montana. Observers surveyed birds using 10-minute point counts and collected vegetation data from 13 burned and 13 unburned transects for five years before fire and three years after fire. We compared changes in vegetation variables and relative bird abundance from before to after fire between the set of points that burned and the set of points that did not burn. The magnitude of change in vegetation variables from before to after fire increased with fire severity. The relative abundances of nine bird species showed significantly greater changes from before to after fire at burned points compared with unburned points. Moreover, when burned points were separated by whether they burned at low, moderate, or high severity, an additional 10 species showed significant changes in relative abundance from before to after fire at one or more severities. Overall, almost twice as many bird species increased as decreased significantly in response to fire. We also found changes in abundance between one year after and two years after fire for most species that responded to fire. Thus, species that have been termed "mixed responders" in the literature appear to be responding differently to different fire severities or different time periods since fire, rather than responding variably to the same fire conditions. These findings underscore the importance of fire severity and time since fire and imply that both factors must be considered to understand the complexities of fire effects on biological communities. Because different bird species responded positively to different fire severities, our results suggest a need to manage public lands for the maintenance of all kinds of fires, not just the low-severity, understory burns that dominate most discussions revolving around the use of fire in forest restoration.

In many cases the indicators have been chosen on empirical bases without testing their predictive power. This study describes a number of structural and compositional parameters in Vaccinium vitis-idaea pine forest over a wide range of stand age and management intensity values. A robust index was developed to describe management intensity: area-weighted sum of anthropogenic activities, based on the forest management database. After the removal of forest age effect, forest management intensity had a negative influence on spruce abundance, number of diameter classes, basal area and number of decay classes of dead wood. Stepwise logistic regression analysis produced the optimal set of indicators for the evaluation of dry boreal forest naturalness: basal area of lying dead wood, structural variation of the tree layer, herb-layer species composition and presence/absence of woodpeckers.

Wildfires can increase or decrease the availability of snags to wildlife by killing live trees or incinerating snags. Our objectives were to describe dynamics and spatial patterns of fire-killed snags in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona and predict the probability of snag use by cavity nesters. We established six 1-ha plots following two recent fires that occurred in northern Arizona (Hochderffer fire of 1996 [H96] and Pumpkin fire of 2000 [P00]) to determine ponderosa pine snag availability and use by wildlife as evidenced by presence of excavated cavities. For comparison, six paired 1-ha plots in nearby unburned areas were sampled with burned plots. For the twelve 1 ha plots, field methods included mapping and measuring 15 characteristics for 668 snags (630 in burned and 38 in unburned plots) 4 years post-fire on the H96 fire, and 1010 snags (996 in burned and 14 in unburned plots) 1 year post-fire on the POO fire. We remeasured characteristics of all snags in 2003. Most burned snags were standing 3 years after fire, but 7 years after fire, 41% had fallen. Snags in burned plots were clumped when initially measured and remeasured. After 7 years, snags in burned plots that were still standing were straight, large diameter trees in denser clumps. Density of excavated cavities was similar between burned (3.0 ha(-1)) and unburned (2.2 ha(-1)) plots, even though burned areas produced much higher densities of snags. Snags (both burned and unburned) that were most likely to contain excavated cavities were large diameter with broken tops. This evidence of cavity nester use indicates that in ponderosa pine forests in the southwest, retaining large diameter snags is important to cavity nesters regardless of snag origin. If salvage logging is to occur in severely burned ponderosa pine in the southwest, retaining straight, large diameter snags in clumps will help maintain snags for cavity-excavating species.

Surveys were conducted on permanent, 25 ha mine and control plots. Five metrics (relative density of individual species, relative density of all birds, species richness using rarefaction curves, and species diversity using two indices) were used to assess potential impacts up to a distance of 1 km from the mine. Six species were more common on mine plots, and three were more common on control plots. Species diversity was slightly higher on mine plots when measured with Fisher's alpha index. No other metrics suggested strong impacts. This study suggests that the mine has had a relatively limited impact on the upland breeding bird community within 1 km of the footprint but has provided habitat for at least one synanthropic bird species. Further monitoring of breeding birds on the tundra should include pre-development control data and demographic variables such as reproductive success and survival.

Birds were censused by point counts at Ankarafantsika, one of the largest remnants of the severely reduced dry deciduous forest. The original forest was dominated by foliage insectivores. A few years after wildfire, regrowth was dense, most forest bird species were still present and additional understorey species appeared. As a result, species richness and abundance per point count increased. In contrast, when forest was transformed into savanna, the avian assemblage became poor, dominated by granivores and aerial insectivores, with only seven species shared with the original forest. Foliage volume, grass volume and bare ground cover explained most of the bird community variation by means of canonical correspondence analysis. Birds tended to increase their habitat breadth along the forest-savanna gradient. An index of bird conservation value, including abundance, endemism and the threatened status of the species, was highest in burned forests (1.12), intermediate in unburned forests (1) and lowest in savanna (0.44). The results emphasise the urgent need to protect not only the undisturbed fragments, but also the burned dry forests, because of their high value for biodiversity.

Forest bird assemblages in a natural grassland matrix displayed a nested non-random species distribution. Species loss was significantly area-dependent and predictable. Assemblages in the plantation-dominated matrix were also nested but were neither area- nor isolation-dependent and these potential processes had equal influence over bird species composition. Forests patches <50 ha in plantation were more species rich than those in a grassland matrix and visa versa for patches >50 ha. The effect of the matrix is revealed here with arboreal plantation cover promoting dispersal across the landscape, favouring abundant generalist bird species in smaller patches than expected in the plantation matrix, and the loss of some specialists and species living at low densities from large (>50 ha) patches. Because of a significant species-area relationship and possible area-dependent extinction, the largest forest patch in the nested series in a grassland matrix protects most bird species (89%). However, in a plantation matrix the absence of a species-area relationship requires the combination of many larger forest patches to protect most bird species. Plantation forests in the matrix significantly alter forest bird assemblage structure and composition. To avoid the effects of insularisation and to maintain the viability of bird communities in Afromontane forests requires conservation of the larger forests in a natural matrix. However, for forests in a plantation matrix, the management of dispersal processes by manipulation of the matrix may be as important to conserving species and communities as is minimising extinctions. Avoiding placing plantations near large forests, increasing the size of small patches, and where afforestation is unavoidable, placing plantations in the vicinity of small rather than large. forest patches, are preferable management practices.

First, post-disturbance colonization is not limited by the dispersal ability of the species to reach the newly created open areas and, secondly, colonization is limited by dispersal. Under the first hypothesis, we expect, at a regional scale, to find similar post-disturbance communities to develop on recently burned sites. However, colonization limited by dispersal will lead to strong between-site variations in species composition.Location To test these hypotheses, we studied the post-fire colonization patterns of nine open-habitat bird species in eight distantly located wildfires in the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula.Methods We censused post-fire bird composition by means of field transects and identified potential colonization sources from species-habitat suitability maps derived from atlas data.Results Our results showed strong significant differences in post-fire species composition between burnt areas. Burnt areas located in areas with low probability of species presence before the fire event showed lower species occurrence and richness after the fire.Main conclusions These results do not support the idea that early successional stages and open habitats have a homogeneous community structure at regional scales and suggest that dispersal is a key constraint determining bird colonization of post-fire habitats. Further attention should be paid to landscape heterogeneity as a key factor in determining population dynamics of open-habitat species in the light of current and future land-use changes in Mediterranean regions.

Studies of the breeding birds in the core part of the forest (Bialowieza National Park) over 29 years show that the bird community is species-rich but that densities of individual species are usually low, resulting in only-moderate overall densities. In some species, low densities are a consequence of large territories and social exclusion, but more often they reflect the undersaturation of habitats by birds, despite superabundant food supply and nest-sites. Low productivity, resulting from high nest predation, may contribute to undersaturation. Species composition and numbers of birds fluctuate within relatively narrow limits, with the populations of closely related species fluctuating either independently of one another or in parallel; interspecific competition for resources plays a minor role. Some attributes of the Bialowieza ecosystems resemble conditions in undisturbed tropical forests but contrast sharply with those in fragmented, temperate secondary forests. The present Bialowieza avifauna provides a glimpse of that existing in central European forests before their historical transformation by humans. Its present exceptional character arises from preservation of most of its pristine features. The forest constitutes a critical reference point for studies of woodland ecology, and its preservation should be a high priority. Unfortunately, commercial logging continues, gradually changing the forest's structure and affecting the birds, especially those dependent on dead wood and old-growth. The relatively small national park (47.5 km(2)) is increasingly becoming an 'island', in which the long-term preservation of primeval forest features will be impossible.

Landscape and Urban Planning		2005	March 28, 2005	71	2-4	263-275	263	275	English	print					4	40	Most insights about the effects of residential development on wildlife are based on research from urban and suburban areas. Yet exurban development is an increasingly prevalent form of human settlement in many parts of the world. Moreover because such development often occurs near the periphery of protected areas, it may have a disproportionate influence on native species. We examined bird community patterns in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado across a gradient of exurban development to determine how avifauna responded to this form of settlement. Using fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed the occurrence and abundance of breeding birds in 11 developed sites and in 6 nearby undeveloped sites, all occurring in a forested matrix. We sampled ground-level habitat features at each survey point and derived digital land-cover maps from aerial photographs to characterize and quantify road development and building density. We found little evidence that land-cover varied with development intensity, yet bird abundance increased significantly with building density. Patterns of species richness were equivocal due to a highly influential observation. Principal components analysis (PCA) distinguished two axes that explained nearly 50% of the variation in the bird community and were strongly associated with road and building density. Weighted average analysis showed a marked decline in the abundance and richness of species that were insectivorous or nested in snags, suggesting that reductions in dead wood may have influenced the bird community. However, no conclusions could be drawn because dead wood was confounded with building density. Logistic regression of species occurrence and building density indicated that the incidence of some generalist species increased with building density, whereas the incidence of specialists decreased. Overall, our results suggest that development at low densities can favor habitat generalists. Similar patterns have been observed in more urbanized areas. If exurban development persists as a popular form of settlement in the Rocky Mountains, a regional plan for protecting avian habitat and limiting development dispersion will be necessary to maintain native bird communities.

Bird surveys were started in 1996 on two burned and two unburned sections of the park to determine what effects the burning and subsequent changes in vegetation were having on bird populations. Birds were sampled at 17 60-m radius point counts on each study area; each point was sampled twice per year during the main breeding period from 1996 through 2002. Total abundance and species richness differed among the four areas but no differences could be attributed to burning. Some individual species, however, differed in abundance and frequency of occurrence between burned and unburned areas. For example, Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), and several species of woodpeckers were more abundant on burned areas; Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vemivorous), Wood Thrush (Hylocicla mustelina) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) were among the species more abundant on unburned areas. As a consequence, overall community composition differed significantly between burned and unburned areas of the park, but did not differ between burned areas or between unburned areas. Prescribed burning was instituted to restore vegetation to presettlement conditions and has started to achieve that objective. Restoration also has affected and likely will continue to affect bird populations. Future maintenance of a full complement of bird species, including a number of neotropical migrants, will be dependent on presence of both burned and unburned forest habitat.

An experimental assessment		Cruz-Angon, Andrea (angon@ecologia.edu.mx) ; Greenberg, Russell									Journal of Applied Ecology		2005	February 2005	42	1	150-159	150	159	English	print					2	59	1. Coffee is produced in tropical regions of the world, largely in Latin America. Coffee cultivation techniques range from traditional systems, where coffee grows under a diverse canopy of shade trees (shade-coffee plantations), to modern systems, where coffee grows without any type of shade (sun-coffee plantations). Shade-coffee plantations provide refuge for forest fauna in otherwise deforested landscapes. The conservation value of these agro-ecosystems depends upon their structural and floristic diversity. 2. The way coffee producers manage the vegetation, including the epiphytic component, may profoundly affect the value of plantations for conserving biological diversity. Shade-coffee certification programmes have emerged to verify that coffee advertised as 'shade grown' is actually grown on highly biodiverse plantations. Although these programmes universally encourage epiphyte protection from pruning (a common practice), there has been no experimental evaluation of the importance of epiphytes in supporting faunal diversity. We report the effect of experimentally removing epiphytes on the bird assemblage in a shade-coffee farm near Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico. 3. We established two matching pairs of epiphyte removal and control plots. We compared bird diversity and abundance, based on daily censuses during the breeding and non-breeding season. We used existing information on the way in which birds use epiphytes as foraging and nesting substrates to explain the presence of different species in plots with epiphytes. 4. Plots without epiphytes tended to be less diverse than plots with epiphytes, but rarefaction analysis and ANOVA showed no significant differences in species richness between treatments in any of the seasons. Mean bird abundance was significantly higher in plots with epiphytes during both seasons, and a multidimensional scaling analysis showed that bird community structure differed between the two treatments. 5. Eighteen forest bird species were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. Three non-forest species were more common in plots without epiphytes. Resident bird species that used epiphytes as a nesting substrate were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. 6. When epiphytes are removed, canopy cover, foraging substrates, nest sites and nest materials are eliminated and microclimatic conditions change. This could increase predation on adult birds and nests, increase intra- and interspecific competition, and decrease individual survivorship. 7. Synthesis and applications. This is the first experimental assessment of the importance of epiphytes for birds. Shade-coffee plantations with epiphytes maintain higher abundance and diversity of the inhabitant bird fauna than plantations without epiphytes. This study reinforces the value of positive epiphyte management as an important factor in shade-grown coffee certification, where the goal is to promote biodiversity conservation.

Observations of birds from the interior region add to our knowledge of the distribution and richness of Suriname's avifauna. The Sipaliwini savanna harbors a number of bird species that are not found elsewhere in the Guianas. The savanna itself has a low human population density and is relatively unaffected by the large-scale cattle grazing and frequent fires that have degraded other savanna regions throughout the Neo-tropics. The Sipaliwini appears to contain healthy populations of several species that require late-successional post-fire habitats or are otherwise sensitive to human activity, including the San Parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis) and Rufous-sided Pygmy-Tyrant (Euscarthmus rufomarginatus). Continued protection of the savanna from extensive fire and grazing is urged.	O'Shea, B.

In this study, bird surveys were carried out during the winter and breeding season on nine farms in the east and south-east of Ireland and field boundaries at each site were assessed using the Field Boundary Evaluation and Grading System (FBEGS). Poisson regression demonstrated that FBEGS scores were a good predictor of both winter and breeding bird species richness and diversity within the field boundaries studied. We interpret these preliminary results with caution since our sample size was relatively small (compared to the wide variety of field boundary types found in Ireland) and no single combination of field boundary attributes is likely to be optimum for all bird species. However, our results suggest that FBEGS may be a useful surrogate indicator of overall field boundary bird diversity and we discuss the consequent implications for agri-environmental policy, and for the possible adaptation and use of FBEGS as a tool to monitor the impact of changing farm management practice.

Although targeted species such as sport fish may benefit, increasingly there are concerns over nontarget species. We assessed the impacts of a drawdown of Lake Kissimmee on Florida apple snails. Prior to the drawdown, we found apple snails at significantly higher densities in sites dominated by sandy substrates and emergent macrophytes: no snails were found in sites with deep layers of unconsolidated organic material and dominated by Nuphar luteum. Following the drawdown. some of the sites containing this unconsolidated organic material were also scraped with heavy equipment (e.g., bulldozer) to remove the organic layer. We monitored the response of 31 snails from one site. most of which were stranded in the dry littoral zone during the 1995-1996 drawdown. Mortality rates of stranded snails were high due to the dry conditions of the littoral zone., but also indirectly due to increased vulnerability to predation by several avian species. The Survival data was corroborated by the 1996 and 1997 funnel trap data wherein our catch declined by 80 % from 1995 (pre-drawdown) levels. The proportion of juveniles also declined significantly, indicating an impact on recruitment. Snail abundance did increase. albeit marginally. in some sites. indicating potential benefits of drawdown and organic Substrate removal in some types of littoral zone habitats. However, the timing of drawdown events appears critical, as evident in poor recruitment and relatively low abundance following completion of lake restoration activity. In order to avoid substantial losses to non-target species such as apple snails, we suggested that natural resource managers give greater consideration to the potential negative impacts of deviating from the natural hydrologic regime in terms of timing, duration, and frequency.

Mowing and burning are alternative management strategies for restoring and rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, but their specific, comparative effects are the subjects of ongoing evaluation. We compared the responses of plant and bird communities on four sets of mowed, burned, and untreated sites of small (3-10 ha), fragmented tallgrass prairies at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR), Iowa, U.S.A., during May-July in 1998 and 1999. Species richness and diversity of plants, resident grassland birds, and communities of birds associated with grassland edges (edge species) were independent of treatment. Although not affecting species richness and diversity in plant communities, mowed sites ranked lower in total plant coverage and total forb coverage than burned sites or untreated sites. In contrast, untreated sites had more coverage by shrubs, suggesting that mowing and burning did retard shrub encroachment. Overall, abundance and diversity of plants and birds were generally insensitive to management strategies. Small, fragmented sites of rare habitat may not respond in the short term to management treatments and may not be capable of supporting highly diverse communities, no matter how intensively manipulated. It is more probable that diversity of native prairie communities can be enhanced and restored only through long-term efforts, acquisition of large land units capable of supporting stable populations, and deliberate reintroduction of species of high conservation value.

Cultural measures were drawn from our surveys of visitors, neighbors, planners, and managers of the wetlands. This paper discusses their perceptions of six metropolitan wetlands (four recent restorations and two reference sites), how cultural measures of their perceptions compared with selected site characteristics and biodiversity measures, and what results suggest for wetland design and management. Overall, sites that were perceived as more well-cared-for and as a good place to enjoy nature were perceived as more attractive. In addition, objective site characteristics, like cultural cues and natural landscape context, were related to perceived attractiveness. While plant species richness was not significantly related to perceived wetland attractiveness for our sites, bird species richness was related to attractiveness.

Ibis		2004	November 2004	146	Suppl. 2	99-107	99	107	English	print					1	36	Increases in the intensity of the management of agricultural grasslands over the past 50 years have reduced plant species diversity in swards and increased uniformity in structure through changes in fertilizer regimes, grazing and mowing practices. These factors, as well as increased disturbance and trampling, have reduced the number and diversity of forbs and thus the diversity and abundance of invertebrates, in particular of foliar species. Associated with these changes in management, there has been a large decline in the abundance of many species of farmland birds in pastoral areas and more local extinctions compared with arable areas. To understand the impact of these management changes on bird populations, and design measures to reverse the declines, it is necessary to identify the key factors influencing bird usage of fields. We review results from five studies, which have related fertilizer and grazing management to bird usage of grass fields. Species that fed on soil invertebrates tended to show a positive response to the amount of nitrogen fertilizer added and increased grazing pressure, although there was a high degree of correlation between these two variables. In summer, many species, including corvids, Common Blackbird Turdus merula, Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris, Pied Wagtail Motacilla alba and Hedge Accentor Prunella modularis, showed a negative relationship with sward height, and in winter more species showed a positive relationship with bare ground. Taller sward heights are associated with a greater abundance and diversity of bird invertebrate food resources, and accessibility of food items or a lower risk of predation (actual or perceived) are likely to be the reasons for birds choosing to forage on shorter swards and in areas with more bare ground. Birds feeding on soil invertebrates were found to be generally tolerant of modern management practices that maintain short swards short, as accessibility to the soil has been increased. Species that feed on foliar invertebrates or forb seeds have been affected negatively by modern grassland agricultural practices.

The effect of these changes for bird species wintering in this agricultural landscape has been rarely analyzed. Here the effects are studied of farming changes in traditional holm oak dehesas on population size, social structure and time budget of common cranes Grus grus in eight traditional wintering sites in Spain. The role of acorn availability, the principal winter food of the species, in relation to management is also assessed. The number of cranes in each wintering area was not related to degree of agricultural intensification, nor to the availability of acorns. However, crane flock size decreased, and the relative occurrence of isolated family groups increased in less intensively transformed wintering areas characterized by the predominance of fallow lands. The age composition of crane flocks varied with acorn availability since more juveniles were reported in areas with relatively lower acorn availability. Time budget was also related to acorn availability, since cranes spent relatively more time preening in those wintering areas with higher availability of acorns. Globally evidence suggests the need to maintain the fallow land (posios) to sustain the wintering populations of cranes in Iberia, since this agro-grazing system maintains most of the juvenile cranes using the western migratory route.

We examined avian community response to pine-grassland restoration for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and traditional United States Forest Service pine sawtimber management at Homochitto National Forest, Mississippi from 1994-1996. Thirteen species were more abundant in pine-grassland restoration stands, whereas 5 species were more abundant in traditionally managed pine sawtimber stands. Mature restored pine-grassland stands had greater avian species richness, total bird abundance, and avian conservation value than traditionally managed pine sawtimber stands. We used logistic regression models in an exploratory analysis to predict occurrence of selected species using stand- and landscape-scale habitat characteristics. Probability of red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus) occurrence increased with increasing hardwood canopy cover, and probability of yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) occurrence increased with increasing grass ground cover. Species richness, total avian abundance, and occurrence of red-eyed vireos and Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) increased with increasing values of Shannon's Habitat Diversity Index. Pine-grassland restoration for red-cockaded woodpeckers created vegetation composition and structure at the stand and landscape scales that may benefit numerous avian species of regional conservation concern.

Ecological Applications		2004	August 2004	14	4	1079-1089	1079	1089	English	print					0	14	The concept of source and sinks can guide conservation, but empirical studies are needed to demonstrate that this concept applies to the real world. We investigated whether the source-sink concept Could help to clarify the influence of habitat potential (scrub ridge characteristics), population density, and fires (shrub heights) on Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) demography and dispersal. We mapped territories and measured survival, recruitment, emigration, immigration, and shrub heights annually for 12 years. We classified territories as oak if they overlapped well-drained ridges, oak-palmetto if they overlapped poorly drained ridges >0.4 ha, and palmetto-oak if they only overlapped poorly drained ridges <0.4 ha. Territory size differed little among these categories but was negatively correlated with the annual number of breeding pairs, which ranged from 12 to 27. Scrub ridge characteristics influenced the locations of sinks and potential sources, whereas population density and fires caused temporal variation in demographic success. Oak territories were usually sources because they were net exporters of individuals and because recruitment exceeded mortality. Oak-palmetto territories sometimes functioned as sources but were often pseudo-sinks because density dependence caused mortality to exceed recruitment. Palmetto-oak territories were true sinks because they were net importers of individuals and mortality exceeded recruitment regardless of population density. All scrub was short (<1.2 m) or medium height (1.2-1.7 m), but the spatial arrangement of these height classes changed regularly because fires occurred every 2-7 years. We observed a quadratic relationship between demographic success and the area of medium-height scrub within territories. Territories that had 0.9-1.2 ha of medium-height scrub had the highest demographic success. Applying source-sink concepts at the territory scale was useful to quantify habitat variation at a spatial scale relevant to population processes, reserve design, and habitat management. Our approach can be applied by using territory maps or geographic information systems to partition heterogeneous landscapes into territories and then by classifying territories into potential sources and sinks using scrub ridge characteristics and shrub heights.

Western North American Naturalist		2004	August 2004	64	3	376-384	376	384	English	print					1	8	We compared vegetation structure used by 14 bird species during the 1998 and 1999 breeding seasons to determine what habitat features best accounted for habitat division and community organization in Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands of southwestern Wyoming. Habitat use was quantified by measuring 24 habitat variables in 461 bird-centered quadrats, each 0.04 ha in size. Using discriminant function analysis, we differentiated between habitat used by 14 bird species along 3 habitat dimensions: (1) variation in shrub cover, overstory juniper cover, mature tree density, understory height, and decadent tree density; (2) a gradient composed of elevation and forb cover; and (3) variation in grass cover, tree height, seedling/sapling cover, and bare ground/rock cover. Of 14 species considered, 9 exhibited substantial habitat partitioning: Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura), Bewick's Wren (Thryomanes bewickii), Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides), Plumbeous Vireo (Vireo plumbeus), Green-tailed Towhee (Pipilo chlorurus), Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri), Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis), and Cassin's Finch (Carpodacus cassinii). Our results indicate juniper bird communities of southwestern Wyoming are organized along a 3-dimensional habitat gradient composed of woodland maturity, elevation, and juniper recruitment. Because juniper birds partition habitat along successional and altitudinal gradients, indiscriminate woodland clearing as well as continued fire suppression will alter species composition. Restoration efforts should ensure that all successional stages of juniper woodland are present on the landscape.

Using buffer strips of varying widths and a control from undisturbed riparian forest, I tested the hypothesis that vegetation differs in buffer strips of varying width. I selected 10 summary variables to represent broad-scale vegetation attributes of riparian habitat. Deciduous tree density was higher, and shrub richness was lower in wide buffers compared with narrow buffers. I then used Akaike information criterion to examine whether vegetation structure or buffer width best explained patterns of bird richness and abundance in riparian habitats. Species richness and abundance in several foraging guilds were explained better by buffer width than by vegetation. Abundances of three bird habitat guilds: riparian specialists, forest-interior, and open-edge species, and 6 of 10 species were best explained by specific vegetation features. Differences in vegetation, particularly deciduous tree density and shrub cover, explained part of the variation in abundance of several riparian forest-dwelling species and may be useful in evaluating specific forest management practices. Because deciduous tree density is also positively correlated with buffer width, wide buffers (>100 m) may benefit not only those species associated with coniferous upland forests and forest generalists sensitive to buffer width, but also those species whose abundance is associated with deciduous trees.

Biological Conservation		2004	June 2004	117	4	375-391	375	391	English	print					1	36	The concept of critical thresholds of habitat loss has recently received considerable attention in conservation biology and landscape ecology, yet empirical examples of thresholds are scarce. Threatened species management could benefit from recognition of thresholds because conditions under which populations are at risk can be specified. In this study, 56 woodland patches in northwest Victoria were surveyed for the white-browed treecreeper Climacteris affinis, a threatened insectivorous bird of the semi-arid zone of southern Australia. Comparisons with historic records indicate the species' range is contracting in Victoria. Using logistic regression and hierarchical partitioning, two models of patch occupancy were developed. Tree species composition was an important factor in both models, confirming the treecreepers' affinity for belah Casuarina pauper and slender cypress-pine Callitris gracilis-buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii woodlands in north-west Victoria. The first model emphasized the importance of demographic isolation: probability of patch occupancy decreased with distance to the nearest occupied patch. A threshold response in demographic isolation was apparent. In agricultural landscapes, most suitable woodland patches within 3 km of an occupied patch were occupied, whereas patches beyond the threshold were vacant. The threshold distance increased to a minimum of 8 km in a matrix of native vegetation, suggesting landscape context affects the response of white-browed treecreepers to habitat fragmentation. Demographic isolation is a quasi-dependent variable and therefore a second model was developed using surrogate variables for demographic isolation. A positive relationship with the proportion of woodland cover in the landscape (100 km2) emerged as the pre-eminent explanatory factor. Depending on woodland quality, a threshold of patch occupancy was apparent at levels of woodland cover between 15 and 25%. However, belah and slender cypress-pine-buloke woodlands now cover only 10% of their original extent in the region. These results highlight the inter-dependence of patch isolation with the amount and quality of habitat in the landscape and the implications this has for maintaining functional connectivity. The retention (or restoration) of suitable habitat is the critical issue for conservation of the white-browed treecreeper, but in landscapes below the threshold of habitat cover, viability of local populations may be influenced by the configuration and quality of remaining habitat.

The total population of 60-80 individuals achieved a reproductive output of only 0.74 young per breeding pair in 2002. Brood parasitism by Shiny Cowbird Molothrus bonariensis was a major factor reducing breeding success, affecting 38.5% of broods. Parasitism rates reached 50% in an ungrazed reserve, but only 14% on an adjacent grazed plot. The resulting difference in breeding success was not, however, attributable to vegetation parameters used to describe microhabitat use. Cowbird parasitism rates therefore seem to be influenced largely by factors operating at the landscape level. These may include grazing scheme, topography, humidity and host availability. It is suggested that lower species diversity and bird abundance rendered the grazed site less attractive to cowbirds. Current parasitism rates are of great conservation concern due to the low population size of Pale-headed Brush-finch, and the initiation of controlling measures is pressing. Management options described from intensive cowbird control programmes in North America are reviewed and evaluated for their applicability here. To. combine the possibility of further data collection with commencement of immediate conservation action, we consider two alternative approaches. Nest monitoring and cowbird egg removal would enable the study of the distribution of parasitism in relation to landscape and vegetation variables, whereas cowbird shooting and nest monitoring might provide a larger short-term benefit to reproductive output. Habitat management, resumption of some grazing in the reserve and cowbird removal should be considered for the intermediate future.

Therefore, structure changes caused by management practices can influence avian communities. The salt marshes of the pampas region of Argentina have experienced an increase in fire use as a management tool to improve cattle forage and to avoid accidental fires. A spring burn of 200 ha of salt marsh in Mar Chiquita Biosphere Reserve, Argentina, in September 1995, allowed us to compare the response of birds associated with two vegetation communities, one dominated by Spartina densiflora (Spartina marsh) and another dominated by Juncus acutus (Juncus marsh) from one month to one year post-bum. We recorded changes in plant species composition and vegetation structure (height and cover) at 40 days after the burn and every season for the subsequent year. Fire reduced total cover of both plant communities. Juncus marsh recovered pre-burn structure and bird community by one year post-fire. However, Spartina marsh recovery was incomplete in that period. Relative abundances of bird species that used unburned Juncus marsh were similar to those in burned Juncus marsh in the spring period one year after the burn. Plant height at the burned Spartina marsh did not reach that of the unburned Spartina in 12 months; red-capped wren-spinetail (Spartonoica maluroides), a rare tall-grass-dependent species, settled burned parcels at lower relative abundances than in unburned habitat. Because species that first use the burned patches are very common and widespread in other habitats, and excessive burning may reduce available habitat for endangered or rare species, prescribed burns should be avoided in this region.

Here we explore the potential effects of managing eastern Ontario deciduous forests for the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea) by examining its potential as a biodiversity indicator species and as an umbrella species. Our results indicate that the Cerulean Warbler would not be an effective biodiversity indicator, as its distribution across the studied landscape did not coincide with areas of high avian species richness. However, the Cerulean Warbler may be effective as an umbrella species for the maintenance of populations of other canopy-nesting species that require mature deciduous forest habitats. It is hoped that the conclusions reached in Ontario, while perhaps not directly transferable to all parts of the breeding range, encourage other Cerulean Warbler researchers to ask similar questions in their study areas.

Data on the structure and diversity of its breeding avifauna have mostly been collected in primeval old-growth stands, preserved within the Bialowieza National Park (BNP). Mapping censuses repeated in space (plots, replicated in riverine, oak-lime-hornbeam and coniferous stands) and time (permanent plots, 28 years) reveal that the breeding bird assemblages are rich in species (29-52/season in a 25 to 33-ha plot), but of moderate overall density (40-120 pairs/10 ha). The latter is due to low, lower than in man-transformed areas, densities of the majority of particular species. Despite marked changes in vegetation structure, the composition of the breeding bird assemblage does not vary much across different primeval forest types, with a single breeding bird community inhabiting all of them, including treefall gaps. High richness of the BF avifauna stems from the Forest's geographical locality, as well as from a high level of the primeval avifauna retention. Over 95% of the 135-140 pristine species still breed there. Especially species-rich groups are birds of prey, owls, woodpeckers and Sylvinae warblers. Bird communities in the BNP and primeval tropical rain forests share many features, suggesting that natural differences between temperate and tropical forests were less pronounced in the past. The combination of high species richness with low densities of individual species is probably a feature of all pristine forests, independent of climatic zone. The BF avifauna must once have been typical of the ancient European forests and it has become so exceptional chiefly because it has preserved most of its pristine features. The BF thus constitutes an indispensable reference site for future studies of woodland bird biology. To ensure its survival should become a priority. Commercial logging, taking place over 80% of the Polish BF part, severely changes the Forest's structure and strongly affects the birds, especially species which depend on dead wood (Dendrocopos leucotos, Picoides tridactylus) and on old-growth stands. The small area protected as the BNP becomes an increasingly isolated "island", in which preservation of the primeval forest features seems to be impossible. In order to retain them, it is necessary to protect the whole BF area.

The relationship assumed is usually one of woodpecker dependence or preference for partially decayed wood in which to excavate cavities, but the woodpecker is also sometimes suggested as a vector for the fungus. In this paper we review such associations and describe patterns evident among woodpecker nest sites that suggest microclimatic and microhabitat characteristics favoring fungal colonization of trees, woodpecker-favorable responses of trees to fungi, and ultimate use of the trees for woodpecker cavity excavation. Factors that favor fungal invasion and tree use by woodpeckers include tree species, growth history, site characteristics such as proximity to water and exposure to sun or shade, nature and position of tree injury, local climate, forest age and species composition, fire frequency, and human management activities. Woodpecker cavity height and entrance orientation may be related to the dispersal dynamics of fungi, which in turn may be related to forest vegetation, thermal, and hydric characteristics.

At Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (LNWR) in northwestern North Dakota, we monitored breeding bird occurrence, abundance, and habitat during successive annual grazing treatments (1998-2000) on 5 prescribe-burned, mixed-grass prairie management units (range=50-534 ha, each burned 3-6 times in the previous 10-20 years). All breeding passerine species characteristic of upland, northern mixed-grass prairie were common (>10% occurrence) during at least 1 of 3 years on burned and grazed units, except Chestnut-collared Longspur (Calcarius ornatus), which was uncommon. Vegetation was generally shorter and sparser than that found on 4 nearby units treated by fire only (1999; density, visual obstruction, and height, all P<0.01). Regardless, occurrences of individual bird species resembled those previously documented on prairie units at LNWR with similar fire histories but no grazing; however, Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) occurred 2.4 times more frequently on burned and grazed units studied. Our data suggest that species diversity of breeding grassland passerines changes little during initial years of rotation grazing at moderate stocking rates in fire-managed, northern mixed-grass prairie at LNWR.

Auk		2004	January 2004	121	1	74-87	74	87	English	print					0	11	Food availability during winter may determine habitat use and limit populations of overwintering birds, yet its importance is difficult to judge because few studies have experimentally tested the response of nonbreeding birds to changes in resource abundance. We experimentally examined the link between fruit availability and habitat use by manipulating winter abundance of Myrica cerifera L. (Myricaceae) fruits in managed longleaf (Pinus palustris) and loblolly (P. taeda) pine stands in South Carolina. Myrica cerifera is a common understory shrub in the southeastern United States and provides lipid-rich fruit in late winter (February and March), when insects and other fruits are scarce. On treatment plots, we covered fruiting M. cerifera shrubs with netting in early winter to prevent birds from eating their fruits. In late February, when M. cerifera fruit crops were largely depleted elsewhere on our study site, we uncovered the shrubs and documented the response of the bird community to those patches of high fruit availability. Relative to control plots, total bird abundance (excluding the most common species, Yellow-rumped Warbler (Dendroica coronata)) and species richness did not change after net removal. Yellow-rumped Warblers, however, became significantly more abundant on treatment plots after net removal, which suggests that they track M. cerifera fruit abundance. We suggest that M. cerifera plays a role in determining the local distribution of wintering Yellow-rumped Warblers at our study site. To put these results into a management context, we also examined the effect of prescribed fire frequencies on M. cerifera fruit production. Across pine stands with different fire regimes, M. cerifera fruit abundance increased with the number of years since burning. It takes 4-6 years for individuals to recover sufficiently from a burn to produce large quantities of fruit. Thus, shorter intervals between burns will reduce winter fruit availability. Taken together, these results suggest that within those pine plantations, the local winter distribution of at least one common migratory bird is closely tied to fruit abundance, which in turn is tied to the frequency of prescribed fires.

Our goal was to determine which landscape features are important controls on species richness, to establish how these constraints are expressed at different levels of organization, and to identify hotspots of biological diversity for a particular locality. We examine the following questions: 1) How is the variance in patterns of plant species richness and diversity partitioned at different scales, or classification units, of the hierarchical ecosystem classification developed for the study area? 2) What are the compositional similarities among ecosystem types? 3) For our study area, what are the sites expected to harbour highest species richness? We used a spatially explicit map of biodiversity to project abundance of species-rich communities in the landscape based on a previously developed ecological classification system for a lower Gulf Coastal Plain landscape. The data indicate that high species richness in this ecosystem was found in sites with frequent fire and high soil moisture. Sites in fire-maintained landscapes with lower frequency of fire were associated with geomorphological characteristics, suggesting a dependence of the diversity-disturbance relationship with soil type. With more frequent fire on some sites, high diversity shifts from canopy component to ground flora, with an overall increase in total species richness. Our approach demonstrates how potential species richness can be identified as a restoration goal and that multiple vegetation endpoints may be appropriate vegetation objectives. We identify basic management needs for the maintenance of biodiversity in this ecosystem that can be derived from an understanding of the combination of factors that most strongly predict diverse plant communities.

The species breeding territories are situated in the northern sections of the regions mentioned, where the distribution is continuous, with a few key breeding grounds. Based on known breeding sites, the total abundance of the White-backed Woodpecker in Warmia and Masuria was assessed at 50-70 pairs, but as many as 70-80 pairs may actually occur in the area. Ca 2/3 breeding territories were found in forests exceeding 50 km(2), the remaining ones in woods below 10 km(2). The largest population, composed of 30-40 pairs, was discovered in the Borecka Forest, and 20 pairs were recorded to breed in the eastern part of the Nizina Sepopolska lowland. The White-backed Woodpeckers preferred old deciduous stands. Merely 10-20% of the Warmian and Masurian populations bred in reserves. The densities in the nature reserves within the Borecka Forest were 5 times higher than in unprotected areas. The factor conducive to occurrence of the species is the abundance of dead trees, e.g. at sites where beavers occur. And therefore, in order to prevent the extinction of the White-backed Woodpecker, it is advisable to undertake in forests steps which would result in an increase of the amount of dead trees and also to take under protection larger forest areas.

The study material is based on territory mappings between 1967 and 1995. The abundance of birds in forests with pre-dominating Beech Fagus sylvatica and Northern Spruce Picea abies increases from deciduous through mixed to coniferous forests. The avian biomass, however, remains roughly the same in all three forest types because the average weight of the birds decreases from deciduous (26.8 g) through mixed (26 g) to coniferous (19.4 g) forests: in coniferous forests there are smaller birds occurring at greater densities. In coniferous forests, the dense evergreen foliage restricts the movement of birds, and the thick arboreal structure supports an avifauna of small 'flitters'.In young stands there is a decline in population density after the thicket stage. After the pole stage, population density and bird biomass increases again with stand age, especially in broad-leaved woodland. No clear dependence on: a particular stand age is discernible in coniferous forests, at least when younger than 1,00 years. Other factors, such as presence of clearings and proportion of dead wood, are probably more significant. Extremely high population densities in small, old, protected forests with up to 275 territories/10 ha cannot be extrapolated to corresponding extensive forests. In coniferous and deciduous woodland there are on average 23 +/- 5 species/10 ha, in mixed woodland over 26 +/- 5. There are indications that the number of species rises with stand age in mixed and coniferous woodlands, but probably less in deciduous woodland. Before leaves appear on deciduous trees, coniferous forests and even single evergreen trees provide early breeders with protection from predators. They also give shelter against the cold and buffer climatic extremes, thereby supporting early breeding. The expansion of coniferous plantations at the end of the 19(th) century has allowed several bird species (e.g. Coal Tit Parus ater, Crested Tit P. cristatus, Firecrest Regulus ignicapillus) to considerably increase their range and numbers in Central Europe.

This paper summarises the current knowledge on population sizes and trends, habitat selection and abundance of the species in Germany and draws conclusions for forest nature conservation. In some federal states, during recent years detailed surveys have been performed. The resulting population estimates are distinctly (up to four times) higher than previous estimates from the late 1990s. In Table 1, an overview of the results of a questionnaire which was send to the responsible administrations and ornithological societies of all federal states is given. The total German population is actually estimated at 16,500-22,000 bp., with largest numbers in Hesse, Lower Saxony, Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria, and Brandenburg. Although this higher population numbers are mainly due to intensified surveys, there is evidence (e.g. from the German Common Birds Census),for A.,distinct increase of the species especially in western and northern Germany - as it is also observed in the Benelux and Baltic countries. Furthermore, studies on occurrence, abundance and to. raging habitats in different forest types revealed that the species does not only occur in (mixed) oak forests, but also in pure beech and alder forests, so far they show a high proportion of mature trees and standing dead wood. This means also, that today the Middle Spotted Woodpecker occurs only in a very small part of its former natural range in Germany, and that the actual, populations have a relict character. The future population development of the species is regarded as an important indicator for the ecological sustainability of forestry management in Germany.

However, little is known about the effects of fire management practices on non-game bird communities, particularly in deciduous forests of the Midwest that are important breeding grounds for many Neotropical migrant songbirds. We compared bird species abundance and community composition in a recently burned (1993 and 1995) closed-canopy forest plot with an adjacent unburned plot, using breeding bird surveys conducted in 1996 and 1997. Avian species richness and overall bird abundance (for all species pooled) did not differ between sites. Avian community composition, however, differed between sites in both years. Ground-nesting Black-and-white Warblers (Mniotilta varia), Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocappilus) and Eastern Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) were more abundant in the unburned site. Conversely, cavity-nesting White-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis) were more abundant in the burned site. Migrant and resident ground- and shrub-nesting guilds were more abundant in unburned forest. Prescribed fires may adversely affect habitat quality for some forest songbirds, particularly species which require dense understory growth. Prescribed fires may benefit other species by creating open understories and snags. Land managers should consider the direct and indirect effects of habitat alteration associated with prescribed fires on all nesting songbirds to conserve local and regional avian biodiversity.

Point counts, corrected for different probabilities of detection in different swamps, suggested that the species richness of bird communities in stands of papyrus disturbed by burning, grazing or pollution was higher than in nearby stands that were not disturbed. However, there were fewer species and individuals of highly specialized birds or species characteristic of papyrus, in disturbed stands than in undisturbed swamps. At <1 ha-1, the density of Papyrus Gonolek Laniarius mufumbiri in Ugandan swamps was, for example, significantly lower in polluted and burnt sites than in undisturbed papyrus where up to 13 ha-1 were recorded in the centre of swamps. White-winged Swamp Warbler Bradypterus carpalis was only recorded in undisturbed papyrus. In the papyrus that fringes Lake Naivasha in Kenya, outside the geographical range of species restricted to papyrus, disturbance in the form of grazing selects against species classified as swamp-reliant. Species classified as generalist users of papyrus were much less sensitive to disturbance than specialists. The density of swamp specialists was also lower near the edge of swamps, where total species richness was higher. These results are discussed in relation to conservation management of papyrus swamps in East Africa.	Maclean, Ilya M.

Conservation Biology		2003	December 2003	17	6	1660-1671	1660	1671	English	print					2	16	Soil characteristics, disturbance histories, and species richness among distinct groups of plants and animals may be useful predictors of important conservation areas when data are limited. We used multivariate analysis of covariance to test the hypothesis that the species richness of plants, arthropods, herpetofauna, and breeding birds are correlated and increase with soil fertility (silt and clay content in sandy soils), soil variability, and hardwood midstory reduction in subxeric, nutrient-poor longleaf pine sandhills at Eglin Air Force Base in northwest Florida. During 1994-1995 and 1998-1999, we sampled 30 81-ha plots with varying fire-exclusion histories and at two spatial scales of resolution (10 X 40 m and 81 ha). The relationship between the number of plant species and percent silt and clay and its coefficient of variation was significant and positive at the plot level (81 ha) but not at the subplot level (10 X 40 m). Herpetofaunal species richness was the only faunal variable that increased with silt and clay content, but the coefficient of variation did not. Multivariate effects of hardwood reduction were significant in 1998-1999 but not in 1994-1995, which suggests that the reintroduction of fire increased species richness across taxa. Univariate effects of hardwood reduction were marginally significant for plant species richness at the subplot level and not significant for herpetofaunal species richness at either scale. Plant and arthropod species richness were not correlated. Herpetofaunal species richness was not correlated with that of other taxa (plant and animal). The species richness of plants and arthropods were each significantly positively correlated with the richness of breeding bird species at the subplot level during 1994-1995, whereas only arthropod species richness was positively correlated with bird species richness at the plot level in either year. Our results suggest that the restoration of fire regime may be the most effective tool with which to increase diversity in pyrogenic areas considered for conservation protection.

Montados are exploited for three main uses: forestry, agriculture, and extensive grazing, in proportions that vary according to local conditions (more or less productive land) and historical circumstances. Because these ecosystems occur over a large geographic area (they occupy some 6 million ha), biodiversity would be expected to vary among montados. However, differences in management practices may also influence species distribution. In this paper, we investigate differences in plant and bird species diversity among 60 montados distributed all across southern Portugal. The environmental variables studied included geographical coordinates, climatological data, soil type, and altitude. We also investigated agro-economic variables that could describe human activities at each site: animal husbandry (breeds, stock density, grazing rotation, etc.), agriculture (fallow rotation frequency, use of fertilizers, etc.), and forestry (cork harvesting, thinning, etc.). Finally, land-use type and metrics were assessed from rectified aerial photographs. Species richness among these two groups was not correlated, sites with high or low numbers of plant species not necessarily having high or low numbers of bird species. However, both plant and bird communities exhibited a similar pattern of species composition and turnover. This pattern was ecologically based, rather than a result of biological similarities between groups: direct gradient analyses and variance partitioning revealed strong correlations between species distribution and spatial gradients, namely longitude and latitude. In trying to distinguish anthropogenic from biophysical processes, we found that both were equally important as drivers of montado, biodiversity. Plants and birds exhibited a similar ecological pattern, although environmental conditions were slightly more important in the case of plants, and human activities were slightly more important in the case of birds.

Here we analyse capture-recapture data from two before/after disturbance studies to estimate the effect of fire on local bird survival. Analyses of six bird species at two Mediterranean shrubland sites were combined using a meta-analysis approach. Two warblers, Sylvia undata and S. melanocephala, were studied at one site altered by prescribed burning, and five passerines (Luscinia megarhynchos, Turdus merula, Parus major, P. caeruleus and S. melanocephala) at one site disturbed by wildfire. Based on the combined analysis, annual survival probability significantly decreased from 0.49 to 0.18 (i.e. a 64% decline) after the fire. Our results further suggest a trend for a higher decrease in annual survival associated with wildfire (-72%, from 0.51 to 0.14) than with prescribed burning (-35%, from 0.41 to 0.27), although this should be properly tested with a specific experimental design. In S. undata, a decline in survival in the 'long-term' cannot account for the drop in density observed the first spring after fire. We suggest that a decrease in recruitment rate and an increase in the proportion of non-breeders immediately after the fire may contribute more strongly to the decline in the breeding population. Our results tend to support the idea that bird populations may respond to moderate disturbances with noticeable time lags, because of individual site tenacity.

For comparison, we also estimated bird density in ROW managed by cutting in New Hampshire and New York and in shrublands managed by fire in the Finger Lakes National Forest (FLNF), New York. On herbicide-managed ROW, we detected a mean of 14.3 individuals and 12.2 species per point count, including many species of early-succession habitat that are declining throughout northeastern United States. Nesting success in forested landscapes of New York, Maine, and Massachusetts was 55% on the ROW, 69% in forests within 20 m of the ROW, and 63% in forests more than 20 m from the ROW. Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitized 5.3% of the nests and reduced host recruitment by even less. This suggests that ROW in forested areas support high production of shrubland birds and do not exert a measurably harmful effect on forest-nesting birds. Selective herbicide application on ROW sustained shrubland vegetation and supported high densities and high nesting success. Mechanical cutting lowered the structural diversity of vegetation the following spring and was associated with fewer individual birds and species. Cool burns in early spring produced a high structural diversity of herbs, shrubs and trees and supported a high density of birds and bird species. Long-term maintenance of shrublands by burning will require supplemental cutting to remove saplings. As reforestation continues to reduce shrubland habitat, probably below pre-colonial levels, active management for early-succession habitat will be necessary to sustain current population levels of numerous species.

This study considers the environmental variables influencing habitat occupancy by birds and the consequences of the use of fire in range management for bird conservation. Bird use and habitat structure of 11 cover types, the result of specific management regimes, were monitored for two breeding seasons in a mosaic landscape. Three main gradients of avian composition, corresponding to tree cover, shrub volume and grazing intensity, were identified from canonical correspondence analysis. The structure of the bird community seemed more intensely affected by species-specific selection of cover types than by the birds' use of multiple patches. Out of a total of 10 bird species analysed by a simultaneous confidence intervals procedure, four species with an unfavourable conservation status in Europe (Emberiza cia, Lullula arborea, Saxicola torquata and Lanius collurio) preferred managed grassland. Three types of grassland with shrubs (derived from single or repeated burning) had the highest bird conservation index (taking into account specific status and abundance of the bird assemblage), whereas forests showed middle or low values. The relation (P=0.054) of this index to the logarithm of the pastoral value (which includes density and grazing quality of grasses) in currently managed cover types suggests that the objectives of grassland recovery by appropriate management practices and those of bird conservation coincide in our study area.

One area had been unintentionally burned 4 years prior and selectively harvested (DIS) 1 year prior to sampling. A second area had been selectively harvested 1 year prior to sampling and had no recent history of fire (HAR). Species richness, as assessed by species-time curves and rarefaction, was higher in both altered areas than in undisturbed forest (INT). In general, frugivores and omnivores were more abundant in both altered areas compared to intact forest. Canopy frugivores, understory omnivores and multiple-strata omnivores were most abundant in HAR. Canopy frugivores, near-ground insectivores, understory and multiple-strata omnivores were least abundant in INT, although INT had the highest abundances of canopy insectivores and near-ground omnivores. Richness and abundance of widespread species with low habitat specificity was higher in both areas that experienced disturbance compared to intact forest. Differences in bird community structure between disturbed and intact forest at this site are attributed primarily to the addition of widespread species with less narrow habitat requirements, and possibly to changes in the distribution of different food types.

The EAR guidelines mandate the retention of at least 12 trees/ha and 24-36 m2/ha of basal area, representing a diversity of overstory and understory species. During summer 1998, we compared the temporal (breeding season vs. mid-summer) and spatial (edge versus interior) use of EAR stands by birds. In addition, we compared observed vs. expected use of overstory trees in EAR stands. In each often representative EAR stands, we sampled birds twice per season along two-edge and two-interior transects. Total species richness and abundance (all species combined), species richness and abundance of ground-shrub foragers, and species richness of canopy-sallier foragers were significantly (P<0.05) higher in the breeding season than in mid-summer. Eight of 20 common bird species analyzed also were significantly (P<0.05) more abundant during the breeding season (e.g., black-and-white warbler and chestnut-sided warbler), and one species was significantly (P<0.05) more abundant during mid-summer. Total species richness, total abundance, and abundance of ground-shrub foragers were significantly higher (P<0.05) in interiors compared to edges of EAR stands. Five species also were significantly (P<0.05) more abundant in interiors of EAR stands, whereas no species was more common in edges. All species combined and three foraging guilds showed differential use (P<0.05) of overstory tree species; eight species also differed significantly in their use of abundant tree species. Based on our findings, we believe that EAR stands are excellent substitutes for clear cuts on state forestlands, although we caution that our findings were based only on one yr of data. We recommend the continued retention of a diversity of overstory trees, especially snags and rough-barked trees, in both edges and interiors of EAR stands for use by a variety of bird species during both the breeding season and mid-summer.

Bird communities using these habitats have also experienced widespread declines that are often attributed to severe habitat loss and fragmentation. We estimated the change, or turnover, in bird populations in the Eagle Lake Wetland Complex, Iowa, with ongoing grassland and wetland restoration by linking geographic information system data and bird surveys in different land cover types (hayland, pasture, restored grassland, restored wetland and rowcrop agriculture) during the 1999-2001 breeding seasons. Habitat restoration efforts primarily converted rowcrop agriculture and pastures into grassland and wetland habitat. Based on land conversion, abundances of most species have likely increased in the area, including many species of management concern. Yet a few species, such as killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), have probably decreased in abundance. This estimation approach and these estimates provided a critical first step for evaluating restoration efforts; however, information on demographic parameters, such as nesting success, in restored areas is needed for understanding how restoration ultimately affects bird populations.

In the deserts of the south-western United States of America, as in many ecoregions around the world, invasion of non-native plants is modifying the structure and composition of riparian vegetation. 2. Restoration of native plant species frequently proves to be ecologically and economically difficult. In the Muddy River drainage in the Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA), eradication of one the most aggressive invasive plants, Tamarix ramosissima (salt-cedar), often reduces the structural and compositional diversity of the remaining vegetation. This can have negative effects on native animals, including birds. 3. The objectives of our work were (i) to examine relationships between avian diversity and measures of vegetational diversity (species richness, dominance of non-native plants and vegetation structure (total vegetation volume)), (ii) to explore the extent to which avian community composition was associated with vegetation composition (floristics) or vegetation structure (physiognomy), and (iii) to consider the potential effects of alternative land management and ecological restoration strategies on the biodiversity of birds and other native fauna in watersheds in the arid south-western USA. 4. Species richness of all birds and of breeding birds was best modelled by total vegetation volume alone. Neither species richness of plants nor dominance of non-native plants had a statistically significant effect on species richness, abundance or evenness of birds. 5. Species composition of birds between sites was more similar when floristics was more similar, and vice versa. Species composition of birds was not correlated with physiognomy. 6. Species richness of native birds in the Muddy River drainage appears not to suffer from invasion of non-native plants, provided that the vegetational community retains sufficient structural diversity. 7. The composition of the bird community is closely related to floristics, and other taxonomic groups may exhibit different responses to vegetation structure and composition. Therefore, explicit strategies for landscape-scale management, restoration and maximization of native faunal diversity should consider how removal of invasive plants may affect physiognomy and floristics of the vegetational community as a whole.

Less than 1% of the original longleaf pine forests remain as old-growth stands. Eglin Air Force Base (Eglin) in northwest Florida contains the largest remaining extent of longleaf pine, but much of this habitat has been degraded through fire suppression, selective logging, and planting off-site species of pines. We examined the distribution of bird species among habitats during spring and fall 1994-1995 to assess the influence of large-scale habitat restoration on bird communities across the landscape. During both spring and fall, species richness and relative abundance of neotropical migrants were greatest in oak hammocks and riparian habitats. During spring, the abundance of resident species was greatest in barrier island scrub and flatwoods, but species richness of residents also was high in oak hammocks. During fall, both species richness and abundance of residents were greatest in oak hammocks and flatwoods. Analyses of abundance for individual species (both neotropical migrants and residents) suggested that each habitat examined was important for gtoreq1 species. An analysis examining the importance of habitats for conservation found that oak hammocks and riparian habitats were important for species of high management concern, but burned sandhills along with oak hammocks and riparian habitats were very important for species of the greatest management concern. Our results suggest that habitat modifications resulting from restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem will benefit many species of management concern. Bird species negatively affected by habitat modifications for longleaf pine restoration were abundant in other habitats.

In order to design management plans to prevent large wildfires while preserving biodiversity, understanding of the ways in which birds respond to these fires is required. We investigated the spatial variability of both avifauna and habitat structure in three zones: unburnt, burnt in 1982, and burnt in 1994. The habitat structure of the unburnt zone was the most variable spatially. However, bird species composition between sampling points was very homogeneous in space. In contrast, the bird communities inhabiting burnt zones were more spatially heterogeneous. This pattern was caused by distinct specific responses to variations in habitat structure. Open-space species responded to small changes in habitat structure with large changes in local abundance, whereas the response of forest species to these structural variations was much less. We suggest that land managers should select specific zones with limited vegetation recovery within large burnt areas and maintain them as open space to keep combustibility low and provide an appropriate habitat for several open space species that are of conservation concern.

Density estimates were calculated from primary forest and secondary habitats using the variable circular plot method. Eight of the nine restricted-range or threatened species resident on Karakelang were recorded and density estimates calculated for five of these. Two species of rail are endemic to Karakelang, Talaud Bush-hen Amaurornis magnirostris and Talaud Rail Gymnocrex talaudensis. The bush-hen was encountered in secondary habitat but occurred at higher densities in primary forest and the estimated population was 2,350-9,560 birds. The less vocal, cryptic G. talaudensis was noted just twice, in primary forest cose to rivers. Both have small populations, are threatened by habitat degradation, hunting, and possibly predation by introduced rats and should be classified as threatened. Population densities of the Endangered, endemic Red-and-blue Lory Eos histrio had remained stable since the last survey in 1997. They occurred at higher densities in primary forest, but were also common in human-made habitats. The estimated population was 8,230-21,400 birds, threatened by habitat loss and trapping for the wild bird trade. Although more commonly encountered in forest, the Near Threatened Blue-naped Parrot Tanygnathus lucionensis was found at higher densities in secondary habitats, and the population was estimated at 8,130-20,700 birds. The Restricted-range Blue-tailed Imperial Pigeon D. concinna was very common on Karakelang (14,500-27,700 birds), whilst the Vulnerable Grey Imperial Pigeon D. pickeringisi was recorded rarely; both species were more frequently recorded in primary forest. The endemic Talaud Kingfisher Halcyon enigma occurred at low densities (5,290-8,690 birds), in primary forest and adjacent disturbed areas. It is heavily dependent on primary forest and threatened by habitat loss, and should be classified as Vulnerable. Approximately 350 km2 of primary forest on Karakelang is protected, 250 km2 as a wildlife reserve. However, at present, management is absent and forest is threatened by agricultural encroachment, illegal logging, and fire. Given that all endemic and threatened species were encountered more frequently or occurred at higher densities in primary forests, future conservation efforts should target these protected areas. Management of reserves should involve local stakeholders from government and representatives of island communities. Wildlife trade is a major threat to Eos histrio and strict enforcement of the species' protected status should include monitoring of roost sites, patrols of harbours and markets in Talaud, Sulawesi and the Philippines, and the control of Philippine fishing boats involved in the wild bird trade. Further species-specific research and monitoring is also required.

We compared community composition, total abundance and species richness, as well as abundance of six individual species on plots within four treatments (three plots/treatment) completed within 30 m on both sides of the stream. Treatments in the riparian area (30 m on both sides of the stream) were: (1) riparian control (no harvest); (2) reduction of basal area to an average of 7-10 m2/ha with full tree harvest system; (3) reduction of basal area to an average of 7-10 m2/ha with CTL harvest system; and (4) control (no harvest in riparian area or upland). For treatments 1, 2, and 3, adjacent upland forests on the plots were clearcut. Bird surveys were completed 1 year prior to, and 3 years after harvest and revealed a significant response of the bird community to timber harvest in the riparian area. Bird communities were most affected by tree removal with both harvest methods, but harvest type also affected bird communities. Early-successional species, e.g. song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), mourning warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), and chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica) were associated with harvested plots, whereas forest species, e.g. scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea) and black-throated green warbler (Dendroica virens) were associated with riparian control and control plots. Of six individual species tested for response to riparian harvest treatment over time, only the ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) showed a significant time by treatment interaction. Ovenbird numbers decreased in both the CTL and full tree harvest plots through 2000, when no individuals were observed. Two other forest-dependent species, black-throated green warbler and hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus), showed similar responses to treatment as the ovenbird. The winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) responded positively to the greater amount of slash that was left on-plot with the CTL harvest system. However, with the exception of the winter wren, we found that bird species and communities did not differ in their response to harvest system.

A total of 42 territories was mapped, 39 of which could be assigned to pairs, the remaining 3 to single territorial males. On the level of the whole forest tract, the territory centres of the pairs were overlaid with a detailed terrestrial habitat map by means of a geographical information system (GIS). The results show that areas without trees of more than 21 cm breast height diameter (BHD) were avoided by the woodpeckers. Forest tracts with standing dead trees (snags) of more than 35 cm BHD were clearly preferred. With the exception of only two territories, all territories and the 5 nesting cavities found were located in stands with strong-dimensioned dead wood. In at least 14 territories oaks were completely absent. No preference for oaks, which occur scarcely in the alder forests, could be observed. On the level of territories, the home range of a breeding pair in the period when they were feeding young was investigated by use of radio transmitters. The results allow a verification of the GIS habitat analysis. The radio tagging results were complemented by observation of the breeding cavity, where 4 young fledged. The home range of the male comprised 9.4 ha, the home range of the female 5.6 ha. Alder trees thicker than 22-25 cm BHD were preferred for foraging. In addition, the occurrence of some very thick trees and standing dead wood are of particular importance not only for foraging but also the construction of the nesting cavity.

Abbott, Ian; Mellican, Amanda; Craig, Michael D.; Williams, Matthew; Liddelow, Graeme; Wheeler, Ian									Wildlife Research		2003		30	4	321-329	321	329	English	print					1	10	In 1985 new silvicultural prescriptions for managing jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in south-west Western Australia came into operation. The most extreme logging treatment (gap release) involved removal of most of the overstorey from patches no larger than 10 ha, followed by a regeneration fire. In the other logging treatment (shelterwood), less wood was removed from a larger area, also followed by a fire. This study examined the impact of these disturbances on the avifauna by monitoring species richness and abundance of birds one year before logging, one year before burning, and for five years after burning. Although 68 bird species were recorded during the seven years of the study, 29 of these were detected fewer than 15 times. Of the other 39 bird species recorded, only two (Gerygone fusca and Acanthiza apicalis) showed a statistically significant treatment effect over time on their abundance. The abundance of G. fusca initially declined in the disturbed treatments and by Year 7 of the study (5 years post-fire) in the gap-release treatment had not recovered its original abundance. A. apicalis increased its abundance in both shelterwood and gap-release treatments. By Year 7, both species in the logged treatments had abundances similar to those in the unlogged treatments. Total abundance of all species varied little across treatments. Species richness was highest by Year 7 in the shelterwood and lowest in the gap-release treatment. In some years community structure varied more at the external-reference sites (not recently logged or burnt) than at the gap-release sites. In particular, there was little overlap in community structure in the external-reference treatment between the first and final years, whereas the pre-logging and final year in the gap-release treatment showed a high degree of overlap. These differences are suggestive of overriding short-term annual variation in broad-scale factors rather than local factors. Yearly variation in rainfall and temperature was documented; during low rainfall periods, populations of foliage arthropods may have been reduced.

Hejl, Sallie J.; Mack, Diane Evans; Young, Jock S.; Bednarz, James C.; Hutto, Richard L.									Studies in Avian Biology		2002	December 18, 2002		25	113-129	113	129	English	print					1	13	We describe historical and current landscape patterns for the north-central Rocky Mountains, speculate on the expected consequences of human-induced changes in coniferous forest patterns for birds, and examine the evidence related to the expected consequences. The Rocky Mountain region has one of the most heterogeneous landscapes in North America, combining high complexity in abiotic gradients with fire as a major disturbance factor. In recent decades fire suppression has limited this disturbance, resulting in altered stand structures and relatively homogeneous expanses of mid-successional forest where there were once mosaics of different-aged post-fire stands. Elsewhere, historically homogeneous landscapes that rarely burned have become more heterogeneous due to logging. Many forest types are less common than they were historically due to current management. Land conversion to agriculture and development has primarily occurred in low elevations. We speculate that the consequences of these changes include: (1) bird species adapted to historically homogeneous forest landscapes would be negatively affected by landscape heterogeneity created by timber harvest openings; (2) bird species specialized for forest types that were once prevalent but are now uncommon may be negatively affected by decreasing patch size and increasing isolation; and (3) birds that breed in close proximity to human-added landscape features may be negatively affected by brood parasites or nest predators. Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) and Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa) had the strongest trends of species sensitive to fragmentation indices. Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina) and Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis) were positively associated with fragmentation across most studies. Nesting success varied among landscape configurations, and some trends paralleled abundance patterns. Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism rates were extremely low (0-3%) where nest success has been studied in coniferous forests of the north-central Rockies. Across extensive and intensive studies, distance to agricultural lands was the strongest predictor of cowbird presence. Therefore, we found evidence for the ideas that birds adapted to homogeneous forest landscapes have been negatively affected by heterogeneity caused by timber harvesting, that patch size is important for some birds in one vanishing habitat (old-growth ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa), and that cowbirds are more abundant in conifer forests near human-added landscape features. The effects of changes in landscape patterns on birds in the north-central Rockies seem to be less dramatic than in eastern and midwestern North America, and different landscape measures are more relevant to western conifer forests. We need additional research on most aspects of breeding, nonbreeding, and dispersal ecology in relation to landscape patterns and within-stand changes. We offer our proposed consequences as hypotheses upon which to base future tests.

Conservation Biology		2002	December 2002	16	6	1620-1631	1620	1631	English	print					2	65	Ecological relationships between wildlife conservation and farm management provide common ground for the enhancement of bird habitat and the natural suppression of pests on farmland. We compared bird populations in 15 paired organic and nonorganic sites (cornfields plus edges, 30 sites total) that were similar in environment and edge habitat but that differed in use of fertilizers, herbicides, cultivation, and crop rotations. At each site, we used one strip transect to sample birds and vegetation in the bordering edge and cornfield perimeter (0-25 m from the edge) and another to sample in the cornfield (50-150 m from the edge). During the 1995 and 1996 growing seasons, we recorded 54 bird species, 51 in organic and 39 in nonorganic sites. On average, bird abundance on organic sites was 2.6 times higher than on nonorganic sites, and mean species richness per visit was 2.0 times greater. When analyzed separately, organic edge, perimeter, and field transects supported higher bird abundance and greater richness than did their nonorganic counterparts. Abundance and richness were higher on organic sites for insectivores, omnivores, and granivores, and for each of three migratory groups. Twelve species were individually more abundant on organic sites, and one regularly observed species was observed only on organic sites. No species had greater abundance on nonorganic sites. More non-crop vegetation on organic cornfields, most likely a result of no herbicide use, may have provided better foraging opportunities for birds. The plant food, cover, and invertebrate prey in organic cornfields appeared to augment birds not only in the field but also in the uncropped edges. Organic fields appear to benefit birds, but reproductive success needs further study. Modifying farm-management practices, especially near field edges where bird activity is concentrated, may enhance the conservation of birds and their potential predation on crop pests.

Box-ironbark woodlands contained high densities of White Cypress Pine Callitris glaucophylla and Narrow-leaved Ironbark Eucalyptus crebra, had a sparse, depauperate understorey, and were associated with frequent, intense logging and infrequent fires (due to fire exclusion and the use of grazing for fuel reduction). Box-ironbark woodlands were characterized by high frequencies of 12 bird species that occurred throughout the Pilliga and low frequencies of many other species. Blakely's Red Gum E. blakelyi woodlands typical of creeks and Broad-leaved Ironbark E. fibrosa woodlands typical of poor soils contained lower densities or smaller trees of C. glaucophylla and E. crebra, had a moderately dense, diverse understorey, and were associated with infrequent low-intensity logging and moderately frequent wildfire. Bird species assemblages of Broad-leaved Ironbark woodlands were similar to those of box-ironbark woodlands. Blakely's Red Gum woodlands were characterized by 36 bird species that were virtually absent from box-ironbark and Broad-leaved Ironbark woodlands, including 10 threatened and declining species. The 10 are among 48 woodland species that are known or thought to be declining and that are dependent on woodlands with mature trees and grassy or patchy grass/shrub understorey. We conclude that these species have declined in the Pilliga and will continue to decline under existing disturbance regimes, particularly in box-ironbark woodlands. We suggest adaptive management strategies for maintaining and rehabilitating their habitats.	Date, E. M.; University of Newcastle, Shortland Union Building, P.O.

I compared four forest treatments: unlogged native forest (UL), two that were selectively logged at low (LL) and high (HL) intensities in the 1960s, and a conifer plantation (PL). Forest-dependent birds were best represented at UL. LL was similar to UL in both vegetation structure and bird community composition, although some forest-dependent bird species were missing from the former. HL had significantly less canopy closure and lower tree density than other plots as a result of the combination of extensive secondary damage and natural disturbance patterns that prevented the reclosure of the forest canopy. Thirty-one percent of the forest-dependent bird species observed during the study were not detected at HL. At PL, bird species richness and bird abundance were about a third of those observed in other plots. There were significant correlations between heterogeneity of tree distribution (horizontal heterogeneity) and abundance and species richness of birds across plots. Abundance and species richness of all, forest-dependent, and forest generalist birds were highest in plots with intermediate measures of horizontal heterogeneity, which were mostly unlogged or lightly logged. If reduced-impact logging practices are not implemented during selective logging operations in tropical forests, consequent long-term changes in vegetation structure may result in significant declines in the populations of some forest-dependent species, as was observed in Kibale National Park.

In southern France, they are the major breeding habitat of five passerine species. Yet, habitat management is done primarily by water control to serve socio-economic rather than conservation interests, because we lack information on the species' ecological requirements. Determinants of passerine abundance were assessed through a comparative analysis of water regime, plant structure, and arthropod (food) distribution at 12 sites consisting of at least 10 ha of marsh densely covered with common reed (Phragmites australis). Overall bird abundance estimated through standardised mist netting was positively correlated with food availability (sweep-netted arthropods weighted by their occurrence in birds' diet), which was in turn negatively correlated with duration of ground dryness between June and December. Abundance of four of the five bird species was associated with specific vegetation parameters (reed diameter, dry reed density, growing reed height, etc.), which could be associated with particular management practices, especially with regard to water levels and salinity.

We examined black-backed and three-toed woodpecker occupancy of stands in a 2-year post-fire forest, mature and old-growth spruce and pine forests, and six post-fire coniferous forests of different ages. Three-toeds were detected in old stands and in the 2-year-old burn, and their probability of occupancy of burned forests decreased between 3 and 8 years post-fire. Within 50 km of the 2-year-old burn, black-backs were only detected in the burn and not in old-growth or mature conifer stands. However, they did occupy old coniferous stands located 75 and 150 km from the recent burn. They had a similar probability of occupying stands in the 3-, 4-, and 8-year-old burns but were not detected in the 16-year-old burn. The persistence of three-toed woodpeckers in boreal Alberta will likely depend on the presence of both old-growth and recently burned coniferous forests or forests with old-growth structural characteristics. Black-backed woodpeckers appear to be more burn dependent than three-toeds, and their long-term persistence may depend on the frequency of recently burned forests within their dispersal range.

Data were collected on species abundance and habitat structure of dry sclerophyll production forest at 36 sites with known logging and fire histories. Sixteen bird species were recorded with most being resident, territorial, obligate hollow nesters that used hollows that were either small (<10 cm diameter) or very large (>18 cm diameter). Species densities were typically low, but combinations of two forest management and three habitat structural variables influenced the abundances of eight bird species in different and sometimes conflicting ways. The results suggest that habitat tree management for biodiversity in production forests cannot depend upon habitat structural characteristics alone. Management histories appear to have independent influence (on some bird species) that are distinguishable from their impacts on habitat structure per se. Rather than managing to maximize species abundances to maintain biodiversity, we may be better off managing to avoid extinctions of populations by identifying thresholds of acceptable fluctuations in populations of not only hollow-nesting birds but other forest dependent wildlife relative to scientifically valid forest management and habitat structural surrogates.

State and federal agencies have responded to this habitat loss with programs and land acquisition that have increased the amount of grassland on the landscape by restoring grassland from other land-use practices. We assessed the effects of habitat restoration and the relative contribution of local habitat and landscape factors on breeding grassland birds in northern Iowa. During the 1999 and 2000 breeding seasons, we surveyed grassland birds in 10 tallgrass prairies and 10 restored grasslands that contained a wide diversity of habitat and landscape conditions. Densities of common bird species were similar between habitat types, except for grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), which were 4 and 9 times more dense in restored grasslands, respectively. Species richness of breeding birds was similar between habitat types. Habitat structure was different in prairies and restored grasslands; restored grasslands had 7% less total vegetation cover and 3% more bare ground. A nested, multiscale analysis indicated that habitat structure explained some variation in species richness and bird density of all common species, yet addition of landscape structure improved models for species richness and for density of 4 of 8 species considered, explaining an additional 10-29% of the variation. Edge-density metrics were the most common variables entering into landscape models; most species had lower densities in landscapes with high edge density. Our results indicate that restored grassland habitats contain bird communities generally similar to those in native prairie habitats in northern Iowa, suggesting that restored grasslands may provide similar habitat suitability for most grassland birds. In addition, both local habitat and landscape factors can be important for managing breeding grassland birds.

To determine northern bobwhite (hereafter, bobwhite) population response in untreated control, thinned, and thinned and burned stands either 1, 2, or 3 growing seasons (Mar to mid-Oct) post-burn, we used whistling-male counts and covey-call counts as indices of population abundance. We estimated woody stem density, understory and overstory canopy cover, conifer and hardwood basal area, and the disc of vulnerability to characterize habitat response. Relative abundance of whistling males in the spring was greatest in thinned stands 3 growing seasons post-burn and in thinned but unburned stands. These stands had the smallest disc of vulnerability and the greatest understory shrub cover <2 m in height compared with other treatments. A threshold-like increase in bobwhite abundance was observed as a function of woody structure <2 m. Pine-grassland restoration provided suitable structure for bobwhites in spring, summer, and fall, but may not be adequate in winter. Further, data suggested that bobwhite density within a stand also was related to the amount of suitable habitat surrounding the stand. Bobwhite management efforts in similar shortleaf pine forests should include thinning to reduce midstory and overstory cover and frequent fire to maintain open woodland conditions-i.e., low basal area stands with limited midstory.

We developed a definition of high-quality foraging habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), a federally endangered, cooperatively breeding bird species, from analyses of resource selection and habitat use, relationships between fitness measures and habitat features, and an extensive literature review. In the North Carolina Sandhills, use of foraging habitat at the level of individual trees, habitat patches, and forest stands was strongly and positively related to age and size of pines (Pinus spp.). Use of habitat patches and forest stands was greatest at intermediate densities of medium-sized and large pines and was negatively associated with hardwood and pine midstory. Size of red-cockaded woodpecker groups, an important fitness measure for this species, was positively related to density of old-growth pines within the home range and negatively related to density of medium-sized pines and height of hardwood midstory. Similar results were reported by 2 other studies. High-quality foraging habitat for red-cockaded woodpeckers, therefore, contains sparse or no midstory, intermediate densities of medium-sized and large pines, and oldgrowth pines in at least low densities. Although we documented a relationship between group size and the amount of habitat meeting our definition of "high quality," we were unable to identify the optimum amount of high-quality habitat to provide per group because most study groups had relatively little high-quality foraging habitat. Both fitness and habitat selection in our study population may be constrained by quality and quantity of foraging habitat. James et al. (2001) recommended. and we strongly agree, that foraging habitat be managed for abundant herbaceous ground cover, low densities of small and medium-sized pines, and moderate densities of large pines. We also stress the importance of old-growth pines in foraging habitat. Because the structure of high-quality foraging habitat is similar to that of high-quality nesting habitat, we recommend that management of these 2 be increasingly integrated.

The impact of these management practices on the fauna is poorly known. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of reed cutting in the Mediterranean region through a comparative analysis of water regime, vegetation structure, arthropod distribution and passerine assemblage at cut and uncut reedbeds in southern France. Cut reedbeds were characterised by a lower salinity, higher water level in spring, and higher reed biomass than uncut reedbeds. Arthropod distribution differed consistently between cut and uncut sites, leading to a higher index of food available to passerines in cut reedbeds. Cut reedbeds had a similar bird species richness but a lower bird abundance, due to the significant decrease in Moustached Warblers and Bearded Tits at cut sites. The mild Mediterranean winter favoured early growth of reed in spring, making harvested reedbeds suitable for breeding of long-distance migrants such as the Great Reed Warbler and Reed Warbler. However, for the resident species that breed earlier in the season, cut reedbeds presumably lack sufficient vegetation cover to provide adequate nesting and feeding sites. Although biennial cutting (double wale) is considered as a good compromise between conservation and commercial interests in the UK, the juxtaposition of annually cut and never cut reed patches appears as the only sustainable alternative for the Mediterranean region. We further hypothesise that an optimal mosaic design of cut/uncut reed patches could provide as high a conservation value as unmanaged reedbeds.

A regression model was constructed for each species in an average year (1988) and a dry year (1989) to examine the relationship of bird abundance to water depth and area of eight vegetation classes. The analyses showed that bird abundance is related to both water level and the vegetation community, but water level generally had the greatest effect. Models showed that in the average year (1988), there was a water level threshold, above which bird abundance was predicted to decline. The level threshold varied among species and may have reflected species-specific foraging constraints. However, in the dry year (1989), the relationship between bird abundance and water level was positive and linear, indicating that few places had water deeper than the thresholds observed in the average year. Overall, the area of slough vegetation appeared to have the second greatest effect on bird abundance. Generally, all models had low coefficients of determination (R2 range 0.06-0.42) suggesting that factors other than water level and vegetation were important, or birds were responding to variables in the model, but at different spatial scales than that which the data were collected. Models for Great Blue Herons and Great Egrets had higher coefficients of determination than models for Wood Storks and White Ibises. The more solitary feeding behavior of the herons and egrets resulted in a more even distribution across the marsh than for storks and ibises, which were usually found in flocks. Our study suggests that if restoration of the Everglades results in more natural hydrologic cycles, an increase in the amount of slough habitat, and a decrease in the proportion of cattails, foraging conditions for wading birds may improve.

Intensive management for pine specialists such as the Red-cockaded Woodpecker may negatively impact both Nearctic-Neotropical and Temperate Zone migrants associated with hardwood vegetation. To evaluate possible positive and negative associations, we surveyed avian communities from 1995-1997 using point counts within managed Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavity tree clusters and mature forest control sites in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and loblolly (P. taeda)-shortleaf (P. echinata) pine habitats. In general, sites managed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers supported more diverse and numerous bird populations than mature forest control sites. During the breeding season in loblolly-shortleaf and longleaf pine habitats, respectively, species richness was 47% and 23% greater, avian abundance was 57% and 65% greater, and bird species diversity was 25% and 21% greater within managed Red-cockaded Woodpecker cluster sites than within control sites.

BSP) sites, after 5, 14, and 27 years of succession. Total bird density was lower in clear-cut sites resulting from fewer hermit thrushes, yellow warblers, Swainson's thrushes, and fox sparrows. Hermit thrushes were positively correlated with snag density while yellow warblers and Swainson's thrushes were positively associated with deciduous tree cover and negatively correlated with conifer cover. Only yellow-rumped warblers had higher densities on clear-cut sites, likely due to greater conifer cover. Bird densities and species richness peaked in the 14-year-old burns and exceeded that of mature forests reported for Labrador. This demonstrates the importance of natural early successional forests for birds. Although logged areas support several species found in natural young burns, logging does not precisely mimic fire. This suggests that forest managers should allow some forests to burn naturally.	Simon, N. P. P.; Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Forest Resources and Agrifoods, Station B, P.O.

Variations of the distribution and abundance of birds were related to changes in the plant-species composition and structural attributes of their habitat. Bird species occurred in plantations in levels of abundance and diversity similar to that of reference forest, although community composition was highly dissimilar. Species of reference stands were typical of mature, mixedwood forest. Species of younger plantations were typical of open, early successional, upland habitats. Once the plantations became older than 13 years and the tree height exceeded about 5 m, birds typical of conifer forest began to invade the habitat, resulting in a mixed-species composition. Although cavity-containing snags were rare in the plantations, if they did occur in them or near their edge they were used by hole-nesting birds. Although we could not study a complete rotation, the field data and habitat trajectory suggest that the plantations will not support some elements of the avian biodiversity of the natural forest in the study area. The mature plantations will be highly depauperate in coarse-woody debris, snags, and cavities, and will not support species dependent on these critical habitat elements. In addition, birds requiring habitat containing trees of larger size and of various species, including hardwoods, will not find the mature plantations to be suitable. To accommodate the needs of species potentially at risk from the extensive development of plantations, the following changes in forestry management practices should be instituted: (1) retention of natural cavity-trees, snags, coarse-woody debris, and hardwood trees and shrubs in residual non-harvested "islands" within clear-cuts and plantations; (b) retention of a patchy angiosperm component by leaving some areas untreated during herbicide applications; and (c) setting aside large areas of natural forest as non-harvested protected areas. Although we believe that these mitigations would help sustain elements of indigenous biodiversity that are at risk in an extensive industrial forest, we stress that these predictions would have to be tested through additional research and monitoring.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2002	July, 2002	66	3	641-661	641	661	English	print					2	35	The dramatic loss and degradation of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests in the southeastern United States have contributed to the declines of several bird species associated with this ecosystem. We examined breeding bird response to habitat restoration in longleaf pine sandhill forests of northwest Florida, USA. We compared habitat variables and abundance of breeding birds among 3 hardwood reduction techniques (prescribed spring burning, herbicide application, mechanical felling-girdling) and maintenance of fire exclusion (control). We also examined abundance of breeding birds in fire-maintained, non-experimental reference sites as a means to gauge management success based on similarity analysis. All 3 hardwood reduction methods decreased midstory hard-woods and canopy cover, and increased herbaceous cover compared with fire-suppressed control plots, but had little effect on longleaf pine basal area. Midstory hardwood reduction methods increased the similarity of the breeding bird species assemblages to those found in the reference plots, compared with the fire-excluded control plots. Species that most strongly contributed to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were, in decreasing order of importance: red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), and brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla). Depending on the similarity index used, additional but weaker contributors to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), and Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). Species associated with hardwoods (e.g., tufted titmouse, northern cardinal, Carolina chickadee) contributed to greater similarity of the reference condition by decreasing in abundance after hardwood reduction, whereas open-habitat species increased in numbers, compared with birds on the fire-excluded control plots. Only the detection rates of cardinals and Carolina chickadees were not different among hardwood reduction methods. Two notable species of concern that increased in all hardwood reduction plots compared with the control, but were not strong contributors of the similarity to the reference condition, were northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and southeastern American kestrel (Falco sparverius paulus). Our results suggest that these management methods were beneficial to landbirds characteristic of fire-maintained longleaf pine sandhills in northwest Florida. However, northern bobwhites and Bachman's sparrows may require more intensive management than red-cockaded woodpeckers, such as shorter burn intervals, as these species depend directly on ground cover vegetation. We recommend prescribed spring burning as the most economical and ecologically desirable method for managing breeding bird habitat in longleaf pine sandhill forests.

In each of four blocks, we established four experimental units: (1) DCWD removed, (2) snags and DCWD removed, and (3) and (4) unmodified control plots. We quantified vegetation layers to determine their effects on the experimental outcome. Total breeding bird abundance, abundance of resident species, breeding bird diversity, breeding species richness, and abundance of Great Crested Flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus) were reduced by the removal of DCWD and snags. Total woodpecker and Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) breeding territories were reduced by snag removal. Weak excavating and secondary cavity-nesting species, Neotropical migrants, and Eastern Towhees (Pipilio erythrophthalmus) had fewer breeding territories on plots where DCWD was removed. Red-headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) and midstory and canopy-nesting species were at lowest densities on plots where all CWD had been removed. The CWD removal had no effect on the nonbreeding bird community. Most breeding and nonbreeding species used habitats with sparse midstory and well-developed understory, whereas sparse canopy cover and dense midstory were important to some nonbreeding species. Snag and DCWD retention, and practices that maintain a dense understory and sparse midstory and canopy, will create favorable breeding habitat for many bird species of loblolly pine forests.

Most researchers of riparian forest avifauna have used riparian woodland width as an index of forest area. We conducted point counts at 135 locations along Big and Little Darby creeks in Ohio and used Landsat Thematic Mapper data to determine woodland area and width surrounding each point-count station. Probability of detection was positively correlated with area for 11 bird species and negatively correlated with area for 8 species. Thus, along Big and Little Darby creeks, woodland area appeared to better predict bird-species presence than woodland width. The proposed Little Darby National Wildlife Refuge located within the study area includes restoration of riparian forest habitat along the two creeks. If the riparian habitat zones are not sufficient in area, already common species, rather than declining Neotropical migrants, may be the only species to benefit from restoration efforts.

We used partial-regression analysis to remove correlations between habitat variables measured at different spatial scales (local habitat and square landscape regions with sides of 0.5, 1, and 2 km) and between landscape composition (proportion of different land cover types) and pattern (spatial arrangement of land cover) variables. To account for spatial autocorrelation, we used autoregressive models that incorporated information on bird abundance in the spatial neighborhood surrounding each sample point. Most species, especially Neotropical migrants, were significantly correlated with at least one landscape variable. These correlations included both composition and pattern variables at 0.5-2 km scales. However, landscape effects explained only a small amount of the variation in bird abundance that could not be explained by local habitat. Our results are consistent with other studies of songbird abundance in large managed forests that have found weak or moderate landscape effects. These studies suggest that songbird abundance in forested landscapes will primarily reflect the quantity of different habitats in the landscape rather than the spatial arrangement of those habitats. Although some studies have suggested consolidating clearcuts in large managed forests to reduce edge and landscape heterogeneity, much of the current evidence does not support this management recommendation. An important future challenge in avian conservation is to better understand how the importance of landscape effects varies in relation to (1) the amount of suitable habitat in the landscape, and (2) land use patterns at broader spatial scales.

Using the vertebrate fauna of south Florida, we quantified how the loss of native species and invasion by nonnatives may alter functional group richness within and across scales. We found that despite large changes in species composition due to potential extinctions and successful invasions by nonnative species, functional group richness will not change significantly within scales, there will not be any significant loss of overall redundancy of ecology function across scales, and overall body mass pattern will not undergo substantial change. However, the types of functions performed will change, and this change may have profound effects on not only the Everglades ecosystem but on the entire landscape of south Florida.

We surveyed birds and sampled vegetation along 1-km line transects bisecting 14 (7 control, 7 burn) 25-ha plots located randomly within a burn and adjacent control unit. Following a spring burn that was moderate in intensity and patchy in areal extent, we observed that ground cover was affected more strongly by burning than mesquite (Prosopis) cover, smaller mesquite were affected more strongly by burning than larger mesquite, and mortality of mesquite was low. No change in total abundance of birds was detected on the burn unit following fire for either wintering or breeding birds; however, species richness of breeding birds decreased in the first year post-burn. During the breeding season, mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) increased, whereas Botteri's sparrows (Aimophila botterii), Cassin's sparrows (Aimophila cassinii), and cactus wrens (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus) decreased in relative abundance following fire. During the wintering season, ladder-backed woodpeckers (Picoides scalaris) and vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) increased and cactus wrens decreased in relative abundance following fire. Beyond species-level trends, we found stronger evidence of trends and greater magnitudes of relative change for breeding species associated with open grasslands compared to those associated with shrubs. The use of spring burns on the Refuge will likely improve conditions for open-grassland species that were historically more abundant by killing smaller mesquite and reducing mesquite recruitment. However, more intense and extensive fires will be required to reduce the presence of larger mesquite. Such fires would likely have a greater impact on birds associated with shrubs, and consequently, a greater impact on the avian community as a whole.

Habitat characteristics (water depth, vegetation height and density, and plant-species composition) and abundance of all passerine species were measured at each of the 68 sampling points. The sampled area included most of the reedbeds in the Ebro Delta. Sampling points were classified according to the habitat parameters measured using cluster analysis. The resulting four habitat types differed in the composition and attributes of their passerine communities. The abundance of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) was greatest in tall, permanently inundated and almost monospecific Phragmites reedbeds. In contrast, the numbers of the reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and Savi's warbler (Locustella luscinioides) were greatest in areas of drier soils and a denser basal stratum. Finally, the fan-tailed warbler (Cisticola juncidis) showed no clear habitat association. In the Ebro Delta, reedbed management includes freshwater inputs and burning of standing reeds. These practices promote tall, permanently inundated reedbeds with minimal detrital accumulation. Bird species richness and diversity were greater in less intensely-managed habitats, but only diversity was significant (p<0.001). We conclude that, since reedbeds are important habitats for several scarce bird species, and the abundance of these species seem to be influenced by vegetation structure, bird conservation considerations should be incorporated into future reedbed management practices.

Mike									Wildlife Society Bulletin		2002	Summer, 2002	30	2	354-360	354	360	English	print					3	19	The longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem is one of the most endangered ecosystems in the United States. Recent incentives have led to increased interest in longleaf pine restoration. These restoration efforts often emphasize reestablishing native groundcovers, yet there have been no studies that address the role of native groundcover on breeding bird communities within longleaf pine forests. Therefore, we studied breeding bird communities in mature longleaf pine stands with either native or disturbed groundcovers to determine the likely effects of groundcover reestablishment associated with longleaf pine reforestation. Avian species richness and diversity did not differ (P=0.823, P=0.571, respectively), and avian community similarity was high (Morisita's index=0.98) between native and disturbed groundcover. However, pine warblers (Dendroica pinus), gray catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis), eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) were more abundant (Pltoreq0.10) in areas with native groundcover, whereas indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) were more abundant (P=0.058) in areas with disturbed groundcover. Although groundcover restoration may benefit some avian populations, overall avian species richness, diversity, and community composition may be unaffected. Restoration of native groundcover may be best justified for aesthetic values and as a tool to facilitate long-term stand management using prescribed fire.	Rutledge, Brandon T.; Conner, L.

The regime of prescribed burning should be adapted to maintain the biological diversity and impact on population dynamics must be determined. We studied the effect of prescribed burning on the capture and survival rates of a population of small mammals, the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) in the Mediterranean region of Torderes, France. To this end, we used a rectangular trapping quadrat measuring 300 X 225 m2, in which 1366 individuals were captured and marked over a total of 18 trapping sessions (May 1991-June 1996). Several prescribed fires were ignited between the fifth and sixth trapping sessions. These multiple fires resulted in a partial burning of the study site, which left a number of small patches of vegetation intact. To estimate the influence of this prescribed burning on capture and survival rates of the wood mouse, the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model was fitted. Likelihood ratio test and AIC criterion allowed us to select the most parsimonious model for our survival data, the additive model PHIs+r. This model did not demonstrate any significant change in survival rates after the prescribed fires, probably because the fire left behind small patches of vegetation and the wood mouse can quickly recolonize the study site. Our result is in accordance with other studies, which found little impact of prescribed burning on survival rates and abundance in animal populations.

Forest Science		2002	May, 2002	48	2	365-372	365	372	English	print					0	9	The Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota are characterized by a complex history of both natural and human disturbance regimes. Historically, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities were characterized by frequent, cool ground fires. Intensive fire suppression and timber harvest throughout the past century have drastically altered the structure of existing forests. Today, much of the area has been harvested using shelterwood logging resulting in open even-aged stands. The goal of this study was to compare bird communities in treated (areas that have recently been harvested) and untreated (areas receiving minimal silvicultural treatment) in the past 40 yr. Of the 20 commonly observed bird species, 3 species (red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta Canadensis), brown creeper (Certhia Americana), and ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus)) were conspicuously less abundant in treated than in untreated stands. Eleven other species were more abundant in treated stands, while six species showed no response to treatment. Although bird species diversity and the abundance of birds were highest in treated stands, this does not imply that logging is beneficial to the entire bird community. The abundance of particular bird species may appear to have increased, but the composition of the bird community has been altered. As more of the forested areas are harvested, the bird community will shift from one with birds typical of both open pine and dense pine forest to one dominated by ground foraging species.

Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment		2002	April, 2002	89	1-2	41-52	41	52	English	print					3	51	Many farmland bird populations have exhibited marked declines in the last 20-30 years and there is growing evidence to link these declines to agricultural intensification. Field margin management is frequently proposed as a way of enhancing bird populations but there have been few attempts to assess the relative value of different management options. This paper aims to provide a preliminary assessment of the relative value of six different cereal field margin management practices in providing foraging habitats for farmland birds. It also briefly compares these with the benefits afforded by field and whole farm approaches such as set-aside and organic farming, to wildlife conservation on arable land. The field margins considered are: grass margins (separated into grass-only strips and grass/wildflower strips), naturally regenerated set-aside margins, uncropped wildlife strips, game cover crops and conservation headlands. Sympathetical managed field margins can provide a range of plant and invertebrate food resources for birds both in summer and winter. In general, the best winter food supplies (mainly seeds) will be provided by game cover crops and naturally regenerated rotational set-aside strips. The most abundant summer food supplies (invertebrates and seeds) will be provided by a diverse sward; grass/wildflower strips, uncropped wildlife strips and naturally regenerated rotational set-aside strips followed by conservation headlands. Field margin swards that are less diverse in terms of species composition and structural heterogeneity and that consequently support fewer invertebrates, can, nonetheless, provide higher quality foraging habitats for birds than an intensively managed crop up to the hedge base. A number of bird species such as yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) and tree sparrow (Passer montanus), prefer to forage in margins in winter and summer and many of the benefits of whole field approaches such as set-aside, overwinter stubbles and undersown cereals, could be gained from margins under the same management. Whole-field approaches are, however, required for boundary-avoiding species such as skylark (Alauda arvensis) and lapwing (Vanellus vanellus). Less is known about the use other birds make of margins, relative to their use of field centres in winter. Whole farm approaches such as organic farming, whilst being highly beneficial to birds, are likely to remain rather localised in the UK, whereas field margin management can be relatively easily incorporated into the farmed landscape on an extensive scale.

However, our study of understorey plant species in various plantations of single exotic or indigenous species has shown that more plant species grew within stands near a natural forest than within grasslands in Sakaerat, northeastern Thailand. These forests contribute to the acceleration of the secondary succession from grassland, which before reafforestation was achieved by recurrent fires. In the natural regeneration of understorey tree species in planted forests, large tree species in the natural forest seem to be the major common seed source among the stands studied. The small leaf biomass in these planted forests generated enough shade to prevent the invasion of 2 fire-adapted competitive grasses and to provide a suitable light environment for seedling establishment at an early stage of forest development. These factors facilitated the establishment of other species within the plantations of single tree species. Faster-growing exotic species accumulated larger amounts of understorey biomass than indigenous species. The most suitable species was Acacia mangium. The association of forests planted with single tree species with a high species richness in the ecosystems may enable to achieve a high biological diversity at the landscape level, which could bring various benefits to the forests of Sakaerat.

Journal of Field Ornithology		2002	Spring, 2002	73	2	130-140	130	140	English	print					1	14	Measurements of food availability for avian insectivores are desirable, but are complicated by the range of microhabitats insects occupy and the difficulty of comparing non-standard techniques across studies. We describe an efficient method for sampling wood-boring beetle larvae, an important food of many woodpeckers, beneath the bark of fire-killed trees. The method involves taking two 225-cm2 bark samples from each tree, and provides enough information to rank most trees by relative wood-borer abundance. At two sites in the northern Rocky Mountains, we tested the reliability of this method by comparing its results to those of a more intensive sampling scheme. For 65 trees of four species, we collected eight bark samples at two different heights, 1.7 m and 6 m, and compared correlations between the smaller, ground-based sampling scheme (two bark samples) and the larger, eight-sample effort. With one exception, correlations for individual tree species ranged from 0.79 to 0.95, indicating that the smaller sample gave rankings of insect abundance comparable to those of the larger sample. Correlation strengths differed between sites, suggesting that the larger sample could be employed at future sites to fine-tune the smaller sampling scheme. Correlations for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) at one site were very low, suggesting that wood-borers may colonize ponderosa pine in a manner different from the other tree species studied. The strong correlations produced by this test indicate that, with limited effort and training, even small field crews (e.g., two workers) can use this method to rank the foraging resources contained in dead trees.

Forest Science		2002	February, 2002	48	1	129-145	129	145	English	print					5	67	To improve our understanding of how management affects the composition and structure of northern hardwood forests, we compared managed with unmanaged sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) dominated forests. Unmanaged old-growth and unmanaged second-growth forests provided baselines for comparing the effects of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on selected aspects of biological diversity. Three replications of each condition were located on the Winegar Moraine in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Old-growth forests were multistoried, dominated by a few, large trees with well-developed crowns extending over a subcanopy stratum 10-15 m in height and an abundance of woody vegetation (mostly sugar maple seedlings) at 2-3 m. This complex stand structure contrasts with the relatively uniform structure of unmanaged second-growth forests with a closed overstory canopy and limited understory development. Forest management, both even- and uneven-aged, created forest structures that were more complex than their unmanaged second-growth baselines, yet managed forests lacked some of the structural complexity characteristic of old-growth. Managed forests had fewer large trees (stem diameter at 1.37 m>50 cm) and considerably less basal area in dead trees when compared with old-growth. There were fewer tree species in managed forests because commercially important tree species were favored for retention and, when present, early successional species (e.g., Populus grandidentata Michx., Populus tremuloides Michx.) were harvested. A subcanopy comprised of large shrubs and small trees characteristic of old growth was absent in managed forests, but this structural element may develop with time under management. As expected, thinning the overstory and disturbing the forest floor through tree harvesting promoted understory development in managed forests. Most of the added species, however, were common in the landscape and thus added little to overall species richness.

Middle Spotted Woodpecker tends to dominate Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) in oak forest managed for the production of quality timber for a long time. At the mature timber forest stage, trees with large trunks dominate: oaks with a trunk diameter of 45 cm represent over 80% of all trees. These mature plots guaranty the presence of high-density Middle Spotted Woodpecker population nucleus, and this despite all standing dead wood being removed. As for the study species other cavity-nesting birds are found in densities much than those recorded in primary forest in Poland. Starlings are especially numerous with the breeding population supplemented by a large number on non-breeding birds, this does not affect Middle Spotted Woodpeckers nor Nuthatches (Sitta europaea) which can be found at densities higher than 7 territories per 10 ha.

As the thermo-Mediterranean life zone is characterised by stronger dryness conditions than other Mediterranean zones, we hypothesised that the bird community succession here is very slow. We used the point-count method to census birds from the first to the sixth breeding seasons after fire in burnt and control shrublands of the northeastern Iberian Peninsula. Bird richness and abundance increased rapidly and even exceeded the values of the control zone six years after the fire. Nevertheless, in the burnt zone, the expected change from communities dominated by open-space species to communities dominated by shrubland species was not detected and high proportions of the former were maintained in the species pool throughout the study period.

Auk		2002	January, 2002	119	1	71-87	71	87	English	print					1	17	Reversing decades of fire exclusion by hardwood midstory reduction is now used to recover populations of the federally endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest ecosystems. The effects of Red-cockaded Woodpecker management on winter birds in longleaf pine sandhill forests are largely unknown. Examining habitat use of winter migrants, some of which are declining, may influence the selection of habitat management techniques used for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers to benefit overwintering migrants. During the winters (December-February) of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999, we tested experimentally the effects of hardwood reduction treatments applied in 1995 on winter birds at Eglin Air Force Base in fire-excluded northwest Florida longleaf pine sandhills. Treatments were (1) prescribed spring burning, (2) herbicide application, (3) mechanical felling and girdling, and (4) a control where decades of fire exclusion was maintained. We also sampled winter bird flocks in frequently burned, nonexperimental reference plots to measure management success. Hardwood reduction techniques had no effect on flock species richness, which averaged 7.9 and 7.2, respectively, during 1997-1998 and 1998-1999. Larger flocks in felling and girdling and in herbicide plots were primarily due to significantly higher numbers of overwintering Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina), as well as resident Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and an influx of temperate migrant Pine Warblers (Dendroica pinus). In contrast, flocks in control plots were smaller (flock size and species composition in spring burn plots were intermediate) and composed of hardwood-associated species, such as Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) and Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). The relative uses of longleaf pines and hardwoods by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, Pine Warblers, and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) during both winters best explained that winter birds present in herbicide, felling and girdling, and reference plots were more likely to forage on the same tree species and substrates than birds in spring-burned plots, and least likely to forage on the same species and substrates as birds in the control plots. Those differences corresponded to the following increasing order of hardwood stem mortality among treatments: control, spring burn (41%), felling and girdling (62%), and herbicide (92%). Repeated burning is recommended to restore the reference foraging condition because it was eight times less expensive than other techniques, which favored mostly Chipping Sparrows.

The habitat suitability model contains three parameters : tree basal area (GHA), number of tree species (NBESS) and tree composition (ESS) (Table 1). These parameters are estimated by a forest inventory. Observations showed that the habitat suitability indices model performs well for 9 ha plots but is irrelevant for I ha plots. The Lesser Spotted Woodpecker requires the presence of a high diversity of tree species, a high density of dead trees and a basal area of more than 15 m2/ha. Dead trees and basal area parameters were used to design multiple logistic regression model. Foresters could use this model as a tool in their forest management.

The objective of this study was to compare the value of these habitats as a repository of plant biodiversity in agricultural areas of southern Quebec. The overall plant diversity was higher in natural hedgerows and they contained more plant species of conservation values than other hedgerow types. Plant species richness per quadrat was, however, higher in planted woody hedgerows, and together with the species composition, lead to the conclusion that planted hedgerows in their entirety consisted of an ecotone type of vegetation such as is found in field edges which usually support high plant diversity and productivity but where transient plant species predominate. Consequently, this study indicated that natural hedgerows fare better than planted hedgerows in terms of diversity of plants of conservation interest. In spite of that, planted woody hedgerows contained plant (and bird) species of some interest and should be favoured over more desolate herbaceous hedgerows. In areas where hedgerows were removed and are not re-establishing naturally, a mixture of deciduous trees and conifers should be encouraged in further windbreak planting programs so as to conciliate both the conservation and agronomic objectives. Furthermore, management practices should optimise the growth of establishing plants of conservation values.

Shane; Maher, Ron									Canadian Field-Naturalist		2002	January-March 2002	116	1	42-50	42	50	English	print					1	26	The abundance and distribution of breeding waterfowl in the Great Clay Belt of northern Ontario was determined through helicopter surveys of 117 fixed plots (2X2 km each) during the nest initiation periods from 1988 to 1990. This area has higher fertility, flat topography, high water table and better access than the surrounding Boreal Forest, and therefore has greater potential for increased waterfowl production through habitat management. Overall breeding density averaged 112.5 indicated breeding pairs per 100 km2, 68% being of the four most common species (Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Ring-necked Duck (Aythya collaris), American Black Duck (Anas rubripes), and Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula)); 13 other species were encountered. The average total of breeding waterfowl for the region was estimated at 59330 pairs. Distributions of the species were related to ecodistrict and to surficial geology. The more northerly of the two main ecodistricts had higher densities of American Black Ducks, Ring-necked Ducks, Common Goldeneyes, and Canada Geese (Branta canadensis). Mallard and Hooded Merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus) distributions correlated with presence of surficial clay and moraines, respectively. Less common species including Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca) and American Wigeon (Anas americana) appeared to be concentrated in smaller-scaled habitat features (beaver pond sequences and estuarine marshes, respectively). Results generally agreed with those of earlier Clay Belt surveys. Total breeding density of waterfowl is slightly higher than that of surrounding regions.	Ross, R.

To investigate possible changes in bird communities, we compared species richness and composition in six forest types (mature spruce plantations, ecotones, mixed forests, and three birch forest types) in two regions over two years. In the southern region, birch forests tended to host a higher number of species than spruce plantations, but species composition differed between forest types. The species composition in rich birch forests was particularly distinguished from spruce plantations, but also from the less productive birch habitats. Furthermore, there were dissimilarities in species richness and composition between regions. Ground nesters and species nesting on their northern margins occurred most frequently in the southern region, whereas cavity-nesters were most abundant in the northern region. Some species declined in abundance from 1998 to 1999, whereas three species shifted their main distribution from birch forests to mixed forests/ecotones. Possible factors underlying these results are discussed. We recommend that researchers and managers pay attention to habitat qualities within forest types (i.e., other than tree species composition in overstory) as well as to regional variations in species assemblages when addressing outcomes of management practices.

We studied songbirds 5-6 years post-fire in a large burn (9600 ha) in the boreal mixedwood forest of north-eastern Alberta. In the spring of 1995 and 1996 we estimated abundance of songbirds in four areas, each with four replicate sites: unburned patches within the fire (Isolates); burned patches (Burns); patches that had been clear-cut prior to burning by wildfire (Cut-Burns); and the unburned, continuous forest adjacent to the burn (Peripherals). We also sampled shrub-based arthropods with sweep-nets at each site. To investigate the role of Isolates, we compared them to Peripherals and to Burns. We compared Cut-Burns to Burns to examine the effect of logging prior to burning. In general, Isolates supported higher numbers of species and individuals than Peripherals, mainly due to higher numbers of aerial-foraging birds. Isolates and Burns had similar species richness and abundance, but Burns supported more aerial foragers while Isolates had more foliage gleaners. Cut-Burns generally supported fewer individuals than Burns, in particular fewer shrub-nesters, aerial foragers, and neotropical migrants. More bird species reached their highest densities in Burns than in any other area. Songbird species richness and abundance were positively related to dry arthropod biomass, with Burns and Isolates having the highest arthropod biomass. These patterns indicated that, 5-6 years post-burn, the patchy mosaic created by this wildfire supported more species than the mature forest surrounding the fire. Clear-cut logging prior to burning resulted in a diminished songbird community compared to that found in burned stands.

Landscape Ecology		2002		17	Supplement 1	19-33	19	33	English	print					0	19	The river valley of the French upper Meuse and its floodplain, constitutes a relatively natural ecosystem which still contains many endangered species of high conservation value. For example, several birds (Crex crex, Numenius arquata) as well as plant species (Gratiola officinalis, Inula britannica, Teucrium scordium, Ranunculus lingua and Mentha pulegium) which have declined seriously in France in recent times are found in the upper Meuse floodplain. Phytosociological studies and water level measurements have shown that the floristic diversity is mainly influenced by hydrological fluctuations and agricultural practices. The plant communities are structured along a topographical gradient in the high water bed reflecting the duration of floods and the ground water table depth. Agricultural practices have influenced the vegetation changes by selecting species adapted to particular management practices (e.g., fertiliser use, grazing, cutting regime). The data collected in this study from the upper Meuse as enabled 13 grassland and wetland ecotopes to be defined which are correlated with different environmental factors. Fertiliser use, grazing and reduction in the frequency of the cutting lead to a lower species richness because they encourage competitive species. However, it is also demonstrated, that maximum biodiversity is not always synonymous with high conservation value because some impoverished ecosystems, e.g., sedges and tall forb formations, may contain endangered plant and bird species. Knowledge of the boundaries between the different plant communities enables likely changes in floristic composition after modification of one or more site factors to be forecasted. Such factors include, water table depth and flood frequency, cutting regime, fertiliser use and grazing pressure. Thus, the definition of these ecotopes, corresponding to correlations between water regime, agricultural practice and vegetation composition, could lead to the establishment of guidelines for water and agricultural managements that could be involved in restoration projects.

Frank, Georg (Frank.Georg@aon.at)									Vogelwelt		2002		123	5	225-239	225	239	German	print					0	0	In the NATURA 2000 area "Otscher-Durrenstein" 69-72 territories of the White-backed Woodpecker were recorded in 43 study plots with a total area of 5,094 hectares, which means an abundance of 1.38 territories/100 ha. The Great Spotted Woodpecker occurred with 75-76 territories (1.48 territories/100 ha). Therefore, in mature mountainous mixed forests, White-backed Woodpecker is one of the commonest woodpecker species. In the primaeval stands of the "Urwald Rothwald" it is even the dominant woodpecker whereas the Great Spotted Woodpecker is the rarest woodpecker species. The White-backed Woodpecker shows a relative preference for altitudes between 900 - 1,200 m a.s.l. Strong inclination and a southerly slope are typical for its territories. Most of the territories of the White-backed Woodpecker are located in the middle and upper parts of the slopes. It only inhabits beech-dominated old-growth stands. Due to the preference of lightly closed stands and dependence on a high proportion of dead wood, forests in the state of decay seem to be of high quality for White-backed Woodpecker. Although basically the Great Spotted Woodpecker is a generalist, the niche partition between the two species is sharp. Obviously in favourable habitats White-backed Woodpecker is dominant and Great Spotted Woodpecker is displaced to habitats which can not be used by the former. As we can see in the primaeval stands of the "Urwald Rothwald", this distribution scheme is not only the result of anthropogenic influences like forestry.

Ten North Central Texas PNAs were studied to understand how plant species richness is related to PNA size. The species-area model was applied to total plant species, native plant species, selected native speciose plant families and invasive plant species. Results indicate that area is a significant predictor of species richness (r2=gtoreq0.60) for both total species and native species in North Central Texas PNAs. Habitat diversity as measured by topographic relief and topographic abruptness is also shown to be a significant predictor of plant species richness in North Central Texas PNAs. Introduced species richness could not be predicted from area alone but was explained by perimeter and perimeter/area ratio and one proxy measure of habitat diversity. The estimates of z values range from 0.15 to 0.30, while c ranges from 0.60 to 1.42 for species-area relationships, both of which fall within the range of values estimated by previous research. Such estimates allowed us to evaluate effective management schemes for North Central Texas PNAs plant diversity. The results of this research permit us to examine the invasion of exotic flora in Texas PNAs and to predict how such invasions will reduce native species richness if conservation management practices are not implemented.

I. Diversity of stand structure		Sullivan, Thomas P.; Sullivan, Druscilla S.; Lindgren, Pontus M. F.

Variable retention harvests or 'green-tree retention systems' are important to the management of coniferous forests in the temperate zone. Green-tree retention leaves large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand and provide mature forest habitat that develops sooner than in typical even-aged management by clear-cutting. The seed-tree system is one method of harvesting that leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally. Green-tree retention may increase biological diversity and help to enhance functional links among forest structures or ecological processes. 2. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the abundance (e.g. basal area and density of residual trees and amount of vegetation) and diversity (e.g. species diversity and structural diversity of the herb, shrub and tree layers) of various aspects of stand structure will decline with lower levels of tree retention. In particular, abundance and diversity should be greater in sites with green-tree retention than in clear-cut sites. 3. Stand structure attributes were measured from 1996 (immediately after harvesting) to 1999 in replicated clear-cut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada. 4. In terms of abundance, clear-cut, single seed-tree and group seed-tree sites had similar mean basal areas of residual trees, ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 m2ha-1, with significantly higher levels on patch-cut (23.4 m2ha-1) and uncut forest (39.0 m2ha-1) sites. Mean densities of residual trees also followed this pattern, ranging from 0.7 to 16.3 stems ha-1 on the clear-cut to group seed-tree sites, to 769.4 and 2050.0 stems ha-1 on the patch-cut and uncut forest sites, respectively. However, mean volume (m3 ha-1) of fallen wood (i.e. dead wood or woody debris) was similar among sites, ranging from 116.7 in the single seed-tree to 210.2 in the patch-cut sites. Contrary to our hypothesis, the mean index of total crown volume of herbs, shrubs, mosses and lichens was similar among sites. 5. Mean species richness of herbs, shrubs and total plants was similar among sites. Mean richness of trees in seed-tree sites was similar to that in uncut forest in three of four post-harvest years. The mean species diversity of herbs was similar among sites, but that of shrubs and trees was generally lowest in the patch-cut sites and similar among the other sites. 6. The mean structural richness and diversity of herbs was lowest in the uncut forest and similar at the other sites 3 and 4 years post-harvest. The mean structural richness of trees and total plants in the patch-cut and uncut forest sites had more vegetation layers than the other sites. 7. Our hypothesis was partly supported in terms of basal area and density of residual trees and structural richness of total vegetation layers across a gradient of tree retention from uncut forest to clear-cut sites. However, this pattern was not supported for abundance or diversity of understorey vegetation. Thus, the structural attributes of residual trees and layers of vegetation, but not the abundance, species richness or species diversity of understorey vegetation, lend support to the aims of variable retention harvesting, at least up to 4 years post-harvest.

This area is of great importance for breeding meadow birds like Curlew (Numenius arquata), Lapwing (Vanellus cntdot vanellus) and Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa). This investigation focuses on characteristic species like Lapwing and Black-tailed Godwit. Populations of these species, showing high densities, are relative constant since many years. Nevertheless an increased fledging success is necessary for a stable development of the populations. Detailed reasons for the low fledging success are unknown. Within the context of these investigation the present status is described. The water regime as a main environmental factor was changed in winter 2000/2001. An important aim of changes in the project area must be the improvement of existing populations, particularly Lapwings and Black-teailed Godwits, at least until the fledging success is high enough to replace annual adult losses. Beyond this long-term objective is to produce further fledglings to support the populations outside the project area. Special treatments for habitat management regarding a higher fledging success to maintain stable bird populations are suggested as follows: (1) flooding of selected areas in winter time; (2) increasing of species diversity of pasture and flowering vegetation as basis for invertebrates; (3) separation from farming or tourist activities during the hedging period on selected areas reduce the loss of nests and juvenile birds.

We counted birds during the 1990 breeding season on 72 field sites in southern Ontario, Canada, paired between 10 organic and 10 conventional farms for local habitat to enhance our ability to detect effects of agricultural practices. Of 68 species recorded, 58 were on organic sites, 59 on conventional. Species richness and total abundance were significantly greater on organic than conventional sites based on log-linear regression. Of 43 species analyzed with log-linear regression, eight (18.6%) were significantly (P<0.05) more abundant on organic than conventional sites and four (9.3%) approached significance (0.05<P<0.10). Eight of these 12 species had negative population trends for 1967-1998 Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS) in this region. Two of the 43 species analyzed (4.7%) were significantly more abundant on conventional than organic sites and three (7.0%) approached significance. Two of these five species had negative BBS population trends. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of 13 practices and 13 habitat variables explained 44% of total variation (TV) accounted for in a detrended correspondence analysis of bird species composition and abundance. Practices contributed 23.7% of TV, habitat 26%; habitat and practices shared 5.7% with each other and 12% with farm ownership (i.e. clustering of field sites within farms). CCA ordinations indicated considerable mixing of organic and conventional sites across a gradient from sites with many birds species associated with greater habitat heterogeneity and more pasture, winter grain, farmstead and other non-crop habitats (hedgerow, woodland) to sites with few bird species associated with larger fields, more rowcrop and spring grain, more passes and tilling, and use of herbicides and chemical fertilizers. Our results re-emphasize the importance of non-crop habitats, more permanent crop cover, and less intensive management practices to the conservation of avian biodiversity on farmland.

We studied the effects of repeated burning (1-4 years of annual burning) and recovery (1 year after burning) on the breeding bird community. Burning resulted in incremental but temporary reductions in the availability of leaf litter, shrubs, and saplings, but it did not affect trees, snags, or understory vegetation cover. Of 30 bird species monitored, 4 were affected negatively and 2 were affected positively by burning. Population densities of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus), and Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina) declined incrementally in response to repeated burning and did not recover within 1 year after burning, suggesting a lag time in response to the changes in habitat conditions. Densities of Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) fluctuated among years in the control units, but remained low in the burned units. Densities of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and Eastern Wood-Pewees (Contopus virens) increased in response to burning, but these increases were apparent only after several years of repeated burning. In general, burning resulted in short-term reductions in the suitability of habitat for ground- and low-shrub-nesting birds, but it improved habitat for ground- and aerial-foraging birds. Overall, there were no changes in the composition of the breeding-bird community. Total breeding bird population levels were also unaffected by burning. Our results suggest that prescribed burning applied on a long-term basis or across large spatial scales is likely to have adverse effects on ground- and low-shrub-nesting bird species, but other changes in the composition of the breeding-bird community are likely to be minimal as long as the closed-canopy forest structure is maintained within the context of prescribed burning.

Caterpillar abundance, caterpillar body mass and the resultant leaf damage were compared between a plot with nest-boxes and a plot without nest-boxes within the same forest. First, the installation of nest-boxes led to an increase in the breeding population of insectivorous birds. Second, the present study reports experimental evidence, under natural conditions, that a high breeding-bird density depresses the numbers of free-living defoliating caterpillars. Third, caterpillars reached significantly lower body masses in the nest-box plot than in the control plot. Finally, caterpillar damage to oak leaves was significantly less in the nest-box plot compared with the control plot. Therefore, the installation of nest-boxes is an effective means of decreasing insect damage to oak leaves. These results suggest that breeding-bird predation (the third trophic level) can be important in the regulation of interactions between oak and caterpillars (the first and second trophic levels, respectively).

Snag surveys were used to described habitat, and both breeding bird surveys and nest surveys were used to characterize the bird community. Stands with the medium snag density treatment had the highest abundance, species richness, and nesting population of cavity nesters. The reasons for this may be: 1) snags were not evenly distributed within a stand such that both clumped and dispersed snag density habitats were interspersed in this treatment, and 2) a greater proportion of ponderosa pine snags in medium density treatments may have attracted species that prefer ponderosa pine for nesting and foraging. Ponderosa pine was preferred for nest sites and large snags (> 48 cm dbh) provided nesting habitat for more species than smaller snags. However, smaller snags were used for nesting and foraging by some species.

Shawn									Restoration Ecology		2001	September, 2001	9	3	253-261	253	261	English	print					1	11	To restore habitat is to restore the functional aspects of a place where one or more species are intended to live. However, habitat restored with the right structural elements can still fail to support the species due to insufficient space and spatial contiguity (e.g., movement corridors) with nearby habitat. The spatial extent of habitat determines its capacity to support various demographic units, such as a breeding pair of individuals, a true population, or a metapopulation. In scatter-plots of published density estimates and their corresponding study area sizes, I found consistent patterns that appeared to represent spatial scale domains, in which subpopulations, populations, and multiple populations exist for each species. These spatial scale domains can help guide habitat restoration by indicating the minimum area needed to support a population. The effectiveness of restored habitat, considered alone or in combination with existing habitat, should be judged by the habitat's capacity to sustain a functioning population, which includes the population's membership in a metapopulation. Additionally, the evidence increasingly demonstrates that habitat must include sufficient space for the population(s) to periodically relocate as resources are depleted locally. The spatial extent of proposed habitat restoration can now be linked to the likely demographic unit of the species that can be supported there. I provide two examples of proposed habitat conservation and their likely effectiveness based on their spatial areas.	Smallwood, K.

Todd									Wildlife Society Bulletin		2001	Fall, 2001	29	3	956-966	956	966	English	print					3	20	The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) is well adapted to fire-maintained pine ecosystems of the southeastern United States. Management practices vary greatly among land ownerships. In some wilderness areas and state parks, a "no management" policy has eliminated use of prescribed fire, artificial cavities, and woodpecker translocation, tools that have proved effective elsewhere in recovering woodpecker populations. We compared forests with essentially "no management" to actively managed forests of similar tree ages and similar red-cockaded woodpecker population demographics. We also compared sites that had received no management in the past to the same sites after management. In every case, populations in forests that did not use state-of-the-art management for woodpeckers declined severely compared to those in managed forests. Because managed forests typically used all available management techniques concurrently, it was not possible to separate and rank effectiveness of specific management activities. One exception was the Wade Tract in Georgia, where prescribed fire was the primary activity for herbaceous layer and hardwood management in a high-density, stable woodpecker population. Wilderness areas, which are intended to be pristine places that preserve biodiversity, are losing red-cockaded woodpeckers, a keystone species in the ecosystem, at an alarming rate. Collectively, 9 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers were present in 4 wilderness areas in Texas national forests in 1983. At the close of the millennium, only one woodpecker group remained and its continued existence is unlikely without management. The very fragmented features of present-day landscapes and intervention by humans impair the effectiveness of natural disturbance processes, primarily growing-season fire, that historically produced and maintained open pine savannas with grass-forb herbaceous layers in the pre-Columbian forests of the southeastern U.S.; therefore, active management must be used if the red-cockaded woodpecker is to persist.

We investigated how terrestrial bird communities varied with different land management practices (levels of grazing by domestic livestock and extent of clearing) and with habitat quality on the floodplains of the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers. Bird community composition in ungrazed and lightly grazed sites was significantly different to that in more heavily grazed sites, and these differences were related to tree and shrub cover, as well as tree species diversity and abundance of standing dead trees. Grazing appeared to have an effect on bird communities separate from that caused by clearing. Indicator species were identified for the effects of grazing and clearing. Grazing by livestock has had negative impacts on riparian birds through degradation of habitat quality. A combination of lower stocking rates, strategic placement of off-river watering points for stock, and the introduction of rotational grazing practices may be used to restore riparian habitat quality. The grazing-sensitive species we identified could be used as indicator species for the success of rehabilitation efforts.

Bird Study		2001	July, 2001	48	2	159-172	159	172	English	print					0	14	Habitat associations of Meadow Pipits breeding in British upland 1 km and 10 km squares were investigated using data from the British Trust for Ornithology's (BTO) Breeding Bird Survey (BBS, 1994-97), The New Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland 1988-1991 and habitat data from the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology's (ITE) Land Cover Survey (1994). Meadow Pipit density was highest in 200 m sections of BBS 1 km transects containing unenclosed grass moor, heather and bog, but there was no difference in Meadow Pipit density between these habitat types. Meadow Pipit density (number of individuals per 1 km square) increased with heather cover up to about 7.5 200 m sections (of ten per 1 km square) of heather, but fell thereafter. There was a positive association between Meadow Pipit density and the extent of grass moor cover. The ITE Land Cover data gave results that were consistent with the BBS habitat data at both the 1 km and 10 km square scale. There was a non-linear relationship between hill grass cover and Meadow Pipit abundance, which reached a maximum when hill grass covered between 40% and 60% of a square. Our results suggest that a mosaic of heather, bog and grassland may be the optimum habitat for Meadow Pipits. Recent changes in land management practices may have led to the disapperance or degradation of these mosaics in some areas. Meadow Pipits are widespread and easily counted. We suggest that this species might be a useful bioindicator of changes in heather and grassland ratios that result from land management practices such as grazing and rotational burning, though further research is required.

The objectives were to compare the diversity and relative abundance of amphibians and reptiles between the ROW and the adjacent forest, among five treatment units on the ROW, and between wire and borders zones on treatments on the ROW. Eight species were observed during the study, and the two most common species were Jefferson salamanders (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) and redback salamanders (Plethodon cinereus). All eight species were noted on the ROW, but only Jefferson and redback salamanders occurred in the adjacent forest. The number of species ranged from six species in the mowing plus herbicide unit to three each in the stem-foliage spray and foliage spray units. All species were found in the wire zones compared to only five species in the border zones. The ROW contained a greater diversity of amphibian and reptile species than the adjacent forest. Because forest-management practices can have negative impacts on populations of amphibians and reptiles, this study provides valuable information on forest-management practices required for the conservation of amphibians and reptiles.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2001	July, 2001	65	3	450-460	450	460	English	print					2	21	In the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, flood control has led to a drastic reduction in the area of forest habitat and altered the patchwork of forest cover types. Silvicultural management of the remaining fragmented forests has changed to reflect the altered hydrology of the forests, current economic conditions of the area, and demand for forest products. Because forest type and silvicultural management impact forest birds, differences in avian productivity within these forests directly impact bird conservation. To assist in conservation planning, we evaluated daily nest survival, nest predation rates, and brood parasitism rates of forest birds in relation to different forest cover types and silvicultural management strategies within this floodplain. Within bottomland hardwood forests, nest success of blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea, 13%), eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus, 28%), indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea, 18%), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis, 22%), and yellow-billed cuckoo (Cocyzus americanus, 18%) did not differ from that within intensively managed cottonwood plantations. However, average daily survival of 542 open-cup nests of 19 bird species in bottomland hardwoods (0.9516 +- 0.0028, apprx27% nest success) was greater than that of 543 nests of 18 species in cottonwood plantations (0.9298 +- 0.0035, apprx15% nest success). Differences in daily nest survival rates likely resulted from a combination of differences in the predator community-particularly fire ants (Solenopsis invicta)-and a marked difference in species composition of birds breeding within these 2 forest types. At least 39% of nests in bottomland hardwood forests and 65% of nests in cottonwood plantations were depredated. Rates of parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were greater in managed cottonwoods (24%) than in bottomland hardwoods (9%). Nest success in planted cottonwood plantations for 18 species combined (apprx14%), and for yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens, 7%), eastern towhee (14%), indigo bunting (14%), and northern cardinal (17%) did not differ from nest success in cottonwood plantations that were coppiced from root sprouts following pulpwood harvest. Within bottomland hardwood forests, uneven-aged group-selection timber harvest reduced the combined daily nest survival of all species from 0.958 to 0.938, which reduced nest success by about 14%. Specifically, timber harvest reduced nest success of species that nest in the forest midstory and canopy, such as Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens)-from 32% before harvest to 14% after harvest. Conversely, those species that nest primarily in the shrubby understory-such as northern cardinal-were not affected by timber harvest and maintained an overall nest success of about 33%. Thus, birds nesting in the understory of bottomland hardwood forests are not adversely impacted by selective timber harvest, but there is a short-term reduction in nest success for birds that nest in the canopy and midstory.

Forest Ecology and Management		2001	30 June, 2001	147	2-3	217-243	217	243	English	print					2	33	We made counts of 42 bird species at 217 points in 44 jack pine Pinus banksiana stands in the boreal region of north-central Saskatchewan, Canada because of concerns about the impact of forestry on avian biodiversity. Using multivariate analyses we describe the main patterns of bird species abundance and composition in relation to local habitat variables. According to canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), 17 of 43 explanatory variables accounted for significant variation in the bird species matrix: stand age, tamarack Larix laricina canopy cover, percentage shrub Alnus glutinosa, canopy closure (6-30%), percentage herbs, maximum canopy height, percentage shrub Alnus viridis, percentage moss, percentage shrub Betula nana, minimum and mean shrub height, percentage litter, white birch Betula papyrifera canopy cover, white spruce Picea glauca canopy cover, mean canopy height, canopy closure (71-100%), and zero shrub canopy closure. Habitat and stand identity (clustering of sites within stands) explained 55.5% of the total variation; 16.3% was unique to habitat alone (29.4% of the total variance explained - TVE) and 17.2% (31.0% TVE) was shared with stand identity. Stand identity accounted for 22.0% (39.6% TVE) of the variation. Neotropical migrants associated with "overmature" mixed-wood stands included Cape May Dendroica tigrina, bay-breasted D. castanea and Tennessee Vermivora peregrina warblers. Conversely, orange-crowned V. celata, palm D. palmarum, and Nashville V. ruficapilla warblers were found in young stands. The presence of several Neotropical migrants was associated with mixed-wood attributes (ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus with aspen, red-eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus with shrub alder, and Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus with canopy white birch). Jack pine stands older than commercial rotation age must be maintained in a managed landscape because their bird communities differ from younger stands. Because of the limited avian diversity in pure jack pine stands, sufficient mixed-wood stands must be regenerated to sustain populations of characteristic bird species. We recommend that jack pine mixed-woods be managed using shelterwood or selective cuts, and that rotation age of some stands be increased. Without the extensive fires necessary for regeneration, cutting patterns at the landscape level should approximate natural disturbance patches both in size and frequency of disturbance.

Litter volume on and near the ground was estimated on a nine-point scale during 1994 to 1999. The relative importance of management type (rotational burning, rotational haying, or a combination of both) and litter volume on relative abundance was analysed for three declining grassland songbirds: Henslow's Sparrow Ammodramus henslowii, Grasshopper Sparrow A. savannarum, and Dickcissel Spiza americana. Haying resulted in significantly higher abundance than burning for all species except Dickcissel, for which few significant management effects were detected. Henslow's Sparrow increased in abundance from light to heavy litter, Grasshopper Sparrow peaked in low to intermediate litter, and Dickcissel showed little pattern relative to litter. Litter scores recorded in each management type increased with number of years since last treatment. Although litter profoundly affected bird abundance, independent and equally important was whether that litter was obtained via haying or burning. Greater consistency among years in hayed vegetation structure may help explain these birds' preference for haying over burning or haying+burning. Rotational haying should be employed more than burning in the management of these declining birds, especially for the sharply declining, fire-sensitive Henslow's and Grasshopper Sparrows.

Conservation Biology		2001	June, 2001	15	3	675-684	675	684	English	print					1	16	In southcentral Florida, where agricultural lands are being converted rapidly to urban development, much of the remaining nonurban habitat occurs on privately owned cattle ranches. We studied the Crested Caracara (Caracara cheriway), a threatened bird of prey, to learn the role of private lands in sustaining the population. We investigated patterns of distribution and reproductive activity of breeding pairs of caracaras in relation to patterns of land ownership and use. Eighty-two percent of 73 active nest sites found were on privately owned cattle ranches. We rarely found breeding pairs on publicly owned lands, most of which are managed as natural areas (no agricultural production and limited livestock grazing) to support native plant and animal communities. In 46 breeding areas with 4 years of known histories of occupancy and reproduction, pairs nesting on lands where the major land use was cattle ranching exhibited higher rates of breeding-area occupancy, attempted breeding during more years, initiated egg laying earlier, exhibited higher nesting success, and attempted a second brood after successfully fledging a first brood more often than pairs nesting on lands managed as natural areas. Compositional analysis suggested nonrandom selection of habitats by breeding pairs of caracaras in their establishment of a home range in the current landscape of southcentral Florida. Compared with random areas and available habitat in the overall study area, caracara home ranges had higher proportions of improved pasture and lower proportions of forest, woodland, oak scrub, and marsh. Which management activities favor and do not favor caracaras is uncertain, and hypotheses should be formulated and tested to guide future conservation applications. Particular grazing and fire management practices on privately and publicly owned lands may affect the structure of vegetation and prey communities in ways that influence caracaras. Or, replacement of native by exotic grasses may retain structurally suitable plant communities, whereas fertilization and grazing may increase productivity and nutrient cycling in ways that favor caracaras. Given continued conversion of natural habitats and agricultural lands to urban development, it is important to recognize that cattle ranches may provide important resources for wildlife conservation. Although cattle ranching is not likely to benefit all species historically associated with the native prairie ecosystem in Florida, finding ways to retain this land use may be important for the conservation of Florida's population of Crested Caracaras and other organisms of Florida's dry prairies.

Twenty-six bird species were observed in terraces. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and dickcissels (Spiza americana) were most abundant, accounting for 58% of the total bird abundance. Bird abundance in terraces (x = 463.0 birds/100 ha, SE = 33.0) was less than that in other strip-cover habitats such as grassed waterways and roadsides, but greater than that in rowcrops. Five species nested in terraces. We found 64.8 nests/10 ha of which 76% were red-winged blackbird nests. Predation resulted in failure of 73% of all nests. The relative contribution of terraces to grassland bird conservation is minor, and changes in current terrace management practices would not likely improve conditions for birds nor be economical.

With the dramatic loss of riparian habitats, restoring them has become a priority among conservation practitioners. Diversity and density of avian species tend to increase following riparian restoration, but little is known about how restored habitats function to meet particular species' needs. Habitat structure is an important factor affecting species diversity and density and can influence nest-site selection and reproductive success. To evaluate habitat restoration, we examined interactions between habitat structure, nest-site selection, and nesting success in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) nesting in restored, mature, and young naturally regenerating stands of riparian forest. We found that stand types differed markedly in structure, and that habitat structure influenced both nest-site selection and rates of nest loss to predation. Comparison of habitat structure among the three stand types indicated that restored stands offered fewer acceptable nest sites and poorer protection from nest predation. Concordant with those differences in habitat structure, Song Sparrows showed trends toward less density in restored stands than in mature forest, and had poorer nesting success as a result of predation.

One hundred and thirty one sampling trips were made to four areas of Everglades National Park (Shark Valley, Chekika, Long Pine Key (LPK), and Flamingo). Species-month curves indicate that the sampling effort resulted in capture of most of the flower-visiting animal species in the park. A total of 143 insects and 1 bird species were recorded. Diptera were the most diverse group (55 spp.), followed by Lepidoptera (42 spp.) and non-apoid Hymenoptera (34 spp.). The majority of species were rare (56% of species were found on fewer than five trips). The highest diversity of species was found from January to May during the peak flowering period in some plant communities. The greatest total diversity was found in Long Pine Key and Shark Valley had the lowest diversity. Chekika and Flamingo were intermediate in diversity. Animals visited 178 plant species, apprx26% of the potentially animal pollinated Angiosperm diversity of the park. Twenty-five species of plants had only non-apoid flower visitors; the majority of these species had only visits by Lepidoptera. Potentially important pollinator species include members of the Syrphidae, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. However, many of the flower-visiting species may not be effective pollinators.

The abundance of meadow pipits appears to be a good indicator of the breeding density of hen harriers on moorland managed for red grouse in Scotland. High densities of hen harriers can limit grouse populations at low density and reduce shooting bags, with repercussions for grouse moor management and conservation. We therefore examined the habitat characteristics of managed grouse moors, asking whether changes in vegetation could alter the ratio of pipits, and thus harriers, to grouse. 2. We examined grouse abundance and habitat on 69 sites of 1 km2 in upland Britain, of which pipit abundance was studied on 36. Similar data were collected on 73 sites of 25 ha within the Langholm estate in south-west Scotland, in order to make a within-estate and among-moor comparison. 3. The distribution of pipit abundance on the Langholm estate was similar to that seen in the extensive among-moor study. Pipit and grouse abundance were related to habitat in similar ways in the two data sets. 4. Pipits were the most frequent passerine, but their abundance was not related to grouse abundance. Pipit abundance declined with increasing muirburn and heather, but increased with grass cover. In a linear regression model Calluna, Sphagnum and muirburn cover accounted for 42% of the variation in pipit abundance across Britain. 5. Grouse abundance was influenced by the regional location of the grouse moor and to a lesser extent by its altitude. There were more grouse on English moors with less patchy habitats. Bird species declined with increasing Calluna and Sphagnum cover and habitat patchiness. Bird species diversity increased from west to east and on moors with more muirburn. 6. This study provides evidence that meadow pipits are influenced by habitat characteristics on moorland managed for grouse. This work also illustrates how habitat management may be able to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts: long-term increases in heather cover and management of this habitat by muirburn on grouse moors may reduce pipit numbers and thus reduce the ratio of hen harriers to grouse. However, the effects of such vegetation change on other components of the upland bird assemblage requires further investigation.	Smith, A.

Banko, Paul C.; David, Reginald E.; Jacobi, James D.; Banko, Winston E.									Studies in Avian Biology		2001	16 March, 2001		22	359-376	359	376	English	print					1	19	Populations of endemic Hawaiian birds declined catastrophically following the colonization of the islands by Polynesians and later cultures. Extinction is still occurring, and recovery programs are urgently needed to prevent the disappearance of many other species. Programs to recover the endemic avifauna incorporate a variety of conceptual and practical approaches that are constrained by biological, financial, social, and legal factors. Avian recovery is difficult to implement in Hawai'i because a variety of challenging biological factors limit bird populations. Hawaiian birds are threatened by alien predatory mammals, introduced mosquitoes that transmit diseases, alien invertebrate parasites and predators that reduce invertebrate food resources, and alien animals and plants that destroy and alter habitats. Life in the remote Hawaiian Archipelago has imposed other biological constraints to avian recovery, including limited geographical distributions and small population sizes. Recovery of the endemic avifauna is also challenging because resources are insufficient to mitigate the many complex, interacting factors that limit populations. Decisions must be made for allocating limited resources to species teetering on the brink of extinction and those in decline. If funds are spent primarily on saving the rarest species, more abundant species will decline and become more difficult to recover. However, critically rare species will disappear if efforts are directed mainly towards restoring species that are declining but not in immediate danger of becoming extinct. Determining priorities is difficult also because management is needed both to supplement bird populations and to restore habitats of many species. Rare species cannot respond quickly to management efforts intended only to improve habitat and reduce limiting factors. Recovery is slow, if it occurs at all, because years or decades are generally required for habitat rehabilitation and because small populations of birds initially increase slowly even when habitat conditions are favorable. Consequently, even as habitat conditions begin to improve, small populations may disappear unless they are supplemented directly. Hawaiian bird conservation is also affected by social and legal factors, including hunting alien game species, commercial land use practices, and lawsuits and policies concerning endangered species and critical habitat. Influenced by this mixture of conflicting and competing issues, Hawaiian bird recovery programs range from management of single species and some components of their habitats to limited forms of community or ecosystem management. Although the effectiveness of most programs is difficult to evaluate because of monitoring limitations, several programs exemplify species and community management. Programs primarily intended to recover single species include Hawaiian Goose or Nene (Branta sandvicensis), Hawaiian Crow or 'Alala (Corvus hawaiiensis), and Palila (Loxioides bailleui). Programs attempting to manage entire communities of forest birds include Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge and Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park on Hawai'i, and Waikamoi Preserve, Hanawi Natural Area Reserve, and Haleakala National Park on Maui.

Bird Study		2001	March, 2001	48	1	2-17	2	17	English	print					0	24	This paper presents the results of the BTO/RSPB survey of breeding Northern Lapwings Vanellus vanellus in England and Wales carried out in 1998. Numbers of breeding Lapwings and land-use types were recorded by volunteers in 1312 randomly selected tetrads using identical methods to those adopted in a previous survey in 1987. The results suggest a population of 62 923 breeding pairs (95% confidence intervals 55 268 to 74 499), representing a 49% decline in 11 years. The declines were greatest in southwest England and Wales, resulting in a marked contraction in range. Both arable and pastoral farmland was found to be important for Lapwings, highlighting their vulnerability to changes in a range of agricultural systems. Recent major changes in land management practices, including the switch from spring to autumn sowing and the conversion of rough to intensively managed, improved grassland is likely to have reduced both the area and the suitability of these habitats for Lapwings. Grassland within arable areas is known to provide important chick rearing habitat, and spring tillage with adjacent grassland was significantly more likely to hold Lapwings than spring tillage that did not abut grass fields. The prevalence of grass and spring tillage fields in close proximity has declined in recent years with the loss of traditional mixed farming and the polarization of pastoral systems in the west of Britain and arable in the east. The implications of these results for the conservation of Lapwings are discussed and it is recommended that, in the light of the scale of the decline recorded, Lapwings should be afforded much higher conservation priority in Britain than they are at present. The range contraction has resulted in high numbers being concentrated on reserves, highlighting the importance of sensitive management of these areas for this species. However, wider countryside measures should also be considered, such as specific options within agri-environment schemes, designed to enhance farmland habitats for Lapwings.

The diverse woodpecker community of lowland dipterocarp forests in Peninsular Malaysia was investigated in a forest selectively logged 40 y ago and in adjacent primary forest at Pasoh Forest Reserve (PFR). Line transects were conducted at dawn and dusk in each forest type to document potential differences in the woodpecker communities in logged vs. unlogged forest. A total of 121 woodpeckers were recorded along transects, including 14 of the 15 species known to occur at PFR. Eleven species were encountered in logged forest, 12 species were encountered in primary forest, and nine species were found at both sites. A significant difference in the overall woodpecker community between the two forest types was found. Of the most common species, Meiglyptes tristis, Reinwardtipicus validus and Dryocopus javensis were significantly more common in primary forest. Only one species, Picus mentalis, was significantly more abundant in logged forest. Possible causes for the differences observed are discussed.	Styring, A.

Wildlife Society Bulletin		2001	Spring, 2001	29	1	218-231	218	231	English	print					1	12	Coastal wetlands in the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain commonly are managed intensively by fall or winter burning and constructing impoundments to improve habitat for wintering waterfowl, reduce wetland loss, and create emergent wetlands. However, little information is available on effects of these management practices on plant or bird communities during summer. We conducted experimental burns in 4 types of impounded and unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Louisiana. We recorded vegetation characteristics and species composition and relative abundance of plants and birds during April-June 1996-1998. We found that vegetation characteristics in burned marshes did not differ from those of unburned marshes by the first summer post-burn and that winter burning did not affect bird species richness or species composition. Birds/survey for all species combined and for sparrows (primarily seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus)) did not differ between burned and unburned marshes during the first or third summers post-burn, but were 2 times greater in burned than in unburned marshes during the second summer post-burn. Our results indicate that winter burning for waterfowl is compatible with management for other marsh birds, provided that measures ensuring sufficient winter cover for passerines are included in management plans. Number of icterids/survey was greatest and sparrows/survey was least in intermediate impounded marshes compared to other marsh-management types. Sparrows generally were most abundant in brackish and saline unimpounded marshes, indicating that continued loss of unimpounded marsh habitat could impact coastal sparrow populations.

The objectives of this paper were to explore the implications of landscape change and wildfires in a region of northwestern Portugal for the diversity of breeding birds. Land use cover for the years 1958, 1968, 1983 and 1995 was obtained from aerial photography for a study area of 3700 ha. Breeding bird assemblages in each of six land use categories were characterized in 1998 using point counts. The main landscape changes in the study area across the 40 years were a decrease in the area of agricultural land and low shrublands (respectively 29% and 48%) and an increase in forests and tall shrublands (both over 95%). Bird assemblages showed increased richness and diversity across the gradient: low shrublands fwdarw tall shrublands fwdarw conifer fwdarw mixed fwdarw deciduous fwdarw agricultural areas. Many of the species with narrow niche breadth (specialists) were associated with agricultural areas and deciduous forests. In spite of the low diversity of burned areas (mostly shrublands) a few specialist species depend on this habitat. Thus, the current fire regime probably contributes to maintaining bird diversity at the landscape level. There was an inverse relationship between landscape diversity and estimated bird diversity across the last 40 years. Landscape management actions to preserve bird diversity should focus on the maintenance of agricultural land and deciduous forests. In parallel, a wider use of prescribed burning and grazing is suggested. This would contribute to maintaining low shrublands in the landscape, useful both as an habitat for some bird species and as fuel breaks for preventing the occurrence of large wildfires.

Enhancing wildlife habitat has become an explicit objective of existing agricultural policy. Thus, there is renewed focus on field borders and the use of shelterbelt agroforestry systems to achieve conservation goals in the Midwest. Two Representative Farms - a 283-ha dryland and 510-ha irrigated farm were created in Saunders County, Nebraska. The Habitat Analysis and Modeling System (HAMS) was used to describe the composition and spatial pattern of the existing farms and surrounding landscape, as well as for the landscapes surrounding selected Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. Simulated land use changes resulting from the implementation of two shelterbelt scenarios, Agricultural and Wildlife, were incorporated on each Representative Farm and surrounding landscape. Landscape variables which influence breeding bird species richness and community composition as determined from BBS routes were measured on simulated farm landscapes. A more heterogeneous landscape results from implementing either scenario. The percent total woods was a significant determinant of bird species richness on the BBS routes and was important in influencing bird communities at the farm- and landscape-level. Other landscape metrics which influenced the bird community composition on BBS routes were woody edge percentages and edge density values. Policies promoting shelterbelts create edge habitats which ultimately favor birds within the Forest-edge/generalist guild while bird species in need of conservation such as grassland-field species would potentially be negatively affected.

Ecology (Washington D C)		2001	January, 2001	82	1	219-231	219	231	English	print					2	35	Preferences for foraging in particular tree species have been well documented in a variety of bird species, but underlying reasons remain little investigated. Understanding the causal bases for such patterns of habitat use can help to elucidate mechanisms of habitat selection and, therefore, community organization and structure. I experimentally tested the hypothesis that fine-scale foliage structure of two deciduous tree species influences the foraging behavior of three small, insectivorous bird species. On sugar maple (Acer saccharum), with its orbicular levels elevated above the branch, Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens) and American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) captured prey predominantly from lower leaf surfaces, whereas Black-throated Green Warblers (Dendroica virens) captured prey predominantly from upper leaf surfaces. In contrast, on yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), with its oblong-ovate leaves held within the plane of the supporting branch, all three bird species captured prey disproportionately from upper leaf surfaces. Overall, aerial maneuvers were used more frequently to capture prey from upper than from lower leaf surfaces on sugar maple, but the opposite occurred on yellow birch, where non-aerial maneuvers were used more frequently to capture prey from upper than from lower leaf surfaces. Those results indicate that the leaf surface from which prey are more easily captured (with less energetically costly non-aerial maneuvers) differs between those tree species. Experimental manipulation of leaf dispersion and distance to prey demonstrated that leaf dispersion is the chief determinant of prey capture location (upper vs. lower leaf surfaces), and that distance to prey is the chief determinant of prey capture maneuver (aerial vs. non-aerial). When foraging on artificial branches in which vertical distance between branches was systematically increased experimentally, Black-throated Green Warblers captured a significantly smaller proportion of prey from lower surfaces of leaves on the upper branch than did Black-throated Blue Warblers. Taken together, these results indicate that different tree species, as well as different locations within tree species, present insectivorous birds with distinct foraging environments and, therefore, constitute distinct foraging microhabitats. Furthermore, even closely related bird species that are generally similar morphologically respond in behaviorally unique ways to differences in foliage structure. For those reasons, forest management practices that enhance tree species diversity could concomitantly enhance foraging opportunities (niche diversity) for forest insectivores and may thus help to promote high bird species diversity and maintain abundant populations.

Plant Biosystems		2001		135	2	207-212	207	212	English	print					0	1	Intuitively, biological diversity would apparently seem the most unambiguous and easily studied of ecological concepts. However, when we look for a suitable numerical definition, we find that no single diversity index adequately summarizes community structure. One reason for this drawback is that different diversity indices confound the qualities of species richness and dominance concentration in a single number. Consequently, the characterization of community diversity can be substantially improved by substituting a parametric index family for traditional diversity indices. While traditional diversity indices supply point descriptions of community structure, according to parametric diversity indices, there is a continuum of possible diversity measures, which differ only in their sensitivity to the presence of rare species in the formulation of the indices. In this paper we first summarize the role of Renyi's generalized information for parametric biodiversity characterization. Then, we show that Renyi's generalized information can be expressed as a simple linear combination of the information associated to species richness and dominance concentration. Raunkiaer's life-form spectra of a Mediterranean garrigue in southern France one year and five years after fire are used to clarify the ideas discussed.

Nilsson, Sven G.; Hedin, Jonas; Niklasson, Mats									Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research Supplement		2001			3	10-26	10	26	English	print					1	45	We review species richness in major organism groups, mainly using examples from northern Europe. A high proportion of these species is forest living, and large numbers are dependent on decaying wood. Biodiversity can be assessed at various scales using two different principles. One is to use features, such as ancient and dead trees, known to be important for a large number of species. The other method is to choose species or groups of species known to indicate high biodiversity or presence of many red-listed species. We argue that any serious biodiversity assessment method should include the most species rich organism groups, for example insects. In the present paper we point out the most important features for high biodiversity (old trees and large dead trees), and review the quantities of these features in near-virgin forests. The natural disturbance regime of a region should be the basis for defining a suitable scale and the appropriate features for biodiversity assessment. Possible indicator species for high biodiversity in northern Europe are suggested, based on previous investigations. Among epiphytic lichens and wood-living beetles there are many potentially useful species in addition to vascular plants in the nemoral forest. Among vertebrates, woodpeckers and grouses seem to be the most useful. Validation tests for indicator structures and species are largely lacking but urgently needed. The implications of possible delayed local extinctions are important to bear in mind when managing for sustainable forestry. The knowledge of forest history is useful when developing cost-efficient measures.

Martin, Tara G.; Catterall, Carla P.									Wildlife Research		2001		28	1	17-31	17	31	English	print					2	9	This study investigated the effects of habitat clearance and fragmentation on birds of coastal heathlands in subtropical eastern Australia. Abundance and species composition were compared among two types of cleared habitat (residential suburbs and sugar cane cropland) and four sizes of heathland remnant (1-2 ha, 5-10 ha, 20-50 ha and >500 ha) in summer and winter. Cleared land contained a distinctly different bird species assemblage from heathland remnants. Residential sites contained a distinct suite of species consistent with that described for 'open/developed land' habitat elsewhere in the region. In contrast, cane cropland supported very few species. Heathland remnants >500 ha contained high densities of 'natural-vegetation-dependent' species, whereas species of open/developed land were absent. Remnants of 1-2 ha had lowered densities of many natural-vegetation-dependent species, and a relatively high abundance of open/developed land species. Some of the avifaunal differences in the >500-ha remnants and 5-50-ha range are probably due to confounding of remnant size with habitat, resulting from selective clearing of the landscape. Most of the heathland birds were intolerant of the matrix habitat (residential and cane cropland), but tolerant of decreased remnant area, down to a threshold of about 5 ha. However, the distinctive floristic associations of heathland vegetation are dependent on an environmental regime (low nutrient, low pH, fire, in some cases inundation) that is unlikely to persist in remnants tens of hectares in size, and longer-term declines in heathland birds, are predicted.

We studied avian foraging behavior and patterns of occurrence in the highly fragmented agricultural landscape of the Kellerberrin district of Western Australia to better understand the factors underlying species declines and losses. We conducted three surveys of 30 wandoo woodland patches that ranged in size from 1.3 to 101.3 ha. Some patches were part of larger remnants of native vegetation, ranging in size from 3.5 to 1204.8 ha and including other habitat types. We examined the extent to which patterns of species richness, the occurrence and composition of foraging guilds, and the occurrence of individual species varied with features of woodland patches, remnants, and the surrounding landscape. Using multiple regression analyses, the best model for species richness included terms for the log of remnant area, the patch diversity of each remnant, and woodland patch condition. We delineated eight foraging guilds based on similarities in the substrate/method dimension and also using multidimensional scaling analyses. The best model for the number of foraging guilds present in a patch included a single variable representing shrub density. Analyses of nestedness based on guilds and on individual species were both significant; and for the latter, 11 of 13 species made a significant contribution to the overall pattern. We derived separate models for the occurrence of each of eight species and one guild using multiple logistic regression. Significant models included, either separately or in combination, the following variables: the log of remnant area, patch area, the total area of woodland in a remnant, and the distance to other woodland patches. For four species that had sufficient records to examine shifts in foraging behavior, we observed significant differences in both foraging methods and substrates with changes in remnant size and/or the presence of other species or guilds. Our analyses indicated that remnant area was the best single variable for measures of community structure, in part because it was strongly correlated with other variables, such as total woodland area, patch area, remnant patch diversity, number of corridor connections, and measures of isolation. For foraging guilds and for individual species, variables other than remnant area assumed greater importance. The strong patterns of nestedness for foraging guilds by remnant area may reflect the diminished availability of certain prey items in small, degraded remnants. This notion is reinforced by the relatively high species and guild richness recorded in small patches that were either fenced from grazing or embedded in large remnants. The nested pattern of species within some foraging guilds, however, indicates the importance of additional aspects of their ecology. A focus on richness alone may mask the unique responses of bird species to fragmentation and may divert attention from important considerations in the development of land-use policy and reserve acquisition.

We use examples from contemporary studies in eastern deciduous forests. Scientific methods, observational versus experimental studies, replication and randomization, choice of factors and models, and response variables are important elements in designing research approaches that address effects of forest management. There are significant gaps in our knowledge on the effects of forest management on birds. Many studies have addressed effects of management on species abundance, but we can make only limited inferences from most of these. The design of studies is complicated because of the range of forest management practices, variation in bird species responses, differences among forest types, and the effects of confounding factors such as landscape effects. Few studies have addressed effects of forest management on the reproductive success of forest songbirds. We believe the reliability of our knowledge in this area will be improved most quickly if we use current knowledge to generate hypotheses, use a mix of well-designed observational and manipulative experiments to test them, and more frequently measure reproductive success in addition to bird abundance.

However, human-induced disturbances in the last several decades have destroyed most of the valued vegetation. Diversity loss and environmental degradation have been a serious problem. It has been pressing and difficult work to restore and rehabilitate the evergreen broad-leaved forests. In China, although numerous studies dealing with the artificial rehabilitation have been carried out, the effect on conservation and restoration of biological diversity has been found to be ineffective due to restricted tree selection. Few studies have undertaken natural regeneration and floristic diversity restoration. The present study was conducted in the secondary and primary subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests at an altitude 1 500 - 1 900 m in Mt. Wawushan National Forest Park of the southwestern China. In order to assess effects of natural recovery and conservation of species diversity, we investigated the secondary and primary vegetation and comparatively analyzed their floristic composition by adopting plot survey method and specimen collection. After 42 years of natural recovery, the secondary vegetation showed complicated species diversity, common floristic characteristics, similar woody plant composition and community phsiognomy with the primary vegetation, and the rare and endangered plants in the primary broad-leaved forest had returned and were conserved successfully. This implies that natural recovery is a very effective and rapid pathway to restore the destroyed evergreen broad-leaved forest and biological diversity. Accordingly, composition and characteristics of floristic diversity could act as one effective indicator to assess and judge the effect of ecological restoration. The difference of floristic composition exiting between the primary and the secondary forest, failed to be distinguished by analysis and comparison of genera/family floristic distribution pattern, hinting that the floristic distribution pattern may be ineffective for indicating and evaluating difference of both actual and similar vegetation. However, when comparing flora property and floristic zonation, it may be feasible for substituting secondary vegetation for primary vegetation in case of scarce of primary vegetation.

One hundred and twenty-eight species were present during the spring and 103 species in autumn. The majority of these species were migrants (103 species in spring and 89 species in autumn) and the majority of these were Nearctic/Neotropical species (73 species in spring and 66 species in autumn). The diet of these migrants was more variable than expected. Many insectivorous species were observed to consume seeds, fruit and nectar as well as insects. Because of these varied diets, many species serve as seed dispersers, occasional pollinators and important predators of herbivorus insects. Wooded areas were found to be important in providing food, cover and water for migrating species. A review of historical changes in the landscape of this area is presented and management practices designed to restore wooded habitat to this area are proposed.	Barrow, Wylie C., Jr.; U. S.

To determine the effects this harvesting strategy might have on communities of breeding forest birds, we conducted point counts in young forests regenerated from clear-cutting (15-25 years), and mature (50-60 years), and old (80-110 years) forests regenerated from fire. Avian species richness was highest in old stands at the point-count station, forest stand, and landscape level. Increased species richness with forest age was associated with increases in the relative abundance of canopy- and cavity-nesting species. At local scales (station and stand), species richness of ground- and shrub-nesting birds was similar among forest age-classes. However, as determined by rarefaction analyses appropriate at the landscape scale, ground-nesting species were more common in young and old forests, while shrub-nesting species were more common in young and mature forests. Density of deciduous shrubs was an important factor influencing the abundance of species like American redstart, Canada warbler, and chestnut-sided warbler. An increase in conifer in old stands resulted in greater use by conifer- or mixedwood associated species such as bay-breasted warbler, magnolia warbler, and ruby-crowned kinglet. Our data indicate that vegetation and structural characteristics such as shrub density should be considered when prescribing sustainable forestry objectives.	Hobson, K.

Clearcutting on Pennsylvania state forests recently has been replaced by a new forest-management practice termed even-aged reproduction stands with reservation guidelines (hereafter, EAR stands), in which high densities of trees in multiple crown and size classes (101 live trees/ ha +-28 SE on study sites) of both commercially and non-commercially important tree species are permanently reserved to maintain species and structural diversity. We compared habitat structure and breeding-bird communities between EAR stands (harvested) and reference stands (unharvested) in 2 state forests of Pennsylvania in 1997-98 and related bird abundance within harvested stands to differences in habitat characteristics among EAR stands and the surrounding landscapes. Total abundance of all bird species combined, abundances of early-successional and edge-habitat guilds, and abundances of many early-successional bird species were significantly higher in EAR stands than in reference stands, but abundances of the forest habitat guild and of 8 forest-associated species were lower in EAR stands. Although EAR stands provide suitable habitat for bird species associated with early-successional forests, abundances of species associated with mature forests were lower in EAR stands than in reference stands despite retention of residual trees. However, some species of forest birds (e.g., red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceus)), which usually are absent from recent clearcut stands until 12-20 years post-harvest, were often detected in EAR stands. Thus, residual trees in EAR stands provide to forest birds habitat components that are generally lacking in clearcut stands. Because abundances of both forest habitat and forest-canopy nesting guilds declined and abundance of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) increased with size of EAR stands (especially when >20 ha), managers should consider limiting the size of EAR stands.

Prescribed fires were set in 1993 and 1995 in a mature hardwood forest in southern Indiana, USA, to reduce shade-tolerant understory woody vegetation and thereby increase the abundance and diversity of ground layer vegetation and seedlings of tree species that require moderate light levels (e.g., Quercus L. spp.). The objective of this study was to determine if prescribed fires reduced the abundance or reproductive success of ground- and shrub-nesting Neotropical migrant bird species. The burned area and an adjacent unburned area were studied during the summers of 1996 and 1997. An unlimited-radius point count method was used to determine relative abundance. Nests were monitored to determine fledging success. Vegetation structure was quantified at nest sites and at random points to assess fire effects and bird nest-site selection. Abundance of birds in this nesting guild was greater in the unburned area during both years. The greatest difference in abundance was for ovenbird (Seiurus aurocappilus Linnaeus). The probability of nest success for all bird species in this nesting guild combined, determined by the Mayfield method, was significantly lower in the burned area (0.125) than in the unburned area (0.291). Abundance of the brood parasite brown-headed cowbird (Molothus ater Boddaert) did not differ between burned and unburned areas. However, the probability of nest success for parasitized nests (0.140) was lower than that of unparasitized nests (0.735). The mean number of host young fledged from successful nests was significantly lower in parasitized nests (1.3) than from unparasitized nests (3.0). Prescribed fires significantly reduced vegetative cover in the burned area. Nest sites in the burned area had higher vegetative cover than random points, indicating that birds may have selected nest sites that were less affected by the fire. While prescribed fires that burn in a "natural" hit-or-miss pattern may retain nesting habitat for bird species in this nesting guild, lower nest success in the burned area indicates that management for desirable vegetation and for this nesting guild may not be compatible within the same forest stand at the same time. This argues for planning at a landscape level to attain objectives for both vegetation composition and maintenance of bird species diversity.

Army Corps of Engineers has managed and irrigated 440 ha along the lower Snake River in Washington as mitigation for four dams constructed 1962-1975. We investigated avian use of irrigated Habitat Management Units (HMUs), compared to non-irrigated sites and streams that entered the river. We conducted bird surveys at 25 sites in summer and fall 1997 and in spring 1998. We compared avian abundance, species richness, and species diversity among habitats and seasons. We detected an average of 169 birds and 33 species at HMUs, 120 birds and 28 species at non-irrigated sites, and 63 birds and 23 species along streams in all three seasons. We detected an average of 29 species/site in summer, 31 in fall, and 22 in spring. Species diversity, as measured by the Shannon-Wiener function, was higher in summer, indicating that large flocks of a few species were common in fall and spring. These data demonstrated that the lower Snake River is an important stopover site for migrating birds. We detected an average of 30 more bird species than a study conducted on the same area in 1974. The increase in species richness is attributed to the development of HMUs and to natural succession of palustrine vegetation since dam construction. Future potential changes in reservoir levels, such as breaching of dams, will undoubtedly affect bird communities along the lower Snake River in all seasons. However, our data demonstrated that habitat perturbations can be partially mitigated by habitat enhancement and management.

Whitlock near Wilson Inlet in the period 1905-19 (mostly 1907, 1909 and 1910), hitherto unpublished, were collated from museum specimens and archives. Whitlock noted 94 species comprising 65 landbirds, 10 waterbirds, 7 seabirds, and 12 non-breeding waders. Records of bird species made by other ornithologists from 1889 to 1913 indicate that the original avifauna of this region comprised 81 landbird species. In the past century four of these species (Burhinus grallarius, Pezoporus wallicus, Atrichornis clamosus and Dasyornis longirostris), as well as the waterbird Ixobrychus flavicollis, appear to have become locally extinct. Deforestation for agricultural development, with the subsequent creation of parkland and pasture, has allowed 10 landbird and 8 waterbird species to colonize the area. Whitlock's records of the seabird species Eudyptula minor and Pterodroma macroptera nesting on islands in Wilson Inlet are otherwise unreported in the literature. A comprehensive synthesis of eyewitness accounts of Aboriginal burning practices in the period 1791-1840 indicates that anthropogenic fire was frequent, prevalent in summer, and spatially extensive but in patches varying in area from c. 10-2000 ha, with a tendency for riparian vegetation to be burnt less often than uplands. Such fires could be set at the hottest part of the day, with multiple ignitions on the one day, and under windy conditions. Three bird species that are sensitive to frequent fire and now considered to be extinct locally are presumed to have had patchy distributions confined to those limited parts of the landscape naturally protected from frequent burning (vegetation along higher order streams, on steep south-facing slopes, or surrounded by expanses of granite). In addition, some of these sites may have had totemic significance to Aborigines and were thus protected from more intense or frequent fire by periodic burning using low intensity fire in spring, late autumn or early winter. The vulnerability of naturally insularized populations to inappropriate intensity or frequency of fire may explain the early demise of these species following European settlement. Few other parts of Western Australia have an avifauna so well documented at a time when agricultural development had only recently commenced. The Denmark area would therefore provide an appropriate focal region for documenting ongoing environmental change as indicated by the avifauna.

We surveyed birds from a range of patch sizes (1 to >3000 live residual trees), at four ages (2, 15, 30, 60 years), following two disturbance types (harvest, fire) in mixedwood boreal forest. Bird communities varied among patch sizes, forest ages, and disturbance types. Immediately post-disturbance, bird communities from large patches (>100 residual trees) were more similar to those from old forest than were communities from small patches (ltoreq10 residual trees). Birds that nest or forage in open or riparian habitats had highest densities in small patches 2 years post-harvest, whereas birds that nest in large snags had highest densities in small patches 2 years post-fire. Throughout the chronosequence following both disturbance types, birds from small patches became more similar to those from old forest. Birds that nest and forage in small trees and shrubs were common 15 and 30 years post-disturbance, and generalist forest birds were common 60 years post-disturbance. Birds associated with old forest were present in all patch sizes 15, 30, and 60 years post-disturbance, although larger patches had higher densities of these species.

Conservation Biology		2000	August, 2000	14	4	941-950	941	950	English	print					13	271	The conservation of biological diversity has become one of the important goals of managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. Ecologists and forest resource managers need measures to judge the success or failure of management regimes designed to sustain biological diversity. The relationships between potential indicator species and total biodiversity are not well established. Carefully designed studies are required to test relationships between the presence and abundance of potential indicator species and other taxa and the maintenance of critical ecosystem processes in forests. Other indicators of biological diversity in forests, in addition or as alternatives to indicator species, include what we call structure-based indicators. These are stand-level and landscape-level (spatial) features of forests such as stand structural complexity and plant species composition, connectivity, and heterogeneity. Although the adoption of practices to sustain (or recreate) key characteristics of forest ecosystems appear intuitively sensible and broadly consistent with current knowledge, information is lacking to determine whether such stand- and landscape-level features of forests will serve as successful indices of (and help conserve) biodiversity. Given our limited knowledge of both indicator species and structure-based indicators, we advocate the following four approaches to enhance biodiversity conservation in forests: (1) establish biodiversity priority areas (e.g., reserves) managed primarily for the conservation of biological diversity; (2) within production forests, apply structure-based indicators including structural complexity, connectivity, and heterogeneity; (3) using multiple conservation strategies at multiple spatial scales, spread out risk in wood production forests; and (4) adopt an adaptive management approach to test the validity of structure-based indices of biological diversity by treating management practices as experiments. These approaches would aim to provide new knowledge to managers and improve the effectiveness of current management strategies.

The stands were of even age (6 - 300 yr), stocked with the first or second tree generation after wildfire. The view of Siren and several authors after him, that the vegetation of old-growth boreal Picea forests is homogeneous on a broad scale, was examined by applying, in parallel, the partial variants of two ordination methods (DCA and PCA) to Siren's vegetation data. Two main vegetation gradients were found: a major gradient running from recently burnt plots with prominence of pioneer species to plots with stand age > 100 yr, a well stocked tree layer and a thick humus layer, dominance of feather-mosses and ample occurrence of shade-tolerant as well as light-preferring vascular plant species, and a second gradient along which first- and second-generation plots segregate. The more prominent element of Betula trees in first- than in second-generation stands < 100 yr contributed to the latter. A minor third gradient related to humus-layer thickness was recovered by partial DCA only. The main vegetation gradient reappeared in separate ordinations of data from 47 mature forest stands (> 100 yr), but without being correlated with forest age. Variation among mature-forest stands in the importance of pioneer species is considered mainly to be brought about by fine-scale disturbance processes such as tree uprooting. Increasing importance of factors operating on within-stand scales (development of a varied gap structure and stronger gradients in tree influence (radiation at ground level), soil moisture, soil depth and nutrient availability) with time is also reflected in the second and third mature-forest ordination axes. Possible implications of the results for conservation of biological diversity and monitoring of changes in boreal forests are discussed.

Forest Ecology and Management		2000	1 June, 2000	131	1-3	1-21	1	21	English	print					2	24	The impact of logging operations on bird species abundance and diversity was studied over an eight-year period using a variable-circular plot bird survey procedure and a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design in karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forest in south-western Australia. The magnitude and spatial extent of impact was assessed from sample points in five bands parallel to the edge between clearfelled areas and mature forest (unburnt-forest, burnt-forest, forest-edge, gap-edge and gap). A total of 24 748 birds of 53 species were detected within 30 m of the observer during the study. Bird species abundance, and diversity, were similar in the five bands prior to treatment, and observed differences could be attributed to spatial patterns of flowering in the overstorey. Following logging, 19 of the 40 species that were detected more than five times showed changes in relative abundance (including both, increases and decreases) in one or more bands. Gaps showed the greatest number of significant changes (15) and these were typically of the greatest magnitude over the four years studied post-treatment. Gap-edges showed fewer changes (six), while both, the burnt-forest (three) and forest-edge (nil) bands showed few changes in relative abundance. Both, the number of species detected (for a given sampling effort), and species diversity declined in gap and gap-edge bands following logging. Nevertheless, variation in bird counts between successive seasons and years necessitates considerable replication before changes can be reliably assigned to disturbance impacts. In addition, the long period before maturation of the overstorey suggests that the local impact of logging and burning is likely to extend well beyond the life of experimental studies. Our results support the implementation of a well-dispersed system of retained mature forest along road, river and stream zones within the regeneration mosaic.

Grasslands make up most of alvar vegetation. The extent of these grasslands decreases because of bush enchroachment which takes place in most alvars when traditional land use practice changes, notably when grazing is ceased. The main threat for the alvar grassland is formed by the rapid expansion of Juniperus communis and Potentilla fruticosa in dry and wet sites, respectively. Applied research has been carried out during several years in order to develop plans for the restoration of alvar grassland. Thus it was shown that species richness in areas with a mixture of grassland and shrubland decreases in relation to the increased cover by shrubs. In the case of Juniperus there is a distinct drop in species number as soon as the cover exceeds 75-80%, while the decrease is more gradual with increased cover of Potentilla. The seed banks under dense stands of these shrubs only contain ca. 20% of the species found in dry and wet alvar meadows. This was confirmed by clearing experiments. Long-term recordings have shown that establishment of juniper seedlings takes place mainly in half-open areas between already existing junipers. Intermediate-sized junipers expanded faster than old and big shrubs. Potentilla shrubs recover fast from cutting or burning. After 2-4 yr they have almost attained their former size. This recovery can be prevented when cattle grazing is introduced. In the framework of a local alvar restoration project on Oland, covering 7000 ha, grazing regimes are re-established, fences erected and large-scale clearings carried out. Recently established juniper shrubs are being cleared, intermediate sized junipers (30 - 50 yr old) are selectively removed while creating a mosaic landscape with high biological diversity. Older dense juniper stands are left alone or are only partly cleared. Potentilla stands in moist areas are cut to create moist meadows which are breeding grounds for waders, and to establish corridors between remaining open areas. Three items are discussed (1) the importance of the Stora Alvar area; (2) re-introduction of grazing and (3) re-introduction of species. The outstanding importance of the area regarding species richness and endemism should be recognized through a 'golden list' to be used along with red and blue lists.

In the virgin forest remnant the proportion of canopy gaps is smaller, there are no stands in the developmental phase of a pole stand (10 < cm d.b.h. < 30 cm), and both the growing stock and the proportion of less vigorous trees are considerably greater. In addition, there is a higher percentage of dead trees, a smaller proportion of minor tree species and a considerably lower diversity of plants. The diversity of bird species is similar for each forest type, but rare bird species are confined to the virgin forest remnant. The biological differences between the two types of forest have led to changes in the physical site conditions. The results of the research are valuable in assessing the consequences of near-to-nature forest management.

It is not always clear, however, if spatial and temporal variability leads to instability in communities. Instability may result from strong biotic interactions or from stochastic processes acting on small populations. I used 10-15 yr of annual data from the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research site to examine whether plant, breeding bird, grasshopper, and small mammal communities in tallgrass prairie exhibit stability or directional change in response to different experimentally induced fire frequencies. Based on ordination and ANOVA, plant and grasshopper communities on annually burned sites differed significantly from plant and grasshopper communities on less frequently burned sites. Breeding birds and small mammals differed among sites as well, but these differences were not dearly related to disturbance frequency. A modified time series analysis indicated that plant communities were undergoing directional change (unstable) on all watersheds, regardless of fire frequency. Contrary to expectations, directional change was greatest on the annually burned sites and lowest on the infrequently burned sites. Unlike the plant communities, breeding bird, grasshopper, and small mammal communities were temporally stable, despite high-compositional variability from 1 yr to the next. Stability among the consumer communities within these dynamic plant communities occurs because three-dimensional vegetation structure does not change over time, despite changes in plant species composition. Evidence suggests that instability in the plant community results from strong biotic interactions among temporally persistent core species and stochastic dynamics among infrequent satellite species. Overall, community stability cannot be assessed if the pattern of temporal dynamics is unknown. Long-term empirical studies of different taxa under different disturbance regimes are needed to determine over what time frames and spatial scales communities may be stable. Such studies are essential for the development of generalities regarding the relationship between disturbance frequency and community stability in terrestrial and aquatic systems.

Females occupied nest holes in March-April, after which two or three eggs are laid. Although cooperative breeding is suspected for the genus, at two nests no helpers were recorded. Nest-concealment behaviour was observed in the adult male. After a nestling period of 55-58 days, the adult female and one juvenile left the nest simultaneously. Immature birds resemble their respective sex. Nest site characteristics of 24 nests of the Tarictic Hornbill and two of the Writhed-billed Hornbill Aceros waldeni, respectively, were recorded on Mt Balabag, Panay Mountain Range. Tarictic Hornbill nests were situated in living as well as dead trees, at an average height of 11 m. Cavity compass direction was uniformly distributed around the circle. Nests are aggregated within the habitat, with a mean nearest-neighbour distance of 190 m. Writhed-billed Hornbills may require larger trees for nesting than Tarictic Hornbills. Nest density was calculated to be around three Tarictic Hornbill nests and 0.2-0.3 Writhed-billed Hornbill nests per square kilometre. Given a total amount of suitable hornbill habitat on Panay of 225-450 km2, about 750-1,000 Tarictic Hornbill breeding pairs and 60-100 Writhed-billed Hornbill breeding pairs may remain on Panay.

We address this issue by examining the conflict between raptor conservation and management of Red Grouse (Lagopus 1. scoticus) in Britain. Heather moorland is a distinctive habitat that supports an important assemblage of breeding birds. Large areas of moorland are managed by private landowners for shooting grouse. Although grouse shooting benefits conservation by retaining heather moorland, it is currently unclear whether grouse management directly benefits other upland birds. Human persecution has greatly restricted the range and abundance of most raptor species in Britain. Following the introduction of bird protection laws, the decline in gamekeeping, and the restriction of organochlorine pesticides, raptor populations have started to recover. Persecution of raptors on grouse moors is widespread and limits the range and abundance of Hen Harriers (Circus cyaneus), Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus), and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). In some circumstances, raptor predation can reduce both the breeding density and productivity of Red Grouse. Limitation of grouse populations through raptor predation is most likely to occur where raptors are at high density because of the abundance of alternative prey, and grouse are at low density either because of poor management or the cyclic nature of some grouse populations. In the long term, habitat management may reduce densities of alternative prey, leading to reductions in raptor densities and their predation on grouse. More active intervention may be required, however, if grouse moors are to remain viable in the short-term. Current research is focused on manipulating harder diet through diversionary feeding. Complementary research is needed to investigate methods to reduce raptor numbers locally while ensuring their national status.

Environmental Management		2000		26	Supplement 1	S85-S96	S85	S96	English	print					2	59	Extensive acreage loss of coastal sage scrub (CSS), isolation of surviving stands, and the federal listing of several animal species with obligate relationships to this plant community, particularly the threatened California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica), have led to attempts to create CSS to mitigate habitat lost to urban development and other causes. Many of these creations lie within habitat conservation plan (HCP) sites, and they could play a more prominent role by being repositories for plants taken from a single site having site-specific genetics. Among others, one technique that increases initial resemblance to natural stands uses digitized, to-scale photography, which has been ground-truthed to verify vascular plant associations, which appear as mosaics on a landscape. A combination of placing patches of salvaged, mature canopy plants within larger matrices of imprinted or container plant plots appears to significantly enhance immediate use by CSS obligate bird species, accelerate "spread" or expansion of CSS, and can also introduce many epiphytic taxa that otherwise would be slow or unable to occupy developing CSS creations. Reptile, amphibian, butterfly, and rodent diversity in a salvaged canopy restoration case study at the University of California, Irvine, showed CSS species foraging and inhabiting transplanted canopy patches. Using restoration techniques to expand existing CSS stands has more promise than creating isolated patches, and the creation of canopies resembling CSS mid-fire cycle stands is now common. Gnatcatchers and other birds use restorations for foraging and occasional nesting, and in some cases created stands along "biological corridors" appear to be useful to bird movement. Patches of transplanted sage scrub shrubs along habitat edges appear to break up linear edge effects. There are no data on which long-term survival, succession, or postfire behavior can be predicted for CSS restoration sites, and postfire community changes are not part of either mitigation or restoration planning at present. Long-term planning including burning is needed so that a fire-adapted habitat will develop. Restoration is important in retaining genetic resources, for ameliorating edge effects, as habitat extenders in buffer zones around HCP sites, and by providing areas into which natural stands can expand.

We conducted a 4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning and forest thinning on breeding wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR) in Georgia. We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates, and apparent annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry, and mist netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities (P = 0.25); wood thrush density ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/10 ha. No radiomarked male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4 years, but female weekly survival was 0.981 +- 0.014 (SE) for females (n = 63) and 0.976 +- 0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual adult survival was 0.579 (SE = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed burning did not reduce adult or juvenile survival during the breeding season or apparent annual adult survival. Annual population growth (lambda) at PNWR was 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.32-1.63), and the considerable uncertainty in this prediction underscores the need for long-term monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants. Population growth increased on experimental compartments after the burn and thin (95% CI before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05), while control compartment lambda declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after = 0.87-0.92). We found no evidence that the current management regime at PNWR, designed to improve red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat, negatively affected wood thrushes.

In Quebec, where the boreal forest is largely dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands, we surveyed 140 point-count stations in 3 postlogging and 4 postfire development stages determined according to the height of the regenerating spruce trees. Species richness did not vary among forest development stages, but bird abundance was higher in recent clearcuts. Recently disturbed areas were characterized by open-land bird assemblages dominated by Neotropical migrants, which reached their highest abundance in clearcuts. Moreover, logged stands were distinguished from burned sites by the absence of cavity-nesting birds. Forest-bird assemblages reestablished themselves as soon as young spruces reached the sapling stage. However, the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), and Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) were restricted to mature stands or recent burns and are thus likely to be negatively affected by modern forestry, which involves fire suppression and short logging rotations. We suggest that retention of larger areas of continuous mature forest might be essential to maintain these species in managed regions.

Regent Honeyeaters were found in 24 of the 93 transects, at a density of 0.09 birds/ha. Most were found in box-ironbark woodland (34% of 62 sites), with single records from box-gum woodland, box-stringybark woodland and dry plateau complex woodland. No Regent Honeyeaters were found in riparian gallery forest during censuses, but they were found breeding there at other times. All habitats contained a high density of birds, compared to other wooded regions in southern Australia, with riparian gallery forest and box-ironbark woodland being particularly rich in species and numbers. These habitats had greater flowering indices, larger trees and more mistletoes than other habitats. Sites used by Regent Honeyeaters supported significantly more birds and bird species than unoccupied sites. The region supports a total of 193 species, four of which are nationally threatened and seven which are threatened in New South Wales. The richness of the bird community in the region is partly because it retains a higher proportion of native vegetation cover (43%) than many other parts of rural Australia. Protection and rehabilitation of box-ironbark woodland and riparian gallery forest is of high priority in a regional conservation plan. However, all habitats in the Bundarra-Barraba region should be protected from clearing and degradation, because they are also used at times by Regent Honeyeaters and support a wide range of bird species. Wise management should retain many sensitive bird species that have disappeared from or declined in other regions of southeastern Australia.

The communal area has twice the recommended stocking rate of sheep and goats, and has less perennial plant cover and more annual plants than neighbouring commercial rangelands. Commercial rangelands supported a larger and more diverse assemblage of small mammals and birds. Small mammal species composition on communal lands was a subset of that on adjacent commercial rangelands, with only one species equally abundant in both treatments. Diurnal mammals were scarce in communal rangelands, apparently due to the lack of cover for predator avoidance and herbivory. Management to maintain a diversity of small mammals requires a minimum level of effective cover. Bird richness and diversity was also reduced on communal rangelands, with many species, especially insectivores, less abundant. A few bird species, notably granivores, were more abundant on communal rangelands, probably because of the increase in annual plant cover. The absence of some large bird species regularly found in Namaqualand, but absent from both treatments (e.g., bustards), suggests that neither management practice is optimal.	Joubert, D. F.; Ryan, P.

A database was assembled from 272 published and unpublished bird lists, and this was supplemented with records extracted from a systematic search of the primary ornithological literature. In excess of 7 000 records were located. The original forest avifauna (just before the impact of European settlers became pronounced) consisted of 112 breeding species (81 land, 31 water). Salient characteristics of this avifauna include: only 1 species is confined (as a breeding species) to the primaeval forest ecosystem; 53 species occur throughout the forests; 32 and 13 species are restricted to its eastern or southern portions respectively; most species occur extensively outside of the forests (66 species to the west, north, east and south; 33 species to the west, north and east); 52 per cent of landbird species are insectivores; about 20 per cent of the landbird fauna migrates from the forest in varying degrees in winter; 67 per cent of landbird species nest in the overstorey or understorey; and landbirds in streamside forests occur at higher densities than in upland forests. The distribution of 5 species - Leipoa ocellata (Malleefowl), Cacatua pastinator (Western long-billed corella), Atrichornis clamosus (Noisy scrub-bird), Falcunculus frontatus (Crested shrike-tit) and Rallus pectoralis (Lewin's rail) - is discussed in detail, with new or neglected information being provided. The landbird fauna of the primaeval forest is impoverished relative to elsewhere in the South West Land Division, particularly the region now known as the wheatbelt. The forests of south-west Western Australia have only about half of the number of bird species present in a similar-sized, comparable area in south-east Australia. The south-west forest avifauna is more similar to that present in the Mount Lofty Ranges (South Australia) than to the forest avifaunas of New South Wales or Tasmania. At local scales (1-100 ha), however, the number of landbird species present is similar in all forests in southern mainland Australia (20-25 breeding species). Overall density of bird populations in jarrah and karri forests is about one half of that in comparable forests in south-east Australia. Disturbances caused by European settlement have resulted in 4 species present in the primal forests contracting in geographical range, 2 species becoming extinct, and more than 90 species benefiting from provision of new habitats. Forest management has had limited impact on biodiversity and total abundance of birds. Prescribed burning under moist soil conditions has no impact on bird species richness in jarrah forest, but increases bird species richness in karri forest for 3-6 years. Total abundance of birds increases in both types of forest after prescribed burning. Planned burning under dry soil conditions increases both bird species richness and total abundance of birds. Wildfire reduces bird species richness. All of these changes are temporary. Thinning of jarrah forest does not change bird species richness, whereas cutting to gaps increases bird species richness. Clearfelling of karri forest initially reduces bird species richness; 12 years later about 85 per cent of the avifauna in mature stands is present in regrowth karri forest. Those species dependent on large hollows for nesting are unlikely to nest in unthinned regrowth forest younger than about 120 years. Open-cut mining for bauxite has a severe initial impact on bird species richness, but following rehabilitation there is a rapid return of bird species, with 85 per cent of species present before mining being recorded after 5 years. Species requiring large hollows for nesting cannot, however, nest in rehabilitated sites for many decades. The most severe, long term reduction in local bird species richness and total abundance is caused by dieback disease and by permanent removal of forest as in agriculture, urbanization, damming of rivers, and plantations of pine. However, an additional 75 species (51 land, 24 water) have been recorded within the forests following clearing for farming and towns. Of these species, 23 (17 land, 6 water) now breed, but only two of them (Aquila morphnoides Little eagle, Dacelo novaeguineae Laughing kookaburra) breed in forest. The policies and procedures in place to mitigate the impact of humans on the forest bird fauna and to promote the conservation of bird species are summarized. These include an extensive mosaic of protected areas (national parks, nature reserves, forest along roads, rivers and streams), a structural goal of 40 per cent of the forest being maintained at the mature or senescent stage, the retention of habitat trees for species dependent on hollows for nesting, and spatially and temporally diversified use of fire. Much of the ornithological literature about forest management impacts in the south-west forests was found to be based on misconceptions about, or lack of awareness of, silvicultural and fire science, policies and prescriptions. The erroneous impressions thus created are discussed. Available empirical data and other information synthesized in this review present a strong challenge to the proponents of fire and logging as causes of long term detrimental change in the forest avifauna. Several bird species are proposed for consideration as suitable indicators of ecologically sustainable forest management. The paper concludes with numerous suggestions for further research.

Therefore, we examined bird-habitat relationships on mixed-grass prairie at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in northwestern North Dakota, where prescribed fire has been used as a habitat management tool since the 1970s. We sampled bird abundance on upland prairie at 310 point count locations during 1993 and 1994 breeding seasons. We also measured vegetation structure and composition at each location. Complete fire histories were available for each point, with over 80% having been burned one to four times in the previous 15 years. Post-fire succession generally transformed vegetation structure from short, sparse, and grassy with few forbs and low litter immediately after fire, to increasing and moderate amounts of forbs, litter, and shrubs two to eight years postfire, to tall, dense, shrubby prairie with little forb, grass, or litter understory when fire was absent (>80 years). Most grassland birds (six of nine species examined) at Lostwood NWR were absent from prairie untreated with fire. Species richness and abundances of Baird's Sparrows (Ammodramus bairdii), Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum), Le Conte's Sparrows (A. leconteii), Sprague's Pipits (Anthus spragueii), and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) were positively related to an index of amount of fire, and these species were absent from unburned units. In contrast, Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) and Clay-colored Sparrows (Spizella pallida) both reached highest abundance on unburned prairie. To provide maximum grassland bird diversity, managers of mesic, mixed-grass prairie generally should provide areas with short (2-4 year), moderate (5-7 year), and long (8-10 year, or more) fire return intervals. Because long-term rest may create habitat unfavorable for most species of grassland passerines in mesic, northern mixed prairie, periodic defoliations by disturbances such as fire should be considered essential to restore and maintain native biodiversity.

Population numbers seem to have fluctuated. In the 1920s and 1930s a local decrease was recorded, followed by an increase in the 1940s. From the 1950s on, a nationwide and devastating long term decrease set in, resulting in a breeding range contraction (figure 2) and severely depleted breeding numbers. At its nadir, around 1985-86, the Dutch breeding population consisted of only 80-140 pairs (table 1). Since then, numbers have slightly recovered to some 210-230 pairs in 1995-96, mainly restricted to the easternmost parts of the country (figure 3). This partial recovery is mainly due to a strong increase in breeding numbers in the Bargerveen, a peat moor reserve (2000 ha) in the province of Drenthe, in the NE-Netherlands. Numbers here have grown from 9 breeding pairs in 1982 to 145 pairs in 1996 (figure 4). In most other areas numbers have continued to decrease, to the point of near-extinction (e.g. in the coastal dune area and on the Wadden islands, in former times important breeding areas). In a few inland areas, almost exclusively situated along the eastern border or at the Veluwe (central Netherlands), numbers have stabilised and in some cases small numbers have reoccupied, sometimes only temporarily, area lost in the past. The strong decrease of the Dutch breeding population in the past has probably mainly been caused by agricultural changes resulting in habitat loss and food shortage. The increasing numbers in the Bargerveen coincide with the start of habitat management with the purpose of peat moor regeneration and resulting in great insect diversity and abundance. A row of rather dry and warm summers may have been favourable and contributed to the increase (figure 5). The future chances of Red-backed Shrike in farmland in The Netherlands are thought to be marginal, although small scale experiments in farmland reserves have sometimes resulted in a come-back of the species as a breeding bird. In nature reserves, chances are thought to be better. The Bargerveen example proves that creation of mosaic like habitats with all kinds of variations in soil moisture and vegetation succession may be promising. Feeding conditions seem to be one of the key-factors for establishment of Red-backed Shrike populations at the moment. As a consequence, restoration of insect diversity will be of utmost importance.

In the northern and eastern parts of Europe, however, this species-rich habitat is still relatively common, albeit in a phase of rapid loss. To halt this decline the Swedish government started a large-scale subsidy scheme for the management and restoration of semi-natural pastures mainly aimed at increasing botanical values. We compared and contrasted the current management prescriptions with habitat preferences of 23 farmland bird species breeding in 88 dry semi-natural pastures in south-central Sweden. Semi-natural pastures showed very high breeding densities of several farmland birds underlining the importance of this habitat to the conservation of farmland birds. A TWINSPAN classification of all birds identified two groups of pastures with different bird communities. Eleven (48%) of the bird species were significantly more common in a group of pastures situated in open farmland, while only five (22%) species occurred in higher densities in pastures characterised by a high proportion of forest along the borders. Fifteen (83%) of the 18 species occurring in both pasture groups showed significant habitat-abundance relationships related to the management of semi-natural pastures, although in different directions and to different extents. Our results suggest that many farmland bird species require two important factors for their choice of breeding habitat, namely safe nest sites close to good foraging areas. Both factors are partly under the control of farmers and should be invoked in conservation strategies since many farmland birds are declining across Europe. To benefit the conservation of farmland birds in Sweden one should, in contrast to the present botanical-based subsidy scheme, retain gtoreq 10% cover of shrubs within pastures and preferentially select pastures in open farmland (i.e. potentially safer nesting sites with better food conditions) for restoration and management plans.

We investigated the impacts of burning aspen-dominated habitats on landbird community structure in the western foothills of the Wind River Range, Wyoming. Habitat structure, breeding bird species composition, richness, and relative abundance were compared in 1994 and 1995 between six independent pairs of sites, each pair consisting of a recently burned aspen site and a control site. Burned sites typically had lower canopy cover and depth, greater snag densities and aspen regeneration, and less shrub growth. We observed 45 diurnal woodland bird species overall. Western Wood-Pewees (Contopus sordidulus) and Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus) were detected significantly less often in the burned sites, while Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) and Pine Siskins (Carduelis pinus) were detected significantly more often in the burned sites. Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivoracelata), Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), and chickadees (Poecile spp.) were significantly less abundant in the burned aspen when burn size or year was factored into the analysis. For many other commonly detected species, we had relatively low power to detect meaningful differences in abundance between recently burned and unburned aspen stands. Bird species richness was similar between treatments. Bird species composition differed consistently among burned-control pairs, but our data suggested that intersite variability in species composition in aspen is the norm in the absence of burning.

Twenty-eight stands of Appalachian pine-oak forest were surveyed of which 14 were managed for red-cockaded woodpeckers (RCWs). Management involved removal of midstories (2.5-17.5 cm dbh) and repeated prescribed burns. Results indicate that these management practices appear to have effects similar to that of timber harvests on species composition and abundance of breeding birds. Prescriptions for RCWs were beneficial to several species associated with early successional and edge habitat, including at least some neotropical migrants whose numbers are decreasing in eastern North America (e.g., indigo bunting, hooded warbler, and prairie warbler). Management for RCWs appears to decrease habitat quality for other neotropical migrants, particularly those associated with forest interiors.

Many of these marshes are managed intensively through a combination of fall/winter burning and construction of impoundments to improve wintering waterfowl habitat, reduce wetland loss, and create emergent wetlands. Little information is available on effects of this management on wintering birds, particularly passerines. We conducted experimental burns in impounded and unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwest Louisiana and recorded species composition and abundance of birds during the 1996 and 1997 winters. We found that burning and impoundment influenced vegetation structure, which in turn influenced bird abundance and species composition. Blackbirds (Icteridae) preferred recently burned plots. Sparrows (Emberizidae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) avoided recently burned plots but recolonized these plots after one year of vegetation recovery. Sparrows and wrens present in burned plots during the first winter following burning generally were observed in scattered patches of unburned vegetation. Suitability of Chenier Plain marshes as winter habitat for several bird species was reduced during the winter in which burning was conducted, particularly if a high proportion of the plot was burned. We recommend that patchy burns be used, at both the landscape level and within specific burned areas, to achieve management objectives and still provide suitable winter habitat for non-target species. Although many groups of birds depend on Chenier Plain marshes for winter habitat, these groups differ in their specific habitat requirements. We recommend that a diverse wetland complex (e.g., impoundments managed for waterfowl foraging habitat interspersed with those managed for passerine winter cover) be maintained.

Wildlife Society Bulletin		1999	Fall, 1999	27	3	810-822	810	822	English	print					0	24	Within the range of the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), the only bird species endemic to Florida, there was a need for a population risk assessment that considered the impacts of declining habitat availability and declining fire frequency associated with rapid human population expansion. We developed a population risk model to examine influence of population size, catastrophes (epidemics and hurricanes), and habitat management scenarios on Florida scrub-jay populations. Extinction risk declined rapidly when initial population sizes increased from 20 to 100 breeding pairs. Hurricanes increased extinction risk for coastal populations by 10-30% compared to inland populations. Our results suggested that habitat in poor condition was unlikely to support a population for more than a few decades. Poor habitat quality conditions were common throughout the species' range because of fire suppression or inadequate fire management. Habitat management was more effective than habitat restoration because population recovery occurred slowly after restoration and only if habitat was restored to optimal conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed that fecundity and survival of experienced breeders without helpers (adult nonbreeders) were the most important model parameters. Slow recovery rates occurred because helpers were the only rapid source of colonists in restored habitat and because an absence of helpers reduced breeder survival and fecundity. Small population sizes and habitat degradation make the Florida scrub-jay vulnerable to rangewide decline and extinction unless habitat is protected, restored, and managed to maintain optimal conditions.

Most of the 33 593 ha island is covered by mature and secondary Atlantic rainforest. Almost 80% of these forests are within the Ilhabela Park. Although the species counted have marked differences in size and weight, density (individuals/km2) and estimated population size in 23 500 ha of well-preserved forests were similar: Amazona farinosa (13.82 +- 5.94; 3247 +- 1395), Pionus maximiliani (15.79 +- 7.04; 3712 +- 1654), Brotogeris tirica (15.05 +- 4.87; 3537 +- 1143) and Pyrrhura frontalis (13.06+-5.53; 3068+-1298). Encounter rates of Forpus crassirostris and Pionopsitta pileata were very low, which suggests that there is only a small population of these species on the island. The Sao Sebastiao forests still support healthy populations of parrots. Although woodpecker population estimates on the island are large enough to provide nesting sites forparrots, competition for holes with other secondary cavity nesters such as toucans, flycatchers and tytiras, and the selective cutting of dead trees for canoe construction, which is a common practice on the island, may limit hole availability for parrots.

We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having gtoreq95% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with 1-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfirethan on postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Red-start (Setophaga ruticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of standing dead trees on the landscape.

This conflict could be mitigated by the identification of safe classes of snags, those with low rates of fall, that can be easily identified and retained in forest operations. I outline an approach to estimating rates of fall of identifiable decay classes of snags based on static life-table analysis of the current age distribution and relative abundance of classes of snags in a stand, applying the analysis to subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) snags. The two most recent classes of snags, identified by the presence of fine branches and intact bark, showed fall rates of 0.17-0.20%/yr, similar to or lower than live subalpine fir trees. Fall rates increased to 0.70%/yr for the third class of snags, identified by loss of fine branches and cracking of bark, and to 3.79% and 6.16%/yr for the fourth and fifth classes, respectively, identified by increasing loss of bark and incipient softening of outer wood. Snags in the two earliest classes could be retained during forest operations without substantial increase in risk to workers. The static life-table approach to estimating fall rates of snags can complement long-term monitoring of snags in older forests where the assumption of a stationary age distribution is met.

The elements of the decision support system are an ecological simulation model and a data management system. In boreal forests, decaying wood is important from the standpoint of biological diversity. Many organisms, such as saproxylic beetles and polypores, live in decaying wood. The structure of a forest determines which species select it as a habitat, because the habitat requirements vary between species. In this study, the stand structure includes living and dead trees, their diameter distribution by tree species and the stage of decay. Forest management strongly modifies stand structure. We used the simulation model to investigate the stand structure and databases on the habitat requirements of beetle and polypore species to assess the number of species in a stand. We tested our system with four management examples and compared the results toexperimental results. Both our study and the experimental results showed that intensive forest management decreases the number of large deciduous trees in boreal forests and therefore reduces the number of beetle and polypore species.

Environmental Management		1999	July, 1999	24	1	25-37	25	37	English	print					2	26	A rapid development and approval process was employed by Ducks Unlimited Canada and other stakeholders to restore a 1246-ha (3079-acre) northern prairie wetland in southern Alberta, Canada, with 3640 m3/day (800,000 US gallons) of municipal wastewater and beef processing wastewater. A large nongovermental organization hastened restoration with a development process that outlined restoration goals and management objectives to satisfy a dual mandate of wastewater treatment and wildlife habitat creation. In 1995, after five years of wastewater additions, the basins had been refilled and the surrounding uplands had been acquired and restored. The Frank Lake Conservation Area currently provides high-quality habitat for a variety of wildlife in a region where many of the native plants and animals species have been lost due to habitat loss and fragmentation. The success of upland and water management strategies is reflected in the increase of target species' abundance and richness: 50 shorebird species, 44 water-fowl species, 15 raptor species, and 28 other new bird species have returned to the marsh since restoration. As well, significant N and P reduction occurs as waters flow through the first basin of the marsh. The management strategies of this project that satisfied a dual mandate serve as a model to guide managers of other large-scale wetland restoration projects.

However, at times, management for threatened and endangered species precludes consideration of other species. We investigated how managing for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and biodiversity at the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, affected communities of bird species that use early-successional scrub habitat (hereafter, scrub-successional species). Management for red-cockaded woodpeckers at the SRS involved both (1) manipulating mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-wiregrass (Andropogon spp.) stands via canopy thinning, removal of midstory trees, and prescribed burning; and (2) even-aged timber harvesting. The former management practice encouraged red-cockaded woodpeckers to establish new colonies in previously unoccupied stands (hereafter, "recruitment" stands). The latter management practice is used to remove offsite planted pines and replant with preferred longleaf pines. We conducted a constant-effort mist net study in recruitment and regenerating stands (stands clearcut and planted with longleaf pine) during the breeding seasons of 1995-96. We hypothesized that the scrub-successional bird community in recruitment stands would have greater species richness and higher survival and reproductive rates per species than in regenerating stands. However, recruitment stands always had fewer scrub-successional species (1995: 36 species; 1996; 31 species) than regenerating stands (1995: 54 species; 1996: 55 species), and all species that occurred in recruitment stands also occurred in regenerating stands. Species which commonly occurred in both recruitment and regenerating stands had similar adult:juvenile ratios (P > 0.15) and relative proportion of adults in breeding condition (P > 0.05). We detected no difference in survival rates of Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis), indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), and of "combined" scrub-successional birds between stand types (P > 0.05). We found that even-aged forestry is an important management practice for maintaining and increasing avian biodiversity on public lands, as well as an acceptable management practice for red-cockaded woodpeckers.

Australian Zoologist		1999	June, 1999	31	1	11-27	11	27	English	print					0	8	A consequence of the European colonization of Australia has been a significant loss of biodiversity: one in four mammal species is either extinct or threatened. In contrast, only one species of bird has been lost from the Australian continent and there is less concern for the survival of the Australian avifauna than for mammals. This is despite the fact that nearly one in five bird species is listed as threatened or of "special concern". Moreover, a review of the status of Australian birds at local, regional, state and continental scales shows that the impact of Europeans on the avifauna is much greater than acknowledged. Over most of southern Australia entire avifaunas are threatened with extinction. When allowance is made for habitat loss and degradation, 30 to 90% of bird species across the continent have declined in abundance. The extent of this decline is that the survival of many bird species in the 21st Century is threatened. While a majority of birds in southern Australia has declined in abundance and/or distribution, others have increased. Parallel changes are proceeding in northern Australia. In terms of evaluating impact on the avifauna, an increase in numbers and a change in the composition of avian communities are as significant as the loss of populations and species. Both adversely affect patterns of continental biodiversity and are ecologically dysfunctional. Assuming that current trends continue, over the next century, significant components of the avifauna will be lost as populations proceed to extinction and the composition of avifaunas change at scales ranging from the local to the continental. The pattern of change in avian abundances, and the failure to anticipate or acknowledge the major losses of birds on the Australian continent, shows that conservation emphasis needs to shift from a species by species approach to the conservation of communities and entire avifaunas. Taken together, the scale of the changes in the distribution and abundance of Australian birds is an affirmation that present and projected patterns of human use of the Australian continent are not sustainable. Much needs to be done to reverse the decline of the terrestrial avifauna and achieve ecological sustainability in land use. The most urgent actions are to end the clearing of native vegetation, reduce grazing pressure, remove inappropriate fire regimes, control feral and native animals whose abundance threatens native species, and restore functional ecosystems, with an emphasis on native vegetation, to a minimum of 30% of the landscape. These need to be accompanied by an aggressive programme to improve water quality in fresh water habitats and restore environmental water flows, and the creation of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system across the continent irrespective of land tenure. In the absence of such action, I predict that Australia will lose half of its terrestrial bird species in the next century.

We estimated species abundance, richness, and evenness using data from 312 point counts in 18 burned sites and six unburned sites. We measured gross habitat features in 0.04-ha circles centered on each point count station. We calculated productivity estimates at nests of seven of the most common nesting species. Habitat components we measured in 1-, 2-, and 3-yr post-burn sites were similar, but most components differed between burned and unburned sites. Although 98 species were detected during point counts, we report only on the 46 species that nested in the area and were detected gtoreq10% of the counts in either habitat class. Twenty-one species preferred burned sites and six preferred unburned sites. Avian species richness and evenness were similar for burned and unburned sites. Burned sites were preferred for nesting over unburned sites. Only nine nests of six species were found in unburned sites. Productivity estimates were low in burned sites. One or more eggs hatched in only 59 of 187 nests monitored, and an average of only 0.82 chicks per nest were estimated to have fledged. Predation was the most common probable cause for nest failure, ranging from 45% in the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) to 64% in the Summer Tanager (Piranga rubra). Because the sources of predation at the refuge are unknown, future research should address this issue.

The Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry recently adopted a new forest management practice termed "even-aged reproduction stands with reservation guidelines," hereafter termed EAR stands, which is intended to replace clearcutting as the primary method of even-aged forest management. We examined wildlife communities (breeding birds and small mammals) in 16 stands (8 EAR stands and 8 reference) in central Pennsylvania from February to October 1995. Species richness and abundances of total birds,foraging guilds, and individual species did not differ (P > 0.05) between large (> 30) and small (< 20 ha) EAR stands. Bird species richness was similar between EAR and reference stands, but abundances of total birds, ground-shrub foragers, common yellowthroats (Geothylpis trichas), and chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina) were significantly higher in EAR than in reference stands. Conversely, abundances of canopy-sallier foragers and red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceus) were considerably higher (P < 0.05) in reference than EAR stands. Abundance of the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in small compared to large EAR stands but was similar between EAR and reference stands. Because of the concerns about forest fragmentation, we recommend that EAR stands be less than 40 ha in size, which is typical of those created by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry. Overstory trees and snags in EAR stands serve as important substrates for breeding birds. Furthermore, EAR guidelines promote regeneration and growth of a dense layer of vegetation near ground level, which is beneficial to wildlife.

We compared bird composition and foraging behavior during the winter in burned and unburned forests. We conducted point counts during four consecutive winters immediately following a stand replacement fire. Burned and unburned forests had similar numbers of bird species, yet species composition was distinctly different. Trunk and branch foraging species were 2.5 times more abundant in burned forest than in unburned forest. Within burned forests, trunk and branch foraging species significantly decreased from the first winter post-fire to the fourth winter post-fire. We conducted foraging observations of four woodpecker species within burned forests only. Woodpeckers used western larch (Larix occidentalis), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) snags that were greater than 23 cm in diameter. Stand replacement fires may play an important role in maintaining populations of trunk and branch foraging species in mixed coniferous forests in northeastern Washington.	Kreisel, Karen J.; 2802 W.

The WBW's home ranges were situated mostly in a sessile oak forest (proportion of sessile oaks > 80%) growing on steep slopes (> 40degree) with a higher proportion of dead trees (> 6%) and with a lower crown cover of an upper tree layer (60-80%). Mean home-range size during breeding was 8.5 ha (6.3-9.9 ha). Nestlings appeared between 25-30 April and fledglings between 20-25 May, i.e. about 2-3 weeks sooner compared to other Dendrocopos species within the study plot. During the incubation and the nestling period the adults were extremely inconspicuous, so that only two nest holes were found. Both cavities were excavated into trunks of living sessile oaks with crown defoliation less than 10% at a height of 7 and 15 m. The food of adults during the growing season consisted mostly of the Scolytidae and Cerambycidae larvae (59.7% of foraging records), that of nestlings mostly of Geometridae, Noctuidae, and Tortricidae larvae (60.5% of foraging bouts, 70.4% of prey items). Food was taken only from oaks in the upper tree layer (100% of records) from the surface of the bark and leaves (47% of records) or excavated from trunks and branches of dying and dead oaks (51% of records).

However, little is known about the use of riparian buffers by terrestrial wildlife, particularly how buffer width may affect abundance and species composition of wildlife communities. In this study, I compared bird assemblages in logged and unlogged riparian areas along headwater streams and assessed the relations between bird abundance and riparian buffer width. The abundances of 4 species of forest-associated birds that were more abundant in unlogged than in logged headwater riparian stands (Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis), brown creeper (Certhia americana), chestnut-backed chickadee (Poecile rufescens), winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes)) increased with increasing width of riparian buffers. However, 4 other species that also were more abundant in unlogged than logged riparian stands (Hammond's flycatcher (Empidonax hammondii), golden-crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa), varied thrush (Ixoreus naevius), hermit warbler (Dendroica occidentalis)) were rarely observed in even the widest buffers sampled (40-70 m on 1 side of the stream). Although riparian buffers along headwater streams are not expected to support all bird species found in unlogged riparian areas, they are likely to provide the most benefit for forest-associated bird species if they are >40 m wide, and density of large trees within buffers is not reduced by harvesting.

Although several studies have characterized the habitat requirements of breeding Henslow's Sparrows, winter habitat requirements for the species remain poorly known. The purpose of our study was to identify habitat variables associated with occupancy by Henslow's Sparrow on silvicultural lands in the core of its winter range in the Gulf Coastal Plain. Forty-one study sites were chosen on lands managed for timber production in Baldwin County, Alabama. Henslow's Sparrows selected moist sites that occurred as pitcher plant bogs or as transition areas between wet pitcher plant bogs and drier upland areas. A multiple logistic regression model identified the density of the grass Panicum verrucosum and the density of pitcher plants as the variables best able to explain the presence of Henslow's Sparrows. Sites occupied by Henslow's Sparrows had higher herbaceous vegetation densities and had been disturbed by timber harvest and/or fire more recently than unoccupied sites.

We collected pre-treatment data in 1995, burned experimental plots in January 1996, and collected post-treatment data in 1996. Data were analyzed in a randomized, complete-block design with winter-burn and control treatments replicated 3 times each within 2 blocks (i.e., herbicide and non-herbicide). Relative abundance (P = 0.246) and species richness (P = 0.622) of breeding birds were not different between treatments. Relative abundance of wintering birds was greater (P = 0.002) in burned treatments, but species richness was not different (P = 0.602). Prescribed burns on mesquite grasslands had minimal effects on bird communities in the year following treatment. We recommend maintaining unburned areas adjacent to burns to provide habitat for bird species that declined after winter prescribed burning (i.e., grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Le Conte's sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), and sedge wren (Cistothorus platensis)).

Journal of Wildlife Management		1998	Oct., 1998	62	4	1349-1358	1349	1358	English	print					0	1	Empirical studies of the effects of forestry on cavity-nesting birds largely neglect weak cavity excavators and instead focus on large, strong cavity excavators such as woodpeckers (Picidae). Weak cavity nesters tend to be smaller and may be less limited by the availability of large trees but more dependent on suitably softened wood. In this paper, we describe availability, use, and preference for nesting habitat of a small cavity-nesting bird, the red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), in mature coniferous forest in southeastern British Columbia. We describe nesting habitat at 3 spatial scales: (1) the level of forest stands proposed for logging (cutblocks), which ranged from 8.1 to 18.4 ha in size; (2) the level of 0.04-ha patches of forest centered on nest trees (nest plots); and (3) the level of individual nest trees. In addition to considering basic structural habitat features, we analyzed the relation between nesting use and several factors related to forest health, including Armillaria root disease (Armillaria ostoyae), stemwood decay, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestation, and dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.). Red-breasted nuthatches nested at higher densities on cutblocks with more dead trees (snags) and higher levels of root disease. Within nest plots, we also detected a preference for nesting in Armillaria-infected trees. Cavity nesting of nuthatches was influenced by both forest structure and the disease agents that contribute to it. We recommend that standing diseased and dead trees be retained in patches during logging operations. Retention of such trees in distinct patches more likely satisfies requirements for worker safety and for limiting the spread of diseases than does retention of single dead and diseased trees throughout cutblocks. Wildlife values not only should be incorporated into timber harvesting regulations but also should be considered when planning activities designed to improve forest health for timber production.

Journal of Wildlife Management		1998	Oct., 1998	62	4	1359-1372	1359	1372	English	print					2	50	Throughout its geographic range, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is rare and appears very similar in its foraging ecology to 2 broadly sympatric congeners, the three-toed (P. tridactylus) and hairy woodpecker (P. villosus). The purposes of our study were to test for differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek fire near Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2 years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ha. Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts, woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986. Our results suggest the black-backed woodpecker is extremely specialized in its foraging niche, exploiting outbreaks of wood-boring beetles in dying conifers for only 2-3 years after fires. Consequently, this species may be particularly vulnerable to local and regional extinction as fire suppression intensifies and programs of intensive salvage logging are pursued following fires.

In 1993-94, we studied the short-term effects of uneven-aged forest management on bird communities in oak-hickory forests of northwestern Arkansas. We estimated bird abundance in mature forests and on managed plots receiving either a heavy cutting of understory vegetation (understory treatment) or a combination of both understory cutting and selective cutting in the forest overstory (full treatment). Two nesting guilds and 7 of 14 species with adequate sample size showed significant treatment effects. Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus). Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens), and the understory-nesting guild were most abundant in mature forest. Indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), white-breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis), and eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) were more abundant on full treatment plots. Tufted titmice (Baeolophus bicolor) were most abundant on mature forest and understory treatment plots. The canopy-nesting guild was most abundant on understory and full treatment plots. Our results suggest that if removal of understory vegetation was practiced widely in the Arkansas Ozarks as part of uneven-aged management, populations of some ground- and shrub-nesting forest interior species of birds could be negatively affected, whereas a few forest canopy and edge species may respond positively. Future research on this type of uneven-aged management should examine effects of removing varying amounts of understory vegetation on both forest interior bird populations and forest regeneration.

We surveyed early-successional forests created by fire or logging for birds and their habitat during the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons. We found that overall bird species richness and number of individuals (territorial males/ha) were higher (P < 0.05) in burned forests than in logged forests. The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), house wren (Troglodytes aedon), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), Lincoln's sparrow (M. lincolnii), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were more abundant in burned areas. The Nashville warbler (Vermivora ruficapilla), chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica), black-throated green warbler (D. virens), and mourning warbler (Oporornis agilis) were present in greater numbers in the logged areas. We related these differences in bird presence and abundance to vegetation differences in the burned and logged habitat types. Burned areas had higher densities of dead trees, wider size ranges of dead trees, and greater heterogeneity in the shrub layer. Logged areas had higher densities of live trees, more live tree species, and wider size ranges of live trees. Red maple (Acer rubrum) was the live tree species found in greatest abundance in logged areas. If management goals include simulating natural disturbances like fire and maintaining bird populations, more dead trees should be left within logged habitats and the variability among logged areas should be increased.

However, it is unclear if restored systems replace the habitat functions of natural wetlands, and few direct comparisons of multiple sites have been made. Three years after restoration, we compared the relative abundance and density of birds using 18 restored wetlands and 8 natural wetlands located in northern New York. Birds were classified as wetland dependent, wetland associated, or nonwetland. Abundances of species and of individuals in all 3 groups did not differ (P > 0.05) between restored and natural wetlands in any year. Densities of species in all 3 groups were consistently but not significantly lower at restored sites. Densities of individuals in the wetland-associated category and nonwetland category were significantly lower at restored sites for the first 2 years following restoration. Bird communities were significantly less similar between restored and natural sites than among restored sites. However, many of these differences may not persist following natural successional-development of the restored sites. The long-term persistence of appropriate plant communities will determine whether or not restored sites provide bird habitat comparable to natural wetlands. The restoration program successfully increased the amount of bird habitat available in the region. However, hectare-for-hectare, the restored wetland sites did not replace the habitat functions of natural wetlands during the time period of this study.	Brown, Stephen C.; Manomet Cent.

In the southern Cascade Range in Oregon, management experiments are being installed to develop and refine silvicultural practices that increase financial returns from high-elevation stands. Pretreatment measurements are complete, and harvest treatments will begin in 1998. The harvest treatments will emphasize the most valuable products: high-quality timber, American matsutake mushrooms (Tricholoma magnivelare), and other nontimber forest products such as food-flavoring extracts, decorative boughs, Christmas trees, and pine cones. Management practices will adjust species composition, remove disease and infested trees, prune target species, manage for timber on long rotations, and opportunistically manage and harvest nontimber forest products, especially the highly valued American matsutake. A comprehensive monitoring program will track ecosystem and economic variables at different temporal scales. In this paper we present management scenarios that emphasize forest function and biological diversity while providing an even flow of commercially valuable timber and nontimber forest products.

Only some of these are able to recover unaided. Where attempts are being made to restore such forests, the scale of the attempts is usually small. Timber plantations are one of the few means by which large areas of cleared or degraded landscape can be reforested. These usually restore the productive capacity of the landscape but do little to recover biological diversity. But a number of approaches might be used to redesign such plantations so that they would both yield the timber needed to justify the investment and also contain some proportion of their former biodiversity. These approaches include using indigenous species rather than exotic species, creating species mosaics by matching species to particular sites, embedding the plantation monocultures in a matrix of intact or restored vegetation, using species mixtures rather than monocultures, or encouraging the diverse plant understories that can often develop beneath plantations. The degree of ecological restoration possible using these alternatives ranges from modest to significant, although none is likely to achieve complete restoration. Any improvements in regional biodiversity brought about by these changes might be seen as being at the expense of plantation productivity. But many of these approaches have advantages other than just restoring former biodiversity. I discuss some of the trade-offs and implications for plantation managers and restorationists.

Condor		1998	Aug., 1998	100	3	485-492	485	492	English	print					0	6	Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) is widely distributed in the Southwestern United States, where it frequently occurs in association with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Fire suppression and fuelwood harvest likely have reduced oak abundance within the pine-oak type. Gambel oak occurs in multiple age-related growth forms, from small shrubs to large, old trees, and may provide important foraging and nesting habitat for breeding birds. I compared attributes of breeding bird communities in 16 northern Arizona ponderosa pine stands from 1993-1995, that were structurally similar except for the presence or absence of Gambel oak. Overlap in bird species composition was high; pine and pineoak stands had a mean Jaccard similarity value of 0.67. Five species were unique to pine stands, whereas 10 species were largely restricted to or only found in pine-oak stands. Overall bird diversity was significantly higher in pine-oak stands, which also had more species of Neotropical migrants, ground nesters, primary cavity excavators, and secondary cavity users than did pine stands. Pine and pine-oak stands had similar species evenness and similar rates of annual species turnover. Total bird abundance did not differ between cover types; however, primary cavity excavators were more abundant in pine-oak stands. Because of the apparent positive influence of oak on breeding birds, forest managers are encouraged to use treatments that retain and enhance the various growth forms of Gambel oak found in pine-oak stands.

Fauna recolonization of rehabilitating waste dumps was rapid, particularly for Mus musculus, Smithopsis youngsoni, Varanus brevicauda and Ctenocus quattuordecimlineatus. Several waterfowl species and Zebra Finches, Magpie-larks, Whitebacked Swallows, Fairy Martins, Diamond Doves and Budgerigars benefitted from permanent water associated with the mine. Control of feral animal populations and improved fire management are highlighted as being important for maintaining the exceptional biodiversity of the Nifty area.

Based on mining history, we selected 28 sites (12 natural, 9 abandoned after blockcut extraction, and 7 abandoned after vacuum extraction) in 15 bogs. We estimated percent cover for six vegetation strata in 106 plots with 100 m radius, on which bird point counts were conducted in 1993 and 1996. Vegetation structure differed significantly between natural, post-blockcut and post-vacuum sites. While vegetation cover was almost complete in natural sites, abandoned sites, especially post vacuum, were less vegetated, even after 20 years. Bird species richness and abundance were similar in natural and post-blockcut sites and both were higher than in post-vacuum sites. Ten of the 28 species studied in detail responded to site perturbation. Among them, the Palm Warbler was most closely associated with natural sites. Bird communities were closely associated with vegetation structure. Communities of post-blockcut sites were more similar to those of natural bogs than were bird communities of post-vacuum sites. Since the blockcut method of peat mining is no longer economically feasible, we conclude that bog habitat restoration should be accompanied by a preservation "safety net" area to counteract the lasting effect of vacuum peat mining on bird species assemblages.

We measured ecosystem properties (metrics) that were clearly linked to ecosystem processes. We focused on conservation of soil and water as key processes in healthy ecosystems, and on maintenance of biodiversity and productivity as important functions of healthy ecosystems. Measurements from which indicators of rangeland health were derived included: sizes of unvegetated patches, cover and species composition of perennial grasses, cover and species composition of shrubs and herbaceous perennials, soil slaking, and abundance and species composition of the bird fauna. Indicators that provided an interpretable range of values over the gradient from irreversibly degraded sites to healthy sites included: bare patch index, cover of long-lived grasses, palatability index, and weighted soil surface stability index. Indicators for which values above a threshold may serve as an indicator of rangeland health include: cover of plant species toxic to livestock, cover of exotic species, and cover of increaser species. Several other indicator metrics were judged not sensitive nor interpretable. Examples of application of rangeland health indicators to evaluate the success of various restoration efforts supported the contention that a suite of indicators are required to assess rangeland health. Bird species diversity and ant species diversity were not related to the status of the sample site and were judged inadequate as indicators of maintenance of biodiversity.

Here, we consider the analysis of species composition when multiple sites are followed through time. Analyses of temporal trends in species composition either summarize species composition into a few metrics (indices or axis scores) or analyze the similarity among sites. We develop and illustrate the similarity approach. Each pair of samples represents a pair of replicates, a pair from the same site at different times, a pair from different sites at the same time, or an unrelated pair. Differences among times can be estimated by comparing average temporal dissimilarity to average replicate dissimilarity. Temporal trends can be described by one of three statistics that measure progressive change, the correlation of temporal dissimilarity with the length of time between samples. These methods are illustrated using data on changes in a South Carolina zooplankton assemblage following disturbance, and changes in bird species composition on Skokholm Island, Wales. It is difficult to define and interpret temporal trends. Some definitions of interesting trends, like increasing divergence from another set of sample plots, place additional requirements on the sampling design. Including replicate samples or clustering sample plots and including "control" plots for comparison with sentinel sites would contribute to an understanding of changes in species composition.

Madrono		1998	April-June, 1998	45	2	93-100	93	100	English	print					0	5	Riparian ecosystems in the mountains of southern California are characterized by unusually dynamic conditions of fluvial disturbance, fire, landslides, and other physical processes. Riparian communities and associated wetland habitats make up less than 1% of the land area of the Santa Monica Mountains of southern California but are the primary habitat for nearly 20% of the native vascular plant flora. While the conditions responsible for such high biodiversity has not been well investigated, the dynamic disturbance regime and seasonal availability of water in riparian ecosystems are two critical factors. In comparison to the total native flora of the Santa Monica Mountains, riparian specialists (i.e., those species with their primary ecological occurrence in such habitats) showed a higher relative frequency of herbaceous perennials, and a lower relative frequency of woody shrubs, geophytes, and annuals. Winter deciduous growth habit characterizes nearly 80% of the woody riparian specialists, a far higher level than in comparable non-riparian species. Compound to the total flora, riparian specialists were found to have relatively broader geographic patterns of distribution within California. No rare or endangered species are included in the riparian-specialist flora of the mountains. Biological diversity of native plant species in riparian communities appears to be negatively impacted by human disturbance. Habit modification, weedy exotic species introductions, stream channel modification, and heavy recreational use all appear to lead to sharp reductions in plant species diversity. Without additional knowledge of the demography and ecology of potentially keystone riparian species, it is impossible to accurately model the impact of anthropogenic disturbance regimes on the structure and stability of these riparian ecosystems.

Wildlife Society Bulletin		1998	Spring, 1998	26	1	148-158	148	158	English	print					0	16	The U.S. Forest Service plans to restore >40,000 ha of the fire-dependent shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)-grassland community on the Ouachita National Forest and potentially >780,000 ha of the pine-grassland community throughout the Southeast to benefit the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Concern has arisen over impacts of large-scale conversion of closed-canopy forests to open pine-grassland woodlands. We evaluated how an ecosystem approach to habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected small mammals. During 2 winters we compared small mammal occurrence and abundance in untreated pine-hardwood stands to stands following wildlife stand improvement (WSI; midstory removal), and with WSI-treated stands in the first, second, and third dormant seasons following prescribed fire. Total abundance of small mammals was highest in WSI stands and was a more direct response to WSI (change in stand structure) than to fire. Increased species richness and diversity in the second year of this study was strongly related to both WSI and fire. No species was adversely affected by WSI or by fire. Rather, WSI and fire-reduced midstory, increased dead debris in the understory, promoted herbaceous production, and increased woody sprouting. Total community abundance, richness, and diversity were lowest in untreated stands. White-footed mice (Peromyscus spp.; primarily white-footed mouse (P. leucopus)) were the dominant species, accounting for 68% of the 611 individuals collected. Restoration efforts may be particularly beneficial to generalist species such as P. leucopus as well as to more specialized species, such as golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli) and fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens) that historically may have depended upon pine-grassland habitats. Restoration of pine-grassland communities may enhance small mammal communities by reestablishing a landscape element that was present during presettlement times.	Masters, Ronald E.; Dep.

Protection from habitat destruction alone cannot guarantee its conservation and the damage already sustained is not fully reversible. Therefore, the ideal for conservation-maintenance or restoration of self-sustaining populations of all species in native ecosystems-is presently unattainable. We assessed three long-term strategies for maintaining and increasing populations of threatened native birds on the mainland and offshore islets of Mauritius, with respect to efficacy, sustainability, and side-effects. Rehabilitation of native vegetation on the mainland is likely to improve food availability over limited areas, but it can only form the basis of a long-term bird conservation strategy when population density of introduced animals, especially predators, can be reduced sustainable at low financial cost, and without adversely affecting native wildlife. Marooning bird populations on ecologically rehabilitated islets can eliminate the predator problem, but they would be vulnerable to catastrophes (especially cyclones) and possibly disease, and much habitat management work is still needed. A third, novel strategy-enhancement of mainland habitat using exotic plants allows creation of source habitats, greatly reducing the predator threat. It also permits larger areas to be managed, and at lower cost, than is the case with intensive rehabilitation. Habitat management regimes for conservation of threatened species or communities must be designed specifically to alleviate population-limiting factors. In altered environments certain exotic plants can be essential to the survival of native animal species. The most effective conservation measure must not be assumed always to be the rehabilitation of native vegetation.	Safford, R. J.; Royal Holloway Inst. Environ.

Conservation Biology		1998	Feb., 1998	12	1	177-189	177	189	English	print					0	20	The avian community of montane coniferous forests changed substantially over 21 years in response to the introduction of the balsam woolly adelgid insect (Adelges piceae) and the resulting death of endemic Fraser fir trees (Abies fraseri). These relict forests are at the southern limit of their distribution on the highest ridges of the southern Appalachian Mountains. We combined a historical study at Mount Collins in the Great Smoky Mountains with a geographic comparison of sites within five southern Appalachian mountain ranges variably affected by the adelgid. At Mount Collins, fir was virtually eliminated and canopy cover reduced to half its previous level. Long-term data from Mount Collins showed that the combined density for all breeding birds also declined by half. Of the common territorial species present in 1974, 10 of 11 declined, 6 by more than 50%. Some species are near local extinction. Canopy-and subcanopy-foraging species declined more than near-ground and trunk-foraging species. In addition, invasions of birds characteristic of open and disturbed forests have diluted the boreal character of the avifauna These changes are consistent with two Other long-term studies and are not explained by regional population trends. In the other southern Appalachian mountain ranges, where habitat is not as extensive, the adelgid invasion resulted in greater declines in avian abundance, stronger effects on sensitive species, and more pronounced invasions by successional species. Sensitive species in the southern Appalachian studies were also strongly affected in other studies of forest disturbance by fire and logging. The extent of relatively pristine spruce-fir forest and the population pools in other forest types in the Great Smoky Mountains appear to have buffered the effects of forest decline on the bird community.

The CRP replaced production agriculture fields with grassland habitat used by more than 90 species of birds. At least 42 bird species nested in CRP habitats. Bird species richness in CRP fields was similar to that in rowerop fields, but relative abundance was 1.4 to 10. 5 times higher in CRP plantings. Nest abundance was 13.5 times higher in CRP than crop fields, although nesting success of songbirds was only slightly higher in CRP fields (40% vs. 36% in crops). Limited evidence suggests that the CRP has positively affected the population growth rates of several nongame grassland bird species. Waterfowl nest densities and nesting success in CRP fields were similar to those occurring in grassland habitats managed specifically for waterfowl. The presence of CRP grassland has been postulated to have improved the quality of existing duck nest habitat by dispersing nests over a larger area. Ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus L.) populations seemingly increased substantially with CRP acres. Little evidence of positive population response by northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus L.) to the CRP is available. Overall, grassland birds known to be declining throughout North America were seemingly the most benefitted by the CRP.	Ryan, Mark R.; Sch. Natural Resources, Stephens Hall, Univ.

Clearcutting practices have affected 80% of the 10,000-ha study area. In total, we located 219 radiotagged birds 5,638 times during 1990-94, of which habitat was described at 722 locations of 103 birds. For feeding habitat, birds preferred young plantations (15-30 yr) dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) and with high canopy closure. For feeding substrates, woodpeckers preferred stumps in young plantations and snags in old forest. Forest >50 years old was preferred for resting and display. The preference for young plantations as feeding habitat corresponded with habitats where the staple food source, wood-living ants (mostly carpenter ants; Camponotus spp.), was most abundant. Year-round home ranges decreased in size with an increasing proportion of young plantations in the landscape. We conclude that in continental Scandinavian forests, where snow depths are moderate (<0.7 m), food resources for the black woodpecker are well secured with present-day forestry practices.

Pacific Conservation Biology		1998		4	2	111-121	111	121	English	print					0	3	Birds were studied at 57 sites in Mountain Ash forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia in spring and summer 1995/96. The sites represented 41 patches of old-growth forest (up to 390 ha in size) in a matrix of regrowth mostly from severe fires in 1939 (57 years previously), with multiple sites in the four largest patches of old-growth and eight sites in 1939 regrowth. Relative bird abundance was assessed by an area-search technique. Generalized linear modelling was used to develop predictive models by regressing abundance of groups of bird species against patch size, isolation and some basic habitat and context variables. Total bird abundance (of all species combined) tended to be higher in old-growth patches than in 1939 regrowth, but riot significantly. There was no trend in total abundance with patch size or isolation. Fruit-eating birds tended to be commonest in small patches. Bark-foragers and uncommon birds favoured large patches, though the latter were most common in 1939 regrowth. More variation was explained by habitat and context variables such as aspect altitude and forest structure. Uneven-aged forest structure was often associated with small patches. It was concluded that old-growth forest patches can have similar values per hectare for forest birds whether they are large or small. The regrowth forest matrix appears to protect small patches from factors which reduce densities of forest birds in small forest patches in farmland. The data support the current policy of retaining all old-growth ash forest patches. A range of factors should be considered in selecting regrowth stands of various sizes to regrow as old forest of the future, including their intrinsic potential to develop particular habitats and produce a mix of forest structures in the landscape.

Scherzinger, Wolfgang									Vogelwelt		1998		119	1	1-6	1	6	German	print					0	1	Density and population trends of specialized woodpeckers are expected to reflect current habitat quality of forests and woodlands, e.g. amount of old growth, dead wood, tree species diversity and structural diversity. I investigated whether this expectation was met prior to and during a major bark beetle outbreak in the Bavarian Forest National Park. Surveys from 1974-1977 showed distinct habitat-related concentrations of woodpecker diversity (seven species) in this mountainous forest. Woodpecker diversity correlated with tree species diversity as well as with age of trees. These results indicated that woodpeckers are 'good' indicators of certain habitat characteristics. Woodpecker numbers on an 80 ha study plot were strongly affected by a large-scale bark beetle outbreak following a storm in 1983: a steep six-year increase in the number of species and density of woodpeckers was followed by a rapid decrease in abundance as soon as most trees had died. The drop in woodpecker densities to levels prior to the outbreak contrasts with a striking increase of dead wood and canopy gaps. In such 'catastrophic' situations habitat parameters other than amount of dead wood limit woodpecker abundance (e.g. lack of cover). To understand such factors, age distribution of trees, amount of dead wood and structural parameters must be monitored continuously in a given area. However, such efforts make the use of woodpeckers as bioindicators superfluous. It is concluded that woodpeckers can function as bioindicators only within certain limits of ecological conditions.

Conservation Biology		1997	Dec., 1997	11	6	1418-1429	1418	1429	English	print					6	84	Fragmentation of forested landscapes can reduce the reproductive success of birds occupying residual forest patches. Previous studies, however, have focused primarily on bow nest predation can change when landscapes become fragmented by agriculture rather than by logging. To determine if predation on artificial nests in forest patches was influenced by the surrounding landscape, we placed ground and shrub nests along the edge and interior of forest patches located in agricultural, logged, and contiguous forest landscapes within a single region of the southern boreal mixed wood forest of central Canada. Nest predators were identified using remotely triggered cameras and by marks left in plasticine eggs, whereas the relative abundance of nest predators such as corvids and small mammals was estimated by surveys and live-trapping. The percentage of ground nests destroyed at the edge and interior of patches in the logged and contiguous forest landscapes was significantly lower than at the edge or interior of patches in the agricultural landscape. No differences in predation rate were observed for shrub nests among landscapes. We attributed higher rates of predation in the agricultural landscape to higher densities of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in the interior and a greater diversity of predators along edges. The similarity in predation rate between logged and contiguous forest landscapes suggests that fragmentation caused by logging may result in little change in predator communities and in this respect, might be similar to fragmentation caused by natural disturbance regimes such as fire. In contrast, fragmentation by agriculture seems to have more serious consequences for nesting birds. Policy changes that limit the growth of agriculture in the southern boreal mixed wood forest are required to conserve the diverse avifauna of this region.

International Journal of Wildland Fire		1997	Dec., 1997	7	4	343-350	343	350	English	print					0	9	In 1989 a wildfire destroyed 300 ha of natural pine forest and Mediterranean woodland on Mt. Carmel, Israel. Consequently an interdisciplinary scientific effort in fire ecology was initiated in order to propose recommendations to the management authorities. Field data gathered on soil erosion in the Mt. Carmel site implied that erosion is severe only during the first winter after fire, but it does not seem to present a significant threat to long-term ecosystem recovery. The recovery of the natural vegetation mitigates erosion, and there is no special need for any precautions to be taken immediately following fire. Salvage cutting of burned trees had no effect on pine seedling recruitment, on vegetation development and on plant species diversity. Salvage cutting did affect passerine bird community by slowing down succession rate. For successful regeneration of the pine forest the burned site need not to be planted, since the number of natural pine seedlings is sufficiently great, and there is a need to conserve the genetic and spatial variability of the forest. Although thinning has a positive effect on short-term pine survival and growth, such action is not recommended since pine seedlings are susceptible to pine bast scale (Matsococcus josephi) up to seven years, and to severe damage by porcupines. Selection caused by this bast scale might improve the resistance of the new pine forest stand. Pine seedling growing in the microsites of the old burned pine trees should be treated carefully, since some of them, due to their fast development, appear to be the next generation of the forest. Thinning of these groups can be considered after seven years, accompanied by removal of Cistus dwarf shrubs. However, where porcupine damage is observed, thinning should be done at low rates and with no pruning of side twigs. Since animal succession is a consequence of the change and progress in vegetation structure, there is no need for animal resettlement. The concept of "fuel breaks", combining a single massive thinning of the woody vegetation and an annual short but heavy grazing, is a management option for decreasing fire danger and future fire damage.

Journal of Applied Ecology		1997	Dec., 1997	34	6	1462-1478	1462	1478	English	print					1	70	1. Skylark numbers declined by 51% between 1968 and 1995 on UK lowland farmland; a loss of approximately 3 million breeding birds. This study examined whether distribution and breeding success of skylarks varied with the cropping of organically and intensively managed fields in southern England in accordance with the hypothesis that changes in agricultural land-use and intensity of management have contributed to this decline. 2. Density was lowest on fields surrounded by tall boundary structures or unsuitable habitat, and those with tall, dense vegetation cover. After controlling for these effects, set-aside and organically-cropped fields supported significantly higher skylark densities throughout the breeding season than intensively cropped fields or grazed pasture. Nests were usually built in crops between 20 and 50 cm tall. In fast-growing broad-leaved crops (e.g. oilseed rape, legumes), skylarks held territories, but no nesting activity was observed. Rapid crop growth probably allows too little time for nesting to begin. 3. Breeding success was higher on set-aside than on intensively managed cereals. Predation caused most nest failures, but did not vary in frequency with crop type. Silage cutting and trampling caused many failures on grass fields, and all cases of apparent brood starvation occurred in cereal fields. These breeding success data, together with published estimates of survival rates, suggest that skylark pairs must make 2-3 nesting attempts per season in order for populations to be self-sustaining. A single crop type rarely provides a suitable vegetation structure for nesting throughout the breeding season. Skylarks therefore require structurally diverse crop mosaics in order to make multiple nesting attempts without territory enlargement or abandonment. Mixed farms are more likely to fulfil these requirements than those dominated by winter cereals and broad-leaved crops. 4. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that loss of mixed farming and rotational cropping, and concomitant increases in autumn sowing of crops, agrochemical inputs, multiple silage cuts and grazing intensities since the 1950s have reduced the breeding productivity and population density of skylarks on lowland farmland in southern England. 5. The following recommendations are made for changes in farming systems that would assist the conservation of breeding skylark populations on lowland farmland. Organic farming systems, set-aside and habitat management for gamebirds are all likely to improve nesting and feeding conditions for skylarks. More generally, breeding skylark populations are only likely to increase on farms that reduce agrochemical inputs, reduce grazing intensity and frequency of silage cutting, and increase the structural diversity of field vegetation by adopting mixed rotations of winter and spring cereals, root crops and grass. Traditional mixed farming systems of this kind are now rarely economically desirable. Only agricultural policy reforms motivated in part by environmental concerns rather than solely by production control are likely to direct subsidy support to reduced-intensity, mixed farming enterprises of this kind, and thus help to restore populations of breeding skylarks on lowland farmland.

Wilson Bulletin		1997	Dec., 1997	109	4	595-613	595	613	English	print					0	10	I examined the long-term dynamics of wintering and breeding bird communities at the Barrens Grouse Habitat Management Area (HAM) in central Pennsylvania. I compared community structure (species richness and population abundances) among three forested sectors that varied in extent of clearcutting and among forested plot types of different age since clearcutting from 1993-95 (termed period 2). These results, which were obtained six-eight years subsequent to a third cutting cycle, were then contrasted to those from a previous study (1988-90, termed period 1). The Barrens Grouse HMA consisted of three distinct sectors: a contiguous uncut stand, a series of uncut strip corridors, and a mosaic of small (1 ha) forest patches (plots). I observed 12 wintering bird species in period 2; most species (67%) were trunk-bark foragers. Uncut plots were used more often (P < 0.05) by wintering birds than clearcut plots, perhaps because uncut plots contained rough-barked trees as foraging substrate and more favorable microclimatic conditions. Of the 40 breeding bird species noted in period 2, most were ground-shrub foragers occurring principally in forested corridor and patch sectors. Abundances of six ground-shrub foraging species were higher (P < 0.05) in the forested patch than in other sectors in period 2; these species were found primarily in recent clearcut plots. Abundances of sallier-canopy foragers were higher (P < 0.05) than expected in contiguous forest and forested corridor sectors in period 2. Species richness, abundances of all wintering species combined, and abundances of two foraging guilds (trunk-bark and ground-shrub foragers) were similar among sectors in periods 1 and 2 in both winter and the breeding season. Abundances of three wintering species, however, were greater (P < 0.05) in period 2 than in period 1. In contrast to winter, abundances of all breeding species combined, sallier-canopy foragers, and five species increased (P < 0.05) between periods, whereas abundance of three species declined. Significant changes in abundances of wintering and breeding birds between periods at the Barrens Grouse HMA may be explained partially by plant succession or regional trends in population abundances.

Landscape cover types were modeled with logistic regression based on temporal changes between 1966 and 1990. Demographic-economic regression models also were used to predict landscape cover types in year 2014 based on selected independent variables. Logistic regressions were used to model probability of occurrence of selected avian species based on predicted area of landscape cover types in year 2014. Model output of vegetation cover types suggests the continued use of intensive agriculture management practices in the high density rural population landscape while extensive agriculture management practices will maintain the native vegetation component in the low density rural population landscape. Our models suggest continued intensive agriculture practices associated with the high density rural population landscapes will adversely affect native grassland bird species to a greater magnitude than extensive ranching practices in the low density rural population landscapes.

The selected stands represented fire refuges as well as different successional stages after fire. Six of the stands were dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.), three were dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and three were dominated by hairy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) or aspen (Populus tremula L.). In 3 of the southernmost stands, the average fire interval was 34 to 65 years during the late 1600s to late 1800s, but since 1888 no fires had occurred in any of the stands. The absence of fire disturbance since 1888 is probably caused by the fire suppression in the overall landscape. The standing volume of living trees ranged between 87 and 511 m 3 ha-1 while the volume of dead trees, including both snags and logs, ranged between 27 and 201 m 3 ha-1. The volume of dead trees constituted ca. 30% of the total stem volume. In the conifer dominated stands, there was a statistically significant relationship between total stem volume, including both living and dead trees, and site productivity. A comparison between the amount of dead and living trees indicated substantial changes in tree species composition in several stands. It is suggested that data on the amount of dead trees, especially logs, and its distribution over decay classes could be used to examine the continuity of certain tree species. All stands had a multi-sized tree diameter distribution, which in most cases was similar to a reversed J-shaped distribution. In general spruce was numerous in the seedling cohort and in small diameter classes, indicating that its proportion in the stands was stable, or was increasing at the expense of pioneer tree species such as pine, aspen and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.). The most numerous species in the seedling cohort, rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.), was almost totally missing in the tree layer, indicating a high browsing pressure preventing rowan seedlings from growing into trees. The general increase of spruce and the sparse regeneration of pioneer species, in the stands previously affected by fire, are discussed in relation to natural disturbance regimes, biological diversity and nature conservation policies. It is proposed that reintroduction of fire disturbance is a necessity for future management plans of forest reserves. Other management practices to increase species diversity within forest reserves are also discussed.	Linder, Per; Dep.

From 1690 to 1971 the Bluethroat was registered as a rare not yearly breeding bird in this area, especially in the Upper Main valley. Beginning from 1971 the total population size increased permanently and reached a first maximum with 102 breeding pairs in 1981. However, breeding pairs decreased to 51 (50%) from 1982 to 1985. In the following 11 years the total population size increased very quickly to 176 breeding pairs. This is 10% of the species' total population of Germany. The reasons for these fluctuations lie in the succession of the vegetation in washponds of gravel plants in the Upper Main valley and by spreading of overgrown ditches in open meadows under extensive use by agriculture in the area around Coburg. Details of the succession of the vegetation in washponds and in ditches in agro areas and wetland are described. Some populations in gravel plants with a maximum of 20 breeding pairs collapsed in 10 to 15 years. If no landscape management programme will be established, the population size in the Coburg county will decrease as quickly as the population in the Upper Main valley 15 years ago. The dispersal of the population in the county of Coburg could only be reached after omitting the yearly cleaning of the ditches so that reed could spread out. The River Main population, settled first, serves as feeder to the Coburg population, as ringed birds show. Over 90% of the total population lives in anthropogenic habitats, with 48% in wash or gravel ponds and 31% in ditches with reed in extensively used agricultural or wetland. The development of the River Main and the Coburg populations is twofold: The Upper Main valley population can be stabilized if necessary habitat protection programmes start. The population size in Coburg county is still increasing, but newly settled areas enter a succession phase which will doom the Bluethroat population to collapse if no protective measures will be taken. Necessary habitat factors for the Bluethroat are described. The Bluethroat population in both parts of the countryside around Coburg can be stabilized if a consequent habitat management together with protective measures, described here in detail, for existing and future washponds would be installed.

Bird abundance was assessed on 13 sites immediately before and after the fire, and annually for three years to 1986. The sites represented a range of habitats including rainforest, heaths and eucalypt forest, all of which burned. Total bird abundance was reduced to 60% of initial levels by the fire, but recovered within three years. These changes differed significantly between habitats. Initial decreases were greatest and subsequent recovery least in heaths where most above-ground vegetation had been killed. Post-fire increases were greatest in rainforest and on granite ridges, and in each case bird abundance rose to levels substantially higher than before fire. Some changes may have involved recovery from drought as well as fire. Changes over time were highly significant for many groups of birds (e.g., honeyeaters), while others showed little change (e.g., bark-foragers and insectivores that inhabit dense understorey or damp ground below shrubs). Honeyeaters and seed-eaters suffered the greatest initial declines, and some species in these groups were slow to recover (e.g., New Holland and Crescent Honeyeaters and Beautiful Firetail). Some species that feed from open ground increased quickly to levels greater than before fire (Flame and Scarlet Robins, Buff-rumped Thornbill and Superb Fairy-wren), but all except the latter then declined as shrubs regenerated. The main loss of birds immediately after the fire was of highly mobile species, and the composition of the remaining bird fauna appeared to depend on resource availability rather than the capacity of species to survive the fire front. Initial responses of species to fire were poor predictors of their responses after three years. Hence, the effects of fire should be considered in terms of habitat changes over several years. Many forest types including rainforest can provide continuing habitat even when they burn, but populations of mobile birds such as honeyeaters depend on access to alternative habitats on a broad regional scale.

Texas Journal of Science		1997	Aug., 1997	49	3 SUPPL.	123-138	123	138	English	print					1	8	Bird communities of the West Gulf Coastal Plain are strongly influenced by the stage of forest succession, species composition of understory and overstory vegetation, and forest structure. Alteration of plant communities through forest management and natural disturbances typically does not eliminate birds as a faunal group from the area affected, but will replace some species with others and cause changes in the abundance and species composition of bird communities. Upland, fire disclimax pine savannah communities composed of primarily longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) provide mature pines for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) while simultaneously providing grassland ground cover for Bachman's Sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) and Henslow's Sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii). On the mesic mid-slopes where there is an increasing presence of loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus echinata) pine and hardwood species, Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and White-eyed Vireos (Vireo griseus) find habitat in the understory and midstory vegetation, whereas canopy hardwoods and pines provide habitat for Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) and Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra). Transition into the wet bottomland hardwood forests increases the abundance of bird species associated with deciduous wetlands such as Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) and Swainson's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii), whereas species associated with conifers and grassland savannahs are lost. Anthropogenic or natural disturbances that set back mature stages of forest succession can dramatically alter the species composition of bird communities. Depending on patch size, forest removal can initiate forest succession and provide habitat for early succession bird species such as Blue Grosbeaks (Guiraca caerulea), Field Sparrows (Spizellapusilla), Prairie Warblers (Dendroica discolor), Painted Buntings (Passerina ciris), Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), and Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens). Although current data are inconclusive, patch size, forest fragmentation, edge effect, and landscape use patterns appear to influence bird communities by affecting area-sensitive species. Of greatest concern are forest-interior bird species that appear to be area sensitive such as the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea), Northern Parula (Parula americana), Louisiana Waterthrush (Seiurus motacilla), American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus).

Edge and interior sites were chosen that were homogeneous with respect to habitat physiognomy i.e. influences of habitat structure and complexity were insignificant. There were no statistical differences in bird species diversity between the forest edge and interior. However, there was significantly greater species turnover at the edge. The difference in bird species composition between the forest edge and interior was due to various edge-effects: removal of dead wood for firewood, soil compaction by cattle, and generally greater levels of disturbance. We question the wisdom of the generally applied edge-effect principle in the conservation of forest biodiversity. We suggest that the principle be applied only once there has been critical appraisal of the extent, nature, and effect of an edge and a clear conservation objective with regard to forest birds.

Realizable protective measures for birds should be formulated by the means of ornithological data. The study area covered 49,67 km2, of which 152,5 ha were sampled in 1994. In each section birds were registered for three times during the breeding season. Types of biotopes (fields, meadows, small woodland, fruit meadows, hedges, farm houses, wetlands), vegetation structure and borderline-length of shrubs and trees were recorded in each section of investigation. During the breeding season of 1994 (198 controls) 96 species of birds were recorded, 55 species regarded as breeding species, which is a higher number than expected from species-area-curves for central Europe. The quite high number of breeding species only refers to 20% of the area of the investigated sections. 80% of the area of the sections are rather poor in birds. Blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) and Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) were the most abundant and most widespread breeding species of the investigation area. Approximately a quarter of the controlled habiats (n = 122) were occupied by Yellowhammer male. The occurrences of the Partridge (Perdixperdix) (6-7 cocks on 125,5 ha), Quail (Coturnix coturnix) (13-20 cocks) and of the Savi's Warbler (Locustella luscinoides) (2 territories) represents a remarkable population level for Carinthia. The Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) (19-24 territories) also shows densities, which proves the Krappfeld as a good habitat for Red-Backed Shrikes in Austria. The investigation area was subdivided into several macrohabitats. Fruit meadows with parts of forest edges, hedges and extensively used dry grasslands was the macro-habitat with the most breeding species.The most endangered species were found in fallow fields. The Skylark (Alauda arvensis) is the characteristic species of the open farmland with corn fields. This is the typical biotope of the central Krappfeld. The avoidance of wood structures by Skylark and Quail is to be recognized. Woods within the areas of fields showed a considerably higher number of species and individuals (areas of fields without woodlots had 4, fields with woodlots had 17 breeding species). Fallow land had a great attraction to ground breeding birds as Partridge, Quail, Skylark and Whinchat (Saxicola rubetra). Especially Quail and Whinchat seem to gain much from the existence of large fallow lands. The meadows including pastures outside the Krappfeld basin include larger areas of hedges and small woodlots. Here is the Red-backed Shrike the typical species. Meadows without hedges or small woodlots are hardly important for birds, not even one species of breeding bird could be found there. Only during mowing a higher presence of birds in search for food could be recorded. Edges of forests showed on average the highest number of species and abundance. Coal Tit (Parus ater), Woodpigeon (Columba palumbus) and Dunnock (Prunella modularis) had their concentration of distribution here. Wetlands and small riverine woodlands such as a large bog along the Silverbach and riverine woodland along the Silverbach and the river Gurk. Savi's Warbler, Marsh Warbler (Acrocephalus palustris) and Reed Bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) settled in this low moor. The woodland along rivers and brooks were characterized by a special bird community with Garden Warbler (Sylvia borin), Spotted Flycatcher (Muscicapa striata), Golden Oriole (Oriolus oriolus), Marsh Warbler, Grey Wagtail (Motacilia cinerea) and the Wren (Troglotytes troglotytes). Moreover Kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), the Dipper (Cinclus cinclus) and Little Woodpecker (Dendrocopus minor) could be found. Beside cornfields, fruit meadows formed the typical kinds of biotopes of the Krappfeld. In general this type of habitat showed a variety of species and abundance high above average, which can be attributed to a high part of dead wood. Wryneck (Jynx torquilla) and Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) breed only in the area of fruit meadows. Greenfinch (Carduelis chloris) and Goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) reach their concentration of distribution here. Farm house dominated villagelots showed similar high densities of abundance. The reason for this might be the relative high part of shrubs and trees and richness of hollows in the old farmhouses. The occurrence of Partridge, Quail, Wryneck, Skylark, Whinchat, Red-back Shrike and Yellowhammer is discussed in more detail. Especially the Partridge and Quail seem to exclude one another almost completely in their occurrence. In contrast to Quail and Skylark, Partridges prefer hedges and small woodlots in their breeding habitat. Beyond that, the Quail showed a definitive preference for cornfields. Moreover fruit meadows are significantly preferred by the Wryneck. All breeding pairs (n = 3) were found within this habitat. Fallow land was the most important biotope for the Whinchat. The Yellowhammer was a good indicator for extensively used farmland.	Lentner, Reinhard; Inst. Zool., Univ.

The plant communities included a mature primary spruce forest and three seral stages of secondary vegetation that grow after a fire, grassland, pine woodland and mixed coniferous forest. The densities of all 30 bird species found in the four plant communities were estimated by the circular-plot method in July and August, 1990. Each community at different sites shows distinct pattern in species composition, guild structure and bird density. Most species show preference in habitat selection. The avian community parameters roughly followed the succession pattern. Total number of species and total density increase along the succession gradient. The bird community in spruce forest had the highest Shannon diversity index, followed by pine woodland, mixed coniferous forest, and grassland. Evenness indices were highest in pine woodland and grassland, and lowest in mixed coniferous forest and spruce forest. The Bray-Curtis index of similarity between two bird communities decreased as the successional difference between plant communities increased. The bird communities in pine woodland and mixed coniferous forest, intermediate successional stages, had the highest index of similarity (0.55), while the bird communities, grassland and spruce forest, the extreme ends of pyrosere, were least similar (0.25). In this study habitat selection by birds was largely a function of habitat structure and bird foraging methods.	Lee, Pei-Fen; Dep. Zool., Natl. Taiwan Univ,.

Bird Conservation International		1997		7	2	117-159	117	159	English						0	2	An annotated compendium of all those bird species known to have occurred in the lowland "Man and Biosphere" Beni Biological Station (B.B.S.) reserve is provided. Previous checklists are reviewed, together with sightings accumulated over the 1992-1995 period during which approximately 70 new species have been added to the reserve inventory, bringing the total to 478. Occurrence across the 12 delineated habitats, relative abundance and sighting documentation are given for each species. The avifauna of the B.B.S. is mixed biogeographically; in addition to a substantial component of lowland birds widespread throughout South America, it is composed of Amazonian, cerrado and chaco elements also. Representation from the Bolivian Yungas is minimal. Significantly, no less than four threatened and 15 near-threatened species have occurred, including the little known Bolivian endemic Unicoloured Thrush Turdus haplochrous, and the enigmatic White-winged Nightjar Caprimulgus candicans, known until recently only from Emas National Park (Brazil). Short accounts are provided detailing records of all of these species. Birds of the reserve core, consisting largely of humid tropical forest formations inundated during the austral summer, appear not to be subjected currently to any serious environmental degradation, although some subsistence clearance by Chimane Indians in the northern reaches of the reserve gives some cause for concern. Of much greater import, however, are changes occurring outside the confines of the B.B.S. These include increasing urbanization immediately to the west (and associated road upgrading) and forest fragmentation to the south brought about by logging. The latter is especially worrying because linkage of the B.B.S. forest block to surrounding forest is already physically tenuous, and therefore it is imperative that future logging activities be geared to minimize isolation occurring and the damaging restriction of gene flow. Monitoring in rainforest immediately south of the reserve should become routine to warn of putative avifaunal impoverishments. Extensive surveying of the 2,500-ha El Porvenir estancia (savanna and related forest islands) due to be assimilated shortly into the B.B.S., which constitutes less than 1% of the area under consideration, has shown that it is used by no less than three threatened and up to nine near-threatened species. In the absence of data relating to other savanna areas (c. 15%) at present, the exact status of each species at the B.B.S. remains imprecise and begs for further research to be undertaken. Unfortunately, present management of the El Porvenir savanna is not conducive to the long-term maximization of populations of these species, several of which have local strongholds in this part of Beni. We recommend that the current policy of cattle ranching adopted by this estancia should cease or be reduced dramatically, to minimize grazing and trampling damage, and that measures should be taken to reduce incursions of fires started wilfully in neighbouring properties. The Academia National de Ciencias de Bolivia, which administers the reserve, should be encouraged to safeguard and enhance the savanna complement further by ensuring that the impending ratification of El Porvenir proceeds as quickly as possible, and by purchasing additional tracts of land to the south of the present southern reserve boundary, where feasible. Such actions should not only secure the future of the biota of the savanna habitat within the B.B.S. but also should ameliorate the degree of isolation which has occurred already by preserving the "curiches" (former river beds) and forest islands which act as access corridors for forest-dwelling and other birds.

The three plantation types (Inga, Gliricidia, and sun) showed high faunistic similarities with each other and were both distinct and depauperate compared to matorral and forest patch habitats. Of all the coffee plantation habitats, Inga shade had the highest diversity. Species associated with wooded vegetation were more common in shade plantations, particularly in Inga. A second census showed a decline in bird numbers that was more pronounced in sun and Gliricidia than in Inga plantations. Overall, differences between the plantation types were small and all coffee plantations were less diverse than traditional coffee farms previously studied in nearby Chiapas, Mexico. The relatively low bird diversity was probably due to the low stature, low tree species diversity, and heavy pruning of the canopy. These features reflect management practices that are common throughout Latin America. The most common species of birds in all coffee plantation habitats were common second-growth or edge species; more specialized forest species were almost completely absent from plantations. Furthermore, many common matorral species were rare or absent from coffee plantations, even sun plantations with which matorral shares a similar superficial structure. Coffee plantations probably will only be important for avian diversity if a tall, taxonomically and structurally diverse canopy is maintained. We suggest this is most likely to occur on farms that are managed for a variety of products rather than those designated entirely for the production of coffee.

During the breeding seasons of 1996 and 1997 surveys were undertaken to obtain a reliable national population size estimate and knowledge of current distribution and habitat choice. The largest subpopulation breeds on a 9 km2 forest-fire site in Hedmark county which burned in 1976 and contained 49-52 males in 1996 and 46-50 males in 1997. More than one hundred lowland peat bogs were searched and Ortolan Buntings were found on 19 bogs (15 in Hedmark and 4 in Akershus counties). The number of males on each bog was 1-9 (median 3) and the total number of males recorded was 65 in 1997 when the most comprehensive peat bog search was done. Only 9 (in 1996) and 7 (in 1997) males in 8 mixed farmland localities in Telemark, Akershus and Oppland counties were found, even though mixed farmland traditionally has been the typical breeding habitat of Ortolan Buntings in Norway. The number of males in the whole of Norway was thus about 120 in known localities. A detectability test suggested that this may represent a total population of up to about 150 males. In the forest-fire locality many males remained unmated and the number of breeding pairs in Norway may therefore be <100. The surveys therefore show that the current population size of Ortolan Buntings in Norway is small and the species has a limited geographical distribution, indicating that the status 'directly threatened' is warranted. The species' vulnerability is further increased by the fact that >80% of the population is concentrated in only ten localities.	Dale, Svein; Agric. Univ. Norway, Dep. Biol. Nat. Conservation, P.O.

Journal of Applied Ecology		1997		34	4	1043-1056	1043	1056	English						3	28	1. Beavers create habitat diversity across catchment landscapes by impounding small streams. This increased habitat diversity leads to increased species richness of plants and animals in small streams. As managers work to balance conflicting management goals (e.g. protection of timber and human structures versus maintenance of biological diversity) the influence of beaver population management practices on habitat availability needs to be assessed. Two questions of initial concern are: (i) how do different levels of management influence the availability of beaver created habitats and (ii) do relationships developed in one region apply to other regions? 2. To address these questions, historical aerial photography was used to determine the extent and rate of impoundment of streams by beavers Castor canadensis over a 77 000 ha south-eastern North American landscape during a 40-year period of beaver population recovery. Between 1950 and 1983, beaver populations were protected from trapping and hunting. From 1983 to the present, beaver numbers were reduced by fatal trapping, to protect roads, railroads and timber. Trapped beavers were assigned to specific colonies associated with beaver-created patches in the landscape, and growth rates and size after management of individual patches receiving different levels of management were compared. Results from this study were also compared with previous studies conducted in Minnesota, USA. 3. Growth rate, patch size following management and the composition of habitat types within patches were not related to management activity, suggesting that the levels of management used in this study did not influence the temporal dynamics of beaver-created patches. The extent and rate of beaver impoundment on the southeastern Upper Coastal Plain of North America was less than that reported from central North American landscapes over comparable periods. 4. These results have the following implications for management: (i) management activities should be monitored on a regional basis; (ii) conflicting beaver population management goals should be addressed, evaluated and balanced; and (iii) beavers do not present a threat to flowing-water species in south-eastern North America and need not be controlled for this reason.

Journal of Field Ornithology		1997		68	3	367-375	367	375	English						0	21	Song rate in birds is known to be influenced by the social status and nutritional state of the male. However, studies examining the impact of management practices on the conservation of migratory species often use song rate techniques to census populations. We examined song rates in three species of forest birds in northwestern Virginia, and found that Wood Thrushes and Ovenbirds sang more often in blocks of continuous forest, while Northern Cardinals sang more often in forest patches. Individuals gt 50 m from the observer sang more often than closer birds, and individuals in higher density populations sang more often than individuals at low density sites. The spatial variability in song rate was not severe enough to significantly change species-detection rates for 5-min song counts, but did significantly affect our population density estimates for those species. A key assumption of song count censuses, that all individuals of a species sing at comparable rates and thus have an equal probability of being detected, regardless of habitat structure, may not be valid.

Journal of Field Ornithology		1997		68	3	458-470	458	470	English						2	10	By late 1985, the population of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, had declined to a low of four individuals. Because of extensive timber harvesting prior to the 1950s, the older live pine trees that Red-cockaded Woodpeckers require for cavity construction were limited. We monitored the response of the population to intensive habitat enhancement that included construction of artificial cavities, control of cavity competitors, and removal of the hardwood mid-story to improve nesting habitat quality. Translocations of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers from on-site and donor populations were undertaken to enhance the number of breeding pairs, the overall population size, and to minimize potential adverse genetic consequences of a small population size. From 1986-1995, we carried out 54 translocations, installed 305 artificial cavities, and removed 2304 southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) (a cavity competitor). Concomitant intensive population monitoring revealed that the number of breeding pairs of woodpeckers increased from 1 to 19 and the overall population size grew from 4 to 99 individuals, reflecting the highly focused habitat restoration effort. Intensive management has been successful in rehabilitating this critically small population of endangered birds.	USDA Forest Serv., Southern Res. Stn., Dep.

Journal of Raptor Research		1997		31	2	160-166	160	166	English						2	25	Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa nebulosa) populations in North America have likely been stable over the past 10-100+ yr. Local populations fluctuate in response to food supply and/or nest-site availability. Breeding Great Gray Owls require preexisting nest structures in forest stands that are adjacent to open foraging habitat, preferably with hunting perches. Current forestry practices have the potential to affect about 75% of the Great Gray Owls' breeding range in North America. Intensive timber management typically removes large diameter and deformed nest trees, leaning trees used by juveniles for roosting before they can fly and stands with dense canopy closure used by juveniles and adults for cover and protection. Modified forest management can, however, create new foraging habitat by opening up large, dense forest stands. Specific recommended guidelines include restriction of harvest unit size ( ltoreq 5-10 ha), but within a mosaic of multi-sized units, retention of forest stands within 300 m of known or potential nest trees/sites, provision of hunting perches in cut-over areas, ensuring irregularly shaped harvest units and maintenance of forested travel corridors between cut-over areas. Because Great Gray Owls can breed on home ranges up to 800 km apart in successive years, integration of local management regimes at a landscape scale is recommended. Ideally, spatio-temporal patterns of natural disturbance (e.g., fire) should be emulated in a management plan to sustain the region's natural biological diversity, including Great Gray Owls when appropriate.

The study area is covered by a mosaic of Mediterranean habitats that includes cultivation, grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands and is representative of the natural features present and of the human usage practiced so far in this part of the Mediterranean. We sampled the vegetation and the bird fauna in the same 193 census plots in 1978 and in 1992. At both the habitat and landscape scales the cover of woody plants increased significantly. Open habitats tend to disappear. As a consequence the abundance of open-habitat bird species decreased significantly whereas the abundance of forest birds increased significantly. These changes favor a pool of forest species widespread in western Europe and reduce habitat availability for open habitat and shrubland species. Many of the latter are Mediterranean species whose distribution in Western Europe could become reduced under current landscape dynamics. Our observation of more woodlands and their typical birds and of less open habitats and their associated avifauna is not consistent with the traditional worry shown by the public and the managers about the regression of forests and woodlands in the Northern Mediterranean as a consequence of fire.

We describe an experimental study of such mechanisms in a hybrid zone between the fire-bellied toad Bombina bombina and the yellow-bellied toad B. variegata. In this system, preference for different breeding habitats reduces the frequency of hybridization. A comparison of habitat ecology shows that the semi-permanent ponds in which B. bombina usually breeds have higher densities of aquatic predators than the temporary puddles typically used by B. variegata. We test for behavioural adaptations in tadpoles to these different levels of predation. B. bombina tadpoles are significantly less active than B. variegata, both before and after the introduction of a predator to an experimental arena; this reduces their vulnerability as many predators detect prey through movement. Behavioural differences translate into differential survival: B. variegata suffer higher predation rates in laboratory experiments with three main predator types (Triturus sp., Dytiscus larvae, Aeshna nymphs). This differential adaptation to predation will help maintain preference for alternative breeding habitats, and thus serve as a mechanism maintaining the distinctions between the two species.

The purpose of creating this natural reserve was to preserve and restore the biological diversity of the calcareous grasslands and the surrounding forest vegetation which was threatened with extinction due to spontaneous woody colonization as a result of the decline of traditional grazing practices. Having obtained a favorable opinion from the scientific advisory committee, the National Forestry Board (ONF) began by implementing a management scheme based on cutting the grass. Initial results show that this system did encourage the specific diversity of the grassland, particularly as regards orchids. However, because of steep slopes and the need to protect other species, management practices are now turning back to traditional extensive sheep grazing under the supervision of a shepherd. This type of management may turn out to be more flexible for the purpose of maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between the various plant communities.	Dutoit, T.; Univ. Provence, Lab. Biosyst. Ecol.

Svensk Botanisk Tidskrift		1997		91	2	85-102	85	102	Swedish						0	3	Major landscape changes in Gotaland (southernmost Sweden) during the last millennium are reviewed, and an attempt to assess concomitant changes in biological diversity is made. 1000 years ago, forests and mires dominated the landscape, except in some costal areas where open meadows prevailed. The forests were composed of several deciduous trees, especially oak, birch and beech (in the south), and, on poor soils, mainly of pine. Most forests were open grazing forests (pasture woodland), but ancient trees and large dead trees were still common. In some areas, rich deciduous forest dominated by lime and oak still occurred. During the following 700 years the forests were opened up by man, but biologically important structures of the virgin forests, viz. ancient trees, large dead trees and wetlands, remained abundant. During this period, biodiversity increased until the coverage of old-growth forest decreased to about 20% of the surface area. The period 1800-1995 was a period of declining biodiversity, mainly due to local and regional extinction of species dependent on ancient trees and large dead trees. On the other hand, biodiversity among vascular plants and vertebrates changed comparatively little. However, these latter groups only comprise less than 5% of the total biodiversity among macroorganisms. The very high biodiversity connected with decomposing wood, the fauna and flora of which has been affected most by the activities of man during the last 200 years, is stressed. In Sweden, the total species diversity connected with dead wood amounts to several thousand species, mainly fungi and insects. Restorations of old-fashioned cultural landscapes are now carried out in several places, unfortunately using the landscape of the 19th century as a model. During that period the biodiversity was lower than previously, since natural disturbance regimes with windfalls, fire, and natural water level fluctuations were no longer present. Therefore, the use of medieval landscapes as a model for the restorations is recommended. This will lead to a higher biodiversity, and may be economically beneficial (wood products, meat, tourism). Studies of such landscapes provide insights useful in conservation and when developing sustainable forestry.	Ekol.

Birds were censured by point counts, and vegetation cover was estimated. The results show an early and continuous use of the burnt area by birds. During this period, the variation in avifauna composition relate first to the season, and secondarily to the time elapsed since fire, as shown by Correspondence Analysis of the birds times samples matrix. The main effect of fire is to induce a rapid transition from a shrubland breeding avifauna (dominated by insectivorous species) to a grassland wintering avifauna (dominated by seed-eating species). After fire, the overall abundance of birds at the breeding season is positively correlated with the foliage volume, which seems to be the main limiting factor. Examples of postfire specific responses (colonization, dispersion, or site tenacity) are shown. Site tenacity of birds, favoured both by the presence of rocky patches and by the persistence of very small unburnt remnants, may explain the relatively moderate effect of fire on this community.

B.									American Midland Naturalist		1996		135	1	153-167	153	167	English						1	48	Bird use of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and row-crop fields was studied in central Iowa from May through July 1991-1993. Thirty-three bird species were recorded in CRP fields and 34 in row-crop fields. The most abundant species in both habitats was the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), accounting for 35% of all birds in CRP and 24% in row-crop fields. The dickcissel (Spiza americana), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), common yellowthroat (Geothypis trichas), brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) were the next most abundant species in CRP plots. The horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) and brownheaded cowbird were the next most abundant species in row-crop fields. Nests of 16 bird species were found in CRP fields, with red-winged blackbirds accounting for 48% of all nests found. The vesper sparrow and horned lark were the only species nesting in row-crop fields. The major cause of nest loss for all species was predation, accounting for 52% of all nest loss in CRP fields and 65% in row-crop fields. Mammals accounted for 89, 88 and 85% of the predation on grasshopper sparrow, red-winged blackbird and dickcissel nests, respectively. The Conservation Reserve Program has likely contributed to an increase in the abundance of many bird species in central Iowa, inasmuch as the row-crop habitat that it replaced has lower bird abundance and supports fewer nesting species. The vegetation structure and composition of CRP fields in central Iowa are diverse, resulting in differences in the bird species communities using these fields. The effects of several land-management practices are discussed relative to bird species composition and nesting success.	Dep.

Enhanced biological diversity potentially offers agricultural producers a means of reducing the cost of their production. Conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes may be greatly enhanced by the adoption of certain crop management practices, such as reduced pesticide usage or measures to prevent soil erosion. Still, the vast monocultures comprising the crop area in many Canadian agricultural landscapes are often of limited conservation value, thus the inclusion of appropriate wildlife habitat in and around arable lands is a fundamental prerequisite for the integration of wild species within agricultural landscapes. This review of current literature considers the potential for non-crop areas within agricultural landscapes to be reservoirs of agronomically beneficial organisms including plants, invertebrates, and vertebrate species. Non-crop habitats adjacent to crop land have been identified as significant for the maintenance of plant species diversity, for the conservation of beneficial pollinating and predatory insects, and as essential habitat for birds. A key component for enhancement of biodiversity is the reintroduction of landscape heterogeneity by (1) protection and enhancement of key non-crop areas, (2) smaller fields and farms, and (3) a greater mixture of crops, through rotation, intercropping and regional diversification. The benefits of increased biodiversity within arable lands are reviewed for various species groups. In the Canadian context, any serious attempt to derive significant agronomic benefit from increased biodiversity will require considerable changes in the agricultural programs and policies which shape mainstream industrialized agriculture. The problems of crop depredation by vertebrate species, weed and insect competition, which still represent significant impediments to the creation and proper management of wildlife habitat, are also discussed.

Ohio Fish and Wildlife Report		1996		0	13	3-60	3	60	English						0	10	A lack of management guidelines for native nongame birds was identified as a significant problem in the Ohio Division of Wildlife's Strategic Plan for 1990-95. A literature review was conducted to identify nesting habitat requirements and research needs for the development of nesting habitat management guidelines for 11 grassland-nesting bird species in Ohio (see Table 1 for common and scientific names). Summaries of habitat types used for breeding (nesting and brood rearing), vegetative characteristics of breeding territories and/or nest sites, area requirements, and effects of no management, mowing, grazing, and prescribed burning on habitat use, nesting density, and/or reproductive success were developed for each species. Nine of the 11 grassland-nesting birds discussed in this paper have populations that are significantly declining nationally and/or regionally. Factors responsible for the decline of grassland bird populations are not entirely understood, but are believed to be a combination of loss and degradation of grassland habitat, reproductive failure because of high rates of nest predation and parasitism, and shifts in agricultural practices, such as earlier and more frequent cutting of hayfields. Each species has a unique set of habitat requirements consisting of area and vegetation composition and structure. Area-sensitive species, those encountered most frequently on grassland tracts gtoreq 50 ha, include the upland sandpiper, bobolink, savannah sparrow, and Henslow's sparrow. Species with a moderate sensitivity to habitat fragmentation are encountered most frequently on tracts gt 10 ha and include the eastern meadowlark, western meadowlark, and grasshopper sparrow. The dickcissel and vesper sparrow have a low sensitivity to habitat fragmentation and are encountered on grassland tracts of all sizes. The sensitivity of lark sparrow and ring-necked pheasant to habitat fragmentation has not been studied. The upland sandpiper, vesper sparrow, and lark sparrow prefer short, sparse vegetation and are generally found in highest densities on recently mowed, grazed, and burned areas. The bobolink, dickcissel, and Henslow's sparrow prefer tall, dense vegetation characteristic of unmowed, ungrazed, and unburned areas. Eastern meadowlarks, western meadowlarks, savannah sparrows, grasshopper sparrows, and ring-necked pheasants prefer vegetation of intermediate height and density and show varied responses to mowing, grazing, and burning. Additional research on the preferred habitat types and vegetation composition and structure of nesting bobolinks, dickcissels, and lark sparrows is needed. Further research on effects of mowing on the western meadowlark, dickcissel, vesper sparrow, and lark sparrow, effects of grazing on the dickcissel, grasshopper sparrow, and ring-necked pheasant, and effects of burning on the upland sandpiper, bobolink, eastern meadowlark, dickcissel, savannah sparrow, vesper sparrow, lark sparrow, and ring-necked pheasant is needed to develop sound habitat management guidelines. Although much as been written regarding nesting ecology and nesting habitat requirements of grassland-nesting birds, many aspects remain poorly understood and were identified as research needs.

Population fluctuations on Aasla were similar to those in mainland Finland in the case of the Grey-headed Woodpecker Picus canus and the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius. Breeding abundance of Black Woodpeckers was negatively correlated with snow depth and positively correlated with temperature in February. Also, breeding densities of Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major and Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor correlated positively with mean January and February temperatures. We suggest that several mild winters in the second part of the study period (1988-1995), are the primary reasons for the continuously high population densities of Grey-headed and Black Woodpeckers. We did not find any evidence indicating competition between Grey-headed and Black Woodpeckers. We stress the need for creating foraging substrates (e.g. standing dead wood) as food sources for woodpecker species in boreal forests under severe winter conditions.

Abundance of breeding birds was greater in thinned stands. Bird species richness was correlated with habitat patchiness and densities of hardwoods, snags, and conifers. During the breeding season, Hammond's flycatchers (Empidonax hammondii), hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus), red-breasted nuthatches (Sitta canadensis), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), warbling vireos (Vireo gilvus), and evening grosbeaks (Coccothraustes vespertinus) were more abundant in thinned than unthinned stands. Pacific-slope flycatchers (Empidonax difficilis) were more abundant in unthinned stands. Golden-crowned kinglets (Regulus satrapa), gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis), and black-throated gray warblers (Dendroica nigrescens) were more abundant in unthinned than thinned stands, but these patterns were inconsistent between seasons, regions, or years. Stand-scale habitat features were associated with the abundance of 18 bird species.	Dep. For.

E.									Biological Journal of the Linnean Society		1995		56	SUPPL. A	11-23	11	23	English						0	31	The concept of ecosystem restoration is gaining momentum in western Europe. This is necessary because in most managed nature reserves one or more of the following processes, which are analogous to those that have led to the dramatic loss of biological diversity in Europe, are still operating: continuing nutrient output, continuing high level of disturbance and fixing the system in some successional stage. This is partly because most management activities have been derived from, or copy, former agricultural practices. The study of natural ecosystems has revealed the key role large herbivores have in maintaining structural diversity in the vegetation and so biological diversity. Because of this they have been used as tools in achieving a variety of conservation goals. Here, various effects large herbivores can have on plant species composition, structural diversity of the vegetation and fauna are briefly reviewed. Attention is given to pasture-woodlands in southern Europe, which often have a relatively high biological diversity and share some key features with natural ecosystems: very low nutrient input, extensive grazing with large herbivores and the presence of natural tree cover. In a number of European countries attempts are being made to restore normal functioning multi-(herbivore) species ecosystems.	Dep. Nature Conservation, Wageningen Agric.

Bird Conservation International		1995		5	4	491-523	491	523	English						0	1	A study of Thuong Da Nhim and Chu Yang Sin Nature Reserves - identified as priority sites because located within the Da Lat Plateau Endemic Bird Area (EBA) in Vietnam - was conducted between 10 November 1993 and 1 February 1994. A total of 212 bird species, of which 11 are considered globally threatened (including the rediscovered Grey-crowned Crocias Crocias langbianis), were recorded in the reserves. Eight restricted-range species were recorded, including the four species confined to the EBA. These two reserves are of international importance because they jointly support bird communities representative of the EBA. They are also of great economic importance, being within watersheds. Their extent is believed adequate but it is not known if they encompass all representative habitats over the full altitudinal range. Local tribal communities traditionally practise shifting cultivation, which has greatly modified the extent, composition and quality of evergreen forest and is causing its increasing fragmentation. Deliberate fires are preventing the regeneration of evergreen forest and promoting the growth of a climax dominated by Pinus kesiya. This reduces bird diversity and compromises the future of the endemic bird taxa. Other threats include recent logging activities, human immigration, the urban expansion of Da Lat and consequent increasing demand for charcoal and fuelwood. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development should urgently proceed with the production of management plans for these areas, aiming to create a single, enlarged protected area. The primary land-use management strategy should be to conserve remaining areas of evergreen forest and to increase their extent by boundary realignment, elimination of shifting cultivation and fire, and the introduction of sympathetic forestry practices.

J.									Canadian Journal of Forest Research		1995		25	9	1509-1518	1509	1518	French						2	22	Diversity of passerine birds and mammals was estimated in well-drained areas located at proximity of the hydroelectric reservoir La Grande-3, where natural fire regime still prevails in the absence of forest exploitation. Forest stands were divided up into four post-fire stages: (i) recent burns (4 years old), (ii) shrubs (25 years old), (iii) young forests (50 years old), and (iv) mature forests ( gtoreq 71 years old). Richness and species diversity were highest in middle stages, in shrubs and young forests. The degree of opening seems to have affected more the composition of bird communities than stand age. Some bird species, typical of shrub stands, in particular white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys Forster), Lincoln's sparrow (Melospiza lincolnii Audubon), and alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum Brewster), appeared after the falling of dead trees, apprxeq 15 years after fire, and disappeared progressively as forests matured. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus Wagner), moose (Alces alces L.), and black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas) were more common at the beginning of succession, whereas northern red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi Vigors) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus L.) were typical of late stages. Mammal presence was mostly associated to their feeding requirements. Fire creates a mosaic of forest stands through periodic killing of trees in the north of the boreal forest, which contributes to maintain regional wildlife diversity; its suppression would reduce biodiversity.

Height and size of live trees, density of large dead trees, and volume of downed woody material increased during succession, whereas density of live trees decreased. Canopy heterogeneity had a bimodal relationship with succession: old forests had the highest, mature forests the lowest, and young forests an intermediate canopy heterogeneity. Old forests had greater bird species richness than young forests, which in turn had greater richness than mature forests. Twenty-seven, 3, and 10 bird species had their highest abundances in old, mature, and young forests, respectively. Seven bird species that nest and forage in canopy gaps and three bird species that nest and forage in large trees and snags were more abundant in young and old forests than in mature forests. Contrary to our predictions, patterns of richness and abundance for bird species that nest and forage in the canopy or in tree cavities were similar to those for bird species that nest or forage in the lower strata. Bird species preferring coniferous forests tended to be more abundant in old than in young or mature aspen-dominated forests, possibly because old aspen forests had more conifers than younger aspen forests.

We conducted a 5-year experimental study of the impact of aerial nitrogen fertilization on birds of the boreal forest near Kluane Lake, southwestern Yukon, to test for such bottom-up effects. Specifically, we tested if avian abundance and species richness increased after fertilization. Variable circular-plot point counts were made to estimate bird numbers and species richness each summer from 1988 to 1992. Fertilization had no effect on abundance for the first two summers, but total abundances of the seven commonest passerine bird species increased by an average of 46% over the final 3 years. Fertilization had no effect on bird species richness. Population densities and species richness were both low at Kluane compared with patterns seen in temperate forest. Yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), and Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) dominated the passerine community at Kluane. There was only moderate spatial and temporal variation in songbird numbers on control plots over the 5-year study period.	Smith, James N. M.; Centre Biodiversity Res., Dep. Zool., Univ.

Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis) and Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) provided different sizes of nest cavities for a suite of nonexcavator species. Flickers preferentially nested in snags; sapsuckers nested primarily in live trees, but used live trees and snags in proportion to their availabilities. Relative abundances of excavators and nonexcavators were associated positively with numbers of cavities. Nest-site variables overlapped extensively among species; Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) relied heavily on sapsuckers for provision of nest cavities, European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) primarily used flicker-excavated cavities, and House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) used nest cavities across the broadest range of nest-site characteristics. Compass orientation of nest-cavity entrances was strongly bimodal, with most facing east or southwest. Cavity entrances of species that foraged largely outside of riparian woodlands were oriented toward woodland edge, in contrast to nest cavities used by species that foraged largely within riparian woodlands. Snowpocket woodlands were much more extensive than riparian aspen, but birds strongly preferred riparian aspen stands as nesting habitats, presumably due to the scarcity of large aspen in snowpockets. Nest cavities appear to be a limiting resource with high potential for interspecific nest-site competition in these woodlands. Decades of livestock overuse and fire suppression have greatly diminished the availability of large aspen in riparian habitats throughout the region.	Dobkin, David S.; High Desert Ecol. Res.

Conservation Biology		1995		9	4	902-914	902	914	English						0	3	We revisited 68 plots of forest vegetation in the San Bernardino Mountains that had been quantitatively described in 1929-1935 from the California Vegetation Type Map (VTM) Survey. By using the same sampling methods, we documented changes-over approximately 60 years and during a period of fire suppression management-in tree density by both species and size class. In general, we found increasing stand densities, a transformation from old-growth age structure to young growth, and a compositional shift from Pinus ponderosa and P. jeffreyi to Abies concolor and Calocedrus decurrens. Density of trees of more than 12 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) increased by 79%, including three to tenfold increases in the youngest cohorts 12-66 cm dbh. The magnitude of change depended upon initial forest composition and local annual precipitation. Monotypic stands of P. jeffreyi or those initially dominated by Abies concolor showed the least change in species composition; the most xeric stands of P. jeffreyi showed the least gain in density; and mesic mixed P. ponderosa stands showed the most dramatic change in composition and density. We compared these data to records of past and present forests in the Sierra Nevada and found parallel trends, but magnified by the increased precipitation of the Sierra Nevada. We also compared VTM data from the San Bernardino Mountains to mixed conifer forests in the Sierra San Pedro Martir of Baja California. These Mexican sites and forests are ecologically similar to those in California, but they still experience unmanaged fire regimes. Californian forests of 60 years ago are remarkably similar to modern forests in the Sierra San Pedro Martir. Thus, we conclude that forest changes in the San Bernardino Mountains are primarily due to lengthening fire intervals. Forest changes as a result of fire suppression have important conservation consequences for bird species diversity in general and for Spotted Owl and Neotropical migrants in particular.

Conservation Biology		1995		9	5	1041-1058	1041	1058	English						1	60	During the two breeding seasons immediately following the numerous and widespread fires of 1988, I estimated bird community composition in each of 34 burned-forest sites in western Montana and northern Wyoming. I detected an average of 45 species per site and a total of 87 species in the sites combined. A compilation of these data with bird-count data from more than 200 additional studies conducted across 15 major vegetation cover types in the northern Rocky Mountain region showed that 15 bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other major cover type occurring in the northern Rockies. One bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing dead forests created by stand-replacement fires. Bird communities in recently burned forests are different in composition from those that characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including early-successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding guilds are especially abundant therein: woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters. Standing, fire-killed trees provided nest sites for nearly two-thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites. Broken-top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for cavity-nesting species significantly more often than expected on the basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the broken-top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest conditions prior to a fire (especially the presence of snags) may be important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity-nesting birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or relatively restricted to burned forests, stand-replacement fires may be necessary for long-term maintenance of their populations. Unfortunately, the current fire policy of public land-management agencies does not encourage maintenance of stand-replacement fire regimes, which may be necessary for the creation of conditions needed by the most fire-dependent bird species. In addition, salvage cutting may reduce the suitability of burned-forest habitat for birds by removing the most important element sbd standing, fire-killed trees sbd needed for feeding, nesting, or both by the majority of bird species that used burned forests.

Widespread loss and fragmentation of old-growth ecosystems have stimulated critical review and revision of existing forest management policies. However. studies of the consequences of forest management for plant species diversity are sorely lacking. We present data front permanent-plot and chronosequence studies in managed and unmanaged forests of western Oregon and Washington to describe the early responses of understory communities to forest harvest, and to suggest how post-harvest practices that alter natural successional processes may influence long-term patterns of diversity and species occurrence. Permanent-plot studies of early succession in old-growth Pseudotsuga forests suggest that changes in understory diversity are fairly short-lived following clear-cut logging and slash burning. Populations of most vascular plant species recover to original levels prior to canopy closure. However, diversity may remain depressed for more than two decades on severely burned sites, and some species may experience local extinction. Evidence of the effects of post-harvest practices on vascular plant diversity is limited by an absence of community-level studies in older, managed forests. Chronosequence studies of natural forest stands indicate that, following canopy closure, vascular plant species diversity tends to increase with time, peaking in old growth. Few understory species are restricted to, or absent from, any stage of stand development (i.e., young, mature, or old growth). However, many species differ significantly in their abundance among stages. A majority of these showed greatest abundance in old growth. Changes in levels of resources (increased shade), changes in the spatial variability of resources and environments (increased horizontal and vertical heterogeneity), and species' sensitivity to fire and slow rates of reestablishment/growth may drive these trends during natural stand development. Silvicultural prescriptions that maintain or foster spatial and temporal diversity of resources and environments will be most effective in maintaining plant species diversity. Practices associated with intensive, short-rotation plantation forestry, that preclude or delay the development of old-growth attributes, may result in long-term loss of diversity. Ultimately, it may be necessary to manage some stands on long rotations (150-300 yr) to maintain understory species that require long periods to recover from disturbance.	Halpern, Charles B.; Div.

Restoration and management techniques include wildlife stand improvement (WSI; thinning of midstory and codominant trees) and prescribed fire. We evaluated how habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected other breeding bird species. We compared avian species frequency of occurrence and abundance during 2 breeding seasons in untreated pine-hardwood stands with that in treated stands after WSI and in 3 growing seasons following WSI and prescribed fire. Total bird densities were highest (P = 0.037) in the second growing season following WSI and fire and lowest in the control, whereas species richness did not differ (P = 0.399) among treatments. Densities of ground/ shrub-foraging and shrub-nesting species increased (P = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively) the most following WSI and fire. Only ground-nesting species were more abundant (P lt 0.001) in untreated stands than in treated stands. Restoration efforts may be beneficial to neotropical migrant species such as eastern woodpewee (Contopus virens) and prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), in addition to declining species of regional interest such as red-cockaded woodpecker, Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) that depend upon pine-grassland habitats.

One successfully breeding pair was radio-monitored throughout a year. Additional telemetry data were collected in summer from a male in a pair that failed breeding. In summer the birds almost exclusively preyed upon ant colonies in soil and rotten stumps located in young conifer plantations. In winter, when snow or frost prohibited ground feeding, birds were feeding on bark-dwelling insects in old pine and dead trees. The winter shift in diet and feeding behavior was accompanied by an approximately 100 times enlargement in home range size, increasing from 50-100 ha (n = 3) in summer to 4 5005 400 ha (n = 2) in winter. With reservations due to small sample size, our data suggests that availability of winter food is critical to the Grey-headed Woodpecker when snow or frozen -round prevents ground-feeding for soil-dwelling ants.

To test this, we compared bird communities of sand pine scrub in mature forest and three disturbance treatments (1) high-intensity wildfire, salvage logged, and naturally regenerated, (2) clearcut, roller chopped, and broadcast seeded, and (3) clearcut and bracke-seeded. We analyzed communities based on residency status and nesting guilds. Migratory breeding birds were nearly restricted to mature forest. Bird communities of mature forest were significantly more species rich and diverse than those of disturbance treatments in spring. However, indicating that they are habitat-structure generalists on their wintering grounds. Canopy- and cavity-nesters and canopy- and bark-foraging species were virtually restricted to mature forest. Most species recorded in mature sand pine forest or disturbance treatments were either habitat-structure generalists or also occurred in other similarly structured vegetation types. However, the threatened and endemic Florida Scrub Jay (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) occurred only in disturbance treatments (no differences). Silvicultural disturbance appears to mimic the natural high-intensity disturbance regime by creating habitat structural features required by open scrub species may be an important habitat management tool where the use of wildfire is impractical. However, long-term effects, unsalvaged burns, and landscape patterns created by clearcutting were not addressed and may also be important in structuring bird communities of sand pine scrub.

In order to counteract continued loss of this habitat, several mitigation programs were developed in the middle Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico. Three areas ranging from 50 to 140 ha were revegetated with native trees using pole planting and cattle exclosures, and changes in vegetation structure were quantified after 2, 3, and 5 years of growth. As expected, the older site contained the most heterogeneous mix of plant species and the greatest structural diversity. We compared year-round avian use of the revegetated sites with a mature cottonwood forest site of approximately 30 years of age. As the revegetated sites matured and salient habitat features changed, the population d ynamics of individual avian species and patterns of guild structure varied. The older revegetated sites showed a greater similarity to the mature cottonwood site, suggesting that reclamation efforts established quality riparian habitats for birds in as little as 5 years. The revegetated sites appeared especially important for Neotropical-migrant birds. We suggest that a mosaic of riparian woodlands containing mixtures of native tree and shrub species of different size classes is necessary to maintain avian species richness in the middle Rio Grande drainage, and probably throughout the southwestern United States.

The number of groups and number of individuals in a 3795-ha area that was surveyed in 1977 and 1989-1990 declined by 62% and 75%, respectively. The productivity of the population was low during 1989-1990; 0.69 young were fledged per nesting attempt. To assess the adequacy of foraging habitat, forest structure was measured in an area with a high density of groups (1.95/km-2) in 1990 and in an area where the group density had declined from 2.92 groups/km-2 in 1977 to 0.74 groups/km-2 in 1990. Forest structure in both areas was adequate but approached the limits recommended in the Red-cockaded Woodpecker Recovery Plan. To determine if isolation of groups was related to population decline, we estimated nearest neighbor distances from cluster locations (a cluster is the cavity trees used by a group of woodpeckers) in 1977 and 1990. Cluster sites had longer nearest neighbor distances in 1977 than in 1990, which may indicate that isolation by distance reduces the influx of dispersing breeders from elsewhere in the population. Periodic fires occur naturally in the MCWA but have been suppressed since 1926. Re-establishment of a fire regime is important in maintaining the integrity of the MCWA and may be beneficial to its red-cockaded woodpecker population.	Kelly, Jeffrey F.; Dep. Biol., Colo.

To determine the importance of roadsides to nesting birds in intensively farmed areas, this study evaluated nest densities and nesting success of birds in roadsides in central Iowa during 1990 and 1991. One hundred and twenty nests of eight species were found in 34 roadsides (10.2 ha). Red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) nest density was greatest in roadsides with tall dense vegetation; vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) nests were most dense in areas of sparse vegetation. Gray partridge (Perdix perdix) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) nest densities were greatest in roadsides with the most residue cover. Red-winged blackbirds usually placed their nests in the bottom or in the fencerow of a roadside; all vesper sparrows nested in the short vegetation of the roadside nearest the road. Daily survival rates for the red-winged blackbird and for all species combined were 0.9471 and 0.9428, respectively. Fifty-five percent of red-wing nests and 52% of the nests of all species were destroyed by predation. Red-wing nests placed in forbs, shrubs and the fence were more successful than those built in grasses other than reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinace). Roadside management which includes seeding native grasses and forbs in roadsides may make these areas more attractive to birds that use such habitats for nesting. Fences were used by some birds in place of vegetation for nest support and should be retained in roadsides. Periodic prescribed burns in roadsides would increase the vigor and structural heterogeneity of roadside vegetation; mowing roadsides should be discouraged except at the roadside shoulder.

Conservation Biology		1994		8	3	691-704	691	704	English						10	107	Conservation and restoration ecology efforts may conserve or restore a particular image of a community, a variety of plausible images or maximum biological diversity. The choice is a policy decision that should reflect relevant history and sound science. Here I argue that common methods of conserving and restoring tallgrass prairie have a weak scientific rationale, are not consistent with plausible history, and threaten prairie biodiversity. Dormant-season burns and grazer exclusion are human interventions that may promote artificially consistent dominance of large grasses utilizing the C-4 photosynthetic pathway, thereby relegating hundreds of other prairie plants to small populations that are vulnerable to local extinction. I recommend an experimental approach to large remnant conservation and restoration in which varied conditions alter dominance, thereby increasing short-term species richness. I also recommend prescribed burning during the summer, to simulate the timing of lightning fire, and light-to-moderate grazing by different ungulates; to simulate historical grazing history. Both should favor plants that are consistently infrequent or rare in many managed prairies. Varied regimes of bum season, burn interval, and large-mammal grazing should pro mote greater overall species diversity and should more realistically represent varied conditions under which grassland taxa evolved.

Vvette Perfecto; Rathcke, Beverly									Ecological Applications		1994		4	3	423-436	423	436	English						3	27	The impacts of four different management systems on diversity of ground-foraging ants were examined to assess potential for conservation of biological diversity in human-influenced agricultural or agroforestry systems. Using a variety of indices, diversity was measured along a gradient of anthropogenically disturbed habitats. The gradient, in terms of increasing levels of disturbance, ranged from primary rain forest, abandoned cacao plantations, productive cacao plantations, to banana plantations. The primary forest and abandoned cacao plantations were situated in a reserve and the productive cacao plantations, and banana plantations were located on privately owned land within 35 km of the reserve in the Sarapiqui Valley of Costa Rica. To sample ground-foraging ants, we placed tuna baits along the ground in each habitat. Although tuna baits attract a generalist assemblage of ants that may be better able to adapt to more disturbed sites, diversity of this community was significantly reduced with increased disturbance. Ant diversity was not different for forest and abandoned cacao sites except in terms of evenness, with the forest having a more even distribution of species. Forest and abandoned cacao sites were significantly more diverse than both productive cacao and banana plantations. The latter two did not differ significantly from each other in terms of diversity, but there was considerable variability within each of these habitat types. The results of this study suggest that conservation of diversity may be possible in a "mosaic" of different land uses, but further studies, such as those addressing the importance of scale and nearby source populations, are necessary before management practices can be implemented.

The largest and probably most viable population in Europe is found in the coastal forests of western Norway. The present study was made in such an area, and is therefore the first to examine the habitat usage of a viable breeding population of White-backed Woodpeckers. The study area is situated in the Surnadal community (about 63 degree N), and covers about 250 km-2. About 85% of the forest is natural, the remainder consists of planted Norway spruce Picea abies. About 50% of the forest consists of trees older than 50 years. Birch Betula pubescens was the dominant tree species, accounting for 47% of all trees within 29 nest areas studied compared to 42% within 18 random sites of similar area. The woodpeckers preferred to nest on south-facing slopes with forest older than 80 years and avoided forest 20-50 years old. They also showed a preference for areas with a high density of aspen Populus tremula and a low density of spruce. The densities of both dead and dying trees (154 and 78 trees/ha, respectively) were higher in the breeding areas than on the random sites (105 and 48, respectively), and the proportions of dead (11-15%) and dying (5-8%) trees were higher in all DBH-classes (stem diameter at breast height; 5-10, 11-15, 16-20, gt 20 cm) for all deciduous tree species and for Scots pine Pinus sylvestris. On average, 15.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the deciduous trees within the nest area were dead or dying. The habitat surrounding the nest tree contained a higher density of aspen trees and a lower density of hazel Corylus avellana, bird cherry Prunus padus, pine and spruce trees. The White-backed Woodpeckers preferred to nest in aspen (67 of 70 nest trees, mean DBH 34.5 cm) both more frequently and in larger aspen trees than those found within the nest area. Of 36 roost trees, aspens (67%) were used more frequently, while grey alder (5%) and birch trees (28%) were used in about the same proportions as those found in the nest area. Although the woodpeckers nested or roosted in living as well as in dead trees, the heart wood of all of the trees was decayed.	Hogstad, Olav; Univ.

Journal of Ethnobiology		1994		14	1	43-57	43	57	English						0	0	The present vegetation on the shale hills of central interior Portugal is called mato. It consists of shrubs mostly in the heath (Ericaceae) and bean (Fabaceae) families. Farmers in this region harvest mato and, whenever they plant a crop, bury it in their cultivated plots to make the soil fertile. Farmers cut mato at ground level, leaving the woody root crown (caudex) just at ground level. Mato plants regrow from these caudices. They are harvested again every four years. In addition, the woody caudex of primarily one species, Erica arborea, is occasionally dug up and burned to distill a brandy-like liquid, called bagaco, from the mass of grape skins, seeds, and pulp that is left over after the fermented wine is drawn off. Interviewing and observing farmers revealed important uses of many different mato species. Sampling mato vegetation from areas regenerating from four to 30 years showed that E. arborea is competitively dominant and capable of reducing mato species diversity The slow, cool burning qualities of any caudex would be adequate for a still fire, and farmers occasionally do use different species for this. However, the practice of occasionally removing the caudex of the competitive dominant for still fires serves to maintain the variety of useful species in the mato. The somewhat unfounded explanation that E. arborea caudex is best for still fires results every fall in appropriate and timely activity, and as such may serve better than would a more ecological, long-term explanation for the same practice.

Natural Areas Journal		1994		14	2	128-135	128	135	English						1	15	The effects of spring burning and habitat-area on breeding bird communities were studied on 11 Illinois prairie fragments between 1987 and 1990. Comparisons of bird distribution and abundance patterns within prairie fragments showed three species, the Henslow's sparrow, bobolink, and grasshopper sparrow, to be most influenced by prescribed burning. Henslow's sparrows completely avoided prairie areas that had been recently burned, whereas bobolinks and grasshopper sparrows tended to be more common on recently burned prairie areas. A comparison of the relative importance of habitat-area and prescribed burning showed that habitat-area had a much greater influence on breeding bird community composition than prescribed burning. Ten of the 15 most common species examined were significantly influenced by habitat-area. An ordination of bird communities from the different prescribed burn categories showed that bird communities on small prairie fragments were, in general, more similar to one another than they were to bird communities on large prairie fragments, regardless of the current management status of the prairies. I suggest that optimal management strategies for small and large prairie fragments need not be the same. Small prairie fragments can be burned with little regard to breeding birds because the occurrence of their characteristic bird species is not significantly influenced by prescribed burning. In contrast, large prairie fragments must be managed to provide a mosaic of burned and unburned areas to ensure the availability of suitable habitat for management-sensitive bird species, species that in the Midwest are experiencing significant population declines and are predominantly restricted to large grassland areas.

Timonen, Sami; Monkkonen, Mikko; Orell, Markku									Ornis Fennica		1994		71	2	55-60	55	60	English						0	9	Herrera (1978) found an inverse relationship between relative densities of resident and migrant passerines in European breeding bird assemblages. He hypothesized that the decreasing proportion of migrants to the south would be due to interspecific competition with residents. The putative competition between resident titmice (Parus montanus and P. major) and migrant conguilders (Fringilla coelebs and Phylloscopus trochilus) was tested by a playback experiment in northern Finland. If competition was important between individual birds, it could reduce overlap between territories. The spatial configuration of the two migrant species was studied in relation to the nests of the two residents during the breeding season in late May - early June, in 1989 and 1990. The experiment was carried out at 13 (year 1989) and 17 (year 1990) tit-nest plots. To control habitat effects, the tape was also played at control plots where the tit pair had bred in the previous year and at randomly chosen plots. The data were analysed using log-linear models, which test for dependencies between categorical variables. In 1990, there were far fewer positive responses at the study points than in 1989, possibly due to changes in the population densities of the migrants. We found that migrants did not avoid settlement near or in resident territories. There was a tendency that migrants aggregated more at the vicinity of tit-nests compared with the random- and control plots. This result is consistent with the 'heterospecific attraction' hypothesis generated by Monkkonen et al. (1990).	Monkkonen, Mikko; Dep. Zool., Univ.

Although 66 bird species were recorded, numbers and species varied among years, and only 17 were nesting species. A few bird species used all vegetation types at some time, but most were limited by vegetation structure or water presence. Olney's three-square bulrush (Scirpus olneyi), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and mudflats were especially favored feeding and resting areas in response to periodic flooding and had the greatest frequency of use as well as species richness. Reduced rainfall and water depths during 1986 were reflected in a change toward birds favoring drier conditions. Heavy rainfall in 1991 decreased diversity but increased usage and favored freshwater and swimming birds. Although tidally influenced wetlands often are considered uniform, dynamic water and salinity regimes observed along this coast must be considered in the design of any management or conservation program.

The woodpecker favors mature, deciduous forests which include many dead trees. These forests have been clearcut and thinned heavily from the 1950s. Winter bird counts from the late 1950s to the 1980s show declines of over 90%. The size of the present population is estimated at 30-50 breeding pairs. Fledging success and adult survival rate are not exceptionally low compared to the results of other studies but juvenile mortality appears to be very high as the recruitment rate is low. The breeding population is also very sparse: the mean distance between nearest nests was 15 km. In order to preserve the white-backed woodpecker from extinction in Finland a network of deciduous forests favored by the woodpecker has been proposed.	Virkkala, Raimo; Dep. Zool., P.O.

We present an approach for managing the habitats of terrestrial vertebrates at the landscape scale on multiple-use lands. The approach is based on the hypothesis that animal community response to landscape change is a function of species life histories and local patterns of landscape change. Key steps are: (1) set clear objectives; (2) associate target species with specific habitat configurations; (3) assess the potential sensitivity of species by mapping habitat suitability and examining species life histories; (4) evaluate alternative management prescriptions using simulation models; and ( 5) implement preferred or experimental strategies and monitor the responses of habitats and species. The approach was demonstrated for a watershed in western Oregon (USA). Management objectives were to maximize habitat diversity for early- and late-successional bird species and to produce saw timber at levels compatible with the habitat goals. Habitat associations of 51 bird species were described by four variables that encompass three spatial scales. An analysis of species sensitivity to landscape change revealed several species that may merit special attention. the landscape model LSPA and the gap model ZELIG.PNW were used to simulate four disturbance/management scenarios over a 140-yr period: natural fire, wood production, multiple use, and no action. The results indicated that 65% more saw timber would be produced under the wood production run than the multiple-use run, but the former would maintain habitats for many fewer bird species than the latter. The multiple-use scenario was selected as the preferred alternative. We suggest carrying out management experiments and rigorous monitoring during the implementation phase. While this approach has various limitations, it is an incremental step towards the effective management of species diversity on multiple-use lands.	Hansen, Andrew J.; Biol. Dep., Mont.

C. Z.									Emu		1993		93	2	100-120	100	120	English						0	7	The bird species composition of 88 patches of monsoon rainforest in the Kakadu National Park area of the Northern Territory was examined in the period April-November 1987. The monsoon rainforest avifauna is a 'cut-and-paste' community, comprising species derived from wet tropical rainforests, from Eucalyptus open forests, from mangroves, from paperbrak woodlands and habitat generalist species. Its composition may be seasonally unstable, and is re-arranged between monsoon rainforests of differing floristics or environment. For most bird species considered the distribution was well associated with a division of monsoon rainforests into six groups: coastal, subcoastal, lowland springs, sandstone springs, escarpment and rock outcrop. Escarpment and rock outcrop rainforests were relatively depauperate. Monsoon rainforests are fragmented into small patches. The distribution of many characteristic rainforest birds (e.g. Orange-footed Scrub-fowl, Rainbow Pitta, Grey Whistler), bird species diversity and a Conservation Index were correlated with patch size. Bird species more typical of Eucalyptus open forests were abundant in patches most disturbed by buffalo, pigs, weeds and fire. No species were particularly associated with the edges of monsoon rainforests, but several open forest species occurred more commonly at edges than in the interior of monsoon rainforests (e.g. Barshouldered Dove, White-throated Honeyeater and Double-barred Finch). Birds occurring in monsoon rainforests are probably highly vagile, a response mainly to the marked seasonality of the environment and the fragmented nature of monsoon rainforests.

The recent erosion coincides with a rise in MHT-level in the last 25 years. Despite the decrease in area, sedimentation continues, especially in the lower salt marsh, which acts as a sink of nitrogen. Assimilation and mineralization of nitrogen are in balance in most plant communities along the gradient from lower to higher salt marshes. Mineralization of nitrogen increases towards the higher salt marsh, whereas the above-ground production and the mean nitrogen content of plants decrease. There is a positive correlation between quality of food plants in salt marshes and breeding success of Brent geese in the arctic tundra. Sedimentation on mainland salt marshes can compensate for the expected sea level rise. This is not the case for island salt marshes, if the relative sea level rise is more than 0.5-1.0 cm yr-1. The natural succession on salt marshes results in an accumulation of organic material, which is related to the dominance of single plant species. It is not clear to which extent this process is enhanced by eutrophication from acid deposition and seawater. Human exploitation of unprotected salt marshes is old and heavy in the system of mound settlements. Reclamation rates by dikes in the last centuries were higher than the rate of area increase. Grazing by cattle as a management practice results in both a higher plant species-richness and community diversity than abandoning; hay-making is intermediate, but shows less structural diversity than grazing with low stocking density. The invertebrate fauna is favoured by a short period of abandoning, but eventually characteristic salt marsh invertebrates are replaced by inland species. Many bird species prefer grazed salt marshes. The final section gives some perspectives. Provided that no further embankments take place the optimal nature management option for plants and animals is a vegetation pattern, which includes areas with a low canopy (grazed) and areas with a tall canopy.

Journal of Wildlife Management		1993		57	2	291-301	291	301	English						1	29	Grazing by livestock is often used to reduce litter, improve plant vigor, and alter plant species composition, but additional information is needed on the effects of these management practices on upland-nesting birds. Thus, we conducted an experimental study of the effect of grazing on nest density and nest success of upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) in southcentral North Dakota from 1981 to 1987. Our experimental design consisted of 4 treatments and 1 control, each applied to 1 field in each of 3 study areas. The treatments represented options available to grassland managers: spring grazing, autumn grazing, autumn-and-spring grazing, season-long grazing, and control (ungrazed during the study). Nests (n = 342) were found by searching study areas with a cable-chain drag. Nest density was lower (P = 0.006) for treatments where cattle were present (spring, autumn-and-spring, and season-long) than where cattle were not present (autumn and control) during the nesting season. We concluded that grazing during the nesting season reduced the nest density of upland sandpipers. Nest success varied among years (P = 0.01) and was low in the first year of grazing and higher at the end of the study period. We found little evidence that the grazing treatment influenced nest success. We recommend that public lands with breeding populations of upland sandpipers include a complex of fields under various management practices, including fields undisturbed during the nesting season.

Journal of Wildlife Management		1993		57	2	335-345	335	345	English						0	10	We determined home range size and habitats used by pileated woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus) to provide essential information for proper management of the species in northeastern Oregon. Twenty-three pileated woodpeckers fitted with transmitters were followed for 5-10 months (Jun-Mar) during 1989-90. Mated pairs (n = 7) ranged over smaller areas ( hivin x = 407 ha) than birds ( hivin x = 597 ha) whose mates had died (n = 9). Habitat use within home ranges was not random. Stands with old growth, grand fir (Abies grandis), no logging, and gtoreq 60% canopy closure were used more (P lt 0.01) than expected, and all other types of stands were used less than expected. From June until March, 38% of the observations of foraging were on downed logs, 38% on dead trees, 18% on live trees, and 6% on stumps. We recommend that management for pileated woodpeckers in northeastern Oregon include increasing density of snags for nesting and foraging, increasing density of downed logs in foraging areas, and increasing management areas from the existing 121 ha to 364 ha of forest. Within these areas, we recommend that 75% be in grand fir forest type; 25% be old growth; and the remainder be mature stands; at least 50% have gtoreq 60% canopy closure; and at least 40% be unlogged with the remainder in mature stands.

There was a significant positive relationship between species richness and wetland size, but the age of the restored wetland had no effect on species richness in either year. Birds rapidly colonized restored wetlands, usually within the first year of restoration. Duration of drainage was not related to species richness but did affect the development of marsh vegetation. Relative coverage of emergents, floating plants, open water, and bare ground affected bird species richness. Restoration efforts should concentrate on large wetland basins that have been recently drained or have a tendency to reflood frequently.	Iowa Dep. Nat. Resources, Wildlife Res.

Gerald									Wildlife Monographs		1993		0	123	1-41	1	41	English						0	9	The conventional approach to maintaining biological diversity generally has been to proceed species by species and threat by threat. We suggest that piecemeal approaches are not adequate by themselves to address the accelerating extinction crisis and, furthermore, they contribute to an unpredictable ecological and economic environment. Here, we describe a methodology called Gap Analysis, which identifies the gaps in representation of biological diversity (biodiversity) in areas managed exclusively or primarily for the long-term maintenance of populations of native species and natural ecosystems (hereinafter referred to as biodiversity management areas). Once identified, gaps are filled through new reserve acquisitions or designations, or through changes in management practices. The goal is to ensure that all ecosystems and areas rich in species diversity are represented adequately in biodiversity management areas. We believe this proactive strategy will eliminate the need to list many species as threatened or endangered in the future. Gap Analysis uses vegetation types and vertebrate and butterfly species (and/or other taxa, such as vascular plants, if adequate distributional data are available) as indicators of biodiversity. Maps of existing vegetation are prepared from satellite imagery (LANDSAT) and other sources and entered into a geographic information system (GIS). Because entire states or regions are mapped, the smallest area identified on vegetation maps is 100 ha. Vegetation maps are verified through field checks and examination of aerial photographs. Predicted species distributions are based on existing range maps and other distributional data, combined with information on the habitat affinities of each species. Distribution maps for individual species are overlaid in the GIS to produce maps of species richness, which can be created for any group of species of biological or political interest. An additional GIS layer of land ownership and management status allows identification of gaps in the representation of vegetation types and centers of species richness in biodiversity management areas through a comparison of the vegetation and species richness maps with ownership and management status maps. Underrepresented plant communities (e.g., present on only 1 or 2 biodiversity management areas or with a small total acreage primarily managed for biodiversity) also can be identified in this manner. Realization of the full potential of Gap Analysis requires regionalization of state data bases and use of the data in resource management and planning. Gap Analysis is a powerful and efficient first step toward setting land management priorities. It provides focus, direction, and accountability for conservation efforts. Areas identified as important through Gap Analysis can then be examined more closely for their biological qualities and management needs. As a coarse-filter approach to conservation evaluation, Gap Analysis is not a pancrea. Limitations related to minimum mapping unit size (where small habitat patches are missed), failure to distinguish among most seral stages, failure to indicate gradual ecotones, and other factors must be recognized so that Gap Analysis can be supplemented by more intensive inventories.

Wilson Bulletin		1993		105	2	239-255	239	255	English						0	11	I examined the effects of even-aged clear-cutting (third cutting cycle) on wintering and breeding bird communities at the Barrens Grouse Habitat Management Area (HMA) in central Pennsylvania (USA), 1987-1989. It tested the hypotheses that community structure and population abundance of wintering and breeding birds did not differ (1) among areas of the Barrens Grouse HMA that varied in extent of clear-cutting (0%, 50%, and 75% areas) or (2) among habitats of different age since clear-cutting on the treated sector (50% and 75% areas). These findings were compared to those obtained subsequent to a second cutting cycle. Abundance of 11 species of wintering birds did not vary (P gt 0.05) among the three areas. Species richness of all species combined and of ground-shrub foragers was high in the 50% and 75% areas after the third cycle, largely because of additional brushy vegetation. Abundances of all species combined and of ground-shrub foragers were greater than expected in the 75% area but lower than expected in the 0% and 50% areas; abundance of sallier-canopy foragers was greater than expected in the 0% area and less in the 75% area. Two Neotropical migrants, Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) and Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), were more sensitive than other area-dependent species to increased fragmentation via forest clear-cutting resulting from the third cycle. I conclude that the creation of a mosaic of small (1 ha), even-aged stands for management of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) habitat does not have a detrimental long-term effect on most species of breeding and wintering forest birds on a localized basis.

The present study, conducted at a degraded coastal pasture site in Puerto Rico, compares 4.5-year-old Albizia lebbek (L.) Benth. plantation stands and adjacent control areas with respect to biomass production, understorey species diversity and nutrient storage patterns within vegetation, forest floor organic matter, and mineral soil compartments. Mineral soil (0-20 cm depth) organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) were both significantly higher in plantation plots (1.70% OC, 0.095% TN) than in control plots (1.44% OC 0.074% TN), while available phosphate and exchangeable cations were similar between treatments. Standing crop biomass of understorey vegetation, forest floor organic matter and fine (less than 2 mm) roots averaged 160 g m-2, 349 g m-2. and 362 g m-2 in the plantation plots and 420 g m-2, 311 g m-2, and 105 g m-2 in the control plots. Nitrogen concentrations within each of these biomass components were, however, consistently higher in the plantation plots. Plantation understorey species appear to be efficient 'scavengers' of biologically fixed nitrogen, and appear to help buffer the system against leaching losses. Species richness was considerably greater in plantation than control plots for grasses, vines, and forbs. Seedlings of several secondary forest species were abundant in the plantation understorey but absent in control plots, suggesting an important role for such plantation in accelerating natural regeneration of native forest species on certain sites.

Thirty-three species were recorded in each woodland type and the overall breeding bird density was similar in each, with Blue Tit and Chaffinch the most abundant species. Measurements at each point showed significant habitat differences between the 2 woodland types although there was much overlap and, particularly in the plantations, considerable variaton in structure. The habitat variables were used to distinguish those points where the structure was typical of the plantation from those where the structure was more characteristic of the pasture woodlands. Seven species were more numerous in areas where the structure was typical of the plantations (Blue Tit, Chaffinch, Robin, Treecreeper, Coal Tit, Blackbird and Mistle Thrush) and three species (Great Tit, Willow Warbler and Jackdaw) were more numerous in typical pasture woodlands. Estimates of the volume of dead wood were made at each point but, with the possible exception of redstart, no species were found to be strongly associated with this.

Consequently, we studied breeding bird populations in an extensively forested region of southern Missouri (USA) to determine if the numbers of breeding birds differed between areas (n = 9) managed by the clearcutting method (CCM), and areas (n = 9) of mature forest with no recent timber harvest or other disturbances (NOHVST). Three forest interior migrants had lower (P < 0.06) mean densities on CCM sites than NOHVST sites; 3 had greater (P < 0.03) densities on CCM sites; and densities of 3 others did not differ (P > 0.40) between treatments. All early successional migrants had greater (P < 0.01) densities on CCM sites. Numbers of 2 avian nest predators and a brood parasite did not differ (P > 0.20) on CCM and NOHVST sites. Densities of 9 species differed (P < 0.10) among regeneration, sapling, and pole-sawtimber habitats on CCM sites. While clearcutting reduced numbers of forest interior birds that were dependent on mature forest habitats, other forest interior species made extensive use of early and mid-successional even-aged stands and occurred in greater numbers on CCM sites.

Predictions based on these two hypotheses were evaluated using June population estimates on burned and unburned tallgrass prairie over the decade, 1981-1990, on Konza Prairie Research Natural Area, Kansas [USA]. The results of these analyses support the notion that drought tolerance is the primary factor determines membership in the tallgrass prairie community. When drought and fire are coincidental, however, the community does respond in a manner commensurate with saturation hypothesis by a reduction in bird abundances but not a decrease in species richness.

Breeding populations of 12 species [Mallard, Anas platyhynchos, Upland Sandpiper, Bartramia longicauda, Eastern Kingbird, Tyrannus tyrannus, Horned Lark Eremophila alpestris, Black-billed Magpie, Pica pica, Sprague's Pipit, Anthus spragueii, Clay-coloured Sparrow, Spizella pallida, Vesper Sparrow, Pooecetes gramineus, Savannah Sparrow, Ammodramus bairdii, Western Meadowlark, Sturnella neglecta, Brewer's Blackbird, Euphagus cyanocephalus] were recorded on 12.9 ha burned plot and an adjacent 5.6 ha unburned plot, each with similar vegetation. The two most common species, Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sanwichensis) and Clay-coloured Sparrow (Spizella pallida) were both adversely affected by the burn. By the third post-burn year, density of Savannah Sparrows was 68% of the value (1.70 pairs/ha) observed in the unburned area, while Clay-coloured Sparrows were only 33% of the density (1.07 pairs/ha) noted in the unburned area. Other important species, Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii) and Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) were adversely affected initially by the burn but by the third year, population densities in the burned and unburned areas were comparable. Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) did not use the burned area in the first year, but as the grassy canopy became reestablished, the burned area was utilized at moderate densities in the second year, and in the third post-burn year densities were identical in burned and unburned areas (0.27 pairs/ha). Only the Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) showed a preference for the burned area in the first year after the burn.

There were many old and decayed trees, down logs, and abundnat mast. The forest were dynamic, changing with plant succession and influenced by numerous other factors such as fire, insects, disease, ice and wind storms, flooding and activities of native Americans. Most early accounts describe a plethora of wildlife in the diverse forests. Bird communities were abundant and diverse, probably with numerous cavity nesters and species associated with mature forests. The passenger pigeon and Carolina parakeet, once abundant and widely distributed in these forests, are extinct today. Early records reveal that the eastern wild turkey was abundant enough to be a food staple for early settlers. The red-cockaded woodpecker was probably abundant in the frequently burned longleaf pine forests of the Southeast. Squirrels and white-tailed deer were abundant in the diverse forests. Deer were a diet staple of native Americans and the hides became a major item of commerce. Large carnivores, such as black bears and cougars, were relatively abundant.

Three locations in the northern (Mt. Hood), central (H.J. Andrews), and southern (Rogue River-Umpqua) portions of this physiographic region were studied in 1984; in 1985, only the central location was studied. A total of 70 species was detected in 1984 in 56 Douglas-fir stands ranging in age from 30 to 450 years. Species richness values were similar for all locations in 1984 but increased slightly between years at H.J. Andrews to 62 species (from 56) in 1985. Numbers of bird species did not differ across the chronosequence (old, mature, young) or moisture gradient (dry, mesic, wet) in either year. The hermit warbler was the most common species encounter in 1984, and the winter wren the most common species at H.J. Andrews in both 1984 and 1985. Locational differences were found for particular species, and the birds segregated out on the basis of elevation, latitude, and longitude and-where they shared the same environments-on the basis of resource utilization. Species associated with older stands, based on significant correlations with stand age or old-growth stands in the chronosequence, were the brown creeper, chestnut-backed chickadee, hairy woodpecker, rufous hummingbird, varied thrush, and winter wren. Two other species that were, with small sample sizes, significantly associated with old growth in 1984 were Vaux's swift and the olive-sided flycatcher; the red-breasted sapsucker was found only in old growth. In 1985, the evening grosbeak and western flycatcher were significantly associated wtih stand age, and Copper's hawk, blue grouse, Hutton's vireo, red crossbill, and Vaux's swift were found only in old-growth stands. In all, 17 species over the 2 years of study were significantly associated with either the dry or wet portion of the moisture gradient. Hutton's vireo and Swainson' thrush were found only in wet stands in 1985. At Andrews, however, 14 species changed their use of the moisture grdient from dry to mesic or wet between 1984 and 1985. The variability found among locations and between years in bird detections suggested considerable flux in the way avian species selected habitats and that environmental factors and interspecific competition were important in modifying the relations of avian species to habitat but not necessarily to vegetative structure. A few (5-6) species dominated the avifauna (> 60 percent of all detections), and most were common in all age-classes. The only important old-growth associates may be some of the rarer species, such as Vaux's swift; spotted owl management prescriptions may accommodate the needs of these and other species. The vegetative structure in the young stands studied, which were all fire-derived, had similar characteristics to that of the old-growth stands. Thus, our findings are probably not represensitive of the avifauna that might be found in managed stands of similar ages.

Stands were surveyed six times each spring using 8-minute counts at 12 counting stations spaced 150 or 100 m apart. More than 115,000 birds were detected. We counted 41 species that regularly used Douglas-fir forests > 40 years old, after the exclusion of raptorial nocturnal, and poorly detected species. The most widespread and abundant species were chestnut-backed chickadee, western flycatcher, winter wren, hermit and Townsend's warblers, and golden-crowned kinglet. All bird species significantly more abundant in forests > 80 years old in at least two of three regions at P .ltoreq. 0.10 were hole or bark nesters: red-breasted sapsucker, brown creeper, chestnut-backed chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, and Vaux's swift. Results suggested that patterns of bird abundance were regionally distinct, even though the study design differed between regions. Total bird abundance, species richness, and bird abundance in four spatial-foraging guilds (aerial, bark, canopy, and understory) were significantly higher in the Oregon Coast Ranges than in the southern Washington or Oregon Cascade Range. Aerial and bark guilds showed strong differences among age-classes: the aerial guild reached its highest abundance in young and old growth and the bark guild was least abundant in young and highest in old growth. Vegetation characteristics used for multiple linear regression models predicted only a small proportion of the variance in bird abundance.

Naturally regenerated Douglas-fir/western hemlock forest stands were sampled, representing one of three general age-classes: young (55-80 years), mature (95-190 years), and old-growth (210-730 years). Stands within the old-growth age-class also represented a variety of moisture conditions. Woodpeckers showed no clear and consistent abundance patterns among forest age- and moisture-classes. Vaux's swifts were consistently more abundant in old-growth stands (all moisture-classes) in both 1984 and 1985. During both 1984 and 1985, chestnut-backed chickadees were most abundant in wet old-growth stands, red-breasted nuthatches were most abundant in dry old-growth stands, and brown creepers were most abundant in mesic old-growth stands. In general, counts of most of the bird species we studied were lowest and most variable in young and mature stands. We found few consistent bird-habitat correlations. Numbers of both chestnut-backed chickadees and Vaux's swifts correlated most strongly with density of live trees > 100 cm in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.), and swift counts correlated with density of snags > 50 cm d.b.h. Except for swifts, relative abundances of snag-dependent bird species were not well-predicted by densities of snags, perhaps because all forest stands sampled were naturally regenerated and contained numerous snags. Except for chestnut-backed chickadees, few nests of any cavity-nesting species were found in young stands. Most of the chickadee nests found in young stands, however, were in old remnant snags, not in trees produced in the current stands. Cavity nesters disproportionally selected large, hard snags for nesting. In particular, selection of hard snags by hairy woodpeckers in this study area contrasted with findings of other studies in the Pacific Northwest, on which current management guidelines have been based. Woodpeckers and creepers used western white pine snags disproportionately, but chickadees and nuthatches nested primarily in Douglas-fir and western hemlock. Disproprionate use of certain tree species for nesting was probably closely related to their decay characteristics. Sample plots centered on nest trees of all species contained higher densities of large, hard snags than randomly sampled vegetation plots. Management recommendations for Douglas-fir forests of the Washington Cascades include retention of tall, hard snags .gtoreq. 76 cm d.b.h. for all species. White pine snags are particularly important for woodpeckers and creepers, and Douglas-fir and western hemlock snags should be retained for chickadees and nuthatches. In designing snag-retention areas, managers should provide adequate snag distribution over large areas, live-tree replacement, and patches of older stands.

The biodiversity issue arises from educated concern that the earth's diversity of life is threatened and is diminishing at an accelerated rate. An appropriate yardstick for biodiversity programs is how they affect the persistence of viable populations-populations that occur with sufficient gene pools, over large enough areas, with the requisite environments of perpetuate the organisms or ecosystems. Biodiversity is often erroneously understood to mean species diversity within stands or communities: the biodiversity concern is not about the local diversity of flora and fauna, but whether species or ecosystems are threatened. A coordinated program of biodiversity research could be structured under three overlapping subject areas: (1) threatened, endangered, and sensitive species; (2) restoration of missing, underrepresented, or declining communities; and (3) general principles and procedures for ecosystem restoration and perpetuation.

Nearly half of the oak/palmetto scrub was intentionally burned midway through the study. The prescribed fire altered avian community composition for at least 6 months in areas where nearly all the vegetation burned. Twenty years after clearing of an area of oak/palmetto scrub, the regenerated oak-scrub habitat differed from adjacent oak/palmetto scrub in having more bare ground (15.5 vs. 0.8%), a taller shrub layer (272 vs. 161 cm) composed primarily of oak species without saw palmetto and more herbaceous species (11 vs. 3). Compared with oak/palmetto scrub, disturbed oak scrub had more breeding bird species that were abundant enough to allow density estimation (8 vs. 4) and supported a higher density of the Florida scrub jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens), a threatened subspecies. These data suggest that disturbed areas can represent important wildlife habitat in scrub-dominated landscapes, but because effects of mechanical disturbance last for very long periods, the use of mechanical disturbance as a habitat management tool should be applied cautiously.

To understand the role of habitat loss in this decline, we examined patterns of habitat occupancy by this species in two areas of South Carolina [USA]. At both sites we recorded relatively high densities of breeding sparrows in mature (> 80 yr old) pine stands, and relatively low densities in young pine stands. Habitat occupancy varied between sites in clearcuts and middle-aged pine stands. Sparrows used areas with open understories and dense ground covers of grasses and forbs. Habitat occupancy differed between the two main study areas because these preferred vegetation characteristics were found in different habitats in the two areas. Timber management practices (especially burning rotations, site-preparation techniques, and thinning) have a strong effect on understory vegetation and, therefore, habitat suitability for the sparrow. Management practices that produce suitable habitat for Re-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) also provide habitat for Bachman's Sparrow. We believe that, even though the sparrow may use open habitats that appear to be relatively common, its habitat requirements are relatively strict, and that habitat loss may be an important factor in this species' population decline.

Thirty-five bird species were recorded with a total density of 29.9 individuals ha-1 of which 8 species, Goldcrest, Chaffinch, Spotted Flycatcher, Coal Tit, Crested Tit, Siskin, Tree-creeper and Redstart, constituted 85% of numbers. Detrended correspondence analysis which was used to ordinate vegetation at point count locations from which 14 groups of bird counts were analysed across the habitat gradients. Two axes, representing increasing openness of canopy (axis I) and decreasing shrubbiness (axis II), were identified. Total bird density declined significantly with openness of canopy and increased significantly with increasing (a) pine density, (b) maximum tree height, (c) frequency of dead woods on the ground and in the canopy. Crested Tit, Goldcrest, and Coal Tit showed species-habitat correlations. Crested Tit density for axis I was positively correlated with the frequency of dead wood in the canopy. Only Crested Tit showed a habitat association with vegetation variables from axis II: density declined with an increase in percentage cover of the 0.3-1.0 m shrub layer.

The number of bird species relative to sample size did not differ significantly between the silvicultural mosaics and old forest. However, in the silvicultural mosaics the total bird abundance was only about one third of that in the reference area. The relative abundances of different species also differed considerably. We divided the bird species into five groups on the basis of their observation frequencies and the way in which they used the silvicultural mosaics. The mosaics provided nesting habitats for the most common forest birds and for species favouring open habitats and forest edges. All other forest species visited the mosaics more or less irregularly. The total bird abundance in the silvicultural mosaics increased with habitat diversity, habitat productivity and the proportion of forested habitats. The effects of management practices on birds are discussed.

The censused community showed a rather high complexity, lower however than in similar forests of Central Europe, but higher than in Northern Europe. The lack or rarity, at Camaldoli, of many bird species which have their maximun dominance values in Central Europe seems to explain the lower complexity of Camaldoli bird community. Only Firecrest, Blackcap and Wren reach at Camaldoli maximum dominance values for this kind of habitat.

The combined effects of fire and drought were surprisingly limited. Similar numbers of species were recorded in each year and differences in species composition involved only rare visitors to the plot. Colour-banding indicated population declines in at least six resident species. The greatest decline was that of the Brown Thornbill (Acanthiza pusilla), from 20 pairs to 10 pairs. In general, insectivorous birds were most abundant and widespread on the plot during the first year, before the fire. In contrast, nomadic birds feeding on flowers or fruits were most abundant in the second year, when there was a prolific flowering and fruting of several important food plants. After the fire, at least ten bird species avoided the burnt ridges and became more concentrated in the unburnt gullies. Most were species associated with dense shrub thickets, the layer of vegetation most affected by the fire. It seems that gullies are major refuge areas in these forests and are the key to the resilience of the bird community to fire and drought.

Birds were surveyed at 39 sites within 31 eucalypt communities, which were, in turn, scored by altitude, temperature, rainfall, basal areas of trees and levels of the nutrients, nitrogen phosphorus, potassium and magnesium in the eucalypt foliage. Ninety bird species were recorded. Numbers per site, averaged over the whole sample period, ranged between 20 and 38 over all surveys, 24 and 42 in 'summer' (October to March) when migrant species were present, and 13 and 38 in 'winter' (April to September). A forward stepwise Poisson regression model was used to fit bird species richness to the environmental variables. Over all surveys and in 'summer', foliar magnesium and tree basal area (including the basal area of dead trees) were significantly (positive) correlated with the number of bird species. In 'winter' the correlations were with altitude and temperature (both negative), presumably the result of emigration of species that avoid cold weather, and tree basal area (positive). The positive association of number of species over all surveys and in 'summer' with tree basal area, including dead trees, and foliar magnesium may index the level of forest maturity and productivity. Forest management directed solely to timber production reduces the basal area and the number of dead trees and may thereby reduce bird species richness permanently. A methodology is offered, based on the relationship between the physical environment and the more productive eucalypt communities, for determining forest areas containing the most species of birds.

Counts conducted on Keauhou Ranch, Island of Hawaii, at 6-month intervals, from December 1977/January 1978 through June/July 1983, showed that species richness and bird abundance were lower in the mechanically cleared or treated plots than on an adjacent control plot. In the treated plots, the nonnative Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), and the Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea) were found in higher abundance than native species and they also were the first to recolonize following treatment. The most successful recolonizing species in the treated plots was the Japanese White-eye. Although endangered forest passerines were present in the adjacent control plot, they were not found in the treated plots. Seasonal differences in the number of birds detected in the treated plots were only observed for the native Apapane (Himatione sanguinea); it was found in high numbers following initial clearing, but subsequently declined, remaining stable through the study period.

The composition of the bird community and the numbers of birds present in any given heathland appeared to be dependent on the years since the last fire. Thirty-nine species were inconsistent user of the habitat. Some of these species were migrants while others were either irregular visitors occurring throughout the year or predictable visitors that take advantage of specific short-lived abundances of food (e.g. carrion after fires or the annual production of nectar or seeds). The longer a heathland was unburnt the smaller the number of inconsistent species recorded visiting that heathland. Of the 15 bird species consistently using the heathlands, 12 were breeding residents, including the Ground Parrot and Southern Emu-wren. The variable patterns of post-fire recolonisation exhibited by the consistent species was attributed to the changing structure of the preferred microhabitats and the availability of food. A minimum seven to eight year fire-free interval is suggested if viable populations of most resident species are to be maintained.

We surveyed birds and measured habitat variables on 90 study plots. Principle components (PC) and cluster analysis were used to group 24 species of birds into 4 seral assoications. The 4 avian assemblages were associated with young clearcuts; pole and mature stands with dense understories; mature deciduous stands; and mature, mixed deciduous-coniferous stands. Habitat attributes responsible for the classification were related to cannopy heihgt and volume, understory density, tree diameter, number of snags, and basal area of deciduous and coniferous trees. Managers can encourage the presence of all species assemblages by maintaining a mixture of forest age classes.

Our objective was to examine yearly trends in bird abundance in relation to changing vegetation structure and composition and in relation to yearly weather variation. From 1969 to 1983 shrub cover on the burned plot increased from about 22% to over 43%, and density of overstory trees increased by about 50%. Herb and grass cover decreased during this period, as did density of snags originally resulting from the fire. During this period of rapid postfire succession, total density of birds was nearly equal on the two plots but species richness increased on the burned plot compared with the unburned plot. Ground- and brush-foraging birds were more numerous on the burned plot, and their population size increased significantly from 1966 to 1985. Foliage-searching birds were more numerous on the unburned plot, and their populations were stable over time relative to the burned plot. In contrast, numbers of foliage-searching birds increased significantly on the burned plot. Bark-gleaning birds declined on the burned plot, probably in response to loss of snags used for nesting by most of these species. Variations in weather, as indicated by measures of temperature and precipitation, did not explain yearly variations in bird populations. Rather, changing vegetation structure resulted in predictable trends related to the foraging and nesting habits of the birds we studied.

Plots included two segments of moderately-disturbed hill forest, a remnant patch of humid ravine forest surrounded by young coffee, a mature coffee plantation with remnant natural forest overstory, and a sub-mature teak monoculture. Species-number and diversity (H') were measured to be highest in the two hill forest plots. Equitability was highest in the Teak plot. Population numbers were highest in one of the forest plots and the Coffee plot. 'Over-dominance" by tramp species was exhibited in the Coffee plot, in which the three most common bird species (two bulbuls and a white-eye) comprised more than half of the indiviudals censused. All censuses were dominated by non-forest and forest-edge species; few raptors and species larger than 100 g were recorded in censuses. The patch of Ravine Forest was species-poor and yet supported several unusual species (e.g., Abbott's Babbler Malacocincla abbotti, Blue Chat Erithacus brunneus and Little Spiderhunter Arachnothera longirostris) found on no other plot. We suggest that: (1) the few remaining undisturbed tracts of moist deciduous and semi-evergreen forest should be declared natural reserves with complete protection from disturbance; (2) future forestry development in upland southeastern India should exclude teak monoculture except on badly disturbed or clear-felled areas. Preferred development would feature coffee/pepper plantation under maximum natural overstory, interspersed with remnant forest tracts for faunal and watershed protection. Such a combination would appear to have the least effect on the original forest avifauna.

These isolated woodlands in Springfield, Massachusetts, provided breeding habitats for a wider variety of birds (77 species) than previously described for other urban habitats (e.g. four times as many species as found in urban residential areas in the same city in a previous study). The size of the woodland was the primary influence on bird diversity in these woodlands, explaining 79 and 75% of the variation in total species richness and the Shannon-Weaver index of bird species diversity respectively. Other woodland characteristics that played a significant role in determining the variety of bird species were the density of buildings in the area immediately adjacent to the woods, density of shrubs within the woods, distance to the nearest trail, distance to the nearest body of water and average canopy height. Percentage of coniferous tree cover was the most important variable in explaining the variation in the number of birds detected at a sampling point (R2 = 0.26). Information on the distance to the nearest trail, distance to the nearest body of water and distance to the nearest extensive forest area were also important in determining the number of bird sightings. The size of the woodland (1-69 ha) played an important role in the distribution of individual bird species. About half of all species observed in these woodlands were more commonly found in the larger woods (43-69 ha). Eight species were more abundant in the smallest woodlands (1-5 ha), and a few others were apparently insensitive to the size of the woodland. Specific recommendations are made to improve the design and management of urban woodlands for enrichment of the avifauna within a city.

A 1983 wildfire caused 100% sagebrush mortality at Custer Battlefield National Monument, converting an Artemisia shrubsteppe into a pure high plains grassland. We examined avian habitat use in 1985-1986 on the burn and an adjacent unburned site. The burn supported a much lower variety and abundance of nesting birds than the unburned shrubsteppe. Lark buntings (Calamospiza melanocorys), lark sparrows (Chondestes grammacus), and Brewer's sparrows (Spizella breweri) occupied patches of unburned habitat with higher than average sagebrush canopy, and they completely avoided the burn. Grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) also were significantly more abundant on the unburned site. Only western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) were equally abundant in both areas, while no species was more common in the burned grassland.

Wooded draw vegetation was dominated by green ash, which occurred in 96% of the draws sampled. Chokecherry and juneberry were the most freuqent shrub species. I recorded 49 bird species in the 30 draws censused. Rufous-sided towhee, brown-headed cowbird, house wren, and American goldfinch were the most numerous bird species present. Significant correlations were found between (1) the number of live trees and bird species evenness, (2) density of dead trees and bird species diversity and richness, (3) density of shrubs with bird species evenness, and (4) foliage volume in the high ground layer and bird species evenness.

A total of 31 plant species comprising nine trees, 14 shrubs and eight climbers and 40 bird species were identified. Higher species richness and abundance of birds were recorded at the edge of the scrub than in the interior. This is explained with reference to edge effect. More birds visited Wolf Hill from October to February than in other months which may be correlated with the abundance of insects and availability of fruits. Ring dove had the highest density of 1123 birds per sq. km and granivorous birds contributed 51% of the total bird biomass. Impact of fire wood cutting on three bird species is discussed.

Birds were counted along shrubby and shrubless transects during the 1982 breeding season. Species richness and total density of birds were greater on shrubby transects. Five species were more abundant on shrubby transects. Availability of woody nesting substrates best explained differences in bird species abundances. Differences in shrub coverages between transects were probably the result of different land-use practices. Land management practices which modify shrub coverages can alter the composition of passerine bird communities.

Data were collected in paired samples on 80 species of birds from January 1983 to May 1984. The CA provided more habitat requirements for more individuals and species of birds throughout the year than the BA. Nonresidents used highly seasonal food sources that were little used by resident species. The BA was an adequate foraging area only during the spring and did not offer the same variety of vegetation types as the CA. Fire was found to decrease bird species richness in coastal sage scrub, unlike the pattern found in chaparral bird communities.

During the summers of 1978 and 1979, a random sample of 816 snags (standing dead trees) was studied in central New York [USA]. Sixty-seven percent of the sample was in mature maple (Acer spp.)-ash (Fraxinus spp.)-elm (Ulmus spp.), the remainder was in 2nd growth woodland. A set of 21 characteristics of snags and 19 characteristics of forest sites was analyzed to determine which best predicted bird use. Use was defined as the presence of .gtoreq. 1 bird cavity in a snag or a forest site. Forest characteristics were sampled in randomly located 0.049-ha circles (N=61) in 1979. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that forest characteristics (total snag basal area, tree species diversity, and number of tree species) were more reliable predictors of bird use than were snag characteristics (diameter at breast height [dbh], amount of bark, height, and species). Snag management based on selecting suitable forest sites and on maintaining or creating suitable snags within those sites is recommended. Use of logistic regression models by field managers is discussed.

A portion of this area was subsequently slash-burnt and aerially sown in 1982, while the rest of the area was left unburnt and unsown. A monthly bird census was conducted during 1983-1984 in surrounding uncut, mature forest and also on the clearfelled area. Species were recorded together with the habitat in which they occurred and the particular plant species being utilised. A total of 46 avian species were recorded during the monthly censuses, with most species and individuals being observed in the spring months. The numbers of species and individuals recorded on the burnt and unburnt clearfelled areas were low in comparison with those observed in uncut forest. In general, those species able to utilise open-ground habitats tended to be the least affected by clearfelling followed by slash-burning. However, the unburnt clearfelled area provided foraging sites for certain species, in preference of the nearby slash-burnt area. Many individuals recorded in the clearfelled areas made use of trees left standing after logging. The use of fire in dry forest management practice and the importance of cull trees are discussed.

The aims were to assess effects of harvesting (followed by burning and artificial regeneration) and provide data on populations and ecology of birds inhabiting this distinctive forest type. Mountain Ash forests grow in high rainfall areas and the trees can reach heights of 100 m; they usually grow as even-aged stands and 79% of Mountain Ash forests in the Central Highlands has regenerated after severe fires in 1939. About 65 species of birds were found to be regular inhabitants of Mountain Ash forests and associated plant communities. All except the Pink Robin breed also in foothill gullies. Several species that are common in drier foothill forests, were absent from Mountain Ash forests. The commonest species were those that feed in the dense shrub layer or from damp ground below. Some insectivorous birds that were abundant in summer (e.g. Golden Whistler Pachycephala pectoralis, Grey Fantail Rhipidura fuliginosa) left Mountain Ash forests for the winter. Winter food sources were limited and the most important were blossoms of Mountain Correa Correa lawrenciana, invertebrates in damp leaf litter, and invertebrates or carbohydrate exudates from hanging bark of Mountain Ash or branches and trunks of Silver Wattle Acacia dealbata. Habitats and interactions between various bird species are described. Bird population densities were low in the first three years after harvesting but some species were confined to open stands of this age. Other forest birds returned rapidly as eucalypts and understorey species regenerated. Populations were as high in 39-year-old regrowth as in older stands though some species (mainly those tht need tree hollows for nesting) were more common in older forest. Implications for management are discussed.

Foliage height diveristy was not significantly correlated with avian community structure, while relative humidity showed significant positive correlation with species richness. Food resources for leaf-litter foragers and woodpeckers that forage extensively into dead tree trunks and branches may be intimately tied to atmospheric moisture. Such a relationship would indicate that the correlation with species richness is directly with food supply and only indirectly with relative humidity. Atmospheric moisture may be a useful indicator of avian community within geographically and structurally similar deciduous woodlands.

One of the aims of the revegetation program is to promote the return of faunal species which inhabited areas prior to mining. The extent to which bird species utilize revegetated bauxite minesites is discussed. It was shown that revegetated areas as young as 4-5 yr can support similar bird species numbers, densities and diversities as unmined forest. Avifaunal populations occupying any rehabilitated area depend largely on the rehabilitation technique used. Factors which may be used to increase further avifaunal utilization of minesites are discussed. The effects of jarrah dieback and fire on forest birds are compared with results for bauxite mined areas. From this, it is possible to assess the combined impact of dieback, fire and mining on long-term conservation of jarrah forest bird species.

Forests and woodlands in both regions have been cleared extensively during the past century. This analysis examines how fragmentation of forest habitat has affected composition and dynamics of local bird assemblages. Species in forest islands are compared with those in equivalent "control plots" near the edge of a large, continuous forest. Disruption of continuous tracts apparently affects not only birds of the forest interior, but also those occurring along or near the edge. Birds in New South Wales and Wisconsin show common patterns of distribution among forest islands, despite considerable differences in taxonomic relationships, seasonality, and habitat. Area was the best predictor of species richness in islands and control plots. Other habitat variables (except isolation) were relatively uniform among sites and did not contribute consistently to variation in numbers of species. Species common in forest islands also tended to be common in large nearby forests, but bird assemblages in forest islands were statistically different from those in forest control plots. Species assemblages in forest islands generally were more predictable over space and time than were local assemblages in larger forests. Although transients or regular visitors commomly were observed in forest islands, nonresident species occurred even more frequently in control plots. Apparently habitat fragmentation alters the spatial and temporal dynamics of native forest bird communities. This, in turn, may favor some species and leave others at a disadvantage. Differences between species assemblages of forest islands and control plots were most pronounced in Wisconsin. Numbers of forest or forest edge species were much lower in Wisconsin forest islands than in corresponding control plots. Isolation of forest islands was associated negatively with species richness only in Wisconsin. Long-term effects of forest fragmentation in New South Wales might not yet be realized, because relatively large areas of forest remain near existing habitat islands.

If all species were neglected, which show only small variations or increasing/decreasing abundances due to weather conditions in the survey area or due to changing environments in southern wintering areas, treecreeper, coal tit and song thrush remain. They may be indicators for the enrichment of dead trees in the forest, respectively, for changing tree species composition in an ecological positive way. The influence of different check time during fieldwork by mapping 1 grid unit in different years must be considered when interpreting the results. Complementing current atlas work (i.e., with a 100 km2 grid) for estimating the population dynamics of rare species an additional census is proposed, which may give quantitative results for all species abundant or widely distributed. For these species until now only unimportant qualitative dispersal patterns can be evaluated. By a time sparing grid mapping every year (1 or more areas of 1 km2 in each 100 km2 square of the atlas grid) using 6.25 ha units (10 min/unit), relative abundances or grid frequencies (6.25 ha grid) may be used for the evaluation of population indices both for local survey areas and for countries.

A gradient of habitat complexity was related with increasing density and basal area of dead trees, live trees and shrubs. The combined densities of 26 breeding species ranged from 3.9 in the least complex habitat to 8.6 territorial males/ha in the most complex. The chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica), mourning warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) and song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) represented an average of 75% of the individuals on the eight plots. Only the density of the chestnut-sided warbler was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with the habitat gradient; the song sparrow was negatively correlated (P < 0.05). Management for greater habitat complexity provides more opportunities for nesting and foraging and results in greater species richness and density of birds breeding in early successional vegetation.

Following fire, a number of transient plant species colonize the open ground, while the original vegetation regenerates from stumps, rhizomes or buried seeds. This results in an increase in species richness of the vegetation at this stage. The time necessary for the bird communities to reach their pre-fire species composition and population level differs in cork-oak and Holm-oak forests. This takes 3 yr in the 1st case but is much slower in the 2nd vegetation type. Bird-species richness is higher in the burned maquis during the 2nd and 3rd years following the fire. The population densities of small mammal species, particularly that of Apodemus sylvaticus, can be higher in all burned areas during the 2nd and 3rd post-fire years but population structures (age and sex ratios) are different. Changes in the physical structure of the above-ground vegetation following the fire is apparently the major factor influencing the bird community; the small mammal community is more influenced by modification of the litter and the subsequent changes in food and shelter availability.

The mapping method has been used on a 33 ha. wide area, placed in a large farm, close to the Tirrenian coast, north of the mouth of the Tevere River (41.degree. 51'N, 12.degree. 12'E). I have examined the structural and dimensional characters of the reed-bed, before and after a fire, pointing out some remarkable differnces. Species [21] in 1982 and 23 in 1983 have been censused; Reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), Great Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and Cetti's Warbler (Cettia cetti) show the highest density in both years. The difference between the first and the second year is significant as far as total density (.SIGMA.d - 15%) is concerned; it has been probably caused by the burning of the reed-bed. The values of biomass result high according to the high productivity of wetlands. No other datum shows significant differences between 1982 and 1983.

Changes in vegetation structure were assessed using data from plant succession studies and by taking 0.04-ha circular samples within the study area 15 yr after fire exclusion and in a contiguous annually burned oldfield forest. Using rarefaction, a statistical technique, annual bird species totals for this study were compared to bird species richness in nearby old-growth longleaf pine and mature beech-magnolia forests. Changes in the bird community and vegetation structure were dramatic. Only 11 of 43 bird species were encountered every year of the study. Most finches and brush nesting species no longer occur on the study area while several species associated with mesic conditions have increased in abundance.

A pair laid 3-4 eggs/yr changing their nesting site. All the trees where they nested were situated within 500 m from permanently running water. The breeding period lasted from late April through late July. The trees where the woodpecker had their roosts or bred were huge old or half-dead coniferous or broad-leaf trees, averaging 200 yr old. The incubation and feeding periods lasted for 14 and 26 days, respectively. The parents shared incubation and feeding but the male spent more time than the female especially in the feeding period. The ratio of time shared by the female and the male with the nestlings was 3:7. The diet of the nestlings consisted of the larvae of Malombyx raddie-71.6% and Myelophilus piniperda-25.6%, and the eggs and the adults of Camponotus berceleanus-2.8%, with a small amount of Miriapoda. The home range and the territory of the woodpecker had a radius of 2 km and 40 m, respectively, with the nesting tree at the center. The preservation of old or half-dead trees within 500 m from permanently running water is essential. Nest-boxes should be installed to reduce competition among birds nesting in the hollow trees. Food plants such as Cornus controversa should be planted.

Logging had occurred on 2 burned and 2 unburned plots. Forty-nine species of birds were recorded during fall, winter and spring. Twenty-eight species were recorded on burned, and 38 spp. on unburned plots. During all seasons, more species were restricted to unburned study plots; more species on unburned sites occurred on only 1 site. Species composition on different areas was related to foraging substrate availability and to season. Habitat alterations caused by fire and by logging appeared to have a similar influence on many components of avian communities. Patterns observed during nonbreeding seasons paralleled, in many instances, response of breeding season communities to similar habitat changes.

Although total densities and species richness were similar among sites (81-109 territories/km2 of 4-6 spp.), the burned site contained 50-86% fewer Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri) territories than the chained and 17-yr-old plowed sites. THe vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) and western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), both grassland birds, were not noticeably affected by sagebrush control. Horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) densities were 1.8-2.8 .times. greater on the recently treated sites. The sage thrasher (Oreoscoptes montanus) was only found in habitat patches containing the largest shrubs. Nesting requirements best explained the patterns of distribution and responses observed. Bird species diversity can be maximized by treating sagebrush areas in narrow (100 m) strips and maintaining blocks of mature sagebrush.

Snags were examined in Douglas-fir forests approximately 10, 35, 75, 110 and 200+ yr of age. The use of snags was quantified on the basis of evidence of past and present use by hole-nesting birds. Hole-nesting birds used Douglas-fir snags over 60 cm in dbh [diameter at breast height] and over 15 m tall for foraging and nesting; these snags usually had broken tops, few or no branches, decayed sapwood and heartwood, and less than 100% bark cover. Snags of this size and type occurred primarily in forests over 110 yr of age; the use of snags by hole-nesting birds was concentrated in older forests (> 110 yr old). Bird censuses were conducted in 1 representative area from each forest age-class. Density and species diversity of hole-nesting birds increased with forest age. Density of hole-nesting birds was positively correlated (r = 0.98, P < 0.05) with mean dbh of snags. The intensive management of Douglas-fir forests does not allow for the production or retention of large snags. A reduction in the number of large snags could reduce populations of hole-nesting birds. Possible means for retaining and producing large snags are discussed.

The main factors that influenced the population were water (both as an agent of vegetation growth and for drinking); fire which destroyed the grasslayer; the grasslayer (which varied in height, density and composition); and arthropod production. This dry bush savanna is tropical as far as the fauna is concerned. But the specific richness cannot be explained through climatic stability since its climatic variations are its main feature. All the indices which were tested to obtain a definition of this bird population showed much variation. The diversity index was not significantly correlated with the number of species (with the habitat structure), but with equitability: each year, the bird population was comprised of a few species with a much higher density than the others.

The unlogged plot supported significantly (P < 0.05) more individuals than did the logged plot (88.9 birds/40 ha more in 1973; 153.5 birds/40 ha more in 1974). The harvested plot supported far fewer tree-foliage searching species. Timber-gleaning species and those that nest in foliage were significantly denser in the unlogged plot. The effect on cavity nesters depended largely on their foraging behavior. Mountain chickadees, which usually nest in snag cavities and forage mainly on live vegetation and bark, were significantly less abundant in the logged plot; woodpeckers which forage on both live and dead trees were equally abundant in both plots. Aerial foragers and birds that used slash, benefited by the lumbering. This selective logging led to an increase in tree species diversity, and no appreciable change in diversity of foliage height, tree volume or bird species. The modified plot, while containing approximately the same number of avian species, supported a far smaller total population. The amount of foliage available undoubtedly exerts a strong influence on avian species composition and densities because it furnishes nesting sites and foraging substrate. The virgin forest provided substantially more foliage (113,984.0 m3/ha vs. 15,269.8 m3/ha) than did the logged plot. Along with foliage volume and configuration, presence of suitable numbers of snags and significant amounts of slash also were important.

In this century 132 spp. have proved to breed in the Veluwe. Some of them have disappeared (white stork, Montagu's harrier, golden plover, ruff), others are extremely rare (peregrine, bittern, little bittern, shoveler, corncrake). The raven has recently been re-introduced. No other part of The Netherlands is as rich in raptors as the Veluwe. Regular species include buzzard, honey-buzzard, sparrowhawk, goshawk, hobby and kestrel. Breeding owls are barn-owl, tawny owl, long-eared owl, little owl, and short-eared owl. The heathlands hold black grouse curlew, wood-lark, wheatear and stonechat. Some sandy spots still hold a few tawny pipits. There are many interesting woodland birds, like black woodpecker, wryneck, woodcock, nightingale, wood-warbler, firecrest, hawfinch and golden oriole. Siskin and crossbill breed sporadically. Relative abundance and distribution data are included.

A biotope classification is presented that is applicable to the northern boreal and hemiarctic zoogeographical zones of Finland (the transition between taiga and tundra). Biotopes (11) are distinguished on the basis of ornithological data from 32 censuses of breeding land birds, performed in the study area in the period 1937-1974. The classification is applicable to new censuses and it can be used to predict the structure of the total bird fauna in the northernmost parts of the country. The 11 biotopes are ordered in a vertical series of 8 open biotopes (from stony ground on fell tops down to peatlands and burned areas surrounded by coniferous taiga forests), and 3 forest biotopes (from mountain birch forests to coniferous taiga forests). The bird communities of the biotopes are described, with densities, frequencies and diversities. There is considerable heterogeneity among the open biotopes, but the bird communities vary little between the forest biotopes. The number of biotopes occupied differes with the species. The most successful species are behaviorally flexible with respect to habitat tolerance (especially the phylogenetically young passerines), able to utilize resources that are common (i.e., abundant in at least 1 of the biotopes), or not marginal in N. Finland. The proportions of non-migrant species and individuals are correlated with the seasonal stability of the biotopes. Several non-migrant species occurred in the forests, but only 2 [Lagopus mutus and L. lagopus) in the open biotopes. The non-migrants are less abundant both in single biotopes and in larger regions than the migrants. The difference appears to be due to the larger size of the non-migrants. Scandinavian censuses performed in subalpine and alpine biotopes are discussed. The bird communities in the more continental Finnish Lapland are poorer in individuals and species than the communities in the more maritime Scandinavian mountains.

Information on species diversity and abundance was collected on 39 linear 4-ha plots in 8 communities by noting birds heard and seen on repeated walks over each plot. Bird populations in tundra and subalpine communities were dissimilar from the 6 lowland communities, the latter all showing a marked similarity (lowland willow shrub, upland willow shrub, spruce-poplar forest, mature spruce, riparian poplar forest, balsam poplar parkland). Communities with greatest species diversity also had greatest total abundance. The tundra ranked lowest in diversity and abundance. Subalpine held a high number of species, reflecting its ecotone position. Subalpine was distinctive in having few species of intermediate density compared with the density-dominance structure of birds in the other communities. The close similarly between bird populations in the lowland communities, despite distinctive differences in vegetation species and structure, was due to the overriding presence of 3 spp. that remained abundant throughout succession: dark-eyed junco, Swainson's thrush and yellow-rumped warbler [Junco hyemalis, Hylocichla ustulata and Dendroica coronata, respectively], which means that species not closely specialized to the vegetation predominate over most of the region.

This forest, the conditions of its soil, the climate and cultivation density are described. A plot of 57.05 ha was chosen for study. Five forest types were discerned. The average abundance of all species was 61.04 territorial birds. The dominant species were chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), robin (Erithacus rubecula), song thrush (Turdus philomelos), blackcap (Sylvia articapilla), blackbird (T. merula) and chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita). The firecrest (Regulus ignicapillus) and goldcrest (R. regulus) were abundant in areas made up exclusively of conifers, whereas the coal tit (Parus ater) nested throughout coniferous, deciduous and mixed woodland regions. Old mixed-forest areas were the most densely populated and had the most numerous species. In addition, 50 m-wide strips along both sides of the brook were analyzed with regard to population densities. The proximity of the brook was significantly preferred. In 1971, a serious decline in the population of firecrests, goldcrests and chaffinches was observed. This was caused by the severe and long winter of that year with its dense layer of closely packed snow. Of 81 spp. observed in the forest, 49 breeding birds are represented. The ecological requirements for nesting were derived from density analyses. Data concerning courting phenology are listed.

(117 acres) in the spring of 1967, with the aim of relating bird distribution and density to the habitats created by different kinds of silvicultural management. The census plots are discussed in relation to current management practices and the breeding bird dominance and densities are enumerated. A comparison of the situation in Queen Wood is made with that at Frithsden Beeches. Herts., an older and more "primaeval" type of beech wood where management has been poor. A further comparison is made between census results in the English pair, and similar types of beech wood investigated in Denmark. In both countries the number of species and density of breeding birds is greatest in the "primaeval" type, largely due to the excess of natural sites for the hole-nesting birds. Many of these are "non-stationery" in that they are species which nest in the wood but feed largely outside it. It is concluded that, in order to preserve a high density and degree of diversity in the bird-life, the "shelterwood" system of management is the best. The provision of nest-boxes and other artificial nesting-sites, and a more varied ecotone on the margins, would also increase the breeding population in younger well-managed stands. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author	Brit.

A detailed description of these types is presented. Observations were made during nesting season in 1956 and '57. Method of singing males was used, i.e. to every singing male a female was added even if she were not observed. Results are outlined. Bird population of primeval forest was high compared with other 2 types. This is ascribed to extreme height of the whole growth and the great quantity of dry wood and dead trees, which support Picidae, Certhiidae, Sittidae and Troglodytidae. Curve of ratio of number of sppcies to the number of individuals indicates that in the primeval forest population majority of species takes part in the total abundance, whereas in the spruce forest population the most abundant component is represented by only a few species. In a comparison of number pyramids the pyramid of the primeval forest bird population is consequently well balanced in comparison with the other populations. Various conditions in the primeval forest enable the various species to achieve a relatively even representation and make full use of all biotopes. Mixed forest population is similar to the primeval forest population in structure; but the structure of the spruce forest population is very unbalanced, and only a few bird species are able to make full use of this environment. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: MDS	Lab. pro vyzkum obratlovcu SAV, Brno, Czechoslovakia						Environmental Sciences & Ecology					Ecology (Environmental Sciences)	07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal	Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [bird] [avifauna]/Gymnospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Gymnosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Coniferopsida [25102]; [spruce forest]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Passeriformes [85548]; [Certhiidae] [Troglodytidae] [Sittidae]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Piciformes [85552]; [Picidae]/Plantae; Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Spermatophyta [25000]; [trees]													2019-04-10	J	BIOSIS:PREV19563000031010	PREV19563000031010		Article		Nesting and production of the blue-winged teal (Anas discors Linnaeus) in northwest Iowa		GLOVER, FRED A.

Nests located in cover of light to sparse stem density and light intensity ratings of less than 10% were more successful than those in other covers utilized. The detrimental effects of burning were reflected by low nesting populations even a year after the fire. Predation was responsible for the loss of 100 of 186 nests. Recommended management measures included: (1) protecting cover around water margins, (2) removing dominant weedy vegetation, (3) maintaining present nesting areas, and (4) educating youth of the area in predator trapping techniques and better fur utilization. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: F.

ECOLOGY		1949		30	(1)	75-82	75	82	English						0	1	The nesting bird populations of the forests in the spruce zone of the Cheat Mts., W. Virginia, are made up predominantly of spp. characteristic of the Boreal coniferous forest far to the north. However, other spp. characteristic of deciduous forests or of forests of more southern climates were found associated with them in smaller numbers, thus indicating the ecotonal or transitional nature of the areas studied. The cutting of spruce forests on the Cheat Mts. apparently has little effect in changing the faunal affinities of the bird populations of the area, although the population density is somewhat reduced. However, when the cutting of these forests is followed by fire, a deciduous forest type develops and takes the place of the spruce, causing very noticeable changes in the species composition of the birds, as well as a marked lowering of population densities. The breeding bird populations of the spruce forests of the Cheat Mts. and the spruce forests of Hog Island, Maine, were found to be quite similar, corresponding much more closely to each other than to the populations of the spruce-fir forests of L. Nipigon, Ontario. Apparently, the Maine coast and central Appalachian areas together represent a phase of the northern coniferous forest region that is quite different ecologically from that characteristic of western Ontario, a difference possibly accentuated by an unusual outbreak of insects in the latter region. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: R.
