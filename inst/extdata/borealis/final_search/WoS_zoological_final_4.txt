Gabrey, Steven W.; Afton, Alan D.; Wilson, Barry C.				Wetlands	19	3		594-606	September 1999	1999				English	2	11	Marshes in the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain provide important winter habitats for many species of birds. Many of these marshes are managed intensively through a combination of fall/winter burning and construction of impoundments to improve wintering waterfowl habitat, reduce wetland loss, and create emergent wetlands. Little information is available on effects of this management on wintering birds, particularly passerines. We conducted experimental burns in impounded and unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwest Louisiana and recorded species composition and abundance of birds during the 1996 and 1997 winters. We found that burning and impoundment influenced vegetation structure, which in turn influenced bird abundance and species composition. Blackbirds (Icteridae) preferred recently burned plots. Sparrows (Emberizidae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) avoided recently burned plots but recolonized these plots after one year of vegetation recovery. Sparrows and wrens present in burned plots during the first winter following burning generally were observed in scattered patches of unburned vegetation. Suitability of Chenier Plain marshes as winter habitat for several bird species was reduced during the winter in which burning was conducted, particularly if a high proportion of the plot was burned. We recommend that patchy burns be used, at both the landscape level and within specific burned areas, to achieve management objectives and still provide suitable winter habitat for non-target species. Although many groups of birds depend on Chenier Plain marshes for winter habitat, these groups differ in their specific habitat requirements. We recommend that a diverse wetland complex (e.g., impoundments managed for waterfowl foraging habitat interspersed with those managed for passerine winter cover) be maintained.

Breininger, David R.; Burgman, Mark A.; Stith, Bradley M.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	27	3		810-822	Fall 1999	1999				English	0	24	Within the range of the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), the only bird species endemic to Florida, there was a need for a population risk assessment that considered the impacts of declining habitat availability and declining fire frequency associated with rapid human population expansion. We developed a population risk model to examine influence of population size, catastrophes (epidemics and hurricanes), and habitat management scenarios on Florida scrub-jay populations. Extinction risk declined rapidly when initial population sizes increased from 20 to 100 breeding pairs. Hurricanes increased extinction risk for coastal populations by 10-30% compared to inland populations. Our results suggested that habitat in poor condition was unlikely to support a population for more than a few decades. Poor habitat quality conditions were common throughout the species' range because of fire suppression or inadequate fire management. Habitat management was more effective than habitat restoration because population recovery occurred slowly after restoration and only if habitat was restored to optimal conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed that fecundity and survival of experienced breeders without helpers (adult nonbreeders) were the most important model parameters. Slow recovery rates occurred because helpers were the only rapid source of colonists in restored habitat and because an absence of helpers reduced breeder survival and fecundity. Small population sizes and habitat degradation make the Florida scrub-jay vulnerable to rangewide decline and extinction unless habitat is protected, restored, and managed to maintain optimal conditions.

Guix, Juan Carlos; Martin, Marc; Manosa, Santi				Biodiversity and Conservation	8	8		1079-1088	August 1999	1999				English	0	18	A census of four species of syntopic parrots was carried out using distance sampling methods on Sao Sebastiao island, SE Brazil. Most of the 33 593 ha island is covered by mature and secondary Atlantic rainforest. Almost 80% of these forests are within the Ilhabela Park. Although the species counted have marked differences in size and weight, density (individuals/km2) and estimated population size in 23 500 ha of well-preserved forests were similar: Amazona farinosa (13.82 +- 5.94; 3247 +- 1395), Pionus maximiliani (15.79 +- 7.04; 3712 +- 1654), Brotogeris tirica (15.05 +- 4.87; 3537 +- 1143) and Pyrrhura frontalis (13.06+-5.53; 3068+-1298). Encounter rates of Forpus crassirostris and Pionopsitta pileata were very low, which suggests that there is only a small population of these species on the island. The Sao Sebastiao forests still support healthy populations of parrots. Although woodpecker population estimates on the island are large enough to provide nesting sites forparrots, competition for holes with other secondary cavity nesters such as toucans, flycatchers and tytiras, and the selective cutting of dead trees for canoe construction, which is a common practice on the island, may limit hole availability for parrots.

Hobson, Keith A.; Schieck, Jim				Ecological Applications	9	3		849-863	August 1999	1999				English	2	101	A current paradigm in conservation biology is that forest harvest practices that better approximate natural disturbance processes are more likely to conserve biodiversity. We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having gtoreq95% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with 1-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest.

Kotliar, Natasha B.; Baker, Bruce W.; Whicker, April D.; Plumb, Glenn				Environmental Management	24	2		177-192	August 1999	1999				English	6	85	Prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) have been labeled as keystone species because of their influence on biological diversity and ecosystem function. However, the validity of several assumptions used to support keystone status is questionable. We review the strength of the evidence and the magnitude of the prairie dog's effects on ecosystem structure and function. We use this review to reevaluate the keystone role for prairie dogs. Our goal is to encourage sound management of the prairie dog ecosystem by improving the ecological foundation of their keystone status. Our review confirms that prairie dogs affect a number of ecosystem-level functions but that their influence on prairie vertebrates may be less than previously suggested. Species richness and abundance patterns were variable among plants, mammals, and birds and were not consistently higher on prairie dog colonies compared to uncolonized areas. In addition, only nine of the 208 species listed in the literature as observed on or near prairie dogs colonies had quantitative evidence of dependence on prairie dogs. Abundance data indicated opportunistic use of colonies for an additional 20 species. A total of 117 species may have some relationship with prairie dogs, but we lacked sufficient data to evaluate the strength of this relationship. The remaining 62 species may be accidental or alien to the system. Despite our conclusion that some prairie dog functions may be smaller than previously assumed, collectively these functions are quite large compared to other herbivores in the system. We suggest that prairie dogs also provide some unique functions not duplicated by any other species and that continued decline of prairie dogs may lead to a substantial erosion of biological diversity and landscape heterogeneity across prairie and shrub-steppe landscapes.

Canadian Field-Naturalist	113	3		487-492	July-September 1999	1999				English	1	22	Bird surveys were conducted in wetlands (n = 1000) throughout South Dakota during the summers of 1995 and 1996 to assess effects of woody vegetation encroachment on nongame wetland bird species. Wetland bird species richness decreased as the extent of woody vegetation encompassing wetland perimeters increased. Logistic analyses indicated that four wetland bird species (Black Tern (Chlidonias niger), Wilson's Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), Eared Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus)) were less likely to occur in wetlands surrounded by trees. The only birds using trees surrounding wetlands were edge species that thrive without the aid of management. We estimate that 35 560 wetlands in eastern South Dakota alone may have wetland bird populations which are negatively impacted by encroachment of woody vegetation. Wetland managers should consider limiting the extent of woody vegetation around prairie wetlands when nongame wetland bird production is the management goal.

Kolstrom, Marja; Lumatjarvi, Jaana				Ecological Modelling	119	1		43-55	1 July 1999	1999				English	1	6	In this study we developed a decision support system for evaluating the effects of forest management on stand structure and wildlife species. The elements of the decision support system are an ecological simulation model and a data management system. In boreal forests, decaying wood is important from the standpoint of biological diversity. Many organisms, such as saproxylic beetles and polypores, live in decaying wood. The structure of a forest determines which species select it as a habitat, because the habitat requirements vary between species. In this study, the stand structure includes living and dead trees, their diameter distribution by tree species and the stage of decay. Forest management strongly modifies stand structure. We used the simulation model to investigate the stand structure and databases on the habitat requirements of beetle and polypore species to assess the number of species in a stand. We tested our system with four management examples and compared the results toexperimental results. Both our study and the experimental results showed that intensive forest management decreases the number of large deciduous trees in boreal forests and therefore reduces the number of beetle and polypore species.

White, Jay S.; Bayley, Suzanne E.				Environmental Management	24	1		25-37	July 1999	1999				English	2	26	A rapid development and approval process was employed by Ducks Unlimited Canada and other stakeholders to restore a 1246-ha (3079-acre) northern prairie wetland in southern Alberta, Canada, with 3640 m3/day (800,000 US gallons) of municipal wastewater and beef processing wastewater. A large nongovermental organization hastened restoration with a development process that outlined restoration goals and management objectives to satisfy a dual mandate of wastewater treatment and wildlife habitat creation. In 1995, after five years of wastewater additions, the basins had been refilled and the surrounding uplands had been acquired and restored. The Frank Lake Conservation Area currently provides high-quality habitat for a variety of wildlife in a region where many of the native plants and animals species have been lost due to habitat loss and fragmentation. The success of upland and water management strategies is reflected in the increase of target species' abundance and richness: 50 shorebird species, 44 water-fowl species, 15 raptor species, and 28 other new bird species have returned to the marsh since restoration. As well, significant N and P reduction occurs as waters flow through the first basin of the marsh. The management strategies of this project that satisfied a dual mandate serve as a model to guide managers of other large-scale wetland restoration projects.

Krementz, David G.; Christie, Jeffrey S.				Journal of Wildlife Management	63	3		803-814	July 1999	1999				English	3	18	Public agencies are required to manage for threatened and endangered species and for biodiversity. However, at times, management for threatened and endangered species precludes consideration of other species. We investigated how managing for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and biodiversity at the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, affected communities of bird species that use early-successional scrub habitat (hereafter, scrub-successional species). Management for red-cockaded woodpeckers at the SRS involved both (1) manipulating mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-wiregrass (Andropogon spp.) stands via canopy thinning, removal of midstory trees, and prescribed burning; and (2) even-aged timber harvesting. The former management practice encouraged red-cockaded woodpeckers to establish new colonies in previously unoccupied stands (hereafter, "recruitment" stands). The latter management practice is used to remove offsite planted pines and replant with preferred longleaf pines. We conducted a constant-effort mist net study in recruitment and regenerating stands (stands clearcut and planted with longleaf pine) during the breeding seasons of 1995-96. We hypothesized that the scrub-successional bird community in recruitment stands would have greater species richness and higher survival and reproductive rates per species than in regenerating stands. However, recruitment stands always had fewer scrub-successional species (1995: 36 species; 1996; 31 species) than regenerating stands (1995: 54 species; 1996: 55 species), and all species that occurred in recruitment stands also occurred in regenerating stands. Species which commonly occurred in both recruitment and regenerating stands had similar adult:juvenile ratios (P > 0.15) and relative proportion of adults in breeding condition (P > 0.05).

Rottenborn, Stephen C.				Biological Conservation	88	3		289-299	June 1999	1999				English	7	49	In 1995, birds were surveyed in riparian woodlands along a gradient of urbanization in the Santa Clara Valley, CA, USA, in order to determine the relationships between riparian bird communities and urbanization. Bird species richness and density decreased at a location as the number of bridges near that location increased and as the volume of native vegetation decreased. Species richness also increased as the distance to the nearest building and the width of the riparian habitat increased. Canonical correspondence analysis confirmed that bird community structure was influenced strongly by these variables. Many individual species responded significantly to variables associated with urbanization, most having lower densities on more urbanized sites. Whereas previous studies have demonstrated substantial effects of urbanization on bird communities in the habitats being directly altered, this study indicates that urbanization on lands adjacent to intact riparian woodlands has substantial impacts on riparian bird communities.

Mason, Christopher F.; Macdonald, Sheila M.				Bird Conservation International	9	2		119-127	June 1999	1999				English	0	1	The winter bird assemblage and habitat preferences were studied in a largely arable landscape, dominated by winter cereals, in eastern England in one winter. A total of 32 species was recorded on 70 1-km transects but 11% of transects had no birds. Overall densities were low, Skylark Alauda arvensis being the most abundant species. Bird density was highest in the first winter period (October-December). Species richness varied in proportion to the available habitat in the first winter period but there was a preference for stubble, grass and tilled land (harrow) in the second winter period (January-February). Skylarks preferred stubbles in the first winter period and stubbles and grass in the second winter period. Some 34% of all birds fed on winter cereals despite a lack of preference for this habitat, while 94% of seed specialists (finches and buntings) were recorded on stubbles. The areas of preferred habitats (stubbles, grass) were probably too limited to allow more than small populations to persist. Only by the widespread adoption of agricultural extensification and/or farming some of the land specifically for conservation benefits can the declines in bird populations on intensively managed arable farmland be reversed.

We estimated species abundance, richness, and evenness using data from 312 point counts in 18 burned sites and six unburned sites. We measured gross habitat features in 0.04-ha circles centered on each point count station. We calculated productivity estimates at nests of seven of the most common nesting species. Habitat components we measured in 1-, 2-, and 3-yr post-burn sites were similar, but most components differed between burned and unburned sites. Although 98 species were detected during point counts, we report only on the 46 species that nested in the area and were detected gtoreq10% of the counts in either habitat class. Twenty-one species preferred burned sites and six preferred unburned sites. Avian species richness and evenness were similar for burned and unburned sites. Burned sites were preferred for nesting over unburned sites. Only nine nests of six species were found in unburned sites. Productivity estimates were low in burned sites. One or more eggs hatched in only 59 of 187 nests monitored, and an average of only 0.82 chicks per nest were estimated to have fledged. Predation was the most common probable cause for nest failure, ranging from 45% in the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) to 64% in the Summer Tanager (Piranga rubra). Because the sources of predation at the refuge are unknown, future research should address this issue.

Wilson Bulletin	111	2		243-250	June 1999	1999				English	1	7	Cavity-nesting bird species have been shown to be associated with early post-fire habitat during the breeding season but little study has been done of birds in the non-breeding season. We compared bird composition and foraging behavior during the winter in burned and unburned forests. We conducted point counts during four consecutive winters immediately following a stand replacement fire. Burned and unburned forests had similar numbers of bird species, yet species composition was distinctly different. Trunk and branch foraging species were 2.5 times more abundant in burned forest than in unburned forest. Within burned forests, trunk and branch foraging species significantly decreased from the first winter post-fire to the fourth winter post-fire. We conducted foraging observations of four woodpecker species within burned forests only. Woodpeckers used western larch (Larix occidentalis), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) snags that were greater than 23 cm in diameter. Stand replacement fires may play an important role in maintaining populations of trunk and branch foraging species in mixed coniferous forests in northeastern Washington.	Kreisel, Karen J.; 2802 W.

Jansen, R.; Little, R.M.; Crowe, T.M.				Biodiversity and Conservation	8	5		587-602	May 1999	1999				English	2	11	We investigated the densities of the Redwing Francolinus levaillantii and Greywing Francolins F. africanus and the diversity of grassland birds in general along a land-use gradient in the highlands of Mpumalanga province, South Africa. Redwing Francolins cannot tolerate intensive grazing and frequent burning and are confined largely to unburnt, ungrazed grasslands. Their density and the species richness of grassland birds in general are negatively correlated with grazing intensity. Redwing populations drop to densities that cannot be utilised by hunters on a sustainable basis in grasslands that are grazed at even moderate levels or burned annually. Nineteen bird species (including five threatened species) were confined to essentially pristine grassland and were never observed in grazed/annually burned grasslands. The Greywing Francolin is more evenly distributed (although always at sub-utilisation densities) along the grassland land-use gradient, and its density is positively correlated with grazing intensity. There are two assemblages of grassland bird species that appear to be indicative of the intensity of habitat utilisation. Populations of grassland birds in the study area are becoming increasingly dependent on isolated patches of pristine grassland and are threatened by management involving annual burning and high stocking rates on a landscape scale.

Thompson, Ian D.; Hogan, Holly A.; Montevecchi, William A.				Condor	101	2		311-323	May 1999	1999				English	0	14	The amount of old growth balsam fir (Abies balsamea) forest (80+ years) in Newfoundland, Canada has declined and management towards a 60-year rotation age will further reduce the availability of old forest as wildlife habitat. We distinguished among three mature age-classes of forests (40-59, 60-79, and 80+ years) based on tree density, canopy gaps, woody debris, and moss and litter cover on the ground. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed two groups of stands: one containing all of the 40-year-old stands and most 60-year-old stands, and a second that included old growth stands and 4 of 10 60-year-old stands. Forest birds were separated into four groups: one preferring the youngest stands, another observed primarily in old stands, and two others that were intermediate. Bird species richness was greater in 40-year-old forests than in 60+ and 80+-year-old stands. Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) and Gray-cheeked Thrush (Hylocichla minima) were most abundant in old forests. Six other species also were grouped together with the latter two as an old forest group. We observed more species and more total birds breeding on productive forest site types than on less-productive sites based on a forest ecosystem classification, and five species showed significant relationships between density and site quality. We observed few relationships between stand age and migratory strategy. The only guild for which there was a significant relationship of abundance with forest age was cone seed-eaters, which were more common in second-growth forests than in old forest. To maintain avian diversity in these forest landscapes, some stands must be allowed to develop as old growth.	Thompson, Ian D.; Canadian Forest Service, 1219 Queen Street East, Sault Ste.

Estades, Cristian F.; Temple, Stanley A.				Ecological Applications	9	2		573-585	May 1999	1999				English	0	40	Impacts of habitat fragmentation on forest bird communities have often been studied in landscapes dominated by agriculture. The striking structural differences between forest fragments and the matrix have led most researchers to rely on island biogeographic theory to predict the distribution of bird species in fragmented forests. However, in some cases the vegetation surrounding fragments is not completely unsuitable for forest birds. Thus, a more general framework is needed to understand the effects of habitat fragmentation. The mosaic approach considers fragments as integrated parts of a complex landscape composed of patches of habitat of different qualities. In the coastal area of the Maule region in central Chile the remaining hualo (Nothofagus glauca) forests cover <10% of the landscape, are severely fragmented, and are imbedded in a matrix of exotic pine plantations. We compared the island and mosaic approaches as explanations for the distribution and abundance of forest birds. Variable circular plots were used to study the distribution of diurnal forest birds in hualo forest fragments and in the surrounding pine plantations. There was a negative relationship between the size of forest fragment and bird species richness per unit area. Fragmentation effects were mostly species-specific. A few large-sized bird species tended to be absent from the smaller fragments, while the presence or abundance of most birds showed no relationship with fragment size. The type of vegetation adjacent to forest fragments had a significant effect on the composition of the bird community inhabiting them. The abundance of most cavity-nesting species in pine plantations was related positively to the proximity of either the nearest native forest fragment or the nearest creek.

Pavlik, Stefan				Biologia (Bratislava)	54	2		187-194	April 1999	1999				English	0	10	In 1995 and 1996, two pairs of the white-backed woodpecker (WBW) were found nesting within a 63 ha mature thermophilic oak forest in S Slovakia. The WBW's home ranges were situated mostly in a sessile oak forest (proportion of sessile oaks > 80%) growing on steep slopes (> 40degree) with a higher proportion of dead trees (> 6%) and with a lower crown cover of an upper tree layer (60-80%). Mean home-range size during breeding was 8.5 ha (6.3-9.9 ha). Nestlings appeared between 25-30 April and fledglings between 20-25 May, i.e. about 2-3 weeks sooner compared to other Dendrocopos species within the study plot. During the incubation and the nestling period the adults were extremely inconspicuous, so that only two nest holes were found. Both cavities were excavated into trunks of living sessile oaks with crown defoliation less than 10% at a height of 7 and 15 m. The food of adults during the growing season consisted mostly of the Scolytidae and Cerambycidae larvae (59.7% of foraging records), that of nestlings mostly of Geometridae, Noctuidae, and Tortricidae larvae (60.5% of foraging bouts, 70.4% of prey items). Food was taken only from oaks in the upper tree layer (100% of records) from the surface of the bark and leaves (47% of records) or excavated from trunks and branches of dying and dead oaks (51% of records).

Journal of Wildlife Management	63	2		484-496	April 1999	1999				English	3	24	The goals of current management practices in riparian areas in the Pacific Northwest include protecting and maintaining habitat for terrestrial wildlife. However, little is known about the use of riparian buffers by terrestrial wildlife, particularly how buffer width may affect abundance and species composition of wildlife communities. In this study, I compared bird assemblages in logged and unlogged riparian areas along headwater streams and assessed the relations between bird abundance and riparian buffer width. The abundances of 4 species of forest-associated birds that were more abundant in unlogged than in logged headwater riparian stands (Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis), brown creeper (Certhia americana), chestnut-backed chickadee (Poecile rufescens), winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes)) increased with increasing width of riparian buffers. However, 4 other species that also were more abundant in unlogged than logged riparian stands (Hammond's flycatcher (Empidonax hammondii), golden-crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa), varied thrush (Ixoreus naevius), hermit warbler (Dendroica occidentalis)) were rarely observed in even the widest buffers sampled (40-70 m on 1 side of the stream). Although riparian buffers along headwater streams are not expected to support all bird species found in unlogged riparian areas, they are likely to provide the most benefit for forest-associated bird species if they are >40 m wide, and density of large trees within buffers is not reduced by harvesting.

Chamberlain, Dan E.; Gregory, Richard D.				Bird Study	46	1		34-47	March 1999	1999				English	0	8	The occurrence of breeding Skylarks, in terms of both density and presence/absence, was assessed from Breeding Bird Survey data in relation to habitat in a random sample of about 1500 1-km squares throughout the UK in two consecutive years, with particular emphasis on the farmland habitat. Upland grassland and other seminatural grassland habitats held the highest mean densities of Skylarks. Within farmland, arable land held the highest and pasture land the lowest densities, but there was a seasonal decline in arable density. Regression analyses showed that Skylark occurrence was most consistently related to the area of arable farmland (positive effects) and the area of woodland (negative effects). Skylark density increased with increasing habitat diversity in upland squares only. Within farmland, boundary characteristics and the presence of grazers had the most consistent negative effects. The diversity of field types was positively related to Skylark density, which gives some support to the hypothesis that a decrease in the diversity of field types as a result of simplification of farm rotations in recent decades may have led to the decline of the Skylark in the UK, but further conclusions about the effects of specific crop types were not possible at this scale of analysis.

Bird Study	46	1		89-99	March 1999	1999				English	0	16	Numbers and habitat preferences of breeding Lapwings and of wintering Lapwings and Golden Plovers were studied over three years in a largely arable district of northeast Essex. There were 49-54 pairs of breeding Lapwings over the period 1994-96, using 6-9 sites, with 69-83% of the total in coastal grazing marshes. The majority of the remainder was in coastal spring tillage, breeding birds being virtually absent from the hinterland. Large numbers of Lapwings and Golden Plovers were recorded in the first winter of study but many fewer in subsequent winters. Larger fields were used preferentially by both species and boundary quality appeared unimportant. Birds fed opportunistically on bare ground left from early harvested crops in late summer. Lapwings were found mostly on plough and stubble in early autumn, on cereals through the winter, with grass becoming important in late winter. Cereals held most Golden Plovers, and they showed a greater preference for cereals than did Lapwings. There was a large overlap in habitat use between the two species. There was no clear seasonal pattern in feeding. Lapwings avoided cereal fields where the blade height was greater than 110 mm, whereas the critical height for Golden Plovers was 9 mm. The rapid growth of autumn-sown cereals in 1994 and 1995 was considered to be the reason for the reduced population of both species using the region. It is considered that, if warm dry autumns become the norm, allowing rapid growth of winter cereals, the implications for the long-term conservation of Lapwings and Golden Plovers in southern England could be severe.

Wetlands	19	1		194-208	March 1999	1999				English	6	65	Dense monocultures of Phragmites australis (common reed) have been rapidly expanding in Connecticut's tidal wetlands at the expense of cordgrass (Spartina spp.) and cattail (Typha spp). Bird and vegetation surveys in 40 salt and brackish marshes showed that there were significantly fewer species of birds and state-listed species in Phragmites-dominated wetlands than in short-grass marshes. Seaside Sparrow, Saltmarsh Sharp-tailed Sparrow, and Willet, three marsh specialists adapted to nesting in short graminoids, had low frequencies in plots dominated by Phragmites. Marsh Wren and Swamp Sparrow, however, are marsh specialists that prefer tall, reedy vegetation, and both species had significantly greater densities at sites with more Phragmites or cattail. Although the bird communities of cattail sites and Phragmites sites were similar, the abundance of Virginia Rails was positively correlated with percent cover of cattail but not Phragmites. The extent of pools was positively related to bird species richness in short-grass meadows but not in Phragmites plots. In Phragmites-dominated wetlands, the height and density of reed stands may inhibit bird use of any pools that are present. Muskrats create pools that may enhance bird species richness, but populations of this mammal have dwindled during the same time period that Phragmites increased in Connecticut's marshes. Although a few species may benefit from reed invasion, it has a negative impact on some marsh bird species that have already declined. These findings support the continued need for marsh restoration and the control of common reed.

Birds were surveyed along 40 m fixed width transects that were placed along wind turbine strings within three CRP fields and in three CRP fields without turbines. Conservation Reserve Program grasslands without turbines and areas located 180 m from turbines supported higher densities (261.0-312.5 males/100 ha) of grassland birds than areas within 80 m of turbines (58.2-128.0 males/100 ha). Human disturbance, turbine noise, and physical movements of turbines during operation may have disturbed nesting birds. We recommend that wind turbines be placed within cropland habitats that support lower densities of grassland passerines than those found in CRP grasslands.

Saab, Victoria				Ecological Applications	9	1		135-151	February 1999	1999				English	2	92	Patterns of habitat use by breeding birds were studied in cottonwood riparian forests along 100 km of the South Fork of the Snake River in southeastern Idaho, United States, from 1991 to 1994. A hierarchical approach was used to examine habitat use at three spatial scales: microhabitat (local vegetation characteristics), macrohabitat (cottonwood forest patch characteristics), and landscape (composition and patterning of surrounding (matrix) vegetation types and land uses). This paper addresses a series of predictions about species' distributions that incorporate the different spatial scales. Bird distribution and abundance and vegetation data were collected on 57 cottonwood forest patches ranging in size from 0.40 ha to 205 ha. The surrounding landscape changed from a valley surrounded by mountains, on the upstream end of the study area, to a narrow canyon adjacent to natural upland vegetation in the middle section, and to a wide, open floodplain dominated by agriculture on the downstream end. The best predictors of high species richness (r2 = 0.71) were natural and heterogeneous landscapes, large cottonwood patches, close proximity to other cottonwood patches, and microhabitats with relatively open canopies. Distribution and frequency of occurrence were evaluated for 32 species of small land birds. The most frequent significant predictor of species occurrence was the landscape component: increases in upland natural vegetation with decreases in agriculture. Both interior and edge specialists were found in arid land, cottonwood riparian forests that are linear in nature, with large amounts of edge. Nest predators, brood parasites, and exotic species responded positively to human-altered landscapes. Landscape patterns were the primary influence on distribution and occurrence of most bird species, whereas macrohabitat and microhabitat were of secondary importance.

Chambers, Carol L.; McComb, William C.; Tappeiner, John C., II				Ecological Applications	9	1		171-185	February 1999	1999				English	1	17	Silvicultural alternatives to clear-cutting have been suggested to promote development, retention, or creation of late-successional features such as large trees, multilayered canopies, snags, and logs. We assessed bird response to three silvicultural alternatives to clear-cutting that retained structural features found in old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests and that imitated natural disturbance regimes more closely than did traditional clear-cutting: (1) small-patch group selection treatment representing a low-intensity disturbance; (2) two-story treatment, representing a moderate to high-intensity disturbance; and (3) modified clear-cut treatment, representing a high-intensity disturbance. We counted diurnal breeding birds 1 yr prior to and 2 yr after harvest to estimate effects of the silvicultural treatments on bird communities compared with uncut controls. The small-patch group selection treatment was most similar in species composition to control stands. The two-story treatment was more similar to the modified clear-cut treatment. Ten bird species remained abundant following the small-patch group selection treatment. They declined in abundance in modified clearcuts and two-story stands. These species included four neotropical migratory species and five species with restricted geographic ranges and habitat associations. Nine species increased in response to moderate and/or high-intensity disturbances. This group included a larger proportion of species that were habitat generalists. Silvicultural treatments imitating low-intensity disturbances were most effective in retaining bird communities associated with mature forest; high-intensity disturbances such as the two-story and modified clear-cut treatments greatly altered bird community composition. Bird responses to the silvicultural treatments that we studied indicate that a variety of stand types is needed to meet needs of all species.

Meunier, Francis D.; Verheyden, Christophe; Jouventin, Pierre				Acta Oecologica	20	1		1-13	January-February 1999	1999				English	5	26	We have investigated the effects of landscape traversed and roadside structure on the use of highway verges by birds. Three contrasted landscapes were chosen in terms of human land use and vegetation structure: an intensive farmland, a pine plantation, and a matoral. The roadside sections varied in vegetation structure, width and profile. We recorded birds present in roadsides and adjacent habitats by transect counts over all seasons. Roadside bird species appeared for a great part similar to those of adjacent habitats. However, diversity and abundance in verges did not depend on that of adjacent habitats. Woody roadsides were compararable to hedges, as trees (and shrubs) in verges enhanced species richness and abundance of birds in the farmland and woodland sites. Width and profile of verges had less influence. In all sites, typical species of the habitat traversed partly avoided roadsides. On the contrary, numerous species associated with 'rare' habitats in one site preferred roadsides, provided that verge vegetation contrasted with the dominant habitat. It is concluded that birds responses to highways can vary greatly with landscape traversed and verge vegetation. Highway verges could be favorable to birds, if they constitute a complementary habitat to the dominant habitat within a landscape.

Meiklejohn, Bradford A.; Hughes, Jeffrey W.				American Midland Naturalist	141	1		172-184	January 1999	1999				English	0	6	Retention of riparian buffers is a common management practice used to protect streams from the effects of upslope forest harvest. We compared bird use of riparian buffers along main stem rivers, tributary streams, and reference riparian zones having intact, upslope forests. Community composition differed considerably between buffers and references, and also between main stems and tributaries. Density of the more common species (those detected >20 times) was significantly higher along main stems than along tributaries. Four species (bay-breasted warbler, black-throated green warbler, blue jay, Cape May warbler) were more abundant along main stems than along tributaries; no species was more abundant along tributaries. The overall density of less common species was significantly higher in buffer strips than in reference sites, but four of the more common species (bay-breasted, blackburnian, black-throated green, and Cape May warblers) were more abundant in reference sites than in buffer strips. We did not detect differences in species diversity or richness among the different site types, but edge-species were significantly more common in buffer strips than in reference sites. Interior-species, in contrast, were significantly more common in reference sites.

Auk	116	1		109-115	January 1999	1999				English	2	7	Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) is one of several grassland bird species that has declined during the last several decades. Although several studies have characterized the habitat requirements of breeding Henslow's Sparrows, winter habitat requirements for the species remain poorly known. The purpose of our study was to identify habitat variables associated with occupancy by Henslow's Sparrow on silvicultural lands in the core of its winter range in the Gulf Coastal Plain. Forty-one study sites were chosen on lands managed for timber production in Baldwin County, Alabama. Henslow's Sparrows selected moist sites that occurred as pitcher plant bogs or as transition areas between wet pitcher plant bogs and drier upland areas. A multiple logistic regression model identified the density of the grass Panicum verrucosum and the density of pitcher plants as the variables best able to explain the presence of Henslow's Sparrows. Sites occupied by Henslow's Sparrows had higher herbaceous vegetation densities and had been disturbed by timber harvest and/or fire more recently than unoccupied sites. Within occupied sites, Henslow's Sparrows chose areas with higher densities of herbaceous vegetation, especially P. verrucosum.

Many species dependent on the grass sward will be eliminated from the planted areas. Land should be maintained as conservation areas to ensure the long-term survival of the wildlife within the afforestable region. Ten land types, defined by combinations of classes of geology, altitude and rainfall, were sampled in the afforestable part of the Maclear district, Eastern Cape Province. Areas of five land types are required in a network of conservation areas to protect all the montane-endemic grasshopper, butterfly and bird species recorded. The addition of a sixth land type to this set of five would protect 93.8% of all the taxa considered. Regions within which conservation areas should be situated are indicated at the district scale.

New Zealand Journal of Ecology	23	1		53-60	1999	1999				English	1	15	We evaluated willow removal as a technique for enhancing habitat for birds of braided rivers by monitoring five bird species at three sites in the Mackenzie Basin, New Zealand, from 1991 to 1994. Four species - banded dotterel (Charadrius bicinctus), pied stilt (Himantopus novaezelandiae), black-fronted tern (Sterna albostriata) and South Island pied oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) used the areas of riverbed cleared of willows for nesting and foraging, at the same or greater density than other areas of riverbed already free from willows. Wrybills (Anarhynchus frontalis) were occasionally seen in cleared areas of riverbed but were not nesting there during the study. Densities of banded dotterel and wrybill were lowest at sites with the greatest densities of willows, and only three out of 327 monitored nests were located in willow habitat. Nest predation rates did not differ significantly among sites with differing levels of willow infestation, nor did they differ between areas of cleared riverbed and riverbed already free from willow. In addition to weed control, predator control may be necessary to increase bird populations. This study indicates that willow removal increases foraging and nesting habitat for some river bird populations, but further surveys are necessary to assess whether willow removal has any long-term benefits.

Northwest Science	73			45-63	(Special Issue) 1999	1999				English	1	26	The emphasis of forest management in the Pacific Northwest has shifted recently from the production of timber resources to the maintenance or restoration of biological diversity and ecosystem functioning. New standards and guidelines for management emphasize the retention of forest structures (live trees, logs, and snags) to reduce logging impacts, to enrich reestablished stands with important structural features, and to enhance connectivity across forest landscapes. However, little is known about the effects on wildlife of varying the level and spatial distribution of retained structures in forests of western Oregon and Washington. Replicated and controlled experiments within the Demonstration of Ecosystem Management Options (DEMO) study are beginning to quantify the effects of varying the level and spatial aggregation of green-tree retention during forest harvest on a variety of ecosystem components (e.g., vertebrates, invertebrates, vegetation, fungi), as well as snow hydrology and social perceptions of these types of regeneration harvests. Eight replicate blocks of six experimental treatments have been established on the Umpqua National Forest in Oregon, and on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and Capitol State Forest in Washington. The objectives of the wildlife studies are to quantify patterns of species richness, evenness, and relative abundance of birds, small mammals, bats, and amphibians before and after harvest to examine short-term treatment responses. Pre-treatment sampling has been completed on all sites, harvest treatments are in progress, and post-treatment sampling has begun. In this paper, we present an overview of our hypotheses and methods, and document the occurrence and relative abundance of species prior to harvest of the study blocks. Long-term studies of vertebrate response, habitat associations, and trophic interactions are planned. Results will inform managers on the consequences of alternative forest management strategies.

Calme, Sophie; Desrochers, Andre				Oecologia (Berlin)	118	3		361-370	1999	1999				English	0	9	Biotic assemblages of insular habitats are nested when poor assemblages are subsets of richer ones. Nestedness of species assemblages is frequent and may result from selective extinction or frequent colonization in insular habitats. It may also be created by a nested distribution of habitats among islands or by sampling bias. We sampled 67 isolated peatlands (7-843 ha) in southern Quebec, Canada, to measure nestedness of bird species assemblages among peatlands and assess the habitat nestedness hypothesis. Species and microhabitat assemblages were both strongly nested among peatlands. Whether sites were ranked by species richness, microhabitat richness or peatland area had no effect on nestedness. However, microhabitat nestedness was significantly reduced when sites were sorted by area rather than by microhabitat richness. As expected, if bird-microhabitat associations are responsible for the nested pattern of distribution, we found a positive correlation between the contributions of bird species and microhabitats to individual site nestedness. Nevertheless, microhabitat assemblages were significantly less nested than bird species assemblages, possibly because of frequent recolonization by birds or uneven sampling among sites.

Kube, Jan; Probst, Sandra				Vogelwelt	120	1		27-38	1999	1999				German	1	1	Densities of breeding bird populations were determined in 1998 in brackish water reedbeds on the island of Ruegen, German Baltic Sea coast. In order to determine potential effects of reed harvesting, we measured various parameters of the reed vegetation in mid April on seven study plots (ca. 10 ha each). Bird territories were mapped during April-June. Reedbeds that had been harvested up to two years prior to this study were easily recognised by their high density of seed-producing Phragmites plants and lack of a herbal layer. On harvested plots the average stem diameter was significantly lower than on unharvested plots, the density of stems per unit area was slightly higher. Ten nonpasserine waterbird species and four typical reed-dwelling passerines were found breeding. Overall breeding success was extremely low, mostly due to predation by wild boar Sus scrofa and fox Vulpes vulpes. Bearded Reedlings Panurus biarmicus nested only in mature reedbeds that had not been harvested for at least 3 years, Marsh Warblers Acrocephalus palustris nested only in unharvested low reeds. Over 80 % of Reed Warbler A. scirpaceus and Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus territories were located in reedbeds not subject to prior harvest. Population density of Reed Warbler was negatively related to the proportion of reed area harvested during the previous winter. Reed Bunting was the only species that appeared to profit from reed harvest, probably due to its preference for edge habitats. The results show that on the island of Rugen reed harvesting renders the habitat unsuitable for bird species typical of this habitat for at least two to three years. Modifications of the presently employed reed havesting schedule are proposed.	Kube, Jan; Vogelwarte Hiddensee, Zum Hochland 17, 18565 Kloster, Germany, Germany.

Braun, Hans-Gunther				Vogelwelt	120	1		39-51	1999	1999				German	0	1	In Berlin-Kreuzberg, an old city quarter with rather desolate buildings, the breeding bird community was studied on a 91 ha plot first in 1979 and again in 1991 after nearly half of the buildings had been restored or rebuilt. The results of both surveys were compared to assess the influence of restoration on the breeding avifauna. Bird species breeding on buildings have decreased drastically, e.g. Feral Pigeon Columba livia f. domestica (decrease of 75 %), House Sparrow Passer domesticus (-64 %), Starling Sturnus vulgaris (-60 %), Swift Apus apus (-25 %), and Jackdaw Corvus monedula (-20 %). On the other hand, tree-breeding species like Wood Pigeon Columba palumbus, Magpie Pica pica, and Hooded Crow Corvus corone cornix have increased. Out of a total of 23 breeding bird species on the whole plot, ten species have decreased and 13 species have increased. Five species disappeared from the plot, three species newly colonised the area. The total abundance decreased froma comparatively high level for Central Europe (239 bp/10 ha, in a section of 22,3 ha even 380.7 bp/10 ha) to an abundance which is typical for quarters with new blocks of flats (120.5 bp/10 ha). The number of species remained about the same. The restoration measures at the house fronts and the new small green courts behind the houses are evaluated from a bird conservation point of view. Finally, some protection measures for bird species breeding on buildings are proposed.	Braun, Hans-Gunther; Reichenberger Str. 122, 10999 Berlin, Germany, Germany.

Landscape and Urban Planning	42	2-4		157-168	7 December 1998	1998				English	2	29	Habitat loss and isolation associated with land conversion for human activities pose perhaps the most severe threat to the earth's biological diversity. Because the study of habitat fragmentation provides an important link between the concepts of landscape ecology and the practice of landscape architecture and planning, my dissertation research focused on the ecological consequences of changes in the spatial characteristics of native habitats. I completed two major field experiments with insects in a native grassland near Boulder, Colorado, USA, that directly tested ecological hypotheses regarding the influences of habitat spatial characteristics and patterns of land conversion on species loss, recolonization, and movement patterns. The first experiment focused on fragment size and connectivity, while the second experiment mimicked four sequences of land conversion that varied in size, connectivity and spatial arrangement of their remnant habitat patches. Both experiments yielded significant results that contribute to the ecological knowledge-base utilized in landscape architecture and planning projects. Specifically, the major findings of my field research were (1) fragment size influenced species loss; small fragments lost species at a higher rate than did larger fragments; (2) corridors reduced rates of species loss, but only in medium-sized fragments; (3) corridors enhanced recolonization of medium-sized fragments, (4) one of the three insect species examined moved preferentially in corridors; and (5) spatial configuration of land conversion sequences significantly influenced species richness.

Emu	98	4		276-287	December 1998	1998				English	2	12	The complexity of avifaunal response to fire is illustrated using long-term demographic data for passerines at Gooseberry Hill, Western Australia, that has experienced an average of one fire every two years in the 41 years since 1957. During a 26 year period from 1972 to 1997, when three major and eight minor fires occurred, the density of Splendid Fairy-wrens Malurus splendens ranged from a high of 105 adults/100 ha in 1985 to 20 adults/100 ha in 1994. Both of these extremes followed periods of similar fire frequency (five fires in preceding 10 years). However, in the ten years before 1985, all fires were of limited extent, whereas the ten year period up to 1994 began with an extensive 100% hot summer burn, closely followed by two smaller reburns. The aftermath of the major fire in 1985 and subsequent minor fires had a major detrimental impact on populations of Splendid Fairy-wrens, Western Thornbills Acanthiza inornata, Scarlet Robins Petroica multicolor and Yellow-rumped Thornbills A. chrysorrhoa, all of which declined during the following eight years, even though the vegetation had nearly recovered to 1985 conditions. This continued decline in bird densities was related to increased mortality of breeding birds and lowered productivity, due to temporary cessation of breeding by Western Thornbills and to increased nest predation and parasitism in Splendid Fairy-wrens. In addition, the broad extent of the 1985 fire reduced opportunities for immigration from elsewhere. Understanding this avifaunal response to fire would not have been possible without an extended period of study. Any fire management plans based on just two or three years data might have yielded recommendations quite detrimental to the fauna they were designed to protect.

Natural History Bulletin of the Siam Society	46	2		171-196	Winter 1998	1998				English	0	0	The bird community in a disturbed mature forest was compared with that found in secondary forest and a regenerating clearing. The mature forest sample areas had only slightly higher species richness, but relatively greater diversity as measured by Fisher's alpha index of diversity. The commonest species were relatively more abundant in the secondary forest and clearings than in mature forest habitat. The secondary forest nevertheless was still rich in bird species, supporting some nationally or internationally threatened species including terrestrial insectivores such as Gurney's Pitta Pitta gurneyi and Large Wren-Babbler Napothera macrodactyla. However, specialist frugivores such as pigeons, Green Broadbill Calyptomena viridis and Asian Fairy Bluebird Irena puella and some arboreal insectivores such as malkohas, woodpeckers and Malacopteron babblers, were much less frequent in the secondary forest than in the tall forest. Secondary forest and clearing were similar in the overwhelming abundance of a few species of bulbuls which were generalist insectivore-frugivores. Patches of secondary or degraded forest outside the margins of parks or sanctuaries may offer the only option for the expansion of protection into the lowland forest biome since there is virtually no mature forest left in the Thai lowlands. More work needs to be done to judge the conservation attributes of the smaller and more isolated forest fragments.

Wildlife Society Bulletin	26	4		867-876	Winter 1998	1998				English	0	5	We investigated the effects of prescribed burns in winter on the relative abundance and species richness of breeding and wintering birds in mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) grassland at the Welder Wildlife Foundation Refuge, Texas, from June 1995 to August 1996. We collected pre-treatment data in 1995, burned experimental plots in January 1996, and collected post-treatment data in 1996. Data were analyzed in a randomized, complete-block design with winter-burn and control treatments replicated 3 times each within 2 blocks (i.e., herbicide and non-herbicide). Relative abundance (P = 0.246) and species richness (P = 0.622) of breeding birds were not different between treatments. Relative abundance of wintering birds was greater (P = 0.002) in burned treatments, but species richness was not different (P = 0.602). Prescribed burns on mesquite grasslands had minimal effects on bird communities in the year following treatment. We recommend maintaining unburned areas adjacent to burns to provide habitat for bird species that declined after winter prescribed burning (i.e., grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Le Conte's sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), and sedge wren (Cistothorus platensis)).

Bird communities differed between sites with different levels of rock climbing. Four bird species were detected only at cliffs where no climbing occurred; 5 species were detected only at cliffs with moderate levels of climbing activity; and 3 species were seen only at cliffs with many popular climbing routes. European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were seen only at climbed cliffs. Birds at unclimbed cliffs were more likely to be perched at the faces of cliffs, whereas birds at popular climbing cliffs were more likely to be flying. At popular cliffs, birds were usually seen away from cliff faces, whereas at unclimbed cliffs birds were more likely to be detected near cliff faces.

I conducted surveys of the terrestrial bird communities at 12 locations in a residential area of Tokyo, Japan in both the breeding and wintering seasons in 1990-91, and identified habitat features associated with bird communities. In both seasons, the residential areas with abundant vegetation supported more species and higher densities of birds. Number of trees (>8 m in height) and average tree height were the most significant variables for explaining variances of diversity of bird species among study plots. Abundance and height of buildings were negative factors for diversity in the wintering season, conversely they were positive in the breeding season. Most bird species preferred to use land covered by vegetation. Land occupied by buildings and bare land tended to be avoided by birds and used by fewer species than expected. It was confirmed that vegetation, especially trees, was the key element for bird conservation in residential areas. I present environmental guidelines required for bird conservation in residential areas.

Natuurbraak: kansen voor akkervogels bij roulerende braaklegging.	Ellenbroek, Frank; Buys, Jan; Oosterveld, Ernst				Limosa	71	3		95-108	november 1998	1998				Dutch	0	2	In The Netherlands, much of the research on birds in agricultural habitats has been carried out on meadow birds in grassland areas. Until now, arable land has been given little attention. Like in grassland, the changes in farming practice on arable land must have had serious impact on breeding bird communities. Strongly negative population trends of some relatively well surveyed farmland birds like Grey Partridge and Corn Bunting confirm this expectation. After an absence of a few decades, set-aside land has returned in 1988 as part of the Dutch agricultural landscape. Since 1992, arable farmers wanting to qualify for income support from the European Union have to set-aside part of their land. Experiences in other European countries indicate that specific management regimes for set-aside fields may increase the natural value of arable farming areas. So far, little experience has been gained in The Netherlands, in particular with rotational set-aside. Therefore, the Centre for Agriculture and Environment initiated a field study on the effects of nature-oriented management of set-aside land on (breeding) birds, along with other fauna and flora. Between 1993 and 1995, the number of breeding birds was surveyed on 124 plots (141 ha) situated in various parts of the country. Territories of 25 species were recorded, the majority however occurred only in low numbers. Of eight species rather high numbers were recorded (Tab. 4). They reached densities of 0.8-2.8 territories per 10 ha. Skylark and Yellow Wagtail were most abundant. The density of seven species was at least twice as high as in the best reference areas of cropped land. Only Mallard did not show a higher density. The density of all species together was at least three times higher than in the reference areas. There were no significant differences concerning the vegetation type of the set-aside land and the time of soil preparation. Field margins yielded higher densities than entire fields.

Stands of early seral green ash undergoing primary succession had few small trees with western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis) in the understory. Some early seral green ash stands resulted from retrogression and had large trees with grass understory. Late seral green ash stands were represented by greater overstory cover consisting of green ash and chokecherry (Prunus virginiana) shrubs and small trees in the understory. Sixty-five of 81 bird species that were observed in these woodlands required woodland vegetation as part of their habitat. Tree- and shrub-nesting birds were the most common and were associated with late seral stages. Ground-nesting birds had mixed relationships between early and late seral stages. Cavity-nesting birds used snags and dead tree branches which occurred in all seral stages. Correlations of birds with vegetation measurements suggested habitat features birds may have selected for in these woodlands.

Murphy, Edward C.; Lehnhausen, William A.				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	4		1359-1372	October 1998	1998				English	2	50	Throughout its geographic range, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is rare and appears very similar in its foraging ecology to 2 broadly sympatric congeners, the three-toed (P. tridactylus) and hairy woodpecker (P. villosus). The purposes of our study were to test for differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek fire near Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2 years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ha. Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts, woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986.

Rodewald, Paul G.; Smith, Kimberly G.				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	4		1411-1417	October 1998	1998				English	1	20	Relatively little is known about the effects of uneven-aged forest management practices on eastern forest birds, despite the fact that such methods are now commonly practiced. In 1993-94, we studied the short-term effects of uneven-aged forest management on bird communities in oak-hickory forests of northwestern Arkansas. We estimated bird abundance in mature forests and on managed plots receiving either a heavy cutting of understory vegetation (understory treatment) or a combination of both understory cutting and selective cutting in the forest overstory (full treatment). Two nesting guilds and 7 of 14 species with adequate sample size showed significant treatment effects. Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus). Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens), and the understory-nesting guild were most abundant in mature forest. Indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), white-breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis), and eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) were more abundant on full treatment plots. Tufted titmice (Baeolophus bicolor) were most abundant on mature forest and understory treatment plots. The canopy-nesting guild was most abundant on understory and full treatment plots. Our results suggest that if removal of understory vegetation was practiced widely in the Arkansas Ozarks as part of uneven-aged management, populations of some ground- and shrub-nesting forest interior species of birds could be negatively affected, whereas a few forest canopy and edge species may respond positively. Future research on this type of uneven-aged management should examine effects of removing varying amounts of understory vegetation on both forest interior bird populations and forest regeneration.

Schulte, Lisa A.; Niemi, Gerald J.				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	4		1418-1429	October 1998	1998				English	1	29	Because logging has replaced fire as the most extensive and frequent disturbance regime in northeastern Minnesota, monitoring bird populations and their habitats has become increasingly important. We surveyed early-successional forests created by fire or logging for birds and their habitat during the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons. We found that overall bird species richness and number of individuals (territorial males/ha) were higher (P < 0.05) in burned forests than in logged forests. The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), house wren (Troglodytes aedon), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), Lincoln's sparrow (M. lincolnii), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were more abundant in burned areas. The Nashville warbler (Vermivora ruficapilla), chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica), black-throated green warbler (D. virens), and mourning warbler (Oporornis agilis) were present in greater numbers in the logged areas. We related these differences in bird presence and abundance to vegetation differences in the burned and logged habitat types. Burned areas had higher densities of dead trees, wider size ranges of dead trees, and greater heterogeneity in the shrub layer. Logged areas had higher densities of live trees, more live tree species, and wider size ranges of live trees. Red maple (Acer rubrum) was the live tree species found in greatest abundance in logged areas. If management goals include simulating natural disturbances like fire and maintaining bird populations, more dead trees should be left within logged habitats and the variability among logged areas should be increased.

Fleming, Kathleen K.; Giuliano, William M.				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	4		1430-1437	October 1998	1998				English	0	3	Many edge- and shrub-nesting bird species have exhibited population declines in the United States over the last 30 years, despite increasing abundance of edge habitat. Declines may be related to quality of edge habitat, rather than quantity. Border-edge cuts are a management technique used to modify existing edge habitat by creating a shrub transitional zone 15-40 m in width at the forest-field edge. To determine if the increased shrub growth in border-edge cuts affected edge-nesting birds, we tested the hypotheses that bird communities in border-edge cuts versus uncut edges have (1) greater abundance and species richness, and (2) greater nest success. We conducted line transect bird counts and nest searches in 12 pairs of border-edge cuts (2-3 yr old) and uncut edges. Border-edge cuts had greater horizontal (P = 0.008) and vertical (P < 0.001) cover than uncut edges. Avian abundance was higher in border-edge cuts than in uncut edges (P = 0.034), but species richness did not differ (P = 0.596). Of 60 bird species recorded, 13 were found only in border-edge cuts, and 23 were found only in uncut edges. Border-edge cuts supported more shrub- and edge-nesting species, while uncut edges contained more woodland species. There was no difference in Mayfield nest-success probabilities between the 2 edge types (P = 0.337). Evidence at depredated nests suggested snakes were the primary nest predators. Border-edge cuts may provide habitat for some declining populations of avian shrub-nesting species in Pennsylvania, but evidence of effects on reproductive success was inconclusive.

Brown, Stephen C.; Smith, Charles R.				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	4		1480-1491	October 1998	1998				English	1	22	Restoration of drained wetlands may contribute significantly to conservation of habitats for wetland birds, and state and federal agencies throughout the country rely on restoration and creation of wetlands to mitigate habitat losses to development. However, it is unclear if restored systems replace the habitat functions of natural wetlands, and few direct comparisons of multiple sites have been made. Three years after restoration, we compared the relative abundance and density of birds using 18 restored wetlands and 8 natural wetlands located in northern New York. Birds were classified as wetland dependent, wetland associated, or nonwetland. Abundances of species and of individuals in all 3 groups did not differ (P > 0.05) between restored and natural wetlands in any year. Densities of species in all 3 groups were consistently but not significantly lower at restored sites. Densities of individuals in the wetland-associated category and nonwetland category were significantly lower at restored sites for the first 2 years following restoration. Bird communities were significantly less similar between restored and natural sites than among restored sites. However, many of these differences may not persist following natural successional-development of the restored sites. The long-term persistence of appropriate plant communities will determine whether or not restored sites provide bird habitat comparable to natural wetlands. The restoration program successfully increased the amount of bird habitat available in the region. However, hectare-for-hectare, the restored wetland sites did not replace the habitat functions of natural wetlands during the time period of this study.

Calvo, Lorena; Blake, John				Bird Conservation International	8	3		297-308	September 1998	1998				English	0	2	Many studies have examined differences in bird communities between shade and sun coffee plantations but less is known about how different management practices within shade coffee plantations affect bird populations. This study compares diversity and abundance of resident and migrant birds in two shade coffee plantations located in Palajunoj, Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, that differ in their farming practices (e.g. pruning schedules and fertilizer regimes) and, consequently, in vegetation structure. One plantation represents a traditional, polyculture shade system whereas the second represents a more modernized, monoculture shade system. Both plantations supported many resident and migrant birds. Bird abundance and diversity were significantly greater during both wet and dry seasons on the traditional farm, due largely to the vegetation structure resulting from the different management practices. All plantations typically classified as "shade coffee" are not equivalent, much of their conservation value coming from the more diverse and structurally complex traditional polycultures rather than from the newer, monocultural systems. Coffee production techniques that affect the structural and floristic diversity of the vegetation (e.g. pruning, application of chemicals) have important consequences for birds.

Condor	100	3		485-492	August 1998	1998				English	0	6	Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) is widely distributed in the Southwestern United States, where it frequently occurs in association with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Fire suppression and fuelwood harvest likely have reduced oak abundance within the pine-oak type. Gambel oak occurs in multiple age-related growth forms, from small shrubs to large, old trees, and may provide important foraging and nesting habitat for breeding birds. I compared attributes of breeding bird communities in 16 northern Arizona ponderosa pine stands from 1993-1995, that were structurally similar except for the presence or absence of Gambel oak. Overlap in bird species composition was high; pine and pineoak stands had a mean Jaccard similarity value of 0.67. Five species were unique to pine stands, whereas 10 species were largely restricted to or only found in pine-oak stands. Overall bird diversity was significantly higher in pine-oak stands, which also had more species of Neotropical migrants, ground nesters, primary cavity excavators, and secondary cavity users than did pine stands. Pine and pine-oak stands had similar species evenness and similar rates of annual species turnover. Total bird abundance did not differ between cover types; however, primary cavity excavators were more abundant in pine-oak stands. Because of the apparent positive influence of oak on breeding birds, forest managers are encouraged to use treatments that retain and enhance the various growth forms of Gambel oak found in pine-oak stands.

Diaz, M.; Carbonell, R.; Santos, T.; Telleria, J.L.				Journal of Applied Ecology	35	4		562-574	August 1998	1998				English	0	27	1. Afforestation with pines (Pinus pinaster and, to a lesser extent, P. pinea and P. halepensis) seems to be the most probable land-use change over large areas of dry cereal croplands in central Spain in the next 10-20 years. This will be encouraged by changes in the subsidy policies of the Common Agricultural Policy that aim to decrease food production and restore the environmental diversity previously lost through agricultural intensification. This study addresses the factors influencing the richness and composition of breeding bird communities in these pine plantations and evaluates the potential environmental benefits of the afforestation programmes. 2. The complement of bird species breeding in 88 plantations ranging in size from 0.1 to 6775 ha was determined. Plantations were characterized according to size, distance to the nearest large plantation, vegetation structure and geographical location (northern moist vs. southern xeric Iberian plateaux). 3. Plantation size alone accounted for 67-75% of the variation in species richness, and was also the main trait explaining the patterns of presence/absence of most individual bird species. Plantations smaller than 25 ha only maintained 50% of the regional pool of forest birds during breeding, whereas this proportion increased to 69-86% for plantations of 25-100 ha. Geographic location, degree of isolation and vegetation structure were also important. Bird species richness decreased with distance to a large plantation, and increased with prevalence of undergrowth shrubs and with plant species richness. 4. Both species richness and the incidence of individual species in plantations were affected by geographical location. They were greater in plantations of the northern plateau, reflecting a trend of increasing densities of most forest bird species in Spain in more northerly locations. 5.

The authors marked a track of about 300 m long within four forest fragments found in the campus and, between April and November of 1995, visited these tracks recording the number of species and individuals of as well as ecological patterns of each species, such as feeding habits and position occupied in the vegetation stratum. From the data obtained, the following abundance parameters were calculated: avifauna similarity among the sites and the index of diversity. A total of 107 bird species were recorded in the forest fragments. It was noted an absence of several families of more specialized forest birds, such as Tinamidae, Contingidae and Trogonidae and of species of the families Dendrocolaptidae, Formicariidae, Pipridae and Picidae when compared to a tract of semideciduous montane forest of the Pogo Bonito Forest Reserve, representing a loss of about 48% of forest birds species, probably due to their very reduced sizes. This work demonstrates the inefficiency of very small forest fragments in maintaining certain more especialized forest bird species and the need of preserving larger fragments that are still left for conservation in the region.

Biological Conservation	85	1-2		183-197	July-August 1998	1998				English	3	54	Management options in commercial forestry include choice of conifers or broadleaves, rotation length, stand size and grazing regime. Each factor potentially affects the conservation value of woodland for birds. Relationships between these factors and the structure and composition of breeding bird communities were examined in 69 stands distributed across a range of plantations composed of predominantly native broadleaved and non-native coniferous trees in the Forest of Dean, western England, in 1992 and 1993. Each stand was classified as one of three high forest types: broadleaved, coniferous or mixed broadleaves and conifers. Stand size had no effect on bird communities. Species richness and overall bird abundance increased with forest age when all forest types were combined. Within stands of similar ages, there were no consistent differences in species richness or overall bird abundance between the three forest types or between grazed and ungrazed stands. However, bird communities in mixed stands were intermediate in their overall species composition to those in broadleaved and coniferous stands. Regression and gradient analyses (CCA and PCA) revealed that major gradients in the species composition of the bird communities were associated with stand age and with tree species composition. The proportion of individuals contributed by hole-nesting species was higher in broadleaved than coniferous stands and increased with stand age. The proportion of individuals contributed by migrants was higher in especially the early years, but also in the late years of the rotation. The proportion of migrants was higher in ungrazed than in grazed stands and increased with openness of the canopy and development of low vegetation. The diversity of stands in terms of tree sizes and tree species was positively correlated with both number of bird species and overall bird abundance.

Brawley, A. Hunter; Warren, R. Scott; Askins, Robert A.				Environmental Management	22	4		625-633	July-August 1998	1998				English	1	29	Tidal marshes have been actively restored in Connecticut for nearly 20 years, but evaluations of these projects are typically based solely on observations of vegetation change. A formerly impounded valley marsh at the Barn Island Wildlife Management Area is a notable exception; previous research at this site has also included assessments of primary productivity, macroinvertebrates, and use by fishes. To determine the effects of marsh restoration on higher trophic levels, we monitored bird use at five sites within the Barn Island complex, including both restoration and reference marshes. Use by summer bird populations within fixed plots was monitored over two years at all sites. Our principal focus was Impoundment One, a previously impounded valley marsh reopened to full tidal exchange in 1982. This restoration site supported a greater abundance of wetland birds than our other sites, indicating that it is at least equivalent to reference marshes within the same system for this ecological function. Moreover, the species richness of birds and their frequency of occurrence at Impoundment One was greater than at 11 other estuarine marshes in southeastern Connecticut surveyed in a related investigation. A second marsh, under restoration for approximately ten years, appears to be developing in a similar fashion. These results complement previous studies on vegetation, macroinvertebrates, and fish use in this system to show that, over time, the reintroduction of tidal flooding can effectively restore important ecological functions to previously impounded tidal marshes.

Boal, Clint W.; Mannan, R. William				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	3		864-871	July 1998	1998				English	0	28	Loss of nesting habitat due to urbanization and development has been identified as a primary threat to Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii), but this species can successfully nest in some urbanized areas. Hence, understanding the features of urban areas that promote occupancy by Cooper's hawks may become important in managing for the species. We measured nest tree, site, and area features at 49 Cooper's hawk nests representing 33 breeding pairs in Tucson, Arizona, between 1993 and 1996. Introduced eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.; 70.8%), aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis; 25.0%), and native cottonwood trees (Populus fremontii; 4.2%) were used as nest trees to a greater extent than expected based on their availability (P < 0.001). Urban nest trees were taller and of greater diameter than random trees. Nest sites (0.08 ha) were characterized by greater basal area, canopy cover, and number of trees >10 m tall when compared to random sites. Most nest trees were located in the yards of single-family residences (48.3%) and in high-use recreational areas (28.3%). Dominant land-use types in nest areas were high-density residential areas (65.9%) and high-use recreational areas (22.7%). Levels of human disturbance at nest sites did not appear to influence nest-site selection. Density of Cooper's hawks nests in Tucson was higher than in exurban areas and probably was associated with the large trees, water, and abundance of prey in the city. Maintaining nest sites for Cooper's hawks in Tucson will require maintaining groves of large trees.

Loyn, Richard H.				Pacific Conservation Biology	4	2		111-121	July 1998	1998				English	0	3	Birds were studied at 57 sites in Mountain Ash forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia in spring and summer 1995/96. The sites represented 41 patches of old-growth forest (up to 390 ha in size) in a matrix of regrowth mostly from severe fires in 1939 (57 years previously), with multiple sites in the four largest patches of old-growth and eight sites in 1939 regrowth. Relative bird abundance was assessed by an area-search technique. Generalized linear modelling was used to develop predictive models by regressing abundance of groups of bird species against patch size, isolation and some basic habitat and context variables. Total bird abundance (of all species combined) tended to be higher in old-growth patches than in 1939 regrowth, but riot significantly. There was no trend in total abundance with patch size or isolation. Fruit-eating birds tended to be commonest in small patches. Bark-foragers and uncommon birds favoured large patches, though the latter were most common in 1939 regrowth. More variation was explained by habitat and context variables such as aspect altitude and forest structure. Uneven-aged forest structure was often associated with small patches. It was concluded that old-growth forest patches can have similar values per hectare for forest birds whether they are large or small. The regrowth forest matrix appears to protect small patches from factors which reduce densities of forest birds in small forest patches in farmland. The data support the current policy of retaining all old-growth ash forest patches. A range of factors should be considered in selecting regrowth stands of various sizes to regrow as old forest of the future, including their intrinsic potential to develop particular habitats and produce a mix of forest structures in the landscape.

Canadian Journal of Zoology	76	6		989-997	June 1998	1998				English	0	13	To evaluate the potential of bog ecosystems to recover following peat mining, we compared bird species richness, abundance, and assemblages and vegetation among naturally revegetated and undisturbed bog sites in southeastern Quebec. Based on mining history, we selected 28 sites (12 natural, 9 abandoned after blockcut extraction, and 7 abandoned after vacuum extraction) in 15 bogs. We estimated percent cover for six vegetation strata in 106 plots with 100 m radius, on which bird point counts were conducted in 1993 and 1996. Vegetation structure differed significantly between natural, post-blockcut and post-vacuum sites. While vegetation cover was almost complete in natural sites, abandoned sites, especially post vacuum, were less vegetated, even after 20 years. Bird species richness and abundance were similar in natural and post-blockcut sites and both were higher than in post-vacuum sites. Ten of the 28 species studied in detail responded to site perturbation. Among them, the Palm Warbler was most closely associated with natural sites. Bird communities were closely associated with vegetation structure. Communities of post-blockcut sites were more similar to those of natural bogs than were bird communities of post-vacuum sites. Since the blockcut method of peat mining is no longer economically feasible, we conclude that bog habitat restoration should be accompanied by a preservation "safety net" area to counteract the lasting effect of vacuum peat mining on bird species assemblages.

Marsden, Stuart J.				Conservation Biology	12	3		605-611	June 1998	1998				English	1	13	Timber concessions cover 90% of forest on some Indonesian islands, but the effects of logging on endemic-rich island avifaunas are poorly known. I used a point count method to estimate population densities of Seram's lowland birds in recently logged forest and in unlogged forest. Few bird species were excluded from logged forest, and several species were similarly common in the two habitats. Bird species diversity (the Shannon index) was, however, significantly lower in logged forest. The proportion of Seram's species that declined after logging was comparable to that reported from species-rich continental areas. There were also some similarities in the types of birds most affected. Species that were rare in unlogged forests were no more likely to decline after logging than were common ones. Although birds with small global ranges fared no worse than widespread species, several endemic forms were seriously affected. So many of the region's taxa are endemic to single islands that logging concessions need to be examined at an individual island level and the presence or absence of endemic forms of susceptible genera considered.

Grant, Gilbert S.; Kirby-Smith, William W.				Estuaries	21	2		361-363	June 1998	1998				English	0	1	Open-marsh water management (OMWM) manipulates selected areas of an estuarine marsh by constructing narrow, deep ditches that harbor resident populations of predators of mosquito larvae. It does not, however, alter the surrounding vegetation by deposition of spoil mounds. We censused the summer (breeding and nonbreeding) bird populations in two adjacent salt marsh sites on Topsail Island, North Carolina, for two summers before OMWM ditching occurred and for four seasons postditching. A total of 53 nonbreeding species and five breeding species of birds were encountered on the study sites. None of the interannual changes in bird populations can be attributed to OMWM.

Densite de corvides (Corvidae) et predation de nids artificiels en relation avec la structure du paysage.	Timsit, O.; Clergeau, P.				Gibier Faune Sauvage	15	2		151-166	Juin 1998	1998				French	0	2	The bocage landscape that we are trying to preserve, or restore, to maintain biological diversity in agricultural landscapes could also incite opportunistic species, like certain corvids, to select such habitats. The predation pressure they exert has already been studied along extensive landscape gradients (from open fields to wooded habitats). It has not been assessed yet along shorter gradients, like those characterized by a bocage hedgerow network. In spring 1996, we started such a study in four nearby agricultural sites (three bocage sites and one polder site in the Mont-Saint-Michel bay) covering some 200 ha with decreasing hedge densities. To measure Corvidae frequentations in each site we made six counts covering the total range of the site. The carrion crow, Corvus corone, and the magpie, Pica pica, are the main species involved. Breeding pair densities were analyzed with the help of a map on which the occupied nests were recorded, and by counts of pairs showing breeding behaviour. These birds were less numerous in the most open sites (Jonckheere and Terpstra indices of presence test, P < 0.01, and the Armitage test of breeding pair density trends, P < 0.01). 169 artificial nests were used to assess predation rates. Nests placed up in trees were more rapidly destroyed than those placed on the ground (chi2 P < 0.05), whereas the latter were destroyed more frequently in an open landscape (Armitage test, P < 0.001). Total observed predation or predation due to corvids only, still could not be related to the presence of hedges. Thus changes in the bocage structure do have an impact on corvid densities, but are apparently difficult to correlate to predation pressures which, at this level of observation, are not very obvious. The differences in predation observed in relation to the position of the artificial nests could be explained by the corvids' feeding behaviour that differed in each site.

Southwestern Naturalist	43	2		155-162	June 1998	1998				English	0	8	Water developments on the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona, have not been adequately monitored for use by wildlife. We used pitfall trapping for herpetofauna, live-trapping for rodents, and transect surveys for birds to determine the small vertebrate species present and their use of three vegetation types at two water developments in 1994 and 1995. We observed 187 species of vertebrates, the majority (80%) of which were bird species. Although one water development was dry throughout the study, there was no difference in the species richness or abundance of reptiles or rodents between sites. Bird species richness and abundance was greater at the site with free-standing water. Although small mammal and reptile species used all vegetation types at each site, bird species primarily used the mesquite (Prosopis velutina) trees at the center of each site. We believe that birds and amphibians benefit from the construction of such sites to a greater extent than reptiles or rodents.

Ecological Applications	8	2		300-308	May 1998	1998				English	1	28	Species composition reflects a combination of environmental and historical events at a site; hence, changes in species composition can provide a sensitive measure of ecologically relevant changes in the environment. Here, we consider the analysis of species composition when multiple sites are followed through time. Analyses of temporal trends in species composition either summarize species composition into a few metrics (indices or axis scores) or analyze the similarity among sites. We develop and illustrate the similarity approach. Each pair of samples represents a pair of replicates, a pair from the same site at different times, a pair from different sites at the same time, or an unrelated pair. Differences among times can be estimated by comparing average temporal dissimilarity to average replicate dissimilarity. Temporal trends can be described by one of three statistics that measure progressive change, the correlation of temporal dissimilarity with the length of time between samples. These methods are illustrated using data on changes in a South Carolina zooplankton assemblage following disturbance, and changes in bird species composition on Skokholm Island, Wales. It is difficult to define and interpret temporal trends. Some definitions of interesting trends, like increasing divergence from another set of sample plots, place additional requirements on the sampling design. Including replicate samples or clustering sample plots and including "control" plots for comparison with sentinel sites would contribute to an understanding of changes in species composition.

Pacific Conservation Biology	4	1		79-89	May 1998	1998				English	0	4	Powerline easements are typically a strip cleared of trees and tall vegetation to a width of approximately 50 m. They may affect avifauna by modification and fragmentation of forest habitat. We investigated the responses of the bird community to easements at three sites in southeastern Australia using 25 m radius point-counts spaced at 50 m intervals from the easement to 300 m inside the forest. The easements caused an absolute loss of habitat for forest avifauna, with abundance and species richness at the easement less than 20% of the forest values. Four species of easement opportunist and one easement specialist provided evidence that the easement represented a now type of habitat for avifauna. A barrier effect of fragmentation may occur for four species of easement avoiders. These were small to medium-sized terrestrial birds associated with dense ground and/or understorey cover. The edge effect of fragmentation was an adverse impact on forest avifauna. At the margin (25-125 m from the easement) of the forest, bird abundance, mean species richness and total species richness were significantly less than the corresponding values for the interior (225-325 m) of the forest. The mean abundance at the sites varied from 13.0-17.7 birds/ha and the species richness varied significantly among sites. The adverse impacts of powerline easements on native avifauna could be minimized by site-specific management which includes strategies to minimize the loss of forest habitat and to ameliorate the effects of fragmentation.

DeGraaf, Richard M.; Hestbeck, Jay B.; Yamasaki, Mariko				Forest Ecology and Management	103	2-3		217-233	20 April 1998	1998				English	0	29	Assessment of faunal distribution in relation to landscape features is becoming increasingly popular. Technological advances in remote sensing have encouraged regional analyses of the distributions of terrestrial vertebrates. Comparisons of the strength of association of habitat characteristics at various scales of measurement of habitat structure are rare. We compared the associations of forest cover-type, stand size-class, and stand structure to abundance of breeding bird species in managed forest in northern New England. We surveyed breeding birds and measured stand structure in 20 stands to test the hypothesis that forest cover-type, stand size-class, and structure variables were equally associated with numbers of forest birds. We fit regression models to data from each data source to predict the log number of individuals for each species. We restricted our analyses to cover-types with > 1 size-class and to size-classes representing > 1 cover-type, and restricted our comparisons to bird species with at least 10 observations/yr for 2 yr. Of 31 bird species that met our criteria for analysis, a significant (P < 0.05) association was detected between bird abundance and structure data for 30 species, cover-type data for 19 species, and size-class data for 10 species. Stand structure was the best predictor of bird abundance for 25 species, cover-type for 5 species, and size-class for none. Of the 14 structure variables used in the analyses, total foliage volume of large and mid-size deciduous trees, density of mid-size trees, total woody stem density, total deciduous understory volume and total volume of large conifers were most frequently important in explaining variation in species abundances. Although each species had a unique set of structural affinities, multi-layered stands are apparently more important to long-distance migrants, in general, than to resident/short distance migrants.

Field techniques were standardized in all states. CRP fields consisted of either permanent introduced grasses and legumes (CP1) or permanent native grasses (CP2), and the plant species seeded in CRP fields differed within and among states. Vegetation characteristics of CRP fields varied considerably from state to state, but vertical density and total canopy cover (primarily grasses) were particularly high in Nebraska. Mean annual total bird abundance ranged from 0.1 to 5.1 birds per km of transect in CRP fields and from 0.1 to 24.2 in row-crop fields. The total number of bird species recorded in CRP fields in the six states ranged from 6 to 32; the range for row-crop fields was 8 to 18. The most abundant species in CRP fields differed among states but included the ring-necked pheasant, American tree sparrow, northern bobwhite, dark-eyed junco and American goldfinch. The most abundant species in row-crop fields included the horned lark, American tree sparrow, European starling, mourning dove, lapland longspur, meadowlarks and Canada goose. Some of the most abundant bird species wintering on CRP fields have been undergoing long-term population declines, thus this program has the potential to mitigate population losses.

We compared total abundance of diurnal breeding birds, individual bird species abundance, bird species richness, and vegetation composition and structure among streamside vegetation associations in Bear and Silvies valleys in eastern Oregon during 1993 and 1994. We collected bird and vegetation data along 4 replicate transects within each of 3 vegetation associations characterized by streamside vegetation structure: herbaceous xeric shrub, discontinuous mesic shrub, and continuous mesic shrub. Total bird abundance was greater (P < 0.001) in the continuous mesic shrub association than in the herbaceous xeric shrub and discontinuous mesic shrub associations during 1993 and 1994. Species richness was inconsistent between years among vegetation associations (P = 0.034); it was greatest (Ps ltoreq 0.037) in the continuous and discontinuous mesic shrub associations in 1993, and greatest (Ps ltoreq 0.003) in the continuous mesic shrub association in 1994. Yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii), American robin (Turdus migratorius), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), and Vaux's swift (Chaetura vauxi) were most abundant in the continuous mesic shrub association (Ps ltoreq 0.088).

Goguen, Christopher B.; Mathews, Nancy E.				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	2		474-484	April 1998	1998				English	1	25	Livestock grazing is a dominant land use of pinyon-juniper habitats in the western United States, yet the effects of grazing on breeding bird communities in this habitat have been poorly studied. We compared habitat structure, songbird abundance, and nesting productivity within pinyon-juniper woodlands on an actively grazed site and a site experiencing long-term relief from livestock grazing in northeastern New Mexico. From 1992 to 1995, we performed vegetation sampling, conducted songbird point counts, and located and monitored nests on 8 35-ha study plots. Four of these plots experienced moderate cattle grazing and 4 were ungrazed since 1973. We found no differences in habitat or vegetation features between grazed and ungrazed plots. Bird communities were similar, with only 1 of the 11 species we tested more abundant on the ungrazed treatment (western scrub-jay; Aphelocoma californicus). We detected no differences in nesting success or cause-specific rates of nest failure for 7 common bird species (P < 0.05), and we detected no differences in brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism rates for the major hosts between grazed and ungrazed areas. Greater than 75% of the nests of the solitary vireo (Vireo solitarius), western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana), and blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea) were parasitized on both treatments. These high parasitism rates may be the result of high densities of local cowbirds because of abundant feeding sites (i.e., livestock), the high mobility of cowbirds, and the close proximity of ungrazed plots to grazed areas (all <4 km). Our results suggest that 20 years of relief from grazing had little influence on the habitat structure or bird species composition of the pinyon-juniper woodlands on our study site. However, livestock grazing has indirectly affected the nesting success of some songbird species via the influence of grazing on cowbird abundance.

Aigner, Paul A.; Block, William M.; Morrison, Michael L.				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	2		485-496	April 1998	1998				English	1	7	Despite a history of oak clearing and thinning in California, little is known about the effects of firewood harvesting on wildlife in oak woodlands. We studied the effect of firewood harvesting on population trends of birds during the breeding season in an oak-pine woodland in the foothills of the northern Sierra Nevada, California. During fall-winter of 1993-94, total tree basal area on 30 3.1-ha study plots was reduced by approximately 23% via removal of commercial-grade oaks, but all old-growth trees and trees with obvious nest cavities or woodpecker granaries were preserved. An additional 30 plots represented controls. We used point counts to derive a population index of birds 1 breeding season before and 2 breeding seasons after harvesting. We detected population shifts in 14 species (7 year-round residents, 4 breeding migrants, 1 migrant, 2 winter residents), of which 10 showed consistent population increases, 2 showed consistent population decreases, and 2 showed varying population changes in the 2 seasons after harvesting. Six of the species that increased on harvested plots appeared to respond to the presence of brush piles. Responses of other species were less clearly linked to a particular aspect of vegetation change. Although we found a negative effect of harvesting on only 2 species, the Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis) and Hutton's vireo (Vireo huttoni), statistical power to detect anything less than total extirpation of many uncommon species was <0.8. Our results indicate that small-scale firewood harvests that reduce basal area by <25% and preserve nest cavities and granary trees have minimal negative short-term effects on most of the more common bird species present during the breeding season, but we caution that effects on uncommon species may have gone undetected.

Melvin, Stefani L.; Webb, James W., Jr				Wetlands	18	1		59-69	March 1998	1998				English	0	21	Birds were surveyed by censusing strip transects monthly from October 1990 through September 1991 in seven created and seven natural salt marshes located in lower Galveston Bay. All birds observed using the transect, the airspace above the transect, and 5m of bay bottom adjacent to the transect were recorded. Species richness and species diversity were calculated for each salt marsh and compared between natural and created sites. Species richness and diversity were greater in natural salt marshes due to the occurrence of migratory waterfowl, wintering shorebirds, and typical marsh species such as rails and marsh sparrows. Birds using created salt marshes consisted primarily of gulls and terns, especially during the nesting season. Bird density was greater in natural marshes during fall and winter months, while created marshes had higher bird density from March through July. Created salt marshes provided bird habitat, however not necessarily for the same species assemblage as natural salt marshes.

Hanski, Ilpo K.				Wildlife Biology	4	1		33-46	March 1998	1998				English	0	9	The flying squirrel Pteromys volans is an arboreal rodent and inhabitant of Palearctic boreal forests. In Finland, the flying squirrel has been classified as a declining species which needs to be monitored. I studied home ranges, habitat use and nocturnal activity of eight adult flying squirrels by radio tracking in fragmented coniferous forests in Finland during June - December, 1996. Average home-range size of the flying squirrel measured by the 100% MCP was 6.5 ha. In summer, the average size of the 95% cluster area was 2.3 ha and the 80% core area 0.5 ha. The core areas represented only 7.8% of the 100% MCP area and were composed of 2-6 separate patches in the home ranges of individual squirrels. Radio-tagged squirrels used several nests, both old woodpecker cavities and dreys for nesting and diurnal roosting. The combined density of all deciduous tree species was significantly greater in the 80% core areas than within the 100% MPC in the summer data set. In the polychotomous logistic regression model the great canopy cover, high densities of alders Alnus incana and A. glutinosa and aspen Populus tremula significantly explained the ranked utilization classes (utilization rank from highly used areas to least used areas: 80% core - 95% cluster - 100% MCP). The three most abundant deciduous trees species (birches Betula pendula and B. pubescens, aspen, alder) constituted 87% of trees used by squirrels in summer. Flying squirrels were found in aspens more often than expected according to their availability. The results show a clear preference for deciduous trees and a preference for the parts of home ranges with higher densities of alders and aspen. The flying squirrel seems to be capable of using several cover types, including young forest stands, as foraging and moving areas and are able to move across semi-open clear-cut areas.

Masters, Ronald E.; Lochmiller, Robert L.; McMurry, Scott T.; Bukenhofer, George A.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	26	1		148-158	Spring 1998	1998				English	0	16	The U.S. Forest Service plans to restore >40,000 ha of the fire-dependent shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)-grassland community on the Ouachita National Forest and potentially >780,000 ha of the pine-grassland community throughout the Southeast to benefit the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Concern has arisen over impacts of large-scale conversion of closed-canopy forests to open pine-grassland woodlands. We evaluated how an ecosystem approach to habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected small mammals. During 2 winters we compared small mammal occurrence and abundance in untreated pine-hardwood stands to stands following wildlife stand improvement (WSI; midstory removal), and with WSI-treated stands in the first, second, and third dormant seasons following prescribed fire. Total abundance of small mammals was highest in WSI stands and was a more direct response to WSI (change in stand structure) than to fire. Increased species richness and diversity in the second year of this study was strongly related to both WSI and fire. No species was adversely affected by WSI or by fire. Rather, WSI and fire-reduced midstory, increased dead debris in the understory, promoted herbaceous production, and increased woody sprouting. Total community abundance, richness, and diversity were lowest in untreated stands. White-footed mice (Peromyscus spp.; primarily white-footed mouse (P. leucopus)) were the dominant species, accounting for 68% of the 611 individuals collected. Restoration efforts may be particularly beneficial to generalist species such as P. leucopus as well as to more specialized species, such as golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli) and fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens) that historically may have depended upon pine-grassland habitats. Restoration of pine-grassland communities may enhance small mammal communities by reestablishing a landscape element that was present during presettlement times.

Conservation Biology	12	1		169-176	February 1998	1998				English	0	18	The native wildlife of Mauritius is highly threatened by a variety of influences other than habitat destruction. Protection from habitat destruction alone cannot guarantee its conservation and the damage already sustained is not fully reversible. Therefore, the ideal for conservation-maintenance or restoration of self-sustaining populations of all species in native ecosystems-is presently unattainable. We assessed three long-term strategies for maintaining and increasing populations of threatened native birds on the mainland and offshore islets of Mauritius, with respect to efficacy, sustainability, and side-effects. Rehabilitation of native vegetation on the mainland is likely to improve food availability over limited areas, but it can only form the basis of a long-term bird conservation strategy when population density of introduced animals, especially predators, can be reduced sustainable at low financial cost, and without adversely affecting native wildlife. Marooning bird populations on ecologically rehabilitated islets can eliminate the predator problem, but they would be vulnerable to catastrophes (especially cyclones) and possibly disease, and much habitat management work is still needed. A third, novel strategy-enhancement of mainland habitat using exotic plants allows creation of source habitats, greatly reducing the predator threat. It also permits larger areas to be managed, and at lower cost, than is the case with intensive rehabilitation. Habitat management regimes for conservation of threatened species or communities must be designed specifically to alleviate population-limiting factors. In altered environments certain exotic plants can be essential to the survival of native animal species. The most effective conservation measure must not be assumed always to be the rehabilitation of native vegetation.

Merrill, Samuel B.; Cuthbert, Francesca J.; Oehlert, Gary				Conservation Biology	12	1		190-199	February 1998	1998				English	0	10	Managers of upland forest generally operate with the assumption that leaving residual timber in clearcuts is beneficial for wildlife. Our primary objective in this study was to evaluate the contribution of residual Patches to forest birds by (1) characterizing differences in components of bird diversity between clearcuts with and without residual patches, (2) characterizing differences in components of bird diversity between residual patches and clearcut edges, and (3) describing any clearcut-wide effects of residual patches for any bird species or group. Breeding birds were surveyed in 40 aspen clearcuts (20 clearcuts with and 20 clearcuts without residual patches) 3-9 years old from May to July 1993 in northern Minnesota, Sixteen additional survey points were established, eight each in clearcut edge and in clearcuts with residual patches but with the survey point outside the residual patch. Two diversity indices, four avian nesting guilds, and 12 bird species showed significant differences between treatments when analyzed with multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance. Five of the seven species significantly associated with residual patches are of high regional management concern: Very (Catharus fuscescens), Ovenbird (Seiurus autocapillus), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Phucticus ludovicianus), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), and Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens). Results from this study suggest that residual patches contribute to forest-bird diversity in northern Minnesota aspen clearcuts, and may enhance bird populations on regional and landscape scales.

Graveland, Jaap				Ardea	86	2		187-201	1998	1998				English	1	21	Several species of migratory marsh birds have declined in Central and Western Europe. An important question is whether this decline is primarily caused by loss of wetlands on the wintering grounds in Africa or by a decline in habitat quality in the breeding areas. Significant losses of Reed Phragmites australis beds have been reported in many European countries, presumably as a result of unnatural water level regimes and eutrophication. We studied the reed requirements of nesting Great Reed Warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus in relation to reed availability in The Netherlands. Numbers of Great Reed Warblers have declined dramatically but the species is less dependent on marshland in its winter quarters than most other migratory marsh birds. Great Reed Warblers nested almost exclusively in reed standing in water and this type of reed has become scarce in The Netherlands. The present distribution of water reed indicates that the man-induced reduction in natural fluctuations of the water level has been an important factor in its decline. Water reed represents the first stage of the succession in a reed marsh. Eventually, loss of water reed will therefore affect the entire marsh bird community. Restoration of natural water level fluctuations seems the most effective course for remedial action, but will be difficult to accomplish because of the conflicting interests of nature and agriculture.

Earnst, Susan L.; Neel, Larry; Ivey, Gary L.; Zimmerman, Tara				Colonial Waterbirds	21	3		301-313	1998	1998				English	0	5	The status of the White-faced Ibis (Plegadis chihi) in the Great Basin is of concern because of its small population size and the limited and dynamic nature of its breeding habitat. We analyzed existing annual survey data for the White-faced Ibis breeding in the Great Basin and surrounding area for 1985-1997. Methods varied among colonies and included flight-line counts and fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter surveys. The number of White-faced Ibis breeding pairs in the Great Basin area has nearly tripled since 1985, despite years of severe flooding and drought at major breeding areas. This growth is reflected in both peripheral (i.e., Oregon, California, Idaho) and core (i.e., Nevada and Utah) components of the population. Our data on colony dynamics in Oregon and Nevada illustrate the ability of the highly nomadic White-faced Ibis to compensate for poor conditions at traditional colony sites by moving among colonies and rapidly colonizing newly available wetlands. We suggest that the White-faced Ibis would benefit from a landscape mosaic of well-distributed peripheral wetlands and persistent colony sites. The nomadic nature of the White-faced Ibis and the dynamic nature of their breeding habitat necessitates that wetland management decisions and population monitoring be conducted in a regional context.

Our results showed that woodlot area is an important predictor of the number of individuals and the species richness of birds in each woodlot. Based on the species composition of birds in wintering season, the fragmented woodlots were classified into four types by TWINSPAN: those are core woodlots, woodlots surrounding core ones, isolated and small woodlots, and isolated and middle-sized woodlots. By canonical discriminant analysis, it was indicated that the connectivity between woodlots and the vegetation structure are also important factors influencing bird communities. The necessity of controlling these factors for avian conservation was pointed out.

Rolstad, Jorund; Majewski, Przemyslaw; Rolstad, Erlend				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	1		11-23	January 1998	1998				English	1	24	To investigate whether the black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) is threatened by modem forestry practices, we studied the use of habitats and feeding substrates in a managed boreal forest landscape of southcentral Scandinavia. Clearcutting practices have affected 80% of the 10,000-ha study area. In total, we located 219 radiotagged birds 5,638 times during 1990-94, of which habitat was described at 722 locations of 103 birds. For feeding habitat, birds preferred young plantations (15-30 yr) dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) and with high canopy closure. For feeding substrates, woodpeckers preferred stumps in young plantations and snags in old forest. Forest >50 years old was preferred for resting and display. The preference for young plantations as feeding habitat corresponded with habitats where the staple food source, wood-living ants (mostly carpenter ants; Camponotus spp.), was most abundant. Year-round home ranges decreased in size with an increasing proportion of young plantations in the landscape. We conclude that in continental Scandinavian forests, where snow depths are moderate (<0.7 m), food resources for the black woodpecker are well secured with present-day forestry practices.

Kilgo, John C.; Sargent, Robert A.; Chapman, Brian R.; Miller, Karl V.				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	1		72-83	January 1998	1998				English	2	14	Bottomland hardwood forests support an abundant and diverse avifauna, but area of this forest type has been reduced, and current projections indicate continued declines. We compared breeding bird abundance indices and species richness among bottomland hardwood stands ranging in width from <50 m to >1,000 m and enclosed by forested habitat. We also compared avian abundance indices and richness among stands enclosed by pine (Pinus spp.) forest and stands enclosed by field-scrub habitats. Total species richness and species richness of Neotropical migrants were associated positively (P < 0.05) with stand width in all years. Total bird counts differed among width classes in all years, with counts generally greatest in width classes <50 m and >1,000 m. Counts of Neotropical migrants differed (P < 0.05) among width classes in 1993 and 1995 and followed the same general trend as total bird count. Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceous) were more abundant in smaller width classes (P < 0.05), whereas the opposite was true for white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) and northern parula (Parula americana). Probability of occurrence was associated positively (P < 0.05) with stand width for 12 species and negatively with stand width for 1 species. Total bird count and the counts of blue-gray gnatcatcher in 1995 and of northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in both years were higher in field-enclosed stands (FES) than in pine-enclosed stands (PES). No species analyzed was more abundant in PES than in FES. We conclude that even narrow riparian zones can support an abundant and diverse avifauna, but that conservation of wide (gtoreq500 m) riparian zones is necessary to maintain the complete avian community characteristic of bottomland hardwood forests in South Carolina.

Jokimaki, Jukka; Suhonen, Jukka				Landscape and Urban Planning	39	4		253-263	January 1998	1998				English	2	70	Habitat selection of wintering land-birds was studied in 31 human settlements in Finland. A total of 26 wintering bird species representing 5155 individuals were observed. Between-year variation (CVB%) and short-term fluctuation within one winter (CVW%) in species richness (CVB = 10% CVW = 15%) were low, as were total numbers of birds (CVB = 22% CVW = 24%) and populations of the most common bird species (CVB = 20-40% CVW = 15-47%). The most abundant bird species (e.g., Passer domesticus, Parus major and Pica pica) occurred in most of the study sites. The total densities of omnivorous birds, sedentary birds and bird species that commonly use feeding tables were higher in a heavily urbanized areas than in moderately or less urbanized areas. According to the Canonical Correspondence Analysis. three corvid species populations, P. domesticus and Columba livia domestica were positively related to human population density. Corvus corone cornix and P. domesticus populations correlated positively with the proportion of the built-up areas in the study plots. The omnivorous diet of these species was a possible reason for their success in urban environments. Dendrocopus major, Parus montanus, Parus cristatus, Parus ater and Certhia familiaris were negatively related to the urbanization axis. These species live mainly in coniferous forest habitats and are probably unable to use deciduous-dominated urban parks in winter time. To attract these species, coniferous trees and shrubs should also be used in park management and planning in northern latitudes. Many species, like Pic. pica, Carduelis chloris and Parus caeruleus, were located at an intermediate place on an urban-forest gradient axis. We suppose that these species are the most probable candidates for colonizing or increasing their abundances in European towns and cities in near the future.

Sind Spechte "gute" Indikatoren der okologischen Situation von Waldern?	Scherzinger, Wolfgang				Vogelwelt	119	1		1-6	1998	1998				German	0	1	Density and population trends of specialized woodpeckers are expected to reflect current habitat quality of forests and woodlands, e.g. amount of old growth, dead wood, tree species diversity and structural diversity. I investigated whether this expectation was met prior to and during a major bark beetle outbreak in the Bavarian Forest National Park. Surveys from 1974-1977 showed distinct habitat-related concentrations of woodpecker diversity (seven species) in this mountainous forest. Woodpecker diversity correlated with tree species diversity as well as with age of trees. These results indicated that woodpeckers are 'good' indicators of certain habitat characteristics. Woodpecker numbers on an 80 ha study plot were strongly affected by a large-scale bark beetle outbreak following a storm in 1983: a steep six-year increase in the number of species and density of woodpeckers was followed by a rapid decrease in abundance as soon as most trees had died. The drop in woodpecker densities to levels prior to the outbreak contrasts with a striking increase of dead wood and canopy gaps. In such 'catastrophic' situations habitat parameters other than amount of dead wood limit woodpecker abundance (e.g. lack of cover). To understand such factors, age distribution of trees, amount of dead wood and structural parameters must be monitored continuously in a given area. However, such efforts make the use of woodpeckers as bioindicators superfluous. It is concluded that woodpeckers can function as bioindicators only within certain limits of ecological conditions.

Kreuziger, Josef				Vogelwelt	119	2		65-90	1998	1998				German	0	1	In the nature protection area "Kuehkopf-Knoblochsaue" (2,369 ha) on the river Rhine in Hesse, central Germany, natural inundation dynamics were re-established on 1400 ha since 1983. 330 ha of cultivated fields were reconverted to meadows and commercial forestry was abandoned. The response of the breeding bird community to these changes was studied from 1994 to 1996 by means of a grid-square survey (108 squares of 25 ha each). The results were compared with those of a study in 1979 that used identical methods. A total of 89 breeding bird species was found in 1994-96, four more than 1979. Over a third of the species increased in abundance, less than 10% decreased. On average, the number of species increased from 24.8 to 30.0 per 25 ha square. This small-scaled increase in species richness was mostly due to structural changes of the vegetation during the restoration process. In wooded habitats this resulted in improved food availability, on the former agricultural fields opportunities for nest placement increased considerably (through growth of bushes). Over the 16 year period most species showed considerable changes in dispersion within the study area. In contrast, most species breeding in reed beds and along the water's edge decreased. This may have resulted from reduced food-availability caused by pesticide use against mosquitos (BTI) and acceleration of water flow in the river Rhine. Long-distance migrants showed more negative trends than residents or partial migrants. Independently of the migration strategy, conditions on the breeding grounds seem to be of greatest importance for long-term population trends.

Bayne, Erin M.; Hobson, Keith A.				Conservation Biology	11	6		1418-1429	December 1997	1997				English	6	84	Fragmentation of forested landscapes can reduce the reproductive success of birds occupying residual forest patches. Previous studies, however, have focused primarily on bow nest predation can change when landscapes become fragmented by agriculture rather than by logging. To determine if predation on artificial nests in forest patches was influenced by the surrounding landscape, we placed ground and shrub nests along the edge and interior of forest patches located in agricultural, logged, and contiguous forest landscapes within a single region of the southern boreal mixed wood forest of central Canada. Nest predators were identified using remotely triggered cameras and by marks left in plasticine eggs, whereas the relative abundance of nest predators such as corvids and small mammals was estimated by surveys and live-trapping. The percentage of ground nests destroyed at the edge and interior of patches in the logged and contiguous forest landscapes was significantly lower than at the edge or interior of patches in the agricultural landscape. No differences in predation rate were observed for shrub nests among landscapes. We attributed higher rates of predation in the agricultural landscape to higher densities of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in the interior and a greater diversity of predators along edges. The similarity in predation rate between logged and contiguous forest landscapes suggests that fragmentation caused by logging may result in little change in predator communities and in this respect, might be similar to fragmentation caused by natural disturbance regimes such as fire. In contrast, fragmentation by agriculture seems to have more serious consequences for nesting birds. Policy changes that limit the growth of agriculture in the southern boreal mixed wood forest are required to conserve the diverse avifauna of this region.

Best, Louis B.; Campa, Henry, III; Kemp, Kenneth E.; Robel, Robert J.; Ryan, Mark R.; Savidge, Julie A.; Weeks, Harmon P., Jr; Winterstein, Scott R.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	25	4		864-877	Winter 1997	1997				English	1	38	We compared the abundance and nesting success of avian species in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields during the summer with that in rowcrop fields over 5 years (1991-1995) for 6 midwestern states (Ind., Ia., Kans., Mich., Mo., and Nebr.). Field techniques were standardized in all states. CRP fields consisted of either perennial introduced grasses and legumes (CP1) or perennial native grasses (CP2), and the plant species seeded in CRP fields differed within and among the states. Disturbances to CRP fields included mowing (partial or complete), application of herbicides, and burning. The height, vertical density, and canopy coverage of vegetation in CRP fields were measured in each state; values for these measurements were particularly low in Kansas. Mean annual total bird abundance in CRP fields ranged from 4.9 to 29.3 birds/km of transect. The most abundant species on CRP fields differed among states but included red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and dickcissels (Spiza americana). Although the total number of bird species was similar in CRP and rowcrop fields across the region, bird abundance was 1.4-10.5 times greater in the former. Nests of 33 bird species were found in CRP fields compared with only 10 species in rowcrop fields, and the number of nests found was 13.5 times greater in CRP fields. Nest success in CRP fields was 40% overall; predation was the greatest cause of nest failure. Long-term farm set-aside programs that establish perennial grass cover, such as the CRP, seem to provide many benefits for grassland birds, including several species for which conservation is a great concern.

Wilson Bulletin	109	4		595-613	December 1997	1997				English	0	10	I examined the long-term dynamics of wintering and breeding bird communities at the Barrens Grouse Habitat Management Area (HAM) in central Pennsylvania. I compared community structure (species richness and population abundances) among three forested sectors that varied in extent of clearcutting and among forested plot types of different age since clearcutting from 1993-95 (termed period 2). These results, which were obtained six-eight years subsequent to a third cutting cycle, were then contrasted to those from a previous study (1988-90, termed period 1). The Barrens Grouse HMA consisted of three distinct sectors: a contiguous uncut stand, a series of uncut strip corridors, and a mosaic of small (1 ha) forest patches (plots). I observed 12 wintering bird species in period 2; most species (67%) were trunk-bark foragers. Uncut plots were used more often (P < 0.05) by wintering birds than clearcut plots, perhaps because uncut plots contained rough-barked trees as foraging substrate and more favorable microclimatic conditions. Of the 40 breeding bird species noted in period 2, most were ground-shrub foragers occurring principally in forested corridor and patch sectors. Abundances of six ground-shrub foraging species were higher (P < 0.05) in the forested patch than in other sectors in period 2; these species were found primarily in recent clearcut plots. Abundances of sallier-canopy foragers were higher (P < 0.05) than expected in contiguous forest and forested corridor sectors in period 2. Species richness, abundances of all wintering species combined, and abundances of two foraging guilds (trunk-bark and ground-shrub foragers) were similar among sectors in periods 1 and 2 in both winter and the breeding season. Abundances of three wintering species, however, were greater (P < 0.05) in period 2 than in period 1.

Wilson Bulletin	109	4		614-629	December 1997	1997				English	1	22	Woodpeckers were censused in 60 fixed-radius (300 m) circular plots (divided into eight 45degree-arc pie-shaped sectors) in mature forests (60-80 years-old) of three forest types (20 plots per type) in eastern Texas: bottomland hardwood forest, longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savannah, and mixed pine-hardwood forest. A total of 2242 individual woodpeckers of eight species was detected in 144 h of censusing. Vegetation characteristics in plot sectors with and without woodpeckers were compared. Woodpecker presence and abundance were primarily associated with the occurrence of large snags and logs. Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus) were the most abundant and widespread species, especially in areas containing more hardwoods than pines. Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) were the least abundant and most habitat-restricted woodpecker, occurring only in the longleaf pine savannah. Pileated Woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus) were the most evenly distributed species among the forest types, but occurred primarily in mature forests with large snags and logs. Bottomland hardwood forests were important for Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus), Redheaded Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), and Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus varius) during the fall and winter, and for Downy Woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens) during the summer and winter. The Hairy Woodpecker (P. villosus) was most frequently encountered in areas of recent disturbance in the mixed pine-hardwood forests, especially in fall. Vocal imitation of a Barred Owl (Strix varia) increased the number of woodpecker detections by 71%.

Boren, Jon C.; Engle, David M.; Masters, Ronald E.				Ecological Modelling	103	2-3		251-266	17 November 1997	1997				English	0	11	Probability of occurrence of selected avian species was modeled as a function of modeled changes in landscape cover types in two landscapes to test whether (1) exotic and generalist avian species will continue to increase is an high density rural population landscape; and, (2) native grassland avian species will continue to increase in a low density rural population landscape. Landscape cover types were modeled with logistic regression based on temporal changes between 1966 and 1990. Demographic-economic regression models also were used to predict landscape cover types in year 2014 based on selected independent variables. Logistic regressions were used to model probability of occurrence of selected avian species based on predicted area of landscape cover types in year 2014. Model output of vegetation cover types suggests the continued use of intensive agriculture management practices in the high density rural population landscape while extensive agriculture management practices will maintain the native vegetation component in the low density rural population landscape. Our models suggest continued intensive agriculture practices associated with the high density rural population landscapes will adversely affect native grassland bird species to a greater magnitude than extensive ranching practices in the low density rural population landscapes.

Lopez, G.; Moro, M.J.				Journal of Applied Ecology	34	5		1257-1272	October 1997	1997				English	1	19	1. The forested habitats in a large part of the Mediterranean semi-arid climates of Spain are dominated by Aleppo pine forests, most of which are managed plantations. Despite this, the effects of changes in the structure and composition of vegetation on birds are unknown. The work reported here was an attempt to detect the relationships between vegetation characteristics and the bird species that inhabit these forests. 2. The point-count method was used to estimate the presence of bird species and their abundance in Aleppo pine plantations in winter and spring. Four perpendicular 15-m transects were traced in each counting station to estimate the size and density of pines, the cover of main species in understorey vegetation and its height. Correspondence analysis was used to find the most important variables in the composition of bird communities, as well as in understorey composition and vertical structure. 3. The composition of bird communities at forest sites was better explained by understorey characteristics than by tree-layer variables. Bird species composition was related to understorey composition in both seasons. 4. A significant linear regression model was found relating bird species richness during the breeding season to understorey composition, in particular variation in Quercus ilex and Q. coccifera cover. No significant model could be found for bird species richness in winter. 5. The probability of finding a bird species at a given site within pine plantations was modelled using logistic regression. 6. Maintenance or introduction of Q. ilex in the understorey of Aleppo pine plantations would increase the diversity of breeding bird communities and would also improve habitat quality for forest bird species with limited distribution in semi-arid climates. On the other hand, a reduction in pine density would have little effect on these bird communities provided that an appropriate understorey was conserved.

Journal of Wildlife Management	61	4		1253-1261	October 1997	1997				English	0	10	We studied movement of color-marked common loons (Gavia immer) among small lakes (4-349 ha) in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to determine the frequency, timing, and ecological causes of multiple-lake usage. Most instances of multiple-lake usage fell into I of 5 categories: (1) territorial defense of 2 or more lakes by a breeding pair, (2) post-reproductive wandering, (3) territorial shifts prior to breeding, (4) dispersal of displaced breeders, or (5) long-distance movements by young birds. Overall, distances moved by adult loons between lakes were shorter than expected. The frequency of such movements might indicate reconnaissance for new territories, consistent with the frequent territorial takeover observed in this species. Regular use by loons of small clusters of lakes suggests that a management strategy that preserves only small, isolated breeding lakes might be inadequate to sustain nesting pairs and also might hamper natural dispersal between lakes.

Bestandsentwicklung und Habitatwahl des Weisssternigen Blaukehlchens Luscinia svecica cyanecula im Coburger Land von 1971 bis 1996.	Theiss, Norbert				Ornithologischer Anzeiger	36	2-3		105-124	September 1997	1997				German	0	0	The development of the Bluethroat population in the countryside around Coburg, (ca. 1500 sq. kilometres) is shown and analysed from 1971 to 1996. From 1690 to 1971 the Bluethroat was registered as a rare not yearly breeding bird in this area, especially in the Upper Main valley. Beginning from 1971 the total population size increased permanently and reached a first maximum with 102 breeding pairs in 1981. However, breeding pairs decreased to 51 (50%) from 1982 to 1985. In the following 11 years the total population size increased very quickly to 176 breeding pairs. This is 10% of the species' total population of Germany. The reasons for these fluctuations lie in the succession of the vegetation in washponds of gravel plants in the Upper Main valley and by spreading of overgrown ditches in open meadows under extensive use by agriculture in the area around Coburg. Details of the succession of the vegetation in washponds and in ditches in agro areas and wetland are described. Some populations in gravel plants with a maximum of 20 breeding pairs collapsed in 10 to 15 years. If no landscape management programme will be established, the population size in the Coburg county will decrease as quickly as the population in the Upper Main valley 15 years ago. The dispersal of the population in the county of Coburg could only be reached after omitting the yearly cleaning of the ditches so that reed could spread out. The River Main population, settled first, serves as feeder to the Coburg population, as ringed birds show. Over 90% of the total population lives in anthropogenic habitats, with 48% in wash or gravel ponds and 31% in ditches with reed in extensively used agricultural or wetland. The development of the River Main and the Coburg populations is twofold: The Upper Main valley population can be stabilized if necessary habitat protection programmes start.

Entwicklung der Wasservogelbestande am Tegernsee von 1973 bis 1997.	Hiller, Wolfgang				Ornithologischer Anzeiger	36	2-3		143-158	September 1997	1997				German	0	0	At Lake Tegernsee, yearly numbers per counting period changed from 6900 individuals in 1973/74 to 11500 in 1990/91 and 6300 in 1996/97. The most important local reason for the varying numbers is the change in water quality. The decrease in numbers of the more adapted species (Mute Swan, Mallard, Coot) is due to the improvement of the sewage situation, together with the nutrient deposition and a "no feeding" campaign. However, mudfauna feeders (Tufted Duck, Pochard, Goldeneye) have increased since a stronger reproduction of Zebra Mussel Dreissena polymorpha at Lake Tegernsee in 1980. A considerable increase is to be noted with species catching fish (Great Crested Grebe, Red-necked Grebe, Black-necked Grebe, Goosander, Cormorant). There are enough small fish suitable for food and because of a higher visibility in the water they are easy to reach. The monthly distribution of the individuals shows that Lake Tegernsee is a stretch of water used by waterfowl especially for resting and spending the winter. The take rarely freezes and if it does so with delay and only for a short time. Setting up six quiet zones since 1985 seems to have had an extremely positive effect to the Great Crested Grebe as a breeding bird. Because of various leisure activities in summer, the number of other breeding waterfowl is relatively small.	Hiller, Wolfgang; Hirschbergstrasse 8, D-83703 Gmund, Germany, Germany.

Pacific Conservation Biology	3	3		221-234	September 1997	1997				English	0	4	A major wildfire burned 228 400 ha of forest in East Gippsland (Victoria, Australia) in February and March 1983, including Cooaggalah forest block where flora and fauna studies had just commenced. Bird abundance was assessed on 13 sites immediately before and after the fire, and annually for three years to 1986. The sites represented a range of habitats including rainforest, heaths and eucalypt forest, all of which burned. Total bird abundance was reduced to 60% of initial levels by the fire, but recovered within three years. These changes differed significantly between habitats. Initial decreases were greatest and subsequent recovery least in heaths where most above-ground vegetation had been killed. Post-fire increases were greatest in rainforest and on granite ridges, and in each case bird abundance rose to levels substantially higher than before fire. Some changes may have involved recovery from drought as well as fire. Changes over time were highly significant for many groups of birds (e.g., honeyeaters), while others showed little change (e.g., bark-foragers and insectivores that inhabit dense understorey or damp ground below shrubs). Honeyeaters and seed-eaters suffered the greatest initial declines, and some species in these groups were slow to recover (e.g., New Holland and Crescent Honeyeaters and Beautiful Firetail). Some species that feed from open ground increased quickly to levels greater than before fire (Flame and Scarlet Robins, Buff-rumped Thornbill and Superb Fairy-wren), but all except the latter then declined as shrubs regenerated. The main loss of birds immediately after the fire was of highly mobile species, and the composition of the remaining bird fauna appeared to depend on resource availability rather than the capacity of species to survive the fire front. Initial responses of species to fire were poor predictors of their responses after three years.

Twedt, Daniel J.; Portwood, Jeff				Wildlife Society Bulletin	25	3		647-652	Fall 1997	1997				English	0	6	Throughout the southeastern United States, forested wetlands that were drained and cleared for agriculture are being reforested through individual, corporate, and government efforts (Haynes et al. 1988, Haynes et al. 1995). Within the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, reforestation efforts on former bottomland hardwood sites (Savage et al. 1989, Newling 1990) are bolstered by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers mitigation, acquisition of public lands for wildlife management, and government incentives to private landowners, such as the Wetland Reserve Program. Reforestation provides myriad environmental benefits including flood control, decreased soil erosion, improved air and water quality, and reduced pesticide use. Wildlife managers and foresters, however, have historically sought to increase the area of bottomland hardwood forest because of its value as wildlife habitat and for timber production. More often than not, oaks (Quercus spp.) are considered the species of choice for reforestation. Oaks are important to game species such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). In terms of providing forage for waterfowl, the value of bottomland hardwood forests is directly related to the proportion and species composition of oaks within the forest (Allen 1987). Valuable lumber is also derived from harvested oaks. Therefore, to maximize profits at harvest, a high proportion of mature oaks in the forest is generally desirable. The benefit of oak forests to Neotropical migratory birds, however, is poorly understood (Martin 1989). But for many insectivorous, forest-breeding birds, the 3-dimensional structure of a forest may be as or more critical than the tree species present. Thus, reforestation to promote rapid development of 3-dimensional forest structure is critical to providing habitat for forest-breeding, Neotropical migratory birds.

Kozma, Jeffrey M.; Mathews, Nancy E.				Wilson Bulletin	109	3		424-436	September 1997	1997				English	0	8	We examined the significance of arroyo-riparian habitat to birds in the Chihuahuan Desert of south-central New Mexico. Nests (N = 620) of 27 species were monitored during 1993-1995. Twenty-three species nested in arroyos and 20 species nested in uplands. Northern Mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos), Rock Wrens (Salpinctes obsoletus), and Verdins (Auriparus flaviceps) nested most frequently in arroyos. Black-throated Sparrows (Amphispiza bilineata), Northern Mockingbirds, and Scott's Orioles (Icterus parisorum) nested most frequently in uplands. Nest density in arroyos was more than twice that of uplands (0.64 nests/ha versus 0.27 nests/ha). Nest success and predation rates did not differ between arroyos and uplands for Black-throated Sparrows, Northern Mockingbirds, and Crissal Thrashers (Toxostoma crissale). Nest predation was the primary cause of mortality to eggs and nestlings in both habitats. Torrey yucca (Yucca torreyi), javelina bush (Condalia warnockii), and little-leaf sumac (Rhus microphylla) were the most frequently used nest substrates, even though these shrubs were among the lowest in density. Maintaining this habitat and protecting sparse shrub species used as nest substrates may have long term importance in managing Chihuahuan Desert bird communities.

Thiollay, Jean-Marc				Biodiversity and Conservation	6	8		1155-1173	August 1997	1997				English	3	65	The composition and structure of bird communities, and the damage to forest structure were surveyed in northern French Guiana (northeastern Amazonia) one year and ten years after selective logging and compared with the situation in a similar undisturbed primary forest. A point-count method was used in which 937 0.25 ha sample plots were censused for 20 minutes each, and their vegetation structure was measured. On average, 38% of the forest undergrowth was destroyed, then invaded by dense regrowth, and up to 63% of the canopy was substantially opened as a result of selective logging. Hunting pressure also increased due to access roads opened for logging. Among the 256 species recorded, overall bird species richness and abundance were depressed by 27-34% in the logged areas compared to primary forest. The most vulnerable guilds, which decreased by 37-98% in abundance, were mature forest understorey species, especially terrestrial ones and mixed flocks of insectivores. Hummingbirds, small gaps, vine tangles and canopy species did not decrease, nor increase significantly after logging. Only species naturally associated with dense second growth, forest edges and large gaps actually increased. Habitat specialization was the major determinant of vulnerability to logging, and, to a lesser degree, size (large) and diet (insectivorous), but foraging behaviour and rarity had little effect. Bird sensitivity to changes in logged forest structure may involve physiological intolerance, reduced food categories, increased exposure to predators, too dense understorey for their specific foraging behaviour and/or avoidance of gaps. Suggested improvements of current forest management and logging techniques for the maintenance of a higher proportion of the original biodiversity include minimizing logging damages, long rotations ( gt 50 years) between cuts, and keeping unlogged forest patches within logging concessions.

Snodgrass, Joel W.				Journal of Applied Ecology	34	4		1043-1056	August 1997	1997				English	3	28	1. Beavers create habitat diversity across catchment landscapes by impounding small streams. This increased habitat diversity leads to increased species richness of plants and animals in small streams. As managers work to balance conflicting management goals (e.g. protection of timber and human structures versus maintenance of biological diversity) the influence of beaver population management practices on habitat availability needs to be assessed. Two questions of initial concern are: (i) how do different levels of management influence the availability of beaver created habitats and (ii) do relationships developed in one region apply to other regions? 2. To address these questions, historical aerial photography was used to determine the extent and rate of impoundment of streams by beavers Castor canadensis over a 77 000 ha south-eastern North American landscape during a 40-year period of beaver population recovery. Between 1950 and 1983, beaver populations were protected from trapping and hunting. From 1983 to the present, beaver numbers were reduced by fatal trapping, to protect roads, railroads and timber. Trapped beavers were assigned to specific colonies associated with beaver-created patches in the landscape, and growth rates and size after management of individual patches receiving different levels of management were compared. Results from this study were also compared with previous studies conducted in Minnesota, USA. 3. Growth rate, patch size following management and the composition of habitat types within patches were not related to management activity, suggesting that the levels of management used in this study did not influence the temporal dynamics of beaver-created patches. The extent and rate of beaver impoundment on the southeastern Upper Coastal Plain of North America was less than that reported from central North American landscapes over comparable periods. 4.

Conner, Richard N.; Dickson, James G.				Texas Journal of Science	49	3	(Supplement)	123-138	August 1997	1997				English	1	8	Bird communities of the West Gulf Coastal Plain are strongly influenced by the stage of forest succession, species composition of understory and overstory vegetation, and forest structure. Alteration of plant communities through forest management and natural disturbances typically does not eliminate birds as a faunal group from the area affected, but will replace some species with others and cause changes in the abundance and species composition of bird communities. Upland, fire disclimax pine savannah communities composed of primarily longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) provide mature pines for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) while simultaneously providing grassland ground cover for Bachman's Sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) and Henslow's Sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii). On the mesic mid-slopes where there is an increasing presence of loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus echinata) pine and hardwood species, Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and White-eyed Vireos (Vireo griseus) find habitat in the understory and midstory vegetation, whereas canopy hardwoods and pines provide habitat for Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) and Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra). Transition into the wet bottomland hardwood forests increases the abundance of bird species associated with deciduous wetlands such as Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) and Swainson's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii), whereas species associated with conifers and grassland savannahs are lost. Anthropogenic or natural disturbances that set back mature stages of forest succession can dramatically alter the species composition of bird communities.

Donald, Paul F.; Haycock, David; Fuller, Robert J.				Bird Study	44	2		206-219	July 1997	1997				English	0	7	This paper presents the results of a study of wintering bird communities across a wide range of coniferous, broadleaved and mixed forest stands in the Forest of Dean, western England. Bird communities of broadleaved and coniferous woodland differed with respect to their species composition. The mean number of individual birds recorded increased linearly with woodland age and was not influenced by woodland type, stand size or the presence of grazing. Woodland age and type and the presence or absence of grazing all significantly influenced bird species richness and the proportions of the bird community made up by granivores, insectivores and omnivores. Broadleaved stands held more species than coniferous stands. Ungrazed stands held significantly more species, particularly seed-eating species, than grazed stands and this effect was independent of woodland type. Ordination was used to relate variation in tree species composition and stand structure to bird community composition. A larger number of species was associated with broadleaved stands and stands with abundant undergrowth than was associated with coniferous stands or stands with little undergrowth. Woodland age had less effect on bird community composition than the extent Of undergrowth and the conifer to broadleaf ratio. The results of this work have relevance to the enhancement of winter bird communities in commercial forests.

Hagan, John M.; McKinley, Peter S.; Meehan, Amy L.; Grove, Stacie L.				Journal of Wildlife Management	61	3		718-735	July 1997	1997				English	2	24	We studied abundance and diversity of landbirds in all successional stages of habitat in an industrial forest landscape in northern Maine. Of 9 broad habitat categories, clearcuts and mature hardwood forests had the lowest avian diversity, but these 2 habitats each contained many individual species that showed their maximum abundance in those habitats. Greatest avian diversity was found in 2 young forest types (6-20 yr following harvesting). Young, even-aged regeneration had the greatest abundance of individual birds per unit area, whereas mature hardwood had the lowest total abundance. Ten of 37 Neotropical migrant species had their highest abundance in the 2 youngest stages of forest (clearcuts and regeneration) whereas 13 of 37 species had their highest abundance in the 3 mature forest types. Short-distance migrants had highest abundances in early-successional habitats, and mature softwood stands contained the greatest number of resident species. The presence or absence at a point count station of 10 late-successional species (of 37) and 13 early-successional species (of 35) was related to the amount of similar habitat within 1 km of the point count center (homogeneous landscapes). Few species showed highest abundances in heterogeneous landscapes. Spatially consolidating harvesting might enhance both early- and late-successional species simultaneously. Based on species-habitat associations identified in this study, estimated population trends in a 1,270 km-2 section of our study area did not correlate well with Breeding Bird Survey results for the state of Maine (1981-1992). This discrepancy probably resulted because few Breeding Bird survey routes occur in the industrial forest of northern Maine, and because of different trends in habitat abundances inside and outside of the study area. This result indicates there might be important subregional differences in landbird population trends.	Hagan, John M.; Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences, P.O.

Kruger, Sonja C.; Lawes, Michael J.				South African Journal of Zoology	32	3		82-91	July 1997	1997				English	1	10	Bird species diversity and guild composition between the edge (5-10 m from the margin) of primary forest abutting grassland and the deep interior (> 500 m from the margin) in the Ongoye Forest Reserve were compared. Edge and interior sites were chosen that were homogeneous with respect to habitat physiognomy i.e. influences of habitat structure and complexity were insignificant. There were no statistical differences in bird species diversity between the forest edge and interior. However, there was significantly greater species turnover at the edge. The difference in bird species composition between the forest edge and interior was due to various edge-effects: removal of dead wood for firewood, soil compaction by cattle, and generally greater levels of disturbance. We question the wisdom of the generally applied edge-effect principle in the conservation of forest biodiversity. We suggest that the principle be applied only once there has been critical appraisal of the extent, nature, and effect of an edge and a clear conservation objective with regard to forest birds.

Fuller, R.J.; Trevelyan, R.J.; Hudson, R.W.				Ecography	20	3		295-307	June 1997	1997				English	0	25	The aim of this paper was to assess which components of landscape structure in lowland English farmland could best predict patterns in bird community composition, total bird density and densities of 12 bird species. As far as possible, predictors were sought that were consistent in their effects over a 20 yr period. The data were derived from mapping censuses in 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982 and 1986 with yearly sample sizes ranging from 41 to 51 plots, of minimum size 50 ha. Landscape composition was quantified in terms of 10 landscape variables representing broad structural (e.g. density of woodland) and crop attributes (e.g. proportion of area under cereals) plus altitude. Gradients in bird community composition were defined as plot scores on axis 1 of a detrended correspondence analysis (AXIS1). This gradient consistently represented a gradient from plots rich in woodland bird species to ones rich in field-feeding and wetland species. Multiple regression was used to build models containing 2-, 3- and 4-variables. Two approaches were used to combine data from the six years and models based on the single best subset in each year were found to be most consistent with respect to predictor selection. Predictors were tested by building models based on each combination of five years and assessing how well the predictors explained variation in the bird variables for the sixth, independent year. The predictors were relatively successful in explaining variations in densities of wren, robin, willow warbler, blue tit, great tit and chaffinch but especially AXIS1 which was explained in terms of woodland density, field size and attitude. The predictors were unsuccessful in explaining total bird density, song thrush density and whitethroat density.

McShea, W.J.; Rappole, J.H.				Journal of Field Ornithology	68	3		367-375	Summer 1997	1997				English	0	21	Song rate in birds is known to be influenced by the social status and nutritional state of the male. However, studies examining the impact of management practices on the conservation of migratory species often use song rate techniques to census populations. We examined song rates in three species of forest birds in northwestern Virginia, and found that Wood Thrushes and Ovenbirds sang more often in blocks of continuous forest, while Northern Cardinals sang more often in forest patches. Individuals gt 50 m from the observer sang more often than closer birds, and individuals in higher density populations sang more often than individuals at low density sites. The spatial variability in song rate was not severe enough to significantly change species-detection rates for 5-min song counts, but did significantly affect our population density estimates for those species. A key assumption of song count censuses, that all individuals of a species sing at comparable rates and thus have an equal probability of being detected, regardless of habitat structure, may not be valid.

Franzreb, Kathleen E.				Journal of Field Ornithology	68	3		458-470	Summer 1997	1997				English	2	10	By late 1985, the population of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, had declined to a low of four individuals. Because of extensive timber harvesting prior to the 1950s, the older live pine trees that Red-cockaded Woodpeckers require for cavity construction were limited. We monitored the response of the population to intensive habitat enhancement that included construction of artificial cavities, control of cavity competitors, and removal of the hardwood mid-story to improve nesting habitat quality. Translocations of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers from on-site and donor populations were undertaken to enhance the number of breeding pairs, the overall population size, and to minimize potential adverse genetic consequences of a small population size. From 1986-1995, we carried out 54 translocations, installed 305 artificial cavities, and removed 2304 southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) (a cavity competitor). Concomitant intensive population monitoring revealed that the number of breeding pairs of woodpeckers increased from 1 to 19 and the overall population size grew from 4 to 99 individuals, reflecting the highly focused habitat restoration effort. Intensive management has been successful in rehabilitating this critically small population of endangered birds.

Hakkarainen, Harri; Korpimaki, Erkki; Koivunen, Vesa; Kurki, Sami				Journal of Raptor Research	31	2		125-128	June 1997	1997				English	0	30	Modern forestry during the last decades has strongly increased fragmentation of forest habitats. This may result in harmful effects on raptor species which are strictly dependent on boreal forests, such as the vote-eating Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus). The long-term data from Finland shows that in extensive forest areas, fledgling production of Boreal Owls is higher on intensively clear-cut territories than on less clear-cut territories. Breeding frequency, clutch size and laying date, however, have not been shown to be related to the proportion of clear-cut areas within a territory. Snap-trapping data suggests that large clear-cut areas sustain more Microtus voles than small clear-cut areas. The increased number of saplings and clear-cut areas during the last two or three decades has created new suitable grass habitats for Microtus voles, and simultaneously new hunting habitats for Boreal Owls. There is some experimental evidence that the presence of the Ural Owl (Strix uralensis) decreases the breeding density of Boreal Owls within 2 km of Ural Owl nests. Therefore, forest fragmentation does not seem to harm Boreal Owls at the present day scale, but a lack of nest holes has to be compensated for by setting nest boxes far ( gt 2 km) from medium-sized and large raptors that can prey upon the Boreal Owl. In the long-term, however, establishment of snags and patches of mature forests with large trees, dense enough to satisfy the ecology of the hole-nesting Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), will provide a natural way to establish new nesting cavities for Boreal Owls.

Duncan, James R.				Journal of Raptor Research	31	2		160-166	June 1997	1997				English	2	25	Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa nebulosa) populations in North America have likely been stable over the past 10-100+ yr. Local populations fluctuate in response to food supply and/or nest-site availability. Breeding Great Gray Owls require preexisting nest structures in forest stands that are adjacent to open foraging habitat, preferably with hunting perches. Current forestry practices have the potential to affect about 75% of the Great Gray Owls' breeding range in North America. Intensive timber management typically removes large diameter and deformed nest trees, leaning trees used by juveniles for roosting before they can fly and stands with dense canopy closure used by juveniles and adults for cover and protection. Modified forest management can, however, create new foraging habitat by opening up large, dense forest stands. Specific recommended guidelines include restriction of harvest unit size ( ltoreq 5-10 ha), but within a mosaic of multi-sized units, retention of forest stands within 300 m of known or potential nest trees/sites, provision of hunting perches in cut-over areas, ensuring irregularly shaped harvest units and maintenance of forested travel corridors between cut-over areas. Because Great Gray Owls can breed on home ranges up to 800 km apart in successive years, integration of local management regimes at a landscape scale is recommended. Ideally, spatio-temporal patterns of natural disturbance (e.g., fire) should be emulated in a management plan to sustain the region's natural biological diversity, including Great Gray Owls when appropriate.

Wetlands	17	2		216-227	June 1997	1997				English	0	9	Despite having an arid climate, the Columbia River Basin of eastern Washington is one of the most important areas for breeding, migrating, and wintering wetland birds in the Pacific Northwest. Extensive farmland irrigation near the O'Sullivan Reservoir and other areas has raised water tables, resulting in closed canopies of emergent vegetation in what are now permanent, shallow wetlands. During 1994-95, we found that avian communities on vegetation-filled wetlands excavated to create open water had greater mean densities of dabbling and diving ducks (Anatidae), shorebirds, American coots (Fulica americana), and tems (Sterna spp.) than untreated control wetlands. Densities of yellow-headed blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus) were greater on excavated wetlands, while the densities of red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), Sora (Porzana carolina), and Virginia rails (Rallus limicola) were greater on unaltered sites. Densities of marsh wrens (Cistothorus palustris) and other passerines were similar among excavated and control wetlands. Zooplankton biomass was greater on altered wetlands and generally greater in older excavations. We suggest that managers may design constructed wetland basins to improve population management of diverse wetland bird species by creating an appropriate mix of wetland habitats at the landscape level.

Engstrom, R. Todd; Sanders, Felicia J.				Wilson Bulletin	109	2		203-217	June 1997	1997				English	2	24	Most Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) populations are in pine forests that have been harvested at least once and are relatively young compared to old growth stands. We quantified foraging behavior, year-round home range, and woodpecker productivity for groups within and proximal to an old-growth longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) stand from late 1992 to late 1993 in southwestern Georgia. Average year-round home range size for seven woodpecker groups in and adjacent to the old-growth stand based on minimum 95% convex polygons was 47.1 ha. Year-round home range was negatively correlated with the percentage of the home-range located within old-growth forest. In the old-growth stand the size class distribution of trees selected by woodpeckers for foraging was different than the distribution of trees available in size classes gt 30 cm dbh. As in other studies, males and females differed in foraging height and parts of the trees used. Clutch size and fledging rates of the seven study groups were also higher than reported in other studies. Red-cockaded Woodpeckers preferentially forage on large (and presumably old) trees. The small year round home range, high density, large group size, and high productivity indicate that this old-growth longleaf forest is high quality habitat. We suggest that forest management intended to provide an adequate number of replacement cavity trees and quality foraging habitat for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker should have old trees across the landscape.

Kinley, Trevor A.; Newhouse, Nancy J.				Northwest Science	71	2		75-86	May 1997	1997				English	0	9	British Columbia forestry guidelines require riparian management areas of 20 to 50 m width between small streams and cutblocks, composed of reserve zones (no timber harvest) and/or management zones (limited timber harvest). Guidelines in Kootenai National Forest, Montana, limit forest harvesting for 30 m adjacent to permanent streams. As one step in providing a basis to assess such guidelines, we compared (1) habitat structure between spruce-dominated riparian forest and pine-dominated upland forest, (2) breeding bird characteristics (density of detections, species richness, species diversity and species equitability) between riparian and upland forest, and (3) breeding bird characteristics between riparian reserve zones of various widths (averaging 70, 37, or 14 m wide). The study occurred in the Montane Spruce biogeoclimatic zone of southeastern British Columbia. In relation to upland forest, riparian forest had greater tall shrub and canopy cover, but fewer live trees. Snag density, low shrub cover, and coarse woody debris did not differ at P lt 0.05. The two habitat types did not differ in mean bird species richness per site, but riparian forest had greater species diversity and species equitability, greater density of all species combined, and greater density of three individual species. The density of all birds combined, all riparian-associated birds combined, and three of the four riparian-associated species increased with increasing reserve zone width. Species diversity and species equitability did not differ significantly among treatments. The widths of riparian management areas required under current British Columbia and Kootenai National Forest guidelines are considerably narrower than the widest category of reserves investigated in this study (70 m).

Bosakowski, Thomas				Northwest Science	71	2		87-96	May 1997	1997				English	0	2	Surveys were conducted to determine the presence, relative abundance, and habitat relationships of the breeding bird community on a private industrial forest (21,600 ha) in western Washington. A total of 284 and 299 point counts (8 min duration) were established in 1995 and 1996, respectively, along unpaved logging roads separated by a minimum distance of 240 m. The counts were performed twice, at least 10 days apart. A total of 9,491 detections of 78 species of breeding birds were detected at point count stations during the survey period with 40 species having gt 30 detections. A GIS analysis of forest habitat types was run for a 100-m radius circle centered on each survey point. Of 61 species tested by multiple regression analysis, significant positive regressions were revealed for the following habitat types: mature conifer habitat ( gt 45 yr) for 32 species, pole-sized conifer habitat (27-44 yr) for 27 species, sapling-sized conifer habitat (6-26 yr) for 38 species, recent clearcut habitat (0-5 yr) for 32 species, nonforested habitat (including open water) for 20 species, and alder-hardwood habitat (all ages) for 19 species. Overall, the GIS-habitat/multiple regression models demonstrated that all successional stages on an industrial forest were important to different groups of species within the breeding bird community. Species richness was equal or greater than observed in studies conducted on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest and suggested that industrial forests can be managed to make an important contribution to regional biodiversity of breeding birds.

Klute, David S.; Robel, Robert J.; Kemp, Kenneth E.				American Midland Naturalist	137	2		206-212	April 1997	1997				English	0	14	The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was established by the 1985 Food Security Act (Farm Bill). Unless renewed, most CRP contracts will expire in 1997 and up to 70% of CRP fields in Kansas may be converted to pasture. We compared avian use of CRP areas with that of pasture to determine if such conversion would be detrimental to grassland birds. Data on vegetative structure, avian abundance, and avian reproductive success were collected on five CRP fields and five pastures during summer 1993. Pastures had significantly greater vegetative cover and CRP fields had more bare ground. Vegetation was significantly taller in CRP fields late in the summer. Total avian abundance and that of dickcissels, grasshopper sparrows, meadowlarks, brown-headed cowbirds and upland sandpipers were greater in pastures than in CRP fields. Reproductive success and rates of nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds did not differ between the habitats, but nests were more numerous in grazed pastures. If the CRP is not reauthorized in the 1995 Farm Bill and most of the Kansas land currently enrolled in CRP is converted to pasture, the conversion probably will not be detrimental to grassland bird populations if the land is moderately grazed.

Reijnen, Rien; Foppen, Ruud; Veenbaas, Geesje				Biodiversity and Conservation	6	4		567-581	April 1997	1997				English	2	64	In wildlife considerations in planning and managing road corridors little attention has been given to the effects of disturbance by traffic on populations of breeding birds. Recent studies, however, show evidence of strongly reduced densities of many species of woodland and open habitat in broad zones adjacent to busy roads. The density reduction is related to a reduced habitat quality, and traffic noise is probably the most critical factor. Because density can underestimate the habitat quality, the effects on breeding populations are probably larger than have been established. In consequence, species that did not show an effect on the density might still be affected by traffic noise. On the basis of this recent knowledge, methods have been developed that can be used in spatial planning procedures related to main roads, and in road management practice, and some practical points are discussed. An example of application shows that the effects are probably very important in The Netherlands with a dense network of extremely crowded main roads. For 'meadow birds', which are of international importance, the decrease in population in the West of The Netherlands may amount to 16%. Because breeding birds suffer from many other environmental influences there is also a great risk of an important cumulation of effects.

Greenberg, Russell; Bichier, Peter; Cruz Angon, Andrea; Reitsma, Robert				Conservation Biology	11	2		448-459	April 1997	1997				English	2	48	We studied the avifauna of sun and shade coffee plantations and associated mid-elevation habitats during the dry season of 1995. The three plantation types (Inga, Gliricidia, and sun) showed high faunistic similarities with each other and were both distinct and depauperate compared to matorral and forest patch habitats. Of all the coffee plantation habitats, Inga shade had the highest diversity. Species associated with wooded vegetation were more common in shade plantations, particularly in Inga. A second census showed a decline in bird numbers that was more pronounced in sun and Gliricidia than in Inga plantations. Overall, differences between the plantation types were small and all coffee plantations were less diverse than traditional coffee farms previously studied in nearby Chiapas, Mexico. The relatively low bird diversity was probably due to the low stature, low tree species diversity, and heavy pruning of the canopy. These features reflect management practices that are common throughout Latin America. The most common species of birds in all coffee plantation habitats were common second-growth or edge species; more specialized forest species were almost completely absent from plantations. Furthermore, many common matorral species were rare or absent from coffee plantations, even sun plantations with which matorral shares a similar superficial structure. Coffee plantations probably will only be important for avian diversity if a tall, taxonomically and structurally diverse canopy is maintained. We suggest this is most likely to occur on farms that are managed for a variety of products rather than those designated entirely for the production of coffee.

Hansson, Lennart				Forest Ecology and Management	91	2-3		137-143	April 1997	1997				English	0	7	Species richness is habitat-dependent but may also be affected both by the surrounding landscape and by spatial variation within habitats. Different taxa may then be affected by different external conditions. To establish the extent and variation in such influences, vascular plant and breeding bird species composition was examined in 28 remnant sites of traditionally managed oak-hazel woods in south-central Sweden and the effects of area, internal structure (amount of managed or abandoned small grasslands), surrounding landscape and distances to other sites were determined. Plant species numbers varied with internal structure while bird species numbers were primarily determined by site area. Adjoining habitats did not affect either plant or bird species numbers. Species composition of both plants and birds varied with regional situation. The different effects for plants and birds were explained by great differences in mobility and turnover during a short time period. Appraisal of total biodiversity cannot rely on examinations of single taxa such as birds because biodiversity depends on interactions between biota and ecosystem structures, and their history. Both external and internal structures have to be considered in the conservation of both traditionally managed and pristine sites within managed landscapes.

James, Frances C.; Hess, Charles A.; Kufrin, Dubravka				Ecological Applications	7	1		118-129	February 1997	1997				English	3	53	"Species-centered Environmental Analysis" (SCEA) is a procedure for diagnosing species-specific environmental factors that limit the size of a population. It attempts to identify presently recognized biotic and abiotic limiting factors. Then, through comparisons and applications of the principles of experimental design, it evaluates the relative importance of the factors and searches for new ones. The advantage of SCEA is that it frames ecological hypotheses in a context that spans population-, community-, and ecosystem-level processes while keeping the research focused on ecological factors that directly or indirectly affect the size of a focal population. In the case of the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis), which lives in mature pine forests of the southeastern United States, four types of environmental factors have been shown to limit its numbers, even on public land: (1) insufficient habitat due to hardwood midstory encroachment, (2) a shortage of suitable cavity trees, (3) loss and fragmentation of habitat, and (4) demographic isolation. As part of the research to identify other potentially limiting environmental factors in the Apalachicola National Forest of northern Florida, we studied a sample of 87 social units (each unit usually a mated pair of birds with or without helpers, but sometimes a single bird). Each unit was defending a cluster of cavity trees and a foraging territory of open longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest. We then developed regression models for predicting within-population variation in the size, density, and productivity of social units from data on habitat variation. We found that variation in the bird variables was not significantly related to the sizes or densities of pine trees in these territories. It was, however, highly significantly related to the ground cover composition and the extent of natural pine regeneration, both of which are indirect indicators of local fire history.

Forest Ecology and Management	90	2-3		141-154	February 1997	1997				English	0	9	Forest management activities potentially influence ecosystems at many spatial scales. For most forest systems, influences at the stand level have been most intensively studied and are best understood. Management impacts at the larger, landscape scale are poorly understood and many hypotheses regarding landscape-level effects remain untested. This lack of knowledge is particularly acute in bottomland hardwood forest (BLH) ecosystems. Most hypotheses regarding landscape-level impacts were derived from theories about island biogeography and metapopulations. Thus, species presence and productivity sometimes are viewed as functions of patch characteristics such as size, shape, amount of edge, degree of isolation from larger, similar habitats, time since isolation, and dispersal, immigration, and extinction rates. Recommendations for mitigating fragmentation effects often include maintenance of reserves, increasing patch size, reducing edges, and enhancing connectivity through the use of corridors. While many of these theories are intuitively sound, there are few data to demonstrate their effectiveness in landscapes dominated by managed forests, including BLH forests. We suggest that high priority be given to using adaptive management to simultaneously test hypotheses about how biotic communities function in managed, BLH landscapes. Such information would help managers understand the consequences of their activities, provide them with more flexibility, and improve their ability to protect biological diversity while also meeting society's needs for forest resources.

Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B Biological Sciences	264	1378		105-110	22 January 1997	1997				English	1	16	Mechanisms which prevent gene flow will maintain differentiation between species, and therefore contribute to biological diversity. We describe an experimental study of such mechanisms in a hybrid zone between the fire-bellied toad Bombina bombina and the yellow-bellied toad B. variegata. In this system, preference for different breeding habitats reduces the frequency of hybridization. A comparison of habitat ecology shows that the semi-permanent ponds in which B. bombina usually breeds have higher densities of aquatic predators than the temporary puddles typically used by B. variegata. We test for behavioural adaptations in tadpoles to these different levels of predation. B. bombina tadpoles are significantly less active than B. variegata, both before and after the introduction of a predator to an experimental arena; this reduces their vulnerability as many predators detect prey through movement. Behavioural differences translate into differential survival: B. variegata suffer higher predation rates in laboratory experiments with three main predator types (Triturus sp., Dytiscus larvae, Aeshna nymphs). This differential adaptation to predation will help maintain preference for alternative breeding habitats, and thus serve as a mechanism maintaining the distinctions between the two species.

Ding, Tzung-Su; Lee, Pei-Fen; Lin, Yao-Sung				Acta Zoologica Taiwanica	8	1		55-64	January 1997	1997				English	0	0	The bird communities of four high elevation plant communities were studied at Tatachia, Yushan National Park, Taiwan. The plant communities included a mature primary spruce forest and three seral stages of secondary vegetation that grow after a fire, grassland, pine woodland and mixed coniferous forest. The densities of all 30 bird species found in the four plant communities were estimated by the circular-plot method in July and August, 1990. Each community at different sites shows distinct pattern in species composition, guild structure and bird density. Most species show preference in habitat selection. The avian community parameters roughly followed the succession pattern. Total number of species and total density increase along the succession gradient. The bird community in spruce forest had the highest Shannon diversity index, followed by pine woodland, mixed coniferous forest, and grassland. Evenness indices were highest in pine woodland and grassland, and lowest in mixed coniferous forest and spruce forest. The Bray-Curtis index of similarity between two bird communities decreased as the successional difference between plant communities increased. The bird communities in pine woodland and mixed coniferous forest, intermediate successional stages, had the highest index of similarity (0.55), while the bird communities, grassland and spruce forest, the extreme ends of pyrosere, were least similar (0.25). In this study habitat selection by birds was largely a function of habitat structure and bird foraging methods.

The densities in the various habitats are amongst the highest in Europe and reflect the optimal use of favorable sites which turn out to be on limited areas. The use of meadows is limited by the height of the vegetation in the spring, the grazing pressure and the presence of passage ways and high points (hedges, trees). Fields with late crops are used but the number of fledglings is small compared with breeding success in grassland habitats. Attempted breeding in green pea fields practically always fails. So management of grassland habitats aimed at maintaining biological diversity, of which the Northern Lapwing is an important element, is necessary.

Dale, Svein; Hagen, Oyvind				Fauna Norvegica Series C Cinclus	20	2		93-103	1997	1997				English	0	3	The Ortolan Bunting has recently been declared a directly threatened species in Norway. During the breeding seasons of 1996 and 1997 surveys were undertaken to obtain a reliable national population size estimate and knowledge of current distribution and habitat choice. The largest subpopulation breeds on a 9 km2 forest-fire site in Hedmark county which burned in 1976 and contained 49-52 males in 1996 and 46-50 males in 1997. More than one hundred lowland peat bogs were searched and Ortolan Buntings were found on 19 bogs (15 in Hedmark and 4 in Akershus counties). The number of males on each bog was 1-9 (median 3) and the total number of males recorded was 65 in 1997 when the most comprehensive peat bog search was done. Only 9 (in 1996) and 7 (in 1997) males in 8 mixed farmland localities in Telemark, Akershus and Oppland counties were found, even though mixed farmland traditionally has been the typical breeding habitat of Ortolan Buntings in Norway. The number of males in the whole of Norway was thus about 120 in known localities. A detectability test suggested that this may represent a total population of up to about 150 males. In the forest-fire locality many males remained unmated and the number of breeding pairs in Norway may therefore be <100. The surveys therefore show that the current population size of Ortolan Buntings in Norway is small and the species has a limited geographical distribution, indicating that the status 'directly threatened' is warranted. The species' vulnerability is further increased by the fact that >80% of the population is concentrated in only ten localities.

Leddy, Krecia L.; Higgins, Kenneth F.; Naugle, David E.				Proceedings of the South Dakota Academy of Science	76			105-111	1997	1997				English	0	0	Nongame birds were surveyed during summer 1995 at Buffalo Ridge in southwestern Minnesota, to evaluate the importance of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands to local avifauna. Bird abundance and composition were compared among 3 habitat types (CRP grasslands, pasturelands, and croplands) using an index to breeding bird density (i.e., number of singing males/transect area), percent species composition, and total species richness. Vertical height and density of vegetation were measured early in the growing season (mid-May) and during the peak of the growing season (mid-June) to determine whether vegetative structure was related to bird use of vegetation. Conservation Reserve Program fields had higher vegetation measurements and supported higher bird densities and species richness than pasturelands and croplands. Mean bird density (birds/100 ha) in CRP grasslands was 312.5 compared to 166.7 in pasturelands and only 75.0 in croplands. Ten bird species were present in CRP grasslands compared to 8 in pasturelands and 9 in croplands. The presence of 3 native bird species (sedge wren, dickcissel, and claycolored sparrow) in CRP grasslands that were not found in pasturelands or croplands indicated that CRP grasslands were an important habitat type for maintaining avian diversity at Buffalo Ridge.

Bestandsentwicklung der Brutvogel des Wallhecken-Agrarlandes samt Dorfern und Stadten im Westen Schleswig-Holsteins 1960 bis 1995.	Busche, Gunther				Vogelwelt	118	1		11-32	1997	1997				German	0	0	Farmland with hedges covers 31,061 ha (22.1%) of the county of Dithmarschen, towns and villages cover 3878 ha and industrial sites 928 ha (Fig. 1 Tab. 1). The population sizes of breeding birds in these areas was determined using several methods. Present population sizes and trends are presented. Species accounts also include a critical analysis of the methods used. For the period 1987-1995, an annual total of 94,400 territorial pairs of 104 species were calculated to have bred in the area. This includes 52,400 pairs in human settlements (151 pairs/10 ha, 73 species, 15-19 species only after 1960) and 42,000 pairs in farmland with hedges (105 pairs/100 ha, 66 species). Population trends are given for species which occurred with more than 10 pairs/year since 1960. Declines (15 species) particularly occurred in species breeding in farmland (7 ground-nesting, 4 scrub-nesting species, 1 waterbird species). Three species declined in numbers in human settlements, three more species disappeared entirely from the area. 30-33 species (of which 4 were new to the area) increased in numbers, 13 of these occur on farmland (11 woodland/scrub-nesting, 2 ground-nesting species). An increase in the number of sewage ponds has favored 3-4 waterbird species. Increases in number were registered in human settlements for 16-19 woodland/scrub-nesting species and 6 species breeding on buildings. On the one hand, losses of farmland with hedges (about 3500 ha lost to housing, industrial and road development) have led to a reduction by about 27,000 pairs of birds, whereas on the other hand the extension of human settlements with gardens (1360 ha) has supplied breeding opportunities for 20,500-37,200 pairs. Conservation measures, especially for ground-nesting birds, are not sufficient to maintain present breeding bird numbers. The survival of highly endangered species depends on bird-friendly management of essential parts of the farmlands.	Busche, Gunther; Hochfelder Weg 49, 25746 Heide, Germany, Germany.

Younger CRP fields (1-2 years old), best described as a combination of forbs and bare ground, had the greatest diversity and relative abundance of avian species. Older CRP fields (3-5/6 years old) were a combination of grasses and deep litter cover and had the greatest avian productivity. We recommend that after 3-5 growing seasons CRP fields be manipulated to provide a variety of successional stages to maintain simultaneously high avian relative abundance, diversity, and productivity.

Forest Ecology and Management	88	1-2	(Special Issue)	199-204	1 November 1996	1996				English	3	9	Many species of forest-inhabiting deer offer strong potential as ecological indicators of forest management and diversity at broad, landscape scales. They have high potential value for land-use planning. Four main characteristics make such deer particularly suited as ecological indicators of forest management (1) Their biology is well known, especially in relation to that of most other wildlife species; (2) They have relatively large, and often, seasonally migratory home ranges, therefore requiring management of landscapes rather than isolated patches of habitat; (3) They require a habitat that is diverse in food and cover, temporally, spatially, and genetically; and (4) They are important to people for both food and aesthetic value and are not an abstract concept such as 'biodiversity.' Deer species, therefore, often provide a means of evaluating land-use alternatives in biologically meaningful, theoretically sound, and socially relevant terms. Their potential should not be overlooked in efforts aimed at forest management in an ecosystem context and the maintenance of biologically diverse wildlife communities.

Das Abflammverbot als Ruckgangsursache von Singvogeln?	Gatter, Wulf				Ornithologischer Anzeiger	35	2-3		163-171	November 1996	1996				German	0	0	Controlled fire played a role in the different forms of agriculture from prehistoric times right up to the 19th and, in some places, the 20th century. A relict form of this practice was the burning of marginal grassland, fallow land, hedges and meadows. Legal provisions document a step-by-step withdrawal from this practice. In Baden-Wurttemberg the nature protection ordinance of 1936 limited burning to between 1st October and 15th March. This was the situation until 1963, after which "unauthorized" burning was forbidden. New nature protection laws, which came into force in Baden-Wurttemberg in 1974, brought a total ban. Controlled burning cleared the ground and prevented slopes from going to bush and causing the shading and abandonment of narrow strips of land. Mechanical clearing and cutting are expensive and use up additional fossil energy, but still fail to achieve the aim of providing or retaining open habitats for thermophile insects and animals. The ban on controlled burning and the resultant loss of habitats are discussed as a cause for the decline of bird species and demonstrated by examples in the case of Woodlark, Northern Wheatear and Tree Pipit.

Beyer, Dean E., Jr; Costa, Ralph; Hooper, Robert G.; Hess, Charles A.				Journal of Wildlife Management	60	4		826-835	October 1996	1996				English	0	10	Current foraging habitat guidelines for management of the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis (RCW)) are based on the hypotheses that reproductive success, number of adults per family group, and occupancy of a cluster of cavity trees by a group are related to the amount of foraging habitat available to each group. We tested these hypotheses in a population in the Apalachicola National Forest (ANF) in Florida. Guidelines mandate providing gtoreq 6350 pine trees gtoreq 25-cm diameter at breast height (dbh) within 800 m of each cluster of cavity trees; occupied clusters we studied had 1,200-13,176 available pines. We detected no association between number of young fledged and the availability of pine trees or degree of habitat fragmentation. We found a weak association between number of young fledged and demographic isolation surrounding cavity tree clusters. No differences were detected in the amount of available foraging habitat or degree of habitat fragmentation surrounding cavity tree clusters occupied by groups of different sizes. However, unoccupied clusters had fewer occupied clusters within 2 km than did occupied clusters. We could not reject the null hypotheses that reproductive attainment and group size were the same for groups with different amounts of available foraging habitat. Our results are consistent with the majority of earlier studies. We suggest that foraging guidelines should not categorically prohibit actions designed to benefit RCW long-term when these actions reduce available foraging habitat below guideline levels in the short-term.

Landscape and Urban Planning	36	1		59-77	October 1996	1996				English	8	285	Habitat loss and isolation associated with land conversion for human activities constitute the most serious threat to the Earth's biological diversity. The study of habitat fragmentation provides an important link between the concepts and principles of landscape ecology and the practice of landscape architecture and planning. Here I review ecological literature to examine current understanding of the ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation, and briefly suggest ways in which the results of these studies may guide decision-making by landscape architects and planners. Two theoretical developments in ecology have informed studies of habitat fragmentation and have provided testable hypotheses for empirical studies: island biogeography theory and metapopulation dynamics. Ecologists have examined the influences of habitat fragment size, shape, degree of isolation, context, and habitat quality or heterogeneity on plant and animal population persistence, community composition, and ecosystem processes. Disruption of continuous habitat usually results in an increase in the length of the boundary between fragments and their surrounding habitats. Newly created edges experience shifts in microclimatic characteristics, which may significantly alter the native plant and animal communities present. The size of a habitat fragment markedly influences the ecological processes occurring therein, largely due to the changes induced by these habitat edges. In general, species richness declines as fragment area decreases. Vegetated corridors may facilitate the movement of plants and animals among habitat fragments, however, more information is needed regarding the efficacy of corridors in reducing species loss from fragmented habitats. Fragments with highly irregular, convoluted boundaries will likely have greater exchange of nutrients, materials, and organisms with adjacent habitats than will those with less convoluted boundaries.

It was demonstrated that the number of insect groups as well as the insect density increases in the unsprayed edges, by a factor of 1.4 and 3.5, respectively. At the level of the 21 insect groups studied, too, a significant increase in numbers was found for most groups. This held true for aphid predators (mainly Coccinellidae), flower visitors (mainly adult Syrphidae) and insects that form the staple diet of the bird species Motacilla flava flava. Although there was an increase in aphid abundance in most unsprayed edges, the aphids did not spread to the rest of the field, improving the compatibility of unsprayed edges with farm management.	de Snoo, G.R.; Centre of Environmental Science, Leiden University, PO Box 9518, 2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands, Netherlands.		de Snoo, geert/M-4315-2013				Zoology; Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology	0931-2048		Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Ecology; Community structure; Population dynamics; Habitat; Man made habitat; Pollution; Chemical pollution; Abiotic factors; Chemical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe	Aphidoidea [Farming and agriculture /  / Crop management effects on dispersal in cereal fields] [Distribution within habitat /  / Dispersal in cereal fields related to crop management practice] [Cultivated land habitat /  / Cereal fields; dispersal related to crop management practice] [Netherlands /  / Haarlemmermeerpolder].

Bennetts, Robert E.; White, Gary C.; Hawksworth, Frank G.; Severs, Scott E.				Ecological Applications	6	3		899-909	August 1996	1996				English	2	25	Dwarf mistletoes (Arceuthobium spp.) are parasitic plants that are widely distributed in coniferous forests of the northern hemisphere. Because the effects of dwarf mistletoes on their host trees include stunted growth, reduced seed production, and death, these mistletoes may have a substantial influence on forest structure. Studies of the effects of dwarf mistletoe on forest communities have focused primarily on their influence on timber production. We studied the effects of southwestern ponderosa pine dwarf mistletoe (A. vaginatum) on the abundance and diversity of bird communities in central Colorado. Four stands, which ranged in level of mistletoe infestation from none to heavy, were selected at each of two locations. Each stand was surveyed approximately once per week during the avian breeding seasons of 1989 and 1990 by spot mapping. The number of bird registrations and bird species richness were positively correlated with the level of dwarf mistletoe, and this pattern was consistent among 1-4 of 28 avian species. No species had a significant negative correlation with the level of dwarf mistletoe. The relative abundance of bird species (i.e., evenness) did not differ among stands. The number of cavity-nesting birds detected also was positively correlated with both dwarf-mistletoe levels and number of snags. The number of snaus and dwarf-mistletoe levels also were highly correlated. Most snags had been infected as live trees by dwarf mistletoe and the mistletoe probably contributed to their death. While dwarf mistletoe has traditionally been viewed as a forest pest because of reductions in timber volume, we suggest that in areas where management goals are not strictly focused on timber production, control of dwarf mistletoe may not be justified, practical, or even desirable. Our data suggest that dwarf mistietoes may have positive influence on wildlife habitat.	Bennetts, Robert E.; Florida Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, P.O.

Hawrot, Rita Y.; Niemi, Gerald J.				Auk	113	3		586-598	July 1996	1996				English	2	23	Forest bird communities were sampled along line transects in northwestern Wisconsin during June of 1985 through 1992 to determine whether edge type and patch shape affect avian abundance. Landscape structural characteristics quantified along these transects included: (1) edges that defined the habitat patches they separated, (2) fractals to quantify patch shapes, and (3) areal extent of different patches. Three multiple-regression models were constructed for 10 bird species and the mean number of individuals and species using the following sets of independent variables: (1) edge variables and fractals, (2) area variables, and (3) the first six components from a principal components analysis based on all independent variables. Multiple-regression analysis indicated that edge variables and fractal dimension explained the most variation in abundance for Black-capped Chickadees (Parus atricapillus), Red-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta canadensis), Hermit Thrushes (Catharus guttatus), and American Robins (Turdus migratorius). In contrast, area variables explained the most variation in abundance for Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus), Chestnut-sided Warblers (Dendroica pennsylvanica), and Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus). Abundances of Yellow-bellied Flycatchers (Empidonax flaviventris), Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas), and White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) were equally correlated with both edge and area variables. Results of our study show that, for selected species, forest management strategies must be developed that consider not only stand characteristics, but also the edges created between these stands.

The data provided by the nature management organizations were used to calculate the numbers in grassland reserves. Two scenarios were used to process this material: 'Scrooge' and 'Big Spender'. In the former scenario the information was adjusted for the effects of insufficient representativeness, while in the latter the effect of counts failing short of the actual number of birds were taken into account. This has resulted in minimum and maximum population estimates, from which a mean value was derived. On the basis of these calculations, breeding populations in cultivated areas in Friesland in 1991 were estimated as follows: Oystercatcher 41 000, Lapwing 46 000, Black-tailed Godwit 30 000, Redshank 12 000, Common Snipe 1050, Ruff 200 (Tab. 1). The following estimates were made of the above species breeding outside cultivated areas: approx. 7000 Oystercatchers (tidal marshes, dunes, sand flats) and approx. 900 Redshanks (tidal marshes). Comparison with estimates show a distinct increase for the Oystercatcher population, a fairly stable situation for Lapwing and Redshank, a strong decline in the late seventies followed by stabilization in the eighties of the Black-tailed Godwit population, while Common Snipe and Ruff populations show a continued decline (Tab. 2).

Conservation Biology	10	3		741-749	June 1996	1996				English	0	10	Two assumptions underlie the current conservation focus worldwide. The first is that democratic governments can restrict human resource use within protected areas, and the second is that human land use for subsistence leads to degradation and is incompatible with the maintenance of high levels of biological diversity. An examination of official policy documents over the past century indicates that Gaddi herders of Himachal Pradesh, northwestern Indian Himalaya, have used political influence to circumvent bureaucratic Policies of exclusion and that there is an absence of scientific evidence to support the notion that Gaddi grazing leads to land degradation. Although grazing intensity has profoundly shaped the structure and composition of the Siwalik forests (the Gaddi winter grazing grounds), as demonstrated by transect-based data presented here, deviations from a supposed "climax" community need not constitute degradation. A growing rather than declining cattle population attests to the regenerative capacities of these forests. Within the alpine meadows grazed by the Gaddi in summer, mean plant species richness increased along transects originating at herder camps and extending 250 m north of herder camp sites. Intense grazing pressure or heavy manuring by livestock bedded at night are likely to be responsible for the observed low species diversity adjacent to the campsite, but the effect is insignificant at the level of the overall landscape. Interviews with herders also suggest the presence of a sizable, though hunted, mammalian fauna in these high altitude meadows. Recognition of the difficulties associated with implementing restrictive policies, and the fact that human land-use practices need not lead to degradation or to a decline in biological diversity, should lead to more inclusive conservation policies within protected areas as well as an expansion of the conservation focus beyond protected-area boundaries.

Ligon, J. David; Stacey, Peter B.				Conservation Biology	10	3		840-846	June 1996	1996				English	0	8	Changes in land-use patterns that alter habitat may have a delayed negative effect on animal species occupying that habitat, and thus such effects may not be recognized for years. In Water Canyon, located in the Magdalena Mountains of southcentral New Mexico, we studied a relatively stable population of the cooperatively breeding Acorn Woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) from 1975 to 1984. These woodpeckers rely on self-constructed storage sites, or "granary trees," to hold the acorns used during the winter and spring. Most granaries were in dead trunks and limbs of the narrow-leafed cottonwood trees (Populus angustifolia). Storage sites form the primary basis for differential quality among territories, Groups of woodpeckers with large storage facilities (high-quality territories) have greater annual reproductive success and survival than do pairs or groups with poorly developed storage sites. In the summers of 1994 and 1995 we censused the original study site, which had held 21 territories. Most territories that bad contained birds a decade earlier were unoccupied. This drastic decline was correlated with the loss of nearly all large storage facilities because of the collapse of the granary trees. Most neighboring territories with lesser storage facilities also were vacant. The lack of production of new, high-quality granaries for the period 1975-1995 probably is due in part to the age structure of the cottonwood trees, which is distinctly bimodal: nearly all trees are either very young or old. There are now fewer old, partly dead trees that could provide granary sites. The scarcity of middle-aged trees reflects a period of intensive cattle grazing in Water Canyon, during which time production of young cottonwoods was suppressed.	Ligon, J.

Abundance of breeding birds was greater in thinned stands. Bird species richness was correlated with habitat patchiness and densities of hardwoods, snags, and conifers. During the breeding season, Hammond's flycatchers (Empidonax hammondii), hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus), red-breasted nuthatches (Sitta canadensis), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), warbling vireos (Vireo gilvus), and evening grosbeaks (Coccothraustes vespertinus) were more abundant in thinned than unthinned stands. Pacific-slope flycatchers (Empidonax difficilis) were more abundant in unthinned stands. Golden-crowned kinglets (Regulus satrapa), gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis), and black-throated gray warblers (Dendroica nigrescens) were more abundant in unthinned than thinned stands, but these patterns were inconsistent between seasons, regions, or years. Stand-scale habitat features were associated with the abundance of 18 bird species.	Hagar, Joan C.; Department of Forest Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330, USA, USA.

Landscape and Urban Planning	34	3-4	(Special Issue)	301-313	May 1996	1996				English	0	6	Dune areas, including salt marshes, comprise only 1% of the land area of The Netherlands. Yet almost 80% of the 180 bird species that breed in The Netherlands, are known to breed or to have bred in dunes, which also represent valuable habitat for migratory and wintering birds. Being aware of the high natural value of the dunes and of the expected impact of a variety of threatening activities, nature conservation studies were set up by concerned volunteers and universities. Breeding birds played an important role from the beginning. It certainly contributed to the rather high nature protection status that most dunes areas currently enjoy. Furthermore these old studies provide a picture of the avifaunal value of these areas in the more pristine days. During the last decades intensive long-term monitoring of breeding bird populations has become more and more important in the Dutch dunes. In 1958 the first inventory of dune breeding birds in relation to management issues started. Its aim was to monitor the changes in species composition and numbers after the artificial infiltration of river water for drinking water production. Since then many projects of the same kind evolved in different dune areas, almost exclusively organised by volunteer bird watchers, yielding a data set which offers promising analytical possibilities. This article provides an overview of breeding bird research projects in dune habitats in relation to important actual management issues. The following issues will be dealt with: the impact of drinking water production; the impact of tall grass dominance and the ongoing growth of shrubs; the impact of the reappearance of the red fox Vulpes vulpes. The review will show that much insight has been gathered over the years concerning breeding birds and dune management but that many gaps in our knowledge still exist.

Leach, G.J.				Pacific Conservation Biology	2	3		232-243	May 1996	1996				English	0	2	Long-term monitoring of bird species provides information on base-line populations and population trends required to ensure that habitat management is effective for their conservation. Two surveys in both spring and autumn over 12 years monitored populations at fixed points in roadside softwood scrub remnants plus adjoining farmland (softwood/farmland) and in eucalypt open forest in southeast Queensland. The main aims were to determine the status of species in each habitat, especially whether the status of any species was changing, and to assess the usefulness of the monitoring procedure. In all, 92 species were observed; 79 in the softwood/farmland and 74 in the eucalypt forest. From 49 to 56 species were observed each year in softwood/farmland and 34 to 46 in eucalypt forest. Annual species turnover in softwood/farmland was about half that in eucalypt forest: 39% of all species were observed every year in the former habitat, but only 19% in the latter. The Torresian Crow was most often observed in softwood/farmland and the Noisy Miner in eucalypt forest. The Torresian Crow was the only species to be among the five most observed in each habitat. Among other common species, 95% or more observations of Bar-shouldered Doves, Superb Fairy-wrens, Yellow Thornbills and Silvereyes were in softwood/farmland, whereas for Weebills, White-throated Gerygones, Buff-rumped Thornbills, White-throated Treecreepers and White-throated Honeyeaters at least 95% of observations were in eucalypt forest, confirming their strong habitat specificities. The number of birds observed increased linearly for eight species in softwood/farmland and six species in eucalypt forest, and decreased for five and four species, respectively, over the 12 years. The most significant trends were for the Crested Pigeon (increase) and Willie Wagtail (decrease) in softwood/farmland, while Peaceful Dove and Rufous Whistler decreased in both habitats.

Spellerberg, Ian F.; Sawyer, John W.D.				Biodiversity and Conservation	5	4		447-459	April 1996	1996				English	2	14	The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity has not only focused attention on the concept of biodiversity it has also set expectations that the signatory nations will establish objectives. It is suggested here that the use of biodiversity standards could have a useful role in quantifying these objectives. The use of biodiversity standards is explored in connection with the levels of biodiversity in plantation forests. Forest plantations have been used for the basis of this investigation because such plantations could be used as large-scale experiments in which the use of standards, and the ecological monitoring of these standards, could be researched. The impact of intensive forestry practices on wildlife has often been the cause of concern and indeed controversy. Recently there has been a move towards the development of multipurpose forest plantations where management for recreation and wildlife takes place alongside management for timber. Some forest authorities are actively looking at ways of restoring levels of biodiversity in plantation forests. We suggest that if levels of biodiversity are to be restored, then forest managers must have something to aim for; that is, there must be a standard. The adoption of standards could provide a means whereby forest managers can meet biodiversity objectives. Standards may also enable managers to determine the effectiveness of those management practices which are intended to increase levels of biodiversity. We suggest a conceptual plan which combines a monitoring procedure with biodiversity objectives.

Woodland and edge species were analysed separately. 2. Numbers of woodland species showed a strong relationship with woodland area which explained c. 70% of the variation in breeding species numbers. Several other features of the woods and of the surrounding landscape also had small additional influences on species numbers. 3. Numbers of edge species showed a poor relationship with woodland area, but length of perimeter explained 30-40% of the variation in species numbers. The number of structural features within a wood and isolation from other woodland also had small additional positive influences on edge species numbers. 4. Small woods held more edge species than equivalent areas of large woods, but tended to hold fewer woodland species than equivalent areas of large woods.

Patterson, Matthew P.; Best, L.B.				American Midland Naturalist	135	1		153-167	January 1996	1996				English	1	48	Bird use of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and row-crop fields was studied in central Iowa from May through July 1991-1993. Thirty-three bird species were recorded in CRP fields and 34 in row-crop fields. The most abundant species in both habitats was the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), accounting for 35% of all birds in CRP and 24% in row-crop fields. The dickcissel (Spiza americana), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), common yellowthroat (Geothypis trichas), brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) were the next most abundant species in CRP plots. The horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) and brownheaded cowbird were the next most abundant species in row-crop fields. Nests of 16 bird species were found in CRP fields, with red-winged blackbirds accounting for 48% of all nests found. The vesper sparrow and horned lark were the only species nesting in row-crop fields. The major cause of nest loss for all species was predation, accounting for 52% of all nest loss in CRP fields and 65% in row-crop fields. Mammals accounted for 89, 88 and 85% of the predation on grasshopper sparrow, red-winged blackbird and dickcissel nests, respectively. The Conservation Reserve Program has likely contributed to an increase in the abundance of many bird species in central Iowa, inasmuch as the row-crop habitat that it replaced has lower bird abundance and supports fewer nesting species. The vegetation structure and composition of CRP fields in central Iowa are diverse, resulting in differences in the bird species communities using these fields. The effects of several land-management practices are discussed relative to bird species composition and nesting success.

Voslamber, Berend				Levende Natuur	97	1		4-10	januari 1996	1996				Dutch	1	2	In the Oostvaardersplassen nature reserve a study was carried out in an experimental area, called the Waterlanden, in order to find relations between visits by fish eating birds and water level management and ditch profile. Special attention was paid to the development of the vegetation under different waterlevel management conditions and the influence of the different vegetations on the fish eating bird species in the area. The area was grazed by cattle and horses (between 0.9 and 1.7 animals per ha). A more or less natural water level management results in an almost open water body where wading birds like spoonbills and grey heron were feeding most. The openness of the area is only possible when the number of grazers is high enough. In the parts of the experimental area with a high water level during summer the vegetation was much less intensively grazed and particularly reed could be found in a high density. These areas were much less visited by spoonbills, but here diving birds like Little and Great crested grebe could be found. These species not only were searching for food in the area but also bred in or along the high reed vegetation. A lot of other breeding bird species preferred the areas with high summer water level, especially ducks, rails and passerines. In the area with low water level in summer waders were breeding.

Saari, Lennart; Mikusinski, Grzegorz				Ornis Fennica	73	4		168-178	1996	1996				English	0	13	The results of the monitoring of woodpecker abundance on the island of Aasla (Finnish Baltic coast) during 1979-1995 are presented and analysed. Population fluctuations on Aasla were similar to those in mainland Finland in the case of the Grey-headed Woodpecker Picus canus and the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius. Breeding abundance of Black Woodpeckers was negatively correlated with snow depth and positively correlated with temperature in February. Also, breeding densities of Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major and Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor correlated positively with mean January and February temperatures. We suggest that several mild winters in the second part of the study period (1988-1995), are the primary reasons for the continuously high population densities of Grey-headed and Black Woodpeckers. We did not find any evidence indicating competition between Grey-headed and Black Woodpeckers. We stress the need for creating foraging substrates (e.g. standing dead wood) as food sources for woodpecker species in boreal forests under severe winter conditions.

Biological Journal of the Linnean Society	56		(Supplement A)	11-23	December 1995	1995				English	0	31	The concept of ecosystem restoration is gaining momentum in western Europe. This is necessary because in most managed nature reserves one or more of the following processes, which are analogous to those that have led to the dramatic loss of biological diversity in Europe, are still operating: continuing nutrient output, continuing high level of disturbance and fixing the system in some successional stage. This is partly because most management activities have been derived from, or copy, former agricultural practices. The study of natural ecosystems has revealed the key role large herbivores have in maintaining structural diversity in the vegetation and so biological diversity. Because of this they have been used as tools in achieving a variety of conservation goals. Here, various effects large herbivores can have on plant species composition, structural diversity of the vegetation and fauna are briefly reviewed. Attention is given to pasture-woodlands in southern Europe, which often have a relatively high biological diversity and share some key features with natural ecosystems: very low nutrient input, extensive grazing with large herbivores and the presence of natural tree cover. In a number of European countries attempts are being made to restore normal functioning multi-(herbivore) species ecosystems.

Stevens, Jan; Louette, Michel; Bijnens, Luc; Herremans, Marc				Bird Conservation International	5	4		463-480	December 1995	1995				English	0	0	Bird species diversity is investigated in different habitat types on Ngazidja (Grand Comoro), Comoro Islands. Total bird diversity does not differ significantly among different forest types, but the proportion of endemic species, endemic subspecies and non-endemic species does. Both intact mature forests and pioneer forests on the slopes of Mount Karthala are important for the preservation of bird endemism. The forests on La Grille are poor in endemic species, but their bird species diversity is high thanks to non-endemics. Planting of Eucalyptus is useless for endemic birds. Humblotia flavirostris, Turdus bewsheri and Nesillas brevicaudata avoid logged forests, but Alectroenas sganzini is numerous in them. Foudia eminentissima is common in forests with bananas planted in the undergrowth.	Stevens, Jan; Royal Museum for Central-Africa, B-3080, Tervuren, Belgium, Belgium.

Folkard, Nicholas F.G.; Smith, James N.M.				Canadian Journal of Zoology	73	12		2231-2237	December 1995	1995				English	0	4	Boreal plant communities are strongly nutrient limited, and the animals of the boreal forest may therefore experience bottom-up nutrient limitation. We conducted a 5-year experimental study of the impact of aerial nitrogen fertilization on birds of the boreal forest near Kluane Lake, southwestern Yukon, to test for such bottom-up effects. Specifically, we tested if avian abundance and species richness increased after fertilization. Variable circular-plot point counts were made to estimate bird numbers and species richness each summer from 1988 to 1992. Fertilization had no effect on abundance for the first two summers, but total abundances of the seven commonest passerine bird species increased by an average of 46% over the final 3 years. Fertilization had no effect on bird species richness. Population densities and species richness were both low at Kluane compared with patterns seen in temperate forest. Yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), and Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) dominated the passerine community at Kluane. There was only moderate spatial and temporal variation in songbird numbers on control plots over the 5-year study period.

Herremans, Marc				Ecography	18	4		440-454	December 1995	1995				English	2	26	Bird diversity was assessed by point-transect-count sampling during the dry and the wet season in riverine gallery woodland and in Colophospermum mopane woodland with different levels of elephant impact. Dramatic woodland degradation did not result in a dramatic overall reduction in bird diversity, but resulted in substantial changes in bird species composition and capacity for migrant birds. Less affected, more dense woodlands functioned as dry season refuges for 'resident' Afrotropical species, but this function was lost in degraded woodlands. In contrast, secondarized habitat had a much higher capacity for long distance migrants in the wet season. Species endemic to the sub-region and subspecies with restricted ranges centred in the area were not negatively affected by woodland degradation. The cumulative interference of past and current elephant numbers with the conservation of bird diversity appears to be insignificant in northern Botswana.

Although predation of clutches has occurred in a few cases, the direct impact of predation is probably negligible. However, there might be an indirect influence through e.g. disturbance of breeding birds. To investigate this, data on nest-site and nest-height have been analysed, with emphasis on the major Nieuwkoop colony. In colonies in reedland, Purple Herons showed a reaction to the appearance of Red Foxes by breeding more dispersed and in wetter vegetations than before. In colonies in shrubs, average nest height increased (Figs. 1, 2) and higher shrub or tree species were preferred (Fig. 3). In both habitats, Purple Herons quickly and successfully adapted to the new situation, thereby avoiding high predation risk. As the Dutch breeding population did not decrease after settlement of Red Foxes in colonies and as the significance of the most important colonies remained unaltered (Fig. 4), it is concluded that, until now, Purple Herons have not suffered directly or indirectly from this predator. The Dutch breeding population, however, remains vulnerable and future conflicts cannot be ruled out. Some suggestions for habitat management and creation of fox-free zones are presented.

Between 1990 - 1994 13 to 15 pairs of Whinchats could be recorded corresponding to a density of 1.78 to 2.05 breeding pairs per 10 hectares. Habitation is characterized by two important patterns: In fallow expanses of land 96% of the nests are found, while extensively worked grasslands meet the bird's nutritional needs. The obvious conclusion is that a mosaiclike land formation meets best the bird's requirements. The removal of some spruce woodland (planted less than 30 years ago on the moist meadow) has achieved an improved habitat such that Whinchats are now successfully installing themselves in and around the cleared area.

Bird Study	42	3		190-204	November 1995	1995				English	0	6	This paper presents the results of a survey of breeding Corn Buntings in Britain in 1993. Numbers of Corn Buntings and land-use types and field boundaries present were recorded by volunteers from over 1300 tetrads selected across the range of the species in Britain. The British breeding population was estimated at around 20 000 territories, Bootstrapped 95% confidence limits differed from the calculated estimates by approximately 20%. Population sizes in different regions of Britain were positively correlated with the proportion of total farmland under tillage and cereals and with the total areas of tillage and cereals, but not with the proportion of tillage made up by cereals nor with the overall area of farmland. Densities in occupied 10-km squares were lower in regions which experienced the greatest declines in distribution between 1968-72 and 1988-91. Areas abandoned by breeding birds between 1968-72 and 1988-91 were higher in altitude and held more grassland and less tilled land than areas where birds were retained. Areas which gained breeding birds during the same period contained more tilled land than areas where the species was not recorded as breeding in either Breeding Atlas. Tilled land of all types was more widespread in tetrads which held Corn Buntings than in those where no birds were recorded, Ten-kilometre squares which retained breeding Corn Buntings between the 2 Breeding Atlas periods and those which lost them both showed an increase in their average area of cereals and total tillage between 1969 and 1988, but 10-km squares which retained breeding birds held around twice the area of both land-use types in both years. The results suggest that changes in cereal area are unlikely to be the main cause of recent population declines, The possibility of a 'source-sink' metapopulation basis to the distribution of Corn Buntings in Britain, and the practical conservation implications of this possibility, are discussed.

Hutto, Richard L.				Conservation Biology	9	5		1041-1058	October 1995	1995				English	1	60	During the two breeding seasons immediately following the numerous and widespread fires of 1988, I estimated bird community composition in each of 34 burned-forest sites in western Montana and northern Wyoming. I detected an average of 45 species per site and a total of 87 species in the sites combined. A compilation of these data with bird-count data from more than 200 additional studies conducted across 15 major vegetation cover types in the northern Rocky Mountain region showed that 15 bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other major cover type occurring in the northern Rockies. One bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing dead forests created by stand-replacement fires. Bird communities in recently burned forests are different in composition from those that characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including early-successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding guilds are especially abundant therein: woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters. Standing, fire-killed trees provided nest sites for nearly two-thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites. Broken-top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for cavity-nesting species significantly more often than expected on the basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the broken-top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest conditions prior to a fire (especially the presence of snags) may be important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity-nesting birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or relatively restricted to burned forests, stand-replacement fires may be necessary for long-term maintenance of their populations.

Height and size of live trees, density of large dead trees, and volume of downed woody material increased during succession, whereas density of live trees decreased. Canopy heterogeneity had a bimodal relationship with succession: old forests had the highest, mature forests the lowest, and young forests an intermediate canopy heterogeneity. Old forests had greater bird species richness than young forests, which in turn had greater richness than mature forests. Twenty-seven, 3, and 10 bird species had their highest abundances in old, mature, and young forests, respectively. Seven bird species that nest and forage in canopy gaps and three bird species that nest and forage in large trees and snags were more abundant in young and old forests than in mature forests. Contrary to our predictions, patterns of richness and abundance for bird species that nest and forage in the canopy or in tree cavities were similar to those for bird species that nest or forage in the lower strata. Bird species preferring coniferous forests tended to be more abundant in old than in young or mature aspen-dominated forests, possibly because old aspen forests had more conifers than younger aspen forests.

Dobkin, David S.; Rich, Adam C.; Pretare, Jennifer A.; Pyle, William H.				Condor	97	3		694-707	August 1995	1995				English	1	27	We examined nest-site and nest-cavity characteristics for six species of cavity-nesting birds in montane riparian and snowpocket aspen (Populus tremuloides) woodlands in the northwestern Great Basin. Live trees and snags with DBH gt 24 cm were favored as nest sites by all species. Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis) and Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) provided different sizes of nest cavities for a suite of nonexcavator species. Flickers preferentially nested in snags; sapsuckers nested primarily in live trees, but used live trees and snags in proportion to their availabilities. Relative abundances of excavators and nonexcavators were associated positively with numbers of cavities. Nest-site variables overlapped extensively among species; Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) relied heavily on sapsuckers for provision of nest cavities, European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) primarily used flicker-excavated cavities, and House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) used nest cavities across the broadest range of nest-site characteristics. Compass orientation of nest-cavity entrances was strongly bimodal, with most facing east or southwest. Cavity entrances of species that foraged largely outside of riparian woodlands were oriented toward woodland edge, in contrast to nest cavities used by species that foraged largely within riparian woodlands. Snowpocket woodlands were much more extensive than riparian aspen, but birds strongly preferred riparian aspen stands as nesting habitats, presumably due to the scarcity of large aspen in snowpockets. Nest cavities appear to be a limiting resource with high potential for interspecific nest-site competition in these woodlands. Decades of livestock overuse and fire suppression have greatly diminished the availability of large aspen in riparian habitats throughout the region.

Hansen, Andrew J.; Garman, Steven L.; Weigand, James F.; Urban, Dean L.; McComb, William C.; Raphael, Martin G.				Ecological Applications	5	3		535-554	August 1995	1995				English	2	33	New silvicultural strategies to sustain both ecological and human communities are being developed and implemented on federal forest lands in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) United States. Two important stand-level components of the new silviculture regimes are rotation age and retention level of live trees in harvest units. Ecologists have suggested that canopy tree retention and longer rotations will create patterns of stand structure in managed forest that are similar to those in natural forests, and promote long-term ecological productivity and biodiversity. Forest economists, however, are concerned that canopy tree retention and long rotations may reduce wood production, although the high value of large logs produced by these new silvicultural regimes may compensate for reduced growth rates. We used the forest model ZELIG to perform a factorial simulation experiment on long-term responses of ecological and economic variables to nine retention levels and four rotation lengths. ZELIG output on forest structure and composition was input to a forest economics model that calculated net value of wood products in 1989 dollars. The simulated stand data were also linked with regression equations to predict the densities of 17 bird species as a function of tree size class distribution. Five replicates of each treatment were run for the 240-yr simulation period. Results indicated that stand structure under each of the canopy tree retention levels was more similar to the pre-treatment natural forest than following clear-cutting. Variation in tree size under intermediate levels of retention, however, did not reach the level of the natural forest during the simulation period. Tree species composition was strongly related to retention level and rotation age. Shade-intolerant Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) lost dominance to shade-tolerant species under intermediate retention levels and longer rotations.

Hansen, Andrew J.; McComb, William C.; Vega, Robyn; Raphael, Martin G.; Hunter, Matthew				Ecological Applications	5	3		555-569	August 1995	1995				English	1	40	Ecologists have advocated retaining various densities of canopy trees in harvest units in Pacific Northwest forests. In contrast to clear-cutting, this practice may better emulate the patterns of disturbance and structural complexity typical of natural forests in the region. Several ecological attributes, including vertebrate habitat diversity, are thought to be associated with stands of complex structure. The goal of this study was to determine bird abundance in canopy retention sites relative to other common stand types in the Pacific Northwest and to develop habitat functions for extrapolating bird abundance across current and future landscapes. We used data from five previous studies in the west central Cascades of Oregon to corn are bird abundance and to develop habitat functions for forest birds across a wide range of natural and managed stand structures and ages. The 67 stands included clearcuts, retention sites, young closed-canopy plantations, mature stands, and old-growth stands. ANOVA revealed that 18 of the 23 species included in the analysis differed significantly in abundance among the stand types, with some species being primarily associated with each of the stand types. The habitat variables used to build habitat functions included tree density by size class, mean tree diameter, and variation in tree diameter. Linear, polynomial, and various nonlinear regression models were evaluated for each bird species. Significant habitat functions were generated for 17 of the 23 bird species. The analyses identified four habitat-use guilds among the 17 bird species: open-canopy; open-canopy with dispersed large trees; structurally complex closed-canopy; and structurally simple closed-canopy guilds. This study is the first in the Pacific Northwest to compare bird abundances across natural stands, traditionally managed plantations, and stands managed under ecological forestry approaches.

Macdonald, D.W.; Johnson, P.J.				Journal of Applied Ecology	32	3		492-505	August 1995	1995				English	1	27	1. We examine the relationship between the botanical and structural characteristics of the hedgerows of five Oxfordshire farms, and the bird populations associated with them. 2. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that, for this sample, bird-rich hedges tended to be tall and to have more species of shrub growing in them than did hedgerows in which few bird species were recorded. 3. The overall density of birds in the hedgerows (measured per unit length), and the density of several individual species, were also positively correlated with hedgerow height, with the rate of occurrence of mature trees in the hedgerows, and with the presence of garden habitat close to the hedgerow. 4. The extent of gaps in hedgerows had a significant negative effect on the overall abundance of birds, and on the abundance of two common species, the blackbird and dunnock. 5. These observations are considered in terms of practical management for conservation, neglect of hedgerows leading to the development of gaps and excessive management in the form of cutting, are both likely to have a negative effect on the local abundance of many species.

No signs of decline were found, 28-29 pairs (0.6 pairs/km-2) bred there in 1991. Coniferous stands were avoided, deciduous stands, especially swampy stands with high content of dead wood, were preferred for nesting. All holes excavated in decaying wood, in riverine stands mostly in alders, in drier stands mostly in hornbeams and oaks, on average 17.2 m above the ground. Egg-laying commenced usually in the last days of March-beginning of April, but large temperature-dependent variation occurred. The clutch size was 3-4 eggs, nesting success 36 and 83% in two years. The difference was due to varying predation. Replacement broods after early loss possible. In response to play-backs of drumming both sexes reacted equally often in spring and autumn, indicating persistence of territorial behaviour beyond the breeding period.

Journal of Field Ornithology	66	3		352-362	Summer 1995	1995				English	1	4	Numbers of birds on 54 circular plots (50-m radius) were counted in two Colorado forest sites for 2 yr, then four artificial nest boxes were added to each of 27 of the plots, and counts continued for 2 more yr. Combined abundances of eight box-using species increased more than threefold on experimental plots compared to unmanipulated control plots, apparently as a result of the box additions. Common cavity-nesting species that responded most strongly to nest box additions included the Mountain Chickadee (Parus gambeli), Pygmy Nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea) and House Wren (Troglodytes aedon). Combined abundances of open-nesting species did not change on experimental versus control plots during the experiment. Results of this study suggest that secondary cavity-nesters were limited by the quantity or quality of available nest sites, but that increased numbers of cavity-nesting species had no affect on abundances of open-nesting species.

Greenberg, Cathryn H.; Harris, Lawrence D.; Neary, Daniel G.				Wilson Bulletin	107	1		40-54	March 1995	1995				English	0	8	We hypothesized that similar bird assemblages will occur in like-structured habitat that results from both clearcutting and high-intensity wildfire followed by salvage logging. To test this, we compared bird communities of sand pine scrub in mature forest and three disturbance treatments (1) high-intensity wildfire, salvage logged, and naturally regenerated, (2) clearcut, roller chopped, and broadcast seeded, and (3) clearcut and bracke-seeded. We analyzed communities based on residency status and nesting guilds. Migratory breeding birds were nearly restricted to mature forest. Bird communities of mature forest were significantly more species rich and diverse than those of disturbance treatments in spring. However, indicating that they are habitat-structure generalists on their wintering grounds. Canopy- and cavity-nesters and canopy- and bark-foraging species were virtually restricted to mature forest. Most species recorded in mature sand pine forest or disturbance treatments were either habitat-structure generalists or also occurred in other similarly structured vegetation types. However, the threatened and endemic Florida Scrub Jay (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) occurred only in disturbance treatments (no differences). Silvicultural disturbance appears to mimic the natural high-intensity disturbance regime by creating habitat structural features required by open scrub species may be an important habitat management tool where the use of wildfire is impractical. However, long-term effects, unsalvaged burns, and landscape patterns created by clearcutting were not addressed and may also be important in structuring bird communities of sand pine scrub.

Sorensen, Uffe Gjol				Dansk Ornitologisk Forenings Tidsskrift	89	1		1-48	1995	1995				Danish	0	0	The breeding range and population size in Denmark of the 54 bird species included as endangered, vulnerable or rare in the most recent Danish Red List (Asbirk & Sogard 1990) are summarized. The criteria for these three Red List categories follow IUCN definitions. Annual population figures from 16 years (1976-1991) have been extracted by comprehensively reviewing published and unpublished information. Also included is information on other scarce breeding birds in Denmark during the study period (occasional breeding records of species otherwise extinct in Denmark, other accidental breeders, introduced species, escapes, and a few species possibly under immigration). Population figures for a total of 87 Red List and other species are presented in Tab. 1. Throughout this century changes in the Danish bird fauna have mainly been related to the utilization of land and change of habitats by humans. Accordingly, breeding ranges and populations of many species have often changed markedly within a short span of time. The landscapes of Denmark have been modified by man through centuries, and present changes in bird populations are the result both of present and previous land use. Therefore, provided the objective for bird conservation in the future is to maintain all species found in Denmark at present, detailed knowledge of past and present land use is of paramount importance. The fact that cultural influence has partly superseded natural successions in the Danish landscapes is the main cause for the prevailing instability in the Danish bird fauna. The species which colonized Denmark during the present century are mostly found in new habitats like plantations of introduced conifers, urban environments, etc. As a consequence, conservation priorities are not exclusively directed towards the "original" Danish fauna.

Wilson, Christopher W.; Masters, Ronald E.; Buckenhofer, George A.				Journal of Wildlife Management	59	1		56-67	January 1995	1995				English	3	41	Plans exist to restore the fire-dependent pine (Pinus spp.)-grassland community in Ouachita National Forest and potentially throughout the southeastern United States to benefit the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Restoration and management techniques include wildlife stand improvement (WSI; thinning of midstory and codominant trees) and prescribed fire. We evaluated how habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected other breeding bird species. We compared avian species frequency of occurrence and abundance during 2 breeding seasons in untreated pine-hardwood stands with that in treated stands after WSI and in 3 growing seasons following WSI and prescribed fire. Total bird densities were highest (P = 0.037) in the second growing season following WSI and fire and lowest in the control, whereas species richness did not differ (P = 0.399) among treatments. Densities of ground/ shrub-foraging and shrub-nesting species increased (P = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively) the most following WSI and fire. Only ground-nesting species were more abundant (P lt 0.001) in untreated stands than in treated stands. Restoration efforts may be beneficial to neotropical migrant species such as eastern woodpewee (Contopus virens) and prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), in addition to declining species of regional interest such as red-cockaded woodpecker, Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) that depend upon pine-grassland habitats.

Darveau, Marcel; Beauchesne, Patrick; Belanger, Louis; Huot, Jean; Larue, Pierre				Journal of Wildlife Management	59	1		67-78	January 1995	1995				English	5	32	Riparian forest strips are usually protected from logging for their buffer effect on aquatic habitats. However, their value to terrestrial wildlife is unknown. From 1989 to 1992, we compared bird abundance and species composition in 5 experimental riparian forest strips (20-m, 40-m, 60-m, and control ( gt 300 m wide), intact strips, and 20-m-wide thinned strips), in boreal balsam fir (Abies balsamea) stands, for 3 years following clear-cutting. Bird densities increased 30-70% (P lt 0.05) in all strips the year after cutting and decreased (P gt 0.05) thereafter to approximately pretreatment levels. The 20- and 40-m-wide riparian strips had highest mean bird densities, but also the fastest (P lt 0.05) decreases thereafter. By the third year after clear-cutting, forest-dwelling species were less (P = 0.01) abundant than ubiquitous species in the 20-m strips. The golden-crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus), blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata), and black-throated green warbler (D. virens) became nearly absent in 20-m strips. The removal of 33% of the trees in some 20-m strips resulted in a lt 20% decline of bird densities, a moderate effect that combined with the greater effect of strip narrowness. There was evidence that 60-m-wide strips are required for forest-dwelling birds. Bird populations may continue to decline in strips before regeneration of adjacent clear-cuts provides suitable habitat for forest-dwelling species.

Murray, Norman L.; Stauffer, Dean F.				Journal of Wildlife Management	59	1		78-88	January 1995	1995				English	0	5	Most studies that have shown higher bird species richness and abundance in riparian zones have been conducted where there is contrast between vegetation in riparian and upland habitats. In central Appalachian hardwood forests, substantial riparian habitat is potentially subject to habitat alterations. However, little information is available on the importance of riparian habitats to songbirds where the riparian-upland vegetation gradient is relatively uniform. We sampled relative bird abundance and habitat characteristics along a gradient from a stream to adjacent upland habitat at 16 sites in southwest Virginia. We evaluated total relative bird abundance, species richness, and relative abundance of 28 bird species to determine whether riparian habitats influenced bird assemblages. Total bird relative abundance and species richness showed no (P gt 0.10) riparian influence; however, Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens) and Louisiana waterthrushes (Seiurus motacilla) were most associated (P lt 0.001) with streams. American robins (Turdus migratorius) showed a weaker but positive association (P = 0.068) with streams. Eastern woodpewees (Contopus virens) (P = 0.01), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia) (P lt 0.001), pine warblers (Dendroica pinus) (P lt 0.001), worm-eating warblers (Helmintheros vermivorus) (P lt 0.001), and scarlet tanagers (Piranga olivacea) (P = 0.041) were negatively associated with streams. We used cluster analysis to group the 28 bird species into 5 assemblages on the basis of their distributions at 69 sampling stations distributed among the 16 sites. Species were classified as belonging to riparian (n = 2 species), upland forest (n = 6 species), mesic forest (n = 3 species), xeric upland forest (n = 6 species), and mature hardwoods generalist (n = 11 species) assemblages. Management or protection of riparian zones often is justified on the basis of higher bird species richness and abundance found in these sites.

One successfully breeding pair was radio-monitored throughout a year. Additional telemetry data were collected in summer from a male in a pair that failed breeding. In summer the birds almost exclusively preyed upon ant colonies in soil and rotten stumps located in young conifer plantations. In winter, when snow or frost prohibited ground feeding, birds were feeding on bark-dwelling insects in old pine and dead trees. The winter shift in diet and feeding behavior was accompanied by an approximately 100 times enlargement in home range size, increasing from 50-100 ha (n = 3) in summer to 4 5005 400 ha (n = 2) in winter. With reservations due to small sample size, our data suggests that availability of winter food is critical to the Grey-headed Woodpecker when snow or frozen -round prevents ground-feeding for soil-dwelling ants.

Farley, Greg H.; Ellis, Lisa M.; Stuart, James N.; Scott, Norman J., Jr				Conservation Biology	8	4		1098-1108	December 1994	1994				English	3	28	Riparian forests are important for maintaining vertebrate species richness in the southwestern United States, but they have become restricted in distribution due to both historical and current management practices. In order to counteract continued loss of this habitat, several mitigation programs were developed in the middle Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico. Three areas ranging from 50 to 140 ha were revegetated with native trees using pole planting and cattle exclosures, and changes in vegetation structure were quantified after 2, 3, and 5 years of growth. As expected, the older site contained the most heterogeneous mix of plant species and the greatest structural diversity. We compared year-round avian use of the revegetated sites with a mature cottonwood forest site of approximately 30 years of age. As the revegetated sites matured and salient habitat features changed, the population d ynamics of individual avian species and patterns of guild structure varied. The older revegetated sites showed a greater similarity to the mature cottonwood site, suggesting that reclamation efforts established quality riparian habitats for birds in as little as 5 years. The revegetated sites appeared especially important for Neotropical-migrant birds. We suggest that a mosaic of riparian woodlands containing mixtures of native tree and shrub species of different size classes is necessary to maintain avian species richness in the middle Rio Grande drainage, and probably throughout the southwestern United States.

Weller, Milton W.				Wetlands	14	4		293-300	December 1994	1994				English	0	14	Birds were surveyed during summer 1985 in five adjacent saline vegetation zones and during summers 1986 and 1991 in 6 adjacent vegetation zones on the San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge on the upper Texas Coast. Although 66 bird species were recorded, numbers and species varied among years, and only 17 were nesting species. A few bird species used all vegetation types at some time, but most were limited by vegetation structure or water presence. Olney's three-square bulrush (Scirpus olneyi), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and mudflats were especially favored feeding and resting areas in response to periodic flooding and had the greatest frequency of use as well as species richness. Reduced rainfall and water depths during 1986 were reflected in a change toward birds favoring drier conditions. Heavy rainfall in 1991 decreased diversity but increased usage and favored freshwater and swimming birds. Although tidally influenced wetlands often are considered uniform, dynamic water and salinity regimes observed along this coast must be considered in the design of any management or conservation program.

Species richness of winter, summer and breeding birds.		Parish, T.; Lakhani, K.H.; Sparks, T.H.				Journal of Applied Ecology	31	4		764-775	November 1994	1994				English	0	36	1. An understanding of how farming practices in adjacent fields and the dimensions of the hedge and other components of the boundary affect birds is essential for efficient conservation management of field boundaries. This paper is based upon surveys of field boundary transects at two sites in eastern England. 2. The first study, near Huntingdon (1983-85), was based upon a range of field boundaries, from small ditches to tall hedges. The boundaries were between small pasture, small arable or large arable fields. 3. The second study, at Swavesey (1985-87), covered the various permutations of boundary structure, and adjacent cropping, available within a catchment of a tributary of the River Great Ouse. This study also included a range of drainage regimens. 4. Regression models were used to relate measures of bird species richness, in both winter and summer over several years, to field boundary attributes, including adjacent land use. 5. Bird variables were positively correlated with the physical size of the hedge, the number and height of trees and adjacent permanent pasture. These attributes accounted for most of the observed variation in bird variables. Ditch and verge dimensions played a statistically significant but relatively less important role. 6. Field boundary management options, beneficial for bird conservation with relatively little agricultural cost, are presented.

Kelly, Jeffrey F.; Pletschet, Sandra M.; Leslie, David M., Jr				American Midland Naturalist	132	2		275-283	October 1994	1994				English	0	7	A search of 4600 ha of the McCurtain County Wilderness Area (MCWA), Oklahoma, in 1989-1990 yielded 15 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis). The number of groups and number of individuals in a 3795-ha area that was surveyed in 1977 and 1989-1990 declined by 62% and 75%, respectively. The productivity of the population was low during 1989-1990; 0.69 young were fledged per nesting attempt. To assess the adequacy of foraging habitat, forest structure was measured in an area with a high density of groups (1.95/km-2) in 1990 and in an area where the group density had declined from 2.92 groups/km-2 in 1977 to 0.74 groups/km-2 in 1990. Forest structure in both areas was adequate but approached the limits recommended in the Red-cockaded Woodpecker Recovery Plan. To determine if isolation of groups was related to population decline, we estimated nearest neighbor distances from cluster locations (a cluster is the cavity trees used by a group of woodpeckers) in 1977 and 1990. Cluster sites had longer nearest neighbor distances in 1977 than in 1990, which may indicate that isolation by distance reduces the influx of dispersing breeders from elsewhere in the population. Periodic fires occur naturally in the MCWA but have been suppressed since 1926. Re-establishment of a fire regime is important in maintaining the integrity of the MCWA and may be beneficial to its red-cockaded woodpecker population.

Roth, Dana S.; Perfecto, Ivette; Rathcke, Beverly				Ecological Applications	4	3		423-436	August 1994	1994				English	3	27	The impacts of four different management systems on diversity of ground-foraging ants were examined to assess potential for conservation of biological diversity in human-influenced agricultural or agroforestry systems. Using a variety of indices, diversity was measured along a gradient of anthropogenically disturbed habitats. The gradient, in terms of increasing levels of disturbance, ranged from primary rain forest, abandoned cacao plantations, productive cacao plantations, to banana plantations. The primary forest and abandoned cacao plantations were situated in a reserve and the productive cacao plantations, and banana plantations were located on privately owned land within 35 km of the reserve in the Sarapiqui Valley of Costa Rica. To sample ground-foraging ants, we placed tuna baits along the ground in each habitat. Although tuna baits attract a generalist assemblage of ants that may be better able to adapt to more disturbed sites, diversity of this community was significantly reduced with increased disturbance. Ant diversity was not different for forest and abandoned cacao sites except in terms of evenness, with the forest having a more even distribution of species. Forest and abandoned cacao sites were significantly more diverse than both productive cacao and banana plantations. The latter two did not differ significantly from each other in terms of diversity, but there was considerable variability within each of these habitat types. The results of this study suggest that conservation of diversity may be possible in a "mosaic" of different land uses, but further studies, such as those addressing the importance of scale and nearby source populations, are necessary before management practices can be implemented.

Barrett, G.W.; Ford, H.A.; Recher, H.F.				Pacific Conservation Biology	1	3		245-256	June 1994	1994				English	0	3	Increasingly, conservation efforts are being extended towards agricultural and pastoral areas outside large reserves. This indicates a change from the view of the landscape as islands of native habitat in a hostile matrix, to one in which the landscape is regarded as a patchwork of differing levels of disturbance. This latter view considers the whole of the landscape as the biological resource. These trends are discussed in relation to land bird species near Armidale on the New England Tablelands, north-east New South Wales, Australia. We assess the conservation status of 137 species of land birds. Of these, six species are locally extinct, 18 are thought to be declining and 35 are vulnerable due to their dependence on healthy woodland. Only 33 species are abundant and widely distributed on the Tablelands. The remaining 45 species tend to be habitat specialists that are marginal to the Armidale Plateau, and may never have been common in the study area. Most of the species that are dependent on large areas of continuous woodland ( gt 400 ha) are in this last group, and it is demonstrated that an emphasis on these species may result in a conservation strategy that is inappropriate for most of the land birds in the region. Indeed, this could result in the extinction of species that at present are secure. An alternative strategy, specific to areas outside large reserves, is proposed that aims to maintain local species richness. In this management plan, priority is given to core species that are tolerant of intermediate levels of habitat fragmentation.

American Midland Naturalist	131	2		347-358	April 1994	1994				English	1	35	Intensive rowcrop farming in the Midwest has eliminated much wildlife grassland habitat; yet some linear habitat remains in areas such as roadsides. To determine the importance of roadsides to nesting birds in intensively farmed areas, this study evaluated nest densities and nesting success of birds in roadsides in central Iowa during 1990 and 1991. One hundred and twenty nests of eight species were found in 34 roadsides (10.2 ha). Red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) nest density was greatest in roadsides with tall dense vegetation; vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) nests were most dense in areas of sparse vegetation. Gray partridge (Perdix perdix) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) nest densities were greatest in roadsides with the most residue cover. Red-winged blackbirds usually placed their nests in the bottom or in the fencerow of a roadside; all vesper sparrows nested in the short vegetation of the roadside nearest the road. Daily survival rates for the red-winged blackbird and for all species combined were 0.9471 and 0.9428, respectively. Fifty-five percent of red-wing nests and 52% of the nests of all species were destroyed by predation. Red-wing nests placed in forbs, shrubs and the fence were more successful than those built in grasses other than reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinace). Roadside management which includes seeding native grasses and forbs in roadsides may make these areas more attractive to birds that use such habitats for nesting. Fences were used by some birds in place of vegetation for nest support and should be retained in roadsides. Periodic prescribed burns in roadsides would increase the vigor and structural heterogeneity of roadside vegetation; mowing roadsides should be discouraged except at the roadside shoulder.

Bird composition was related, using a multivariate approach (canonical correspondence analyses), to either habitat or to landscape, eliminating the effect of habitat statistically. Bird composition and species richness varied with patch area and isolation from large pine stands, but this effect could be assigned principally to variation in vegetation structure and altitude. Another effect, that of increasing occurrence and numbers of Anthus trivialis with decreasing distance to nearest low-altitude forest, could be assigned to both habitat (grass cover) and landscape (connectivity effects). Management implications are drawn from the results.

For birds, variation within a mature forest area was mainly due to nonsynchronous fluctuations of species and stochasticity in the site selection of individual breeding pairs. For carabid beetles, small-scale aggregations within a forest presumably reflected movement patterns of individuals. Both birds and carabids included some old-growth specialists and species inhabiting mainly, or exclusively, open habitats in young forest stages. The grain-patterning of silvicultural mosaics differ: birds put together their home ranges in a small-grained fashion, whereas for carabids the environment is coarse-grained. Maintenance of ecological heterogeneity at various scales relevant to different organisms in the taiga depends on how human-induced change and natural change compare with each other. The observed patterns are related to natural disturbance dynamics, and ecologically sound management approaches are discussed.

Baguette, M.; Deceuninck, B.; Muller, Y.				Acta Oecologica	15	3		275-288	1994	1994				English	1	3	Spruce forestry is usually considered to impoverish animal communities but few data support this claim. This paper analyses the structure and dynamics of bird communities over an artificial spruce plantation age gradient and compares them with those of a deciduous native beechwood succession. Fifty-two bird species (2 489 individuals) were recorded in 14 pure evenly-aged spruce plantations along a gradient from 2 yr to 77 yr Species richness was lowest in the youngest plots (2 yr) and maximal in the 37 yr plantation. Youngest plantations recruited species of open habitats; a fast change in community composition occurred in bushy stages (from 4 to 10 yr). Comparison between bird communities of the artificial spruce succession and those of the beech succession showed the particularity of young spruce stages which has no equivalent in any other stages of both successions. Bird communities in bushy stages are very similar in both successions. The avifaunas of old stages diverge between the two successions in two respects: by (1) the colonization of old spruce plantations by bird species specialized in conifers, and (2) the occurrence of birds restricted to old broad-leaved forests in the beech succession. Therefore, at a regional scale spruce forestry modifies to some extent bird communities but does not impoverish them.

Biological Conservation	70	3		265-276	1994	1994				English	5	128	The breeding densities of many bird-species which nest in tree cavities are in some areas limited by shortage of sites. This is evident from circumstantial evidence in which the numbers of breeding pairs in different areas correlate with the numbers of local nest sites, or where changes in the numbers of nest sites resulting from natural processes or human action are followed by changes in the numbers of pairs. It is also shown experimentally, where nest site provision or removal has been followed by a corresponding change in breeding density. When nest boxes were provided, they were often occupied in the same year, leading to an immediate rise in breeding density. This implied that surplus birds were available in the vicinity and able to take them up. In future years, pair numbers often increased further but eventually they levelled off. This implied that, at this higher level, other limiting factors came into play. Experiments on nest site provision thus provide examples of different factors acting successively to limit breeding density at different levels. By constraining breeding density, shortage of nest sites not only prevents some birds from breeding, but must also limit the total numbers of breeders and non-breeders, because no population can increase beyond a certain point, when the production of young is limited Once all available nest sites are occupied, reproduction is inevitably density-dependent with respect to the total population of breeders and non-breeders. Because several bird species can use the same type of site, competition is frequent, and the numbers of dominant species can affect the numbers and distribution of others. In extreme situations, a species may be totally absent from areas where all suitable nest sites are occupied by dominant competitory. In less extreme situations, the numbers o a subordinate species may vary from year to year or from place to place in inverse relation to the numbers of a dominant species.

Timonen, Sami; Monkkonen, Mikko; Orell, Markku				Ornis Fennica	71	2		55-60	1994	1994				English	0	9	Herrera (1978) found an inverse relationship between relative densities of resident and migrant passerines in European breeding bird assemblages. He hypothesized that the decreasing proportion of migrants to the south would be due to interspecific competition with residents. The putative competition between resident titmice (Parus montanus and P. major) and migrant conguilders (Fringilla coelebs and Phylloscopus trochilus) was tested by a playback experiment in northern Finland. If competition was important between individual birds, it could reduce overlap between territories. The spatial configuration of the two migrant species was studied in relation to the nests of the two residents during the breeding season in late May - early June, in 1989 and 1990. The experiment was carried out at 13 (year 1989) and 17 (year 1990) tit-nest plots. To control habitat effects, the tape was also played at control plots where the tit pair had bred in the previous year and at randomly chosen plots. The data were analysed using log-linear models, which test for dependencies between categorical variables. In 1990, there were far fewer positive responses at the study points than in 1989, possibly due to changes in the population densities of the migrants. We found that migrants did not avoid settlement near or in resident territories. There was a tendency that migrants aggregated more at the vicinity of tit-nests compared with the random- and control plots. This result is consistent with the 'heterospecific attraction' hypothesis generated by Monkkonen et al. (1990).

The analysis is based on 8 years of observations and 89 nests. Breeding pairs occupied only some fragments of the available habitat, showing a tendency to breed in scattered colonies. Little Bitterns breed in the following types of habitats: 1) small, shallow ponds with broad zones of fringe vegetation and old reed beds; 2) large ponds (30-40 ha), but with peninsulas and islands at least 15 m wide and with stands of old reeds Phragmites australis; 3) small ponds (up to 6 ha) and channels with a zone of emergent aquatic vegetation at least 3 m wide and with relatively old reeds; 4) larger patches covered with Typha spp. are used for nesting as often as are Phragmites stands; 5) mean water depth under the nests is 40 cm and nests are built on average 40 cm above the water surface. There were significant differences in several parameters of nest placement between the two study areas (Tab. 2), probably related to habitat structure. Little Bitterns were rather tolerant against disturbance by man. The nests are often constructed in places regularly visited by people. Good habitat conditions are especially important during the first half of the breeding season, when larger clutches are produced than later in the season (calendar effect). Survey methods for studying population dynamics are discussed and some questions are suggested for further study in order to protect this species more effectively.

Maeda, Taku				Journal of the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology	25	2	No 90	105-136	30 October 1993	1993				Japanese	0	6	Because Japanese cities have been developed for the purposes of pursuing only economy and industry, they are usually short of natural habitats, consisting mostly of nonorganic environments with few wildlife. Recently, however, it is strongly expected that new-styled cities with a variety of wildlife will be developed. In doing so, it is essential to know the ecology of wildlife, especially their habitat needs, and to apply that information to the city plan. In this paper, I review and discuss information concerning the relationships between terrestrial bird communities and the environmental factors of urban areas and, by using them, propose some methods for introducing and/or reintroducing those environmental factors needed to develop an "eco-city". The principal assertions are as follows: 1) Urban bird communities usually depend on vegetational factors such as amount, structure, species composition and dispersion of vegetation. Increase of vegetation volume may be most important for introducing a high diversity bird community into an urban area. An increase of green volume in an urban area could be promoted by adopting vegetation management by avoiding over-pruning, and a city plan that provides for increasing green space by aggregating houses (apartments, town houses, terrace houses), road systems with culs-de-sac, provision of underground car parks and the introduction of vegetation to walls and roofs. 2) The bird communities of "green islands" isolated in urban areas are usually affected by factors such as the shape, size and distance from adjacent green areas. Further, these relations may vary depending on localities, seasons and methodologies for analyses. Therefore, we need specific local surveys. For the present, Diamond's proposition (1975) will be effective as a guide, and the garden city with an extensive green area proposed by Howard (1902), could be considered as an ideal style of city favorable for inhabitation by a variety of birds.

Kangas, Jyrki; Kuusipalo, Jussi				Forest Ecology and Management	61	1-2		1-15	October 1993	1993				English	0	11	In this paper, an approach is presented for incorporating biological diversity into strategic forest management planning. Alternative management strategies are evaluated with respect to biodiversity using Saaty's ratio scale estimation method. Biodiversity consists of a variety of components, their importance depending on context, definition and the objectives of the decision-maker in question. In this study, biodiversity is decomposed into three characteristics: species richness, rarity and vulnerability of the species. Weights of the components of biodiversity are assessed on the grounds of pairwise comparisons between the importance of the components, made by an expert on conservation biology. Maximizing biodiversity is added as an objective to a decision hierarchy of a planning problem of multiple-use forestry. The weight of biodiversity, in relation to other objectives, is determined based on the preferences of the decision-maker. A case study is reported where biodiversity is integrated into forest management planning. The main problems in the application of the presented approach include, primarily, the lack of general agreement on operational definition of biodiversity, and, secondly, the lack of objective knowledge for evaluating decision alternatives with respect to components of biodiversity.

Delphey, Philip J.; Dinsmore, James J.				Wetlands	13	3		200-206	September 1993	1993				English	0	21	We compared the breeding bird communities of natural and recently restored prairie potholes in northern Iowa (USA) in 1989 and 1990. Species richness of breeding birds was higher (P lt 0.05) at natural wetlands, although duck pair counts and species richness were not significantly different between wetland types (P gt 0.1). Common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris), and swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) were each more abundant at natural than at restored wetlands during at least one year (P lt 0.05). Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitized a significantly greater proportion of red-winged blackbird nests at natural than at restored wetlands. Incomplete development of typical vegetation structure evidently depresses bird species richness at recently restored prairie potholes. Drought the year before and during the first year of our study undoubtedly affected our results. Similar studies should be conducted during periods of relatively high precipitation to complement our results.

The greatest impact of fencing was on nest density and nest success. Nest density was higher on fenced than control sites, but nest success was lower on fenced compared to control sites. Although nest success was lower, overall productivity (no. of successful nests/ha) did not differ between fenced and control sites. Reducing stream-bank erosion, improving water quality, and the belief that fencing would become mandatory in the future were the primary reasons landowners gave for participating in the fencing program. After joining the program, the major concerns or complaints landowners had about fencing involved weeds, fence maintenance, and loss of pasture. These issues will need to be addressed to maintain high levels of voluntary participation in fencing programs.

Few bird species showed a preference for roadsides with native-mix versus exotic grasses or for burned versus unburned roadsides, but the abundance of some birds was related to vegetation height and vertical density in roadsides. American robin, brown thrasher, brown-headed cowbird, and vesper sparrow abundance, as well as total bird abundance, were greater in roadsides in 1990 than in 1991.

Hydrobiologia	265	1-3		73-95	august 13 1993	1993				English	1	73	The area of salt marshes does no longer increase. The recent erosion coincides with a rise in MHT-level in the last 25 years. Despite the decrease in area, sedimentation continues, especially in the lower salt marsh, which acts as a sink of nitrogen. Assimilation and mineralization of nitrogen are in balance in most plant communities along the gradient from lower to higher salt marshes. Mineralization of nitrogen increases towards the higher salt marsh, whereas the above-ground production and the mean nitrogen content of plants decrease. There is a positive correlation between quality of food plants in salt marshes and breeding success of Brent geese in the arctic tundra. Sedimentation on mainland salt marshes can compensate for the expected sea level rise. This is not the case for island salt marshes, if the relative sea level rise is more than 0.5-1.0 cm yr-1. The natural succession on salt marshes results in an accumulation of organic material, which is related to the dominance of single plant species. It is not clear to which extent this process is enhanced by eutrophication from acid deposition and seawater. Human exploitation of unprotected salt marshes is old and heavy in the system of mound settlements. Reclamation rates by dikes in the last centuries were higher than the rate of area increase. Grazing by cattle as a management practice results in both a higher plant species-richness and community diversity than abandoning; hay-making is intermediate, but shows less structural diversity than grazing with low stocking density. The invertebrate fauna is favoured by a short period of abandoning, but eventually characteristic salt marsh invertebrates are replaced by inland species. Many bird species prefer grazed salt marshes. The final section gives some perspectives.				de Leeuw, Jan/0000-0001-7020-2503			Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology	0018-8158		Animals and man; Conservation; Ecology; Habitat; Brackish habitat; Pollution; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Marine zones; Atlantic Ocean; North Atlantic	Animalia [Disturbance by man /  / ecological responses & management recommendations; Netherlands] [Conservation measures /  / Salt marshes; recommendations] [Ecology /  / impact of disturbance & management recommendations] [Salt marsh /  / responses to disturbance & management recommendations] [Pollution /  / ] [Water movements /  / Salt marsh high tide level changes; ecological impact] [North Sea /  / Salt marsh ecology].

Mallari, Neil Aldrin D.; Jensen, Arne				Asia Life Sciences	2	2		101-112	July-December 1993	1993				English	0	3	Biological diversity in the northern Sierra Madre mountains was evaluated using a combination of several survey techniques: namely, forty-hour line transect counting, mist-netting, general observations, bioacoustics, systematic trapping of non-volant mammals, and ethnobiological interviews with local people. In addition, information on existing land-use, logging practices, forest distribution and forest quality were compiled, together with a study focused on the Philippine Eagle. Thirteen study sites covering different forest types, habitat types and elevational gradients were identified. A total of 241 (200 breeding and 41 migratory) species of birds was identified. Nearly 80% of the breeding species known from Luzon have now been recorded. Eighty-seven percent of Luzon's Philippine endemics and 84% of all Luzon endemics are now known to occur in the area. This confirms the international importance of this mountain range as one of the 221 global key sites for conservation of biodiversity. Twenty-seven species of mammals (14 bats, 8 murid rodents, 1 monkey, 1 wild pig, 1 deer and 2 civets) were recorded, including 2 poorly known genera of rodents and a possibly undescribed species of bat. At present, about 70% of Luzon mammals are of unknown conservation status. It is evident that further reduction of the remaining primary forests and old residual forests in the mountain range will result in serious loss of biodiversity. And because of this and its limited distribution, the Isabela Oriole, Oriolus isabelae (not observed since 1961) may be the first bird species endemic to the area that will face extinction. With the extinction of very vagile organisms such as some birds, it is apparent that organisms which are less vagile and thus, with low colonization capability, face greater threat of extinction.

Rickart, Eric A.				Asia Life Sciences	2	2		251-260	July-December 1993	1993				English	0	4	Standardized biological surveys along habitat gradients are a rapid means of obtaining basic information on the structure of terrestrial vertebrate communities and patterns of biological diversity. In the Philippines, studies involving two kinds of gradients are most informative: 1) elevational gradients extending from lowland forest to mossy forest, and 2) disturbance gradients ranging from primary forest to severely disturbed human landscapes. Gradient surveys of two groups of mammals (small fruit bats and small non-volant mammals) on four islands in the Philippines have revealed several common patterns. Species richness and relative abundance of fruit bats are highest in lowland forest and decline with elevation, whereas species richness and abundance of non-volant mammals are lowest in lowland forest and increase with elevation. Many endemic species in both groups occur at low population densities. Communities at higher elevations may include ecological specialists which often are local endemics. Endemic species are restricted to undisturbed or lightly disturbed habitats, whereas non-endemic species predominate in highly disturbed habitats. To adequately protect entire local faunas, protected areas must incorporate the wildest elevational range possible, and must be large enough to sustain viable populations of species that naturally occur at low densities. They should be designed to include a fully protected core area of primary forest surrounded by concentric buffer zones of regenerating secondary forest and managed forest plantation. Knowledge of Philippine mammals is still very incomplete. Many areas of the country remain unsurveyed, and ecological data are scarce for many common species.

Emu	93	2		100-120	June 1993	1993				English	0	7	The bird species composition of 88 patches of monsoon rainforest in the Kakadu National Park area of the Northern Territory was examined in the period April-November 1987. The monsoon rainforest avifauna is a 'cut-and-paste' community, comprising species derived from wet tropical rainforests, from Eucalyptus open forests, from mangroves, from paperbrak woodlands and habitat generalist species. Its composition may be seasonally unstable, and is re-arranged between monsoon rainforests of differing floristics or environment. For most bird species considered the distribution was well associated with a division of monsoon rainforests into six groups: coastal, subcoastal, lowland springs, sandstone springs, escarpment and rock outcrop. Escarpment and rock outcrop rainforests were relatively depauperate. Monsoon rainforests are fragmented into small patches. The distribution of many characteristic rainforest birds (e.g. Orange-footed Scrub-fowl, Rainbow Pitta, Grey Whistler), bird species diversity and a Conservation Index were correlated with patch size. Bird species more typical of Eucalyptus open forests were abundant in patches most disturbed by buffalo, pigs, weeds and fire. No species were particularly associated with the edges of monsoon rainforests, but several open forest species occurred more commonly at edges than in the interior of monsoon rainforests (e.g. Barshouldered Dove, White-throated Honeyeater and Double-barred Finch). Birds occurring in monsoon rainforests are probably highly vagile, a response mainly to the marked seasonality of the environment and the fragmented nature of monsoon rainforests.

Wilson Bulletin	105	2		239-255	June 1993	1993				English	0	11	I examined the effects of even-aged clear-cutting (third cutting cycle) on wintering and breeding bird communities at the Barrens Grouse Habitat Management Area (HMA) in central Pennsylvania (USA), 1987-1989. It tested the hypotheses that community structure and population abundance of wintering and breeding birds did not differ (1) among areas of the Barrens Grouse HMA that varied in extent of clear-cutting (0%, 50%, and 75% areas) or (2) among habitats of different age since clear-cutting on the treated sector (50% and 75% areas). These findings were compared to those obtained subsequent to a second cutting cycle. Abundance of 11 species of wintering birds did not vary (P gt 0.05) among the three areas. Species richness of all species combined and of ground-shrub foragers was high in the 50% and 75% areas after the third cycle, largely because of additional brushy vegetation. Abundances of all species combined and of ground-shrub foragers were greater than expected in the 75% area but lower than expected in the 0% and 50% areas; abundance of sallier-canopy foragers was greater than expected in the 0% area and less in the 75% area. Two Neotropical migrants, Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) and Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), were more sensitive than other area-dependent species to increased fragmentation via forest clear-cutting resulting from the third cycle. I conclude that the creation of a mosaic of small (1 ha), even-aged stands for management of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) habitat does not have a detrimental long-term effect on most species of breeding and wintering forest birds on a localized basis.

Thiollay, Jean-Marc				Ecography	16	2		97-110	April-June 1993	1993				English	1	9	The influence of irregular or incomplete fragmentation and increasing degradation of natural rain forest on diurnal raptor community was studied in the northern part of the western Ghats in southwestern India. A census of mainly territorial breeding pairs on 400 ha samples quadrats was associated with a measure of the percent cover of the main habitat types and a degree of forest fragmentation including irregular patch shape and habitat heterogeneity. Four groups of 3-4 species were defined according to their decreasing tolerance to forest fragmentation and disturbance, from mostly open grassland species to interior forest specialists. Habitat selection, density and sensitivity to landscape structure were investigated. The community composition and dynamic of each habitat were the sum of these specific reactions. The distribution of species along the succession of increasing fragmentation and forest degradation was thus found to be non random, but did not following a nested subset pattern. The density of forest species declined with forest patch size possibly because of the irregular patch shape, the increased edge effects and the consequent increase of linear distance for a bird to cover within its territory. However, sensitivity to habitat structure and disturbance was found to be even higher than sensitivity to area per se. The need to conserve the largest patches of little disturbed forest is emphasized, as well as the conservation value of woodlots-open habitat mosaics that are suitable for a different set of species.

Bowen, Bonnie S.; Kruse, Arnold D.				Journal of Wildlife Management	57	2		291-301	April 1993	1993				English	1	29	Grazing by livestock is often used to reduce litter, improve plant vigor, and alter plant species composition, but additional information is needed on the effects of these management practices on upland-nesting birds. Thus, we conducted an experimental study of the effect of grazing on nest density and nest success of upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) in southcentral North Dakota from 1981 to 1987. Our experimental design consisted of 4 treatments and 1 control, each applied to 1 field in each of 3 study areas. The treatments represented options available to grassland managers: spring grazing, autumn grazing, autumn-and-spring grazing, season-long grazing, and control (ungrazed during the study). Nests (n = 342) were found by searching study areas with a cable-chain drag. Nest density was lower (P = 0.006) for treatments where cattle were present (spring, autumn-and-spring, and season-long) than where cattle were not present (autumn and control) during the nesting season. We concluded that grazing during the nesting season reduced the nest density of upland sandpipers. Nest success varied among years (P = 0.01) and was low in the first year of grazing and higher at the end of the study period. We found little evidence that the grazing treatment influenced nest success. We recommend that public lands with breeding populations of upland sandpipers include a complex of fields under various management practices, including fields undisturbed during the nesting season.

Bull, Evelyn L.; Holthausen, Richard S.				Journal of Wildlife Management	57	2		335-345	April 1993	1993				English	0	10	We determined home range size and habitats used by pileated woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus) to provide essential information for proper management of the species in northeastern Oregon. Twenty-three pileated woodpeckers fitted with transmitters were followed for 5-10 months (Jun-Mar) during 1989-90. Mated pairs (n = 7) ranged over smaller areas ( hivin x = 407 ha) than birds ( hivin x = 597 ha) whose mates had died (n = 9). Habitat use within home ranges was not random. Stands with old growth, grand fir (Abies grandis), no logging, and gtoreq 60% canopy closure were used more (P lt 0.01) than expected, and all other types of stands were used less than expected. From June until March, 38% of the observations of foraging were on downed logs, 38% on dead trees, 18% on live trees, and 6% on stumps. We recommend that management for pileated woodpeckers in northeastern Oregon include increasing density of snags for nesting and foraging, increasing density of downed logs in foraging areas, and increasing management areas from the existing 121 ha to 364 ha of forest. Within these areas, we recommend that 75% be in grand fir forest type; 25% be old growth; and the remainder be mature stands; at least 50% have gtoreq 60% canopy closure; and at least 40% be unlogged with the remainder in mature stands.

Journal of the Elisha Mitchell Scientific Society	109	1		37-44	Spring 1993	1993				English	0	0	We examined the relationships among measures of snag density, cavity-nesting bird density, and use of red-cockaded woodpecker cavities by other species in 12 red-cockaded woodpecker clusters located in south-central North Carolina. The relationships are important in determining habitat management strategies for this endangered species. The proportion of red-cockaded woodpecker cavities occupied by other species was positively related to cavity-nesting bird density. Controlling for cavity-nesting bird density, multiple regression analysis revealed that there was not a significant relationship between snag density and the occupancy rate of red-cockaded woodpecker cavities by other avian species. It is likely that snag density (and, hence, cavity availability) is not a factor in determining the utilization rate of red-cockaded woodpecker cavities by other species. Avian competitors selected red-cockaded woodpecker cavities in preference to snags as nest sites.

Prairie Naturalist	25	1		1-11	March 1993	1993				English	1	5	The number of breeding marsh birds per restored wetland in northern Iowa (USA) was fewer during 1989 ( hivin X = 8.2). There was a significant positive relationship between species richness and wetland size, but the age of the restored wetland had no effect on species richness in either year. Birds rapidly colonized restored wetlands, usually within the first year of restoration. Duration of drainage was not related to species richness but did affect the development of marsh vegetation. Relative coverage of emergents, floating plants, open water, and bare ground affected bird species richness. Restoration efforts should concentrate on large wetland basins that have been recently drained or have a tendency to reflood frequently.

Usher, M.B.; Thompson, D.B.A.				Biological Conservation	66	1		69-81	1993	1993				English	5	59	The two main communities of British upland heaths are heather Calluna vulgaris moor and heather-dominated blanket bog, which occur towards dry and wet ends, respectively, of a climatic gradient. The four developmental phases of heather-pioneer, building, mature and degenerate-also contribute to the variability, particularly for animal species. Spatial variation in the invertebrates often reflects these primary determinants of ecological variation, although soil or geological differences can be important. Temporal variation relates to the succession after heather burning or cutting. Examples of spatial and temporal variation are drawn from studies on the North York Moors, an upland area with 15% of British ground beetles Carabidae, 20% of British spiders Araneae, but only 2.2% of the British vascular plants. There are many fewer species of vertebrates on upland heaths, but for the breeding birds (15% of British species), three questions are discussed in detail-what is desired, what management options are available and can heathlands be managed for assemblages as well as for individual species? The review concludes that (i) burning on blanket bog be minimized; (ii) variable burning cycles to improve habitat complexity be used; (iii) wet flushes be conserved, (iv) upland heathland margins be burnt less intensively; and (v) scattered mosaics of scrub and woodland be established. The mosaic structure of upland heathlands is critical for wildlife conservation. The invertebrate assemblages rely for their diversity on this mosaic structure. Several scales of mosaic on any one moor are likely to lead to the greatest diversity of vertebrate species.

There were no significant differences in size, height or species number between the inshore and offshore islets studied. On the other hand, the inshore skerries were significantly more luxuriant, and on average one inshore islet contained 4.6 times more breeding pairs than one offshore islet. I conclude that, at their present stage of succession, the barren offshore skerries do not offer any immediate interest for conservation, whereas bird protection in the inshore area could focus on the larid colony islets, where 88% of the local waterbirds on skerries breed, including all pairs of the endangered Scaup and the locally few Mute Swan. Thus conservation priorities should be set on a relevant ecological basis, according to, e.g. differences in species composition between small islets in different archipelago zones and the presence or absence of larid colonies.

Tjernberg, Martin; Johnsson, Kristina; Nilsson, Sven G.				Ornis Fennica	70	3		155-162	1993	1993				English	0	22	Density of the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus maritus was examined and reproductive data collected, both in a forest landscape area (128 km-2) and in a farmland area (123 km-2) with highly fragmented forests (26% forest), in central Sweden during 1985-1990. The composition, age, and the management practices of the forests did not differ in the two areas. We found that the densities (about 0.15 territorial pairs/km-2 of forest land) were the same in the forest area and in the farmland area were highly fragmented forests. Furthermore, we found no differences in the reproductive rate, predation rate, body conditions of the young, or the breeding times between the two areas. The frequency distribution based on the duration in years of the territory occupation was also the same in both areas. We conclude that the Black Woodpecker is not excluded from highly fragmented forests and can successfully breed there, provided that three composition and food supplies are suitable. However, we do not known what the lower limit of fragmentation is for the species. Further studies of the effects of habitat fragmentation on the Black Woodpecker are needed from northern Fennoscandia, where the density is lower than in southern Sweden.

Most shrub-dwelling birds preferred older stands (> 10 yr since last fire) with taller shrubs, or intermediate stands (4 yr since last fire) than recently burned stands (1-2 yr since last fire). Five species were negatively correlated with percent burn in stands burned 1-2 yr previously. The downy woodpecker was most abundant in recently burned areas. Densities of three species of woodpeckers and the northern bobwhite were positively correlated with snag density. The results suggest that extensive burns occurring every 4 yr or less are likely to have a negative influence on shrub-dwelling birds that are a natural component of these coastal communities.

Residency status had no significant relationship with bird numbers between treatments. Of the 26 bird species analyzed, significant yearly variation in numbers was found for 10 species between 1983 and 1984 and six species between 1986 and 1987. Significant treatment effects were shown for 10 species during 1983 and 1984 and 10 species during 1986 and 1987; a tendency was found for higher numbers on uneven-aged stands. Maintenance of a somewhat natural mix of tree species may have reduced possible treatment effects on bird numbers. If managed for maintenance of high tree-species diversity and other wildolfe needs, even- and uneven-aged stands may support similar bird communities.

Warner, R.E.				Biological Conservation	59	1		1-7	1992	1992				English	0	20	The ecology of nesting by grassland passerines was studied from 1976 to 1984 along rural interstate (four-lane) and secondary road rights-of-way in central Illinois (N = 593 nests). Numbers of nests and species increased with roadside width. The probability of nest survival/day on managed (seeded and unmowed) rural secondary roadsides was 0.970. Densities of passerine nests on roadsides were high where forage crops (prime nest cover) were relatively distant from plots, and in years when small grain production was low. The frequency of nesting on rights-of-way was also affected by seeding type and by mowing regime. For example, fescue Festuca spp., the most widely planted roadside vegetation in the Midwest, sustained relatively few breeding birds. The amount of vehicular traffic along secondary roadsides did not influence nest densities. With the expansion of row-crop farming in the Midwestern United States, vegetation along road rights-of-way is critical for sustaining grassland birds that nest in edges and ecotones; roadside should be carefully managed toward this end.

Smith, K.W.; Burges, D.J.; Parks, R.A.				Bird Study	39	2		132-141	1992	1992				English	0	8	To compare the breeding bird communities, counts were made at a total of 408 points in 482 ha of oak plantations and 641 ha of ancient pasture woodlands of the New Forest. Thirty-three species were recorded in each woodland type and the overall breeding bird density was similar in each, with Blue Tit and Chaffinch the most abundant species. Measurements at each point showed significant habitat differences between the 2 woodland types although there was much overlap and, particularly in the plantations, considerable variaton in structure. The habitat variables were used to distinguish those points where the structure was typical of the plantation from those where the structure was more characteristic of the pasture woodlands. Seven species were more numerous in areas where the structure was typical of the plantations (Blue Tit, Chaffinch, Robin, Treecreeper, Coal Tit, Blackbird and Mistle Thrush) and three species (Great Tit, Willow Warbler and Jackdaw) were more numerous in typical pasture woodlands. Estimates of the volume of dead wood were made at each point but, with the possible exception of redstart, no species were found to be strongly associated with this.

Velasquez, C.R.				Colonial Waterbirds	15	1		43-55	1992	1992				English	4	24	Approximately 222 ha of saltmarshes have been reclaimed at the Berg River estuary (32 degree 47'S, 18 degree 10'E), South Africa for the construction of a series of commercial saltpans. The quality of such artificial wetlands as a foraging site for shorebirds and wading birds depends largely on the abundance of benthic macrofauna and their availability to birds which are determined by salinity and water level, respectively. This study examines responses of migrant and resident shorebirds to increased availability of prey and foraging space and how prey quality and season affect this response. The water level of a 11.3 ha saltpan was gradually reduced in November 1988, and again in January and March 1989. The number of bird species foraging increased significantly when the water level was reduced. Variations in response within and between waterbirds species can be attributed to changes in prey composition in the saltpan during successive experiments. Migrant shorebirds responded rapidly to increased prey availability whereas resident shorebirds showed a weak response. In another experiment involving lowering water levels, relatively large waders and shorebirds were attracted to the pan of lower salinity where the benthic macrofauna resembled that of intertidal mudflats in the estuary. Smaller shorebirds were attracted to the higher salinity pan where amphipods and chironomid fly larvae were the most abundant macrofauna. The management of artificial wetlands such as commercial saltpans can increase their value as a foraging site for waterbirds, particularly for migrant shorebirds during periods of high energy requirements.

Ibis	134	3		250-258	1992	1992				English	0	13	Twenty clutches were collected from nests of Fish Eagles Haliaeetus vocifer at Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe, and a small dam nearby in 1989-90. Unaltered DDT, and metabolites DDD and DDE, were found in every egg. Mean levels of .SIGMA.DDT(=DDT+DDD+DDE) generally varied from 14 to 49 mg/kg dry weight per clutch, but 113-223 mg/kg dry weight were found in clutches from the eastern end ot the lake and the mouth of the Sengwa River. .SIGMA.DDT and DDE levels were significantly correlated with the Ratcliffe Index of eggshell thickness. Comparison with museum specimens showed that the Ratcliffe Index has declined by II% since 1936-41 due to a significant fall in shell weight. Eggshell thinning exceeded 20% at the eastern end of the lake. Aerial surveys in 1987 and 1990 found that hatching success along the southern lakeshore exceeded 72%, but chicks were seen in fewer than half the nests at the eastern end. However, the density of breeding pairs was greatest here. Residue levels have increased by about 8% since 1980, rinsing more steeply in areas recently sprayed for tsetse fly control and falling in others. The threat from DDT may now be receding as regional use has declined and will end, tsetse fly control, by 1995. None was used for this purpose in 1991. Mercury levels in adult birds were very high and may pose a significant risk. The breeding population may be limited by availability of safe nest sites. Chicks are sometimes eaten by people. Settlement along the lakeshore is increasing and safe sites are becoming scarcer as dead trees in the lake collapse and large trees onshore are destroyed by elephants.

Journal of Wildlife Management	56	1		23-30	1992	1992				English	1	13	Concern has arisen that forest management practices that create edge (such as clearcutting) are contributing to regional declines in neotropical migrant birds that inhabit forest interiors. Consequently, we studied breeding bird populations in an extensively forested region of southern Missouri (USA) to determine if the numbers of breeding birds differed between areas (n = 9) managed by the clearcutting method (CCM), and areas (n = 9) of mature forest with no recent timber harvest or other disturbances (NOHVST). Three forest interior migrants had lower (P < 0.06) mean densities on CCM sites than NOHVST sites; 3 had greater (P < 0.03) densities on CCM sites; and densities of 3 others did not differ (P > 0.40) between treatments. All early successional migrants had greater (P < 0.01) densities on CCM sites. Numbers of 2 avian nest predators and a brood parasite did not differ (P > 0.20) on CCM and NOHVST sites. Densities of 9 species differed (P < 0.10) among regeneration, sapling, and pole-sawtimber habitats on CCM sites. While clearcutting reduced numbers of forest interior birds that were dependent on mature forest habitats, other forest interior species made extensive use of early and mid-successional even-aged stands and occurred in greater numbers on CCM sites.

Wilson Bulletin	104	1		85-94	1992	1992				English	0	5	The low species richness in grassland bird communities has been hypothesized to results from competition in a simplistic, saturated habitat (Cody) or to result from the periodic occurrence of climatic extremes that prevent drought-susceptible species from perennial settlement (Wiens). Predictions based on these two hypotheses were evaluated using June population estimates on burned and unburned tallgrass prairie over the decade, 1981-1990, on Konza Prairie Research Natural Area, Kansas [USA]. The results of these analyses support the notion that drought tolerance is the primary factor determines membership in the tallgrass prairie community. When drought and fire are coincidental, however, the community does respond in a manner commensurate with saturation hypothesis by a reduction in bird abundances but not a decrease in species richness.

Many species have been declining on farmland over the past 20 years. The most pervasive, yet least studied effect, has operated through a reduction in the birds food supplies as a consequence of increased farm intensification. Three broad landscape changes are described and their impact on birds identified. The effect of declining food resources and the farming practices which bring them about are discussed. The claimed benefits to wildlife of organic farming are outlined and the longer-term prospects for integrating wildlife with farming are considered against various policy initiatives such as Set-aside, the Countryside Premium Scheme and Extensification.

Canadian Field-Naturalist	105	3		346-349	1991	1991				English	1	8	Breeding bird populations were monitored for three years after an October prescribed burn in a fescue grassland near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan [Canada]. Breeding populations of 12 species [Mallard, Anas platyhynchos, Upland Sandpiper, Bartramia longicauda, Eastern Kingbird, Tyrannus tyrannus, Horned Lark Eremophila alpestris, Black-billed Magpie, Pica pica, Sprague's Pipit, Anthus spragueii, Clay-coloured Sparrow, Spizella pallida, Vesper Sparrow, Pooecetes gramineus, Savannah Sparrow, Ammodramus bairdii, Western Meadowlark, Sturnella neglecta, Brewer's Blackbird, Euphagus cyanocephalus] were recorded on 12.9 ha burned plot and an adjacent 5.6 ha unburned plot, each with similar vegetation. The two most common species, Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sanwichensis) and Clay-coloured Sparrow (Spizella pallida) were both adversely affected by the burn. By the third post-burn year, density of Savannah Sparrows was 68% of the value (1.70 pairs/ha) observed in the unburned area, while Clay-coloured Sparrows were only 33% of the density (1.07 pairs/ha) noted in the unburned area. Other important species, Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii) and Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) were adversely affected initially by the burn but by the third year, population densities in the burned and unburned areas were comparable. Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) did not use the burned area in the first year, but as the grassy canopy became reestablished, the burned area was utilized at moderate densities in the second year, and in the third post-burn year densities were identical in burned and unburned areas (0.27 pairs/ha). Only the Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) showed a preference for the burned area in the first year after the burn.

Conservation Biology	5	2		176-188	1991	1991				English	0	9	Birds were censused on habitat islands to investigate the effect of vegetation, island size, and isolation on the density and species diversity of birds. The density of birds was highest on small habitat islands and in islands close to other islands, especially large ones. We suggest that this is because birds on small habitat islands utilize resources from surrounding fields. After compensating for sampling effect (the fact that we made more observations and there are more territories on large islands), we analyzed the species richness of different islands. We found that there are more territorial species (i.e., bird species whose territories are readily mapped) on small than on large islands. We discuss different causes for this findings. We also found that a given area comprised of many small islands contains more speices than the same area comprised of only a few large islands. This is true for both all observed bird species and for all recorded territorial species. We conclude that when considering conservation from a local perspective, it is important to protect all nonmatrix land in this type of landscape. This will ensure a high local diversity.

Fauna (Oslo)	44	1		5-10	1991	1991				Norwegian	0	0	Principles of managing forests for faunal diversity are reviewed within the realm of landscape ecology. Three main stages in the development of forestry in Norway is recognized: (1) the primeval stage of more and less virgin forest (up to c. 1500), (2) the 'natural forest'-stage characterized by small-scaled forestry cutting methods (1500-1950), adn (3) the 'modern forestry'-period, starting with clearcutting practises at c. 1950. It is argued that modern forestry is incomplete in managing biological diversity and that Norwegian forestry should spend 1990's to incorporate landscape ecological principles ('New forestry') in the overall silviculture and forest management. Such principles involve the consideration of: (1) species' area-requirements in relation to the 'grain-size' of the landscape, (2) edge-effects and the consequences of habitat fragmentation, and (3) structural diversity of the landscape mosaic at a hierarchy of spatial scales (.alpha.- and .beta.-diversity).

Aulen, G.				Holarctic Ecology	14	1		68-80	1991	1991				English	0	21	A total of 135 trees were girdled or notched in a forest area close to the river Dalalven in central Sweden. The purpose was to see whether good microhabitats for wood-living insects could be created and if so, could be used as food for the endangered white-backed woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos. The chosen tree species were three of the most frequent used for foraging by the white-backed woodpecker, i.e. aspen Populus tremula, birch Betula alba and common alder Alnus glutinosa. The proces of dying and decay in the manipulated trees was followed for eight to nine years, and the following variables were studied: tree condition, three structure, wood-condition, consistency of bark and cambium, frequency of polypori, foraging marks made by woodpeckers and abundance of insect species of importance as food for woodpeckers. Notched aspen died faster and were more quickly colonized by wood-living insects than were girdled aspen. Since the notched aspen was also reduced more quickly to low stumps or lost their bark, their value for wood-living insects was short-lived. Notched birch died almost as quickly as girdled birch but were populated by slightly fewer insect species. Notching, in general, seemed to create good foraging trees in the short-term whereas girdling produced trees of a longer-term value. In order to improve the local food siutation for the white-backed woodpecker, a combination of the two methods is suggested. Nonetheless, both must be seen as emergency measures and cannot compensate for a large-scale reduction in the abundance of old deciduous trees in the forest.

Journal of Field Ornithology	62	1		97-106	1991	1991				English	0	13	Snags and nest boxes were added to 2-4-yr-old pine plantations in north-central Florida. The International Bird Censusing Method was used to determine abundance, diversity and territory boundaries on three 12-ha replicated, paired treatment and control plots during two consecutive spring breeding seasons. Treatment and control areas were compared in two ways: an analysis of variance was calculated for the total 12-ha plot and for a subplot consisting only of a young pine plantation (8 ha). Twelve bird species were found in young pine plantation subplots. Young pine plantation subplot treatments supported more species (P = 0.0025; df = 1) and had nearly twice as many birds as controls (P = 0.0066; df = 1). There were no significant differences between treatment and control areas when the total plot was analyzed. However, when young pine plantation treatment and control subplots were analyzed separately from the total plot, Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) and Great-crested Flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus were found to use nest boxes and nested in greater numbers in treatments than in controls (P = 0.0105 and P = 0.0020, respectively; df = 1). Snags were used for perching, singing, feeding, nesting, courtship displays and roosting. Presence of snags and nest boxes in 2-4-yr-old plantations encouraged Rufous-sided Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra), Great-crested Flycatchers and Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus) to include higher proportions of young pine plantations in their territories. Flycatchers had larger territories in treatments than in controls (P = 0.0538; df = 1). They expanded their territories to utilize the snags and nest boxes in young pine plantations. Adding snags and nest boxes artificially to young pine plantations seems to be an effective way to enhance young plantations for breeding birds.

Natural Areas Journal	11	1		26-33	January 1991	1991				English	0	4	Most early accounts of pre-Colonial southern forests present a picture of a diverse forest with a variety of tree ages, interspersed with openings. There were many old and decayed trees, down logs, and abundnat mast. The forest were dynamic, changing with plant succession and influenced by numerous other factors such as fire, insects, disease, ice and wind storms, flooding and activities of native Americans. Most early accounts describe a plethora of wildlife in the diverse forests. Bird communities were abundant and diverse, probably with numerous cavity nesters and species associated with mature forests. The passenger pigeon and Carolina parakeet, once abundant and widely distributed in these forests, are extinct today. Early records reveal that the eastern wild turkey was abundant enough to be a food staple for early settlers. The red-cockaded woodpecker was probably abundant in the frequently burned longleaf pine forests of the Southeast. Squirrels and white-tailed deer were abundant in the diverse forests. Deer were a diet staple of native Americans and the hides became a major item of commerce. Large carnivores, such as black bears and cougars, were relatively abundant.

U S Forest Service General Technical Report SE			No. 71	1-7	1991	1991				English	0	0	Biological diversity can be defined as the diversity of life, including the diversity of genes, species, plant and animal communities, ecosystems, and the interaction of these elements. The biodiversity issue arises from educated concern that the earth's diversity of life is threatened and is diminishing at an accelerated rate. An appropriate yardstick for biodiversity programs is how they affect the persistence of viable populations-populations that occur with sufficient gene pools, over large enough areas, with the requisite environments of perpetuate the organisms or ecosystems. Biodiversity is often erroneously understood to mean species diversity within stands or communities: the biodiversity concern is not about the local diversity of flora and fauna, but whether species or ecosystems are threatened. A coordinated program of biodiversity research could be structured under three overlapping subject areas: (1) threatened, endangered, and sensitive species; (2) restoration of missing, underrepresented, or declining communities; and (3) general principles and procedures for ecosystem restoration and perpetuation.

Vogelkundliche Hefte Edertal			No. 17	5-14	1991	1991				German	0	2	All species of birds present on the site of a planned golf course northwest of Waldeck, Germany, were inventoried between May 20 and July 31, 1990. A total of 63 species were identified, 36 of which were breeding birds. In comparison to other predominently agricultural areas, species diversity was very high. While colonization density was relatively high for Redbacked Shrike (Lanius collurio) and Whitethroat (Sylvia communis), bioindicators for ecologically intact hedgerows, several of the species observed are on the Red Lists for Germany, Hesse, and the Waldeck-Frankenberg district. Constriction of the gold course will destroy breeding habitats or adversely affect breeding success of the "seriously endangered" Quail (Coturnix coturnix), the Great Gray Shrike (Lanius excubitor), a species "threatened with extinction," the Grasshopper Warbler (Locustella naevia), and the Marsh Warbler (Acrocephalus palustris). Even if structural diversity of the site is preserved, which, however, will not be the case, the noise alone from golfers, traffic, and frequent lawn mowing will have a negative impact on the birds of the area. Construction of the golf course the seems unjustifiable from the ecological viewpoint; botanical and ornithological species diversity distinguish this relatively undisturbed site and make it worthy of protection.

Marone, Luis				Revista Chilena de Historia Natural	63	2		187-195	Agosto 1990	1990				English	0	3	A fire in the Monte Desert brought about an abrupt decrease in grass cover and the subsequent invasion by forbs. This led bird species that fed on seeds an buds on the ground to segregate spatially between burned and unburned sites (while there was food in the burned habitat). Owing to the disappearance of food resources from the burned sites, four bird guilds withdrew from those sites, while the generation of new resources led to the selection of the burned habitat by two guilds scarcely represented in the unburned area. These modifications in habitat use brought about a decrease in local bird diversity and an increase in regional bird diversity. The structural simplification of the habitat in burned sites may account for the decrease in local diversity, according to the theory of habitat selection. The increase in regional diversity may be a consequence of the complementary spatial distributions between burned and unburned areas of species belonging to different guilds (either stressed or favored by the disturbance). The intermediate disturbance hypothesis explains satisfactorily the increase in regional bird diversity after the fire.

American Midland Naturalist	123	1		64-74	1990	1990				English	0	6	The vegetation and avian communities of a site consisting of oak/palmetto scrub and disturbed oak scrub were characterized. Nearly half of the oak/palmetto scrub was intentionally burned midway through the study. The prescribed fire altered avian community composition for at least 6 months in areas where nearly all the vegetation burned. Twenty years after clearing of an area of oak/palmetto scrub, the regenerated oak-scrub habitat differed from adjacent oak/palmetto scrub in having more bare ground (15.5 vs. 0.8%), a taller shrub layer (272 vs. 161 cm) composed primarily of oak species without saw palmetto and more herbaceous species (11 vs. 3). Compared with oak/palmetto scrub, disturbed oak scrub had more breeding bird species that were abundant enough to allow density estimation (8 vs. 4) and supported a higher density of the Florida scrub jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens), a threatened subspecies. These data suggest that disturbed areas can represent important wildlife habitat in scrub-dominated landscapes, but because effects of mechanical disturbance last for very long periods, the use of mechanical disturbance as a habitat management tool should be applied cautiously.

Dunning, J.B., Jr; Watts, B.D.				Auk	107	3		463-472	1990	1990				English	0	3	Bachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) has declined over much of its range in the last fifty years. To understand the role of habitat loss in this decline, we examined patterns of habitat occupancy by this species in two areas of South Carolina [USA]. At both sites we recorded relatively high densities of breeding sparrows in mature (> 80 yr old) pine stands, and relatively low densities in young pine stands. Habitat occupancy varied between sites in clearcuts and middle-aged pine stands. Sparrows used areas with open understories and dense ground covers of grasses and forbs. Habitat occupancy differed between the two main study areas because these preferred vegetation characteristics were found in different habitats in the two areas. Timber management practices (especially burning rotations, site-preparation techniques, and thinning) have a strong effect on understory vegetation and, therefore, habitat suitability for the sparrow. Management practices that produce suitable habitat for Re-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) also provide habitat for Bachman's Sparrow. We believe that, even though the sparrow may use open habitats that appear to be relatively common, its habitat requirements are relatively strict, and that habitat loss may be an important factor in this species' population decline.

Bird Study	37	2		133-141	1990	1990				English	0	3	In view of the 25% loss of native pine woodland in Scotland during the period 1950 to 1986, bird communities breeding in native Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) forest at Abernethy, Scotland, are described from species densities estimated by point count methods and individual species densities were compared across gradients of habitat identified by ordination techniques. Thirty-five bird species were recorded with a total density of 29.9 individuals ha-1 of which 8 species, Goldcrest, Chaffinch, Spotted Flycatcher, Coal Tit, Crested Tit, Siskin, Tree-creeper and Redstart, constituted 85% of numbers. Detrended correspondence analysis which was used to ordinate vegetation at point count locations from which 14 groups of bird counts were analysed across the habitat gradients. Two axes, representing increasing openness of canopy (axis I) and decreasing shrubbiness (axis II), were identified. Total bird density declined significantly with openness of canopy and increased significantly with increasing (a) pine density, (b) maximum tree height, (c) frequency of dead woods on the ground and in the canopy. Crested Tit, Goldcrest, and Coal Tit showed species-habitat correlations. Crested Tit density for axis I was positively correlated with the frequency of dead wood in the canopy. Only Crested Tit showed a habitat association with vegetation variables from axis II: density declined with an increase in percentage cover of the 0.3-1.0 m shrub layer. The management implications of these findings are discussed.

The combined density of secondary cavity-nesting birds did not decline in either year by a greater proportion on the treatment plot than on a control plot, indicating that cavities were not limiting. In habitats where timber management has not substantially reduced availability of natural cavities, managers should not assume nest site limitation; natural nest site availability should be evaluated before implementing nestbox programs designed to increase populations of secondary cavity-nesting birds.

Ochrona Przyrody			No. 47	215-233	1990	1990				Polish	0	0	Within the area of 136 km2 in the Narew river valley between Suraz and Tykocin (North-eastern Poland) 125 breeding pairs of Luscinia svecica cyanecula were recorded. In this number 97 pairs occurred in the not drained marshy part of the valley from Suraz to Zoltki (density 101 pairs per 100 km2), where they occupied only edges of the alder swamp-forests Carici elongatae-Alnetum (density on these habitats: 1.8 to 9.1 pairs per 10 ha). In the drained part of the valley from Zoltki to Tykocin 29 pairs were recorded, but all of them concentrated on marshes which had remained after the drainage. In this part of the study area willow thickets Salici Franguletum were the only occupied type of habitat (density 8.5 pairs per 10 ha). Bluethroat turned out to be a species closely connected with the ecotone which forms at the junction line between wet forests or thickets and open marshes. Its breeding is conditioned by moderately high level of water above the ground surface, and at the same time the existence of dry places which enable nesting. A hypothesis has been put forward, supported with results of studies from other in North-eastern Poland, that at least in a part of Central Europe the alder swamp-forest Carici elongatae-Alnetum in its early stage of succession is the primary habitat of bluethroat. At the same time some shrub communities and other flooded sites are its secondary habitats, which became accessible due to hydrological changes produced by human management.

Monkkonen, M.				Oikos	57	3		281-288	1990	1990				English	2	4	To test the idea that the wide amplitude of environmental variation in the north keeps northern bird populations, guilds and communities far below the level of the carrying capacity, I conducted a removal experiment near Oulu, northern Finland, in two study plots of about 7 ha in size. In 1987, plot I was the experimental plot, and II the control. In 1988 the roles of the plots were reversed. All the birds captured in mist-nets were removed from the experimental plot, banded and released. On the control plot they were just banded and released. Several biometrical measurements were taken in the field from every bird captured. On both plots the removal caused a significant increase in the number of individuals captured and in capture rate (ind/100-net-hours) as compared with the control year results on the same plot. The removal also resulted in a decreasing trend in the course of experiments in tarsus and wing length when detected across all species. These trends became more pronounced after the identified females had been omitted from the data. The results suggest that breeding numbers in northern migrant bird populations are limited by territoriality. Furthermore, it is suggested that northern bird populations, guilds and communities may track environmental variation because of existence of floating populations, flexible breeding strategies, and non-synchronic population declines. Therefore, competition both within and among populations may occur more commonly than usually thought.

Raivio, S.; Haila, Y.				Ornis Fennica	67	3		73-83	1990	1990				English	0	2	We studied the significance of successional forest mosaics, created by modern forestry, for forest birds by censusing breeding birds during three summers in 12 study areas with variable habitat composition and configurations and in a reference area of old forest. The number of bird species relative to sample size did not differ significantly between the silvicultural mosaics and old forest. However, in the silvicultural mosaics the total bird abundance was only about one third of that in the reference area. The relative abundances of different species also differed considerably. We divided the bird species into five groups on the basis of their observation frequencies and the way in which they used the silvicultural mosaics. The mosaics provided nesting habitats for the most common forest birds and for species favouring open habitats and forest edges. All other forest species visited the mosaics more or less irregularly.

Australian Journal of Ecology	14	1		41-54	1989	1989				English	0	2	THe bird community of a forested 13 ha plot was studied for 3 years, during which the plot was burnt by wildfire and was severely drought-affected. The combined effects of fire and drought were surprisingly limited. Similar numbers of species were recorded in each year and differences in species composition involved only rare visitors to the plot. Colour-banding indicated population declines in at least six resident species. The greatest decline was that of the Brown Thornbill (Acanthiza pusilla), from 20 pairs to 10 pairs. In general, insectivorous birds were most abundant and widespread on the plot during the first year, before the fire. In contrast, nomadic birds feeding on flowers or fruits were most abundant in the second year, when there was a prolific flowering and fruting of several important food plants. After the fire, at least ten bird species avoided the burnt ridges and became more concentrated in the unburnt gullies. Most were species associated with dense shrub thickets, the layer of vegetation most affected by the fire. It seems that gullies are major refuge areas in these forests and are the key to the resilience of the bird community to fire and drought.

Braithwaite, L.W.; Austin, M.P.; Clayton, M.; Turner, J.; Nicholls, A.O.				Biological Conservation	50			33-50	1989	1989				English	0	6	We examined the relationship between the number of bird species and environment within 500,000 ha of eucalypt forests in south-eastern New South Wales, Australia. Birds were surveyed at 39 sites within 31 eucalypt communities, which were, in turn, scored by altitude, temperature, rainfall, basal areas of trees and levels of the nutrients, nitrogen phosphorus, potassium and magnesium in the eucalypt foliage. Ninety bird species were recorded. Numbers per site, averaged over the whole sample period, ranged between 20 and 38 over all surveys, 24 and 42 in 'summer' (October to March) when migrant species were present, and 13 and 38 in 'winter' (April to September). A forward stepwise Poisson regression model was used to fit bird species richness to the environmental variables. Over all surveys and in 'summer', foliar magnesium and tree basal area (including the basal area of dead trees) were significantly (positive) correlated with the number of bird species. In 'winter' the correlations were with altitude and temperature (both negative), presumably the result of emigration of species that avoid cold weather, and tree basal area (positive). The positive association of number of species over all surveys and in 'summer' with tree basal area, including dead trees, and foliar magnesium may index the level of forest maturity and productivity. Forest management directed solely to timber production reduces the basal area and the number of dead trees and may thereby reduce bird species richness permanently. A methodology is offered, based on the relationship between the physical environment and the more productive eucalypt communities, for determining forest areas containing the most species of birds.

Condor	90	1		61-71	1988	1988				English	1	19	Breeding densities of secondary (i.e., nonexcavating) cavity-nesting birds are often assumed to be limited by availability of nest sites. We investigated this assumption for species breeding in northern Arizona's ponderosa pine forests. In 1979, we installed nest boxes on three treatment plots that differed in habitat structure and monitored breeding densities of six species through the 1983 breeding season. The effect of nest boxes was evaluated by comparing breeding densities on three treatment plots from 1980 to 1983 with: (1) pretreatment densities (1973 to 1975, 1979), and (2) densities on control plots from 1980 to 1983. We observed variation in the importance of nest-site limitation among treatment plots and species. Overall breeding densities (all species combined) increased significantly on only two treatment plots. Individual species' responses were influenced by habitat structure, and breeding densities of only three species were apparently limited by nest sites before boxes were installed; Violet-green Swallows (Tachycineta thalassina), Pygmy Nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea), and Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana). A given species' breeding density in northern Arizona is nest-site limited if it is locally common and reliant on dead trees for nest sites. Availability of food or foraging substrate and territoriality may determine an upper limit to breeding densities if nest sites are in ample supply. [Other species discussed include Sitta carolinensis, Troglodytes aedon, and Parus gambeli].

Condor	90	2		339-348	1988	1988				English	0	5	For the first time, the effect of mechanical clearing of a native ohia/koa (Metrosideros polymorpha)/(Acacia koa) forest has been determined on some Hawaiian birds. Counts conducted on Keauhou Ranch, Island of Hawaii, at 6-month intervals, from December 1977/January 1978 through June/July 1983, showed that species richness and bird abundance were lower in the mechanically cleared or treated plots than on an adjacent control plot. In the treated plots, the nonnative Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), and the Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea) were found in higher abundance than native species and they also were the first to recolonize following treatment. The most successful recolonizing species in the treated plots was the Japanese White-eye. Although endangered forest passerines were present in the adjacent control plot, they were not found in the treated plots. Seasonal differences in the number of birds detected in the treated plots were only observed for the native Apapane (Himatione sanguinea); it was found in high numbers following initial clearing, but subsequently declined, remaining stable through the study period.

McFarland, D.				Emu	88	4		249-257	1988	1988				English	1	11	A total of 54 bird species was recorded in the subtropical heathlands of Cooloola National Park, Queensland. The composition of the bird community and the numbers of birds present in any given heathland appeared to be dependent on the years since the last fire. Thirty-nine species were inconsistent user of the habitat. Some of these species were migrants while others were either irregular visitors occurring throughout the year or predictable visitors that take advantage of specific short-lived abundances of food (e.g. carrion after fires or the annual production of nectar or seeds). The longer a heathland was unburnt the smaller the number of inconsistent species recorded visiting that heathland. Of the 15 bird species consistently using the heathlands, 12 were breeding residents, including the Ground Parrot and Southern Emu-wren. The variable patterns of post-fire recolonisation exhibited by the consistent species was attributed to the changing structure of the preferred microhabitats and the availability of food. A minimum seven to eight year fire-free interval is suggested if viable populations of most resident species are to be maintained.

Raphael, M.G.; Morrison, M.L.; Yoder-Williams, M.P.				Condor	89	3		614-626	1987	1987				English	0	8	We summarized breeding bird censuses done from 1966 to 1985 on two Sierra Nevada forest plots, one that was burned in 1960 and an adjacent, unburned control. Our objective was to examine yearly trends in bird abundance in relation to changing vegetation structure and composition and in relation to yearly weather variation. From 1969 to 1983 shrub cover on the burned plot increased from about 22% to over 43%, and density of overstory trees increased by about 50%. Herb and grass cover decreased during this period, as did density of snags originally resulting from the fire. During this period of rapid postfire succession, total density of birds was nearly equal on the two plots but species richness increased on the burned plot compared with the unburned plot. Ground- and brush-foraging birds were more numerous on the burned plot, and their population size increased significantly from 1966 to 1985. Foliage-searching birds were more numerous on the unburned plot, and their populations were stable over time relative to the burned plot. In contrast, numbers of foliage-searching birds increased significantly on the burned plot. Bark-gleaning birds declined on the burned plot, probably in response to loss of snags used for nesting by most of these species. Variations in weather, as indicated by measures of temperature and precipitation, did not explain yearly variations in bird populations. Rather, changing vegetation structure resulted in predictable trends related to the foraging and nesting habits of the birds we studied.

One part of the forest has been intensively grazed for years. The second part was grazed for the first time in 1983. A lower density was found in the grazed plot compared to the ungrazed plot. All bird species reduced their densities, with the exception of two pioneer species, Anthus trivalis and Emberiza citrinella, which had their greatest densities in the grazed area. The diversity of the bird species (H') was slightly greater in the grazed area than in the ungrazed area. The bird density in the formerly ungrazed area was reduced by 46% (adjusted for control plot) after one year of grazing. All species present reduced their densities. A significant difference was found in the composition of birds in the ungrazed plot compared to the grazed plot. The difference was not significant after one year of grazing in the ungrazed plot.

A total of 31 plant species comprising nine trees, 14 shrubs and eight climbers and 40 bird species were identified. Higher species richness and abundance of birds were recorded at the edge of the scrub than in the interior. This is explained with reference to edge effect. More birds visited Wolf Hill from October to February than in other months which may be correlated with the abundance of insects and availability of fruits. Ring dove had the highest density of 1123 birds per sq. km and granivorous birds contributed 51% of the total bird biomass. Impact of fire wood cutting on three bird species is discussed.

Five species were more abundant on shrubby transects. Availability of woody nesting substrates best explained differences in bird species abundances. Differences in shrub coverages between transects were probably the result of different land-use practices.

Colonial Waterbirds	9	2		196-202	1986	1986				English	0	2	The typical traditional Dutch grassland polder is a flat, open space, cut into squares by a maze of ditches and canals. It has a high water table and sometimes even winter inundations, hence no trees or buildings, which are found along the edges. Owing to a rare combination of soil, climate, hydrology, and management, these moist but fertile artificial prairies hold high densities (up to over 100 pairs/km2) of six species of shorebirds, known as 'meadow birds.' This situation is now being changed with improved drainage, increased fertilization, early mowing, and higher cattle densities. Meadow-bird reserves can be recreated by imitating traditional methods and by keeping high water tables using dams and sluices. Meadow-bird management can be encouraged, for example, by financial compensation to private farmers for late mowing. Technically, we know how our meadow-bird populations can be preserved and managed; keeping them is mostly a political and financial matter. Despite some examples of very successful meadow reserves, Dutch meadow-bird populations are steadily declining.

Data were collected in paired samples on 80 species of birds from January 1983 to May 1984. The CA provided more habitat requirements for more individuals and species of birds throughout the year than the BA. Nonresidents used highly seasonal food sources that were little used by resident species. The BA was an adequate foraging area only during the spring and did not offer the same variety of vegetation types as the CA. Fire was found to decrease bird species richness in coastal sage scrub, unlike the pattern found in chaparral bird communities.

Sedgwick, J.A.; Knopf, F.L.				Journal of Wildlife Management	50	2		247-252	1986	1986				English	0	3	Densities of, and potential nesting substrates for, cavity-nesting birds were examined in a mature plains cottonwood (Populus argentii) community in northeastern Colorado [USA]. Although snag (dead tree) densities were low (0.66/ha), the cavity-nesting guild included 7 species with densities .ltoreq. 463 birds/100ha. This finding suggests that cavity nesters are not limited by snag densities. Most (94.2%) of the nest substrate for cavity-nesting birds was provided by live trees with large, dead limbs (.gtoreq. 10 cm in diam). Both total dead limb length and the number of trees with dead limbs were highly correlated (P < 0.001) with the number of cavities excavated. Large trees (> 55 cm in diam at breast ht [dbh]) and dead limbs 15-30 cm in diameter were preferred for cavity excavation. Because snags were a minor component of potential nest substrate, snag management may not be a useful concept for cavity-nesting birds in cottonwood bottomlands, and snag retention aspects of habitat models would be relatively unimportant for this forest type.

Swallow, S.K.; Gutierrez, R.J.; Howard, R.A., Jr				Journal of Wildlife Management	50	4		576-583	1986	1986				English	0	4	Current recommendations for snag management, which focus on characteristics of individual snags or stocking levels in forests managed for timber production, not only obscure the importance of forest characteristics surrounding a potential nesting site but also fail to meet the management objectives or abilities of the small landowner. During the summers of 1978 and 1979, a random sample of 816 snags (standing dead trees) was studied in central New York [USA]. Sixty-seven percent of the sample was in mature maple (Acer spp.)-ash (Fraxinus spp.)-elm (Ulmus spp.), the remainder was in 2nd growth woodland. A set of 21 characteristics of snags and 19 characteristics of forest sites was analyzed to determine which best predicted bird use. Use was defined as the presence of .gtoreq. 1 bird cavity in a snag or a forest site. Forest characteristics were sampled in randomly located 0.049-ha circles (N=61) in 1979. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that forest characteristics (total snag basal area, tree species diversity, and number of tree species) were more reliable predictors of bird use than were snag characteristics (diameter at breast height [dbh], amount of bark, height, and species). Snag management based on selecting suitable forest sites and on maintaining or creating suitable snags within those sites is recommended. Use of logistic regression models by field managers is discussed.

Emu	85	4		213-230	1985	1985				English	0	12	Bird populations were estimated from 1977 to 1979 by mapping territories and by an" area search" methods in stands of differing age (regenerating after wildfire or harvesting eucalypts) in the Victorian Central Highlands mainly near Toolangi. The aims were to assess effects of harvesting (followed by burning and artificial regeneration) and provide data on populations and ecology of birds inhabiting this distinctive forest type. Mountain Ash forests grow in high rainfall areas and the trees can reach heights of 100 m; they usually grow as even-aged stands and 79% of Mountain Ash forests in the Central Highlands has regenerated after severe fires in 1939. About 65 species of birds were found to be regular inhabitants of Mountain Ash forests and associated plant communities. All except the Pink Robin breed also in foothill gullies. Several species that are common in drier foothill forests, were absent from Mountain Ash forests. The commonest species were those that feed in the dense shrub layer or from damp ground below. Some insectivorous birds that were abundant in summer (e.g. Golden Whistler Pachycephala pectoralis, Grey Fantail Rhipidura fuliginosa) left Mountain Ash forests for the winter. Winter food sources were limited and the most important were blossoms of Mountain Correa Correa lawrenciana, invertebrates in damp leaf litter, and invertebrates or carbohydrate exudates from hanging bark of Mountain Ash or branches and trunks of Silver Wattle Acacia dealbata. Habitats and interactions between various bird species are described. Bird population densities were low in the first three years after harvesting but some species were confined to open stands of this age. Other forest birds returned rapidly as eucalypts and understorey species regenerated. Populations were as high in 39-year-old regrowth as in older stands though some species (mainly those tht need tree hollows for nesting) were more common in older forest. Implications for management are discussed.

Osborne, P.				Journal of Applied Ecology	22	3		681-691	1985	1985				English	1	8	(1) The appearance of the British farming landscape has been drastically altered over the last decade by the death and felling of elm trees. This paper attempts to assess the effect of this on bird numbers, distributions and territory sizes on a farm in Dorset, England. (2) Comparison of bird numbers with an index for unaffected farms showed significant differences, but not in the expected direction if elm death is detrimental. (3) There were few indications that elm death caused birds to redistribute among hedges. Conversely, elm felling had a far greater impact and affected species in relation to their use of dead elms. (4) Elm death increased the size of chaffinch territories but not of the other five species examined. However, after elm felling, the territories of great and blue tits were also larger. (5) Elm death alone is probably not of great significance to most bird species (with some notable exceptions), but felling causes reductions in numbers and species diversity. Some species may be more sensitive to operations incidental to felling, e.g. accidental damage to live trees or ditch clearance. (6) The question of how farmland birds react to habitat change is complicated by the interaction of habitat choice and population levels which is poorly understood. In particular, the contribution of breeding success in hedgerows to overall population levels, and to what extent hedgerow populations are maintained by recruitment from elsewhere, deserve special attention.

Nilsson, S.G.; Bjorkman, C.; Forslund, P.; Hoglund, J.				Oecologia (Berlin)	66	4		516-521	1985	1985				English	0	2	Bird densities were estimated on 41 small islands and 2 mainland plots at a South Swedish lake both in 1976 and 1983. In the latter year, 3 additional plots were also censused. The ratio between combined densities of hole-nesting birds on the mainland and on islands was 3:1 both in plots without and with nest boxes. In plots with boxes combined densities of hole-nesting birds doubled compared with control plots. This increase was caused by a tenfold increase of pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. Territories of this species were on average established about a week later on the islands compared with the mainland. Furthermore, 50% of the males on the islands did not attract a female. Densities of great tit Parus major, marsh tit P. palustris and nuthatch Sitta europaea were unaffected by increased nesthole availability. For P. major this result contrasts with those in other studies. The density of chaffinch Fringilla coelebs in habitats with similar height and vertical structure was 2 times higher on the islands compared to the mainland. The density was the same on islands with only 1 pair and on those with 2 or more pairs. In spring, there were no significant differences between islands and the mainland in the proportion of leaves with insect feeding traces. The proportion of Salix leaves with feeding traces increased with island size, but this was not so for Alnus and Betula leaves. In late summer, the proportion of leaves with feeding traces were halved inside a plot with nest boxes and hence increased bird densities compared to a nearby control plot. This result was the same along the lake shore and about 150 m away from the shore. The discussion centers on the effect of man on the food- and nest site-availability of hole-nesting birds, food limitation of insectivorous birds and density compensation on islands.

They have assessed its distribution, status and ecological preferences during the reproductive period, aiming at a better knowledge of this bird, in view of its effective conservation in the future. The species seems to be strictly associated with old forests of Pinus laricio and numbers approximately 2000 pairs in total; such a low value stresses once more the need for protection of this small population, as well as a correct management of its natural biotope. Among the limiting factors playing an important role, the following ones should be mentioned: the predation on pulli by the Great Spotted Woodpecker Picoides major; the pine forest fires and tree felling which lead to the alteration and contraction of the habitat, a decrease in numbers and even the disappearance of the Nuthatch from portions of its former range.

Foliage height diveristy was not significantly correlated with avian community structure, while relative humidity showed significant positive correlation with species richness. Food resources for leaf-litter foragers and woodpeckers that forage extensively into dead tree trunks and branches may be intimately tied to atmospheric moisture. Such a relationship would indicate that the correlation with species richness is directly with food supply and only indirectly with relative humidity. Atmospheric moisture may be a useful indicator of avian community within geographically and structurally similar deciduous woodlands.

One of the aims of the revegetation program is to promote the return of faunal species which inhabited areas prior to mining. The extent to which bird species utilize revegetated bauxite minesites is discussed. It was shown that revegetated areas as young as 4-5 yr can support similar bird species numbers, densities and diversities as unmined forest. Avifaunal populations occupying any rehabilitated area depend largely on the rehabilitation technique used. Factors which may be used to increase further avifaunal utilization of minesites are discussed. The effects of jarrah dieback and fire on forest birds are compared with results for bauxite mined areas. From this, it is possible to assess the combined impact of dieback, fire and mining on long-term conservation of jarrah forest bird species.

Howe, R.W.				Ecology (Washington D C)	65	5		1585-1601	1984	1984				English	0	9	Small isolated forest patches (0.1-7 ha) in eastern New South Wales and southern Wisconsin were surveyed regularly for at least 1 yr between 1977 and 1981. Forests and woodlands in both regions have been cleared extensively during the past century. This analysis examines how fragmentation of forest habitat has affected composition and dynamics of local bird assemblages. Species in forest islands are compared with those in equivalent "control plots" near the edge of a large, continuous forest. Disruption of continuous tracts apparently affects not only birds of the forest interior, but also those occurring along or near the edge. Birds in New South Wales and Wisconsin show common patterns of distribution among forest islands, despite considerable differences in taxonomic relationships, seasonality, and habitat. Area was the best predictor of species richness in islands and control plots. Other habitat variables (except isolation) were relatively uniform among sites and did not contribute consistently to variation in numbers of species. Species common in forest islands also tended to be common in large nearby forests, but bird assemblages in forest islands were statistically different from those in forest control plots. Species assemblages in forest islands generally were more predictable over space and time than were local assemblages in larger forests. Although transients or regular visitors commomly were observed in forest islands, nonresident species occurred even more frequently in control plots. Apparently habitat fragmentation alters the spatial and temporal dynamics of native forest bird communities. This, in turn, may favor some species and leave others at a disadvantage. Differences between species assemblages of forest islands and control plots were most pronounced in Wisconsin. Numbers of forest or forest edge species were much lower in Wisconsin forest islands than in corresponding control plots.

Utschick, H.				Journal fuer Ornithologie	125	1		39-57	1984	1984				German	0	1	The results from grid mapping of the breeding bird community on 6.25 ha units in the Lauterbacher Wald, southern Bavaria, in 1980 and 1982 offer possibilities for using bird species as a bioindicator for local changing environments because of variation in their abundance and dispersal patterns. If all species were neglected, which show only small variations or increasing/decreasing abundances due to weather conditions in the survey area or due to changing environments in southern wintering areas, treecreeper, coal tit and song thrush remain. They may be indicators for the enrichment of dead trees in the forest, respectively, for changing tree species composition in an ecological positive way. The influence of different check time during fieldwork by mapping 1 grid unit in different years must be considered when interpreting the results. Complementing current atlas work (i.e., with a 100 km2 grid) for estimating the population dynamics of rare species an additional census is proposed, which may give quantitative results for all species abundant or widely distributed. For these species until now only unimportant qualitative dispersal patterns can be evaluated. By a time sparing grid mapping every year (1 or more areas of 1 km2 in each 100 km2 square of the atlas grid) using 6.25 ha units (10 min/unit), relative abundances or grid frequencies (6.25 ha grid) may be used for the evaluation of population indices both for local survey areas and for countries.

Niemi, G.J.; Manowski, J.M.				Journal of Wildlife Management	48	2		438-443	1984	1984				English	0	4	Habitat and breeding bird populations were examined in logged areas of northern Minnesota [USA]. A gradient of habitat complexity was related with increasing density and basal area of dead trees, live trees and shrubs. The combined densities of 26 breeding species ranged from 3.9 in the least complex habitat to 8.6 territorial males/ha in the most complex. The chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica), mourning warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) and song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) represented an average of 75% of the individuals on the eight plots. Only the density of the chestnut-sided warbler was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with the habitat gradient; the song sparrow was negatively correlated (P < 0.05). Management for greater habitat complexity provides more opportunities for nesting and foraging and results in greater species richness and density of birds breeding in early successional vegetation.

The mapping method has been used on a 33 ha. wide area, placed in a large farm, close to the Tirrenian coast, north of the mouth of the Tevere River (41.degree. 51'N, 12.degree. 12'E). I have examined the structural and dimensional characters of the reed-bed, before and after a fire, pointing out some remarkable differnces. Species [21] in 1982 and 23 in 1983 have been censused; Reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), Great Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and Cetti's Warbler (Cettia cetti) show the highest density in both years. The difference between the first and the second year is significant as far as total density (.SIGMA.d - 15%) is concerned; it has been probably caused by the burning of the reed-bed. The values of biomass result high according to the high productivity of wetlands. No other datum shows significant differences between 1982 and 1983.

Engstrom, R.T.; Crawford, R.L.; Baker, W.W.				Wilson Bulletin	96	3		437-450	1984	1984				English	2	13	For 15 yr after fire exclusion in 1966, annual breeding bird censuses were conducted on an 8.6-ha plot of oldfield pine forest in norther Florida [USA]. Changes in vegetation structure were assessed using data from plant succession studies and by taking 0.04-ha circular samples within the study area 15 yr after fire exclusion and in a contiguous annually burned oldfield forest. Using rarefaction, a statistical technique, annual bird species totals for this study were compared to bird species richness in nearby old-growth longleaf pine and mature beech-magnolia forests. Changes in the bird community and vegetation structure were dramatic. Only 11 of 43 bird species were encountered every year of the study. Most finches and brush nesting species no longer occur on the study area while several species associated with mesic conditions have increased in abundance.

Blake, J.G.				Journal of Wildlife Management	46	2		404-415	1982	1982				English	1	4	Nonbreedig bird communities were censused on burned and unburned study plots in ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) habitat of Prescott National Forest, Yavapai County, Arizona [USA]. Logging had occurred on 2 burned and 2 unburned plots. Forty-nine species of birds were recorded during fall, winter and spring. Twenty-eight species were recorded on burned, and 38 spp. on unburned plots. During all seasons, more species were restricted to unburned study plots; more species on unburned sites occurred on only 1 site. Species composition on different areas was related to foraging substrate availability and to season. Habitat alterations caused by fire and by logging appeared to have a similar influence on many components of avian communities. Patterns observed during nonbreeding seasons paralleled, in many instances, response of breeding season communities to similar habitat changes.

Castrale, J.S.				Journal of Wildlife Management	46	4		945-952	1982	1982				English	0	9	Determination of breeding-bird densities 3-4 yr after sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) control in central Utah [USA] revealed varied responses by bird species. Although total densities and species richness were similar among sites (81-109 territories/km2 of 4-6 spp.), the burned site contained 50-86% fewer Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri) territories than the chained and 17-yr-old plowed sites. THe vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) and western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), both grassland birds, were not noticeably affected by sagebrush control. Horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) densities were 1.8-2.8 .times. greater on the recently treated sites. The sage thrasher (Oreoscoptes montanus) was only found in habitat patches containing the largest shrubs. Nesting requirements best explained the patterns of distribution and responses observed. Bird species diversity can be maximized by treating sagebrush areas in narrow (100 m) strips and maintaining blocks of mature sagebrush.

Freedman, B.; Beauchamp, C.; McLaren, I.A.; Tingley, S.I.				Canadian Field-Naturalist	95	3		307-311	1981	1981				English	0	7	Effects of forestry practices on the breedig birds of a hardwood forest in Nova Scotia were studied. Total breeding density on 3 uncut control plots was (.times. .+-. SD) 663 .+-. 145 pairs/km2. Total breeding densities on 3 plots clear-cut 3-5 yr earlier were somewhat lower (588 .+-. 155 pairs/km2), as were the densities on 1 thinned plot (550 pairs/km2) and on 2 strip-cut plots (475 and 575 pairs/km2), but differences between treatment were not statistically significant. Marked differences occurred in the species composition of the bird communities in the various plots. The most important breeding species on the control plots were least flycatcher (Empidonax minimus) and ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus). In the clear-cut plots the bird community was dominated by chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) and white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). The species mixtures of the thinned and strip-cut plots were intermediate between those of the control and clear-cut plots.

Transects and plots (64) were sampled seasonally in 1976. Species richness was greatest in the woodland type and least in the cropland; 2 pasture types and a meadow type were intermediate. Bird densities also were greatest in the woodland type followed by the meadow. Species frequenting aquatic habitats were important in the seasonally wet meadow type. Various habitat features and land management practices, which greatly influence bird populations, are discussed.

Zoologicheskii Zhurnal	60	10		1542-1552	1981	1981				Russian	0	2	The communities of burned out forests differ from the initial ones by the species composition, set of dominants, ration of layer groups; and trophic structure. The spreading of burns overvast spaces results in the rearrangement of distribution of many mammalian and avian species. The fires change zoogeographical ratios in the faunas of different regions and, in particular, favor the expansion of the European fauna and limit the distribution of the Siberian [USSR] elements. Changes in the animal population induced by the fires were characterized by a cyclic pattern initially. The mass felling of forests made these processes irreversible.

Journal of Wildlife Management	44	4		787-797	1980	1980				English	0	12	The use of standing dead trees, or snags, by birds was investigated in the Douglas-fir (P. menziesii) region of western Oregon in spring and summer, 1975 and 1976. Snags were examined in Douglas-fir forests approximately 10, 35, 75, 110 and 200+ yr of age. The use of snags was quantified on the basis of evidence of past and present use by hole-nesting birds. Hole-nesting birds used Douglas-fir snags over 60 cm in dbh [diameter at breast height] and over 15 m tall for foraging and nesting; these snags usually had broken tops, few or no branches, decayed sapwood and heartwood, and less than 100% bark cover. Snags of this size and type occurred primarily in forests over 110 yr of age; the use of snags by hole-nesting birds was concentrated in older forests (> 110 yr old). Bird censuses were conducted in 1 representative area from each forest age-class. Density and species diversity of hole-nesting birds increased with forest age. Density of hole-nesting birds was positively correlated (r = 0.98, P < 0.05) with mean dbh of snags. The intensive management of Douglas-fir forests does not allow for the production or retention of large snags. A reduction in the number of large snags could reduce populations of hole-nesting birds. Possible means for retaining and producing large snags are discussed.

Condor	80	4		431-441	1978	1978				English	0	5	Avian species composition and densities in a mixed-coniferous virgin forest and in a similar area that sustained a moderately heavy overstory removal form of timber harvesting were examined in the White Mountains in Arizona [USA] during the summers of 1973 and 1974. The unlogged plot supported significantly (P < 0.05) more individuals than did the logged plot (88.9 birds/40 ha more in 1973; 153.5 birds/40 ha more in 1974). The harvested plot supported far fewer tree-foliage searching species. Timber-gleaning species and those that nest in foliage were significantly denser in the unlogged plot. The effect on cavity nesters depended largely on their foraging behavior. Mountain chickadees, which usually nest in snag cavities and forage mainly on live vegetation and bark, were significantly less abundant in the logged plot; woodpeckers which forage on both live and dead trees were equally abundant in both plots. Aerial foragers and birds that used slash, benefited by the lumbering. This selective logging led to an increase in tree species diversity, and no appreciable change in diversity of foliage height, tree volume or bird species. The modified plot, while containing approximately the same number of avian species, supported a far smaller total population. The amount of foliage available undoubtedly exerts a strong influence on avian species composition and densities because it furnishes nesting sites and foraging substrate. The virgin forest provided substantially more foliage (113,984.0 m3/ha vs. 15,269.8 m3/ha) than did the logged plot. Along with foliage volume and configuration, presence of suitable numbers of snags and significant amounts of slash also were important.
