Abstract = {{Restoration is underway to restore lost or degraded remnants of savanna
   and woodland in the Midwestern United States in the hopes of restoring
   floristic and wildlife diversity. Information is needed on the effects
   of pine savanna-woodland restoration on bird abundance to inform
   management decisions. We conducted point-count surveys for 19 bird
   species across the gradient of savanna, woodland, and forest in restored
   and non-restored areas throughout the Ozark-Ouachita Highlands in parts
   of Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma during the 2013-2015 breeding
   seasons. We estimated densities of 16 species using distance sampling to
   account for detection probability, and we determined relationships of
   bird abundance with management and vegetation variables by evaluating
   support for a priori models. Densities of early-successional and
   generalist species were positively related, and interior-forest species
   negatively related, to restoration. Densities of Brown-headed Nuthatch
   (Sitta pusilla), Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), Eastern
   Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens), Pine Warbler (Setophaga pinus), Prairie
   Warbler (Setophaga discolor), Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes
   erythrocephalus), White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus), and Yellow-breasted
   Chat (Icteria virens) were positively related to prescribed fire
   activity. Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera), Kentucky Warbler
   (Geothlypis formosa), and Yellow-breasted Chat densities were positively
   related to tree thinning. Many species had higher densities in areas
   with less canopy cover, tree density, and forest cover. Acadian
   Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), Black-and white Warbler (Mniotilta
   varia), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla
   mustelina), and Worm eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum) were
   negatively related to one or more aspects of restoration treatment and
   generally preferred areas with greater tree density and canopy cover.
   Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra) were abundant but density was not
   strongly related to management or vegetation variables. Restoration
   provided breeding habitat for disturbance-dependent species and woodland
   generalists, many of which are species of conservation concern, but
   canopy cover generally remained too great for species that require more
   open savanna.}},

Title = {{Dynamic multi-species occupancy models reveal individualistic habitat
   preferences in a high-altitude grassland bird community}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Moist, high-altitude grasslands of eastern South African harbour rich
   avian diversity and endemism. This area is also threatened by
   increasingly intensive agriculture and land conversion for energy
   production. This conflict is particularly evident at Ingula, an
   Important Bird and Biodiversity Area located within the least conserved
   highaltitude grasslands and which is also the site of a new Pumped
   Storage Scheme. The new management seeks to maximise biodiversity
   through manipulation of the key habitat variables: grass height and
   grass cover through burning and grazing to make habitat suitable for
   birds. However, different species have individual habitat preferences,
   which further vary through the season. We used a dynamic multi-species
   occupancy model to examine the seasonal occupancy dynamics of 12 common
   grassland bird species and their habitat preferences. We estimated
   monthly occupancy, colonisation and persistence in relation to grass
   height and grass cover throughout the summer breeding season of 2011/12.
   For majority of these species, at the beginning of the season occupancy
   increased with increasing grass height and decreased with increasing
   grass cover. Persistence and colonisation decreased with increasing
   grass height and cover. However, the 12 species varied considerably in
   their responses to grass height and cover. Our results suggest that
   management should aim to provide plots which vary in grass height and
   cover to maximise bird diversity. We also conclude that the decreasing
   occupancy with increasing grass cover and low colonisation with
   increasing grass height and cover is a results of little grazing on our
   study site. We further conclude that some of the 12 selected species are
   good indicators of habitat suitability more generally because they
   represent a range of habitat needs and are relatively easy to monitor.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance legacies structure communities and ecological memory, but
   due to increasing changes in disturbance regimes, it is becoming more
   difficult to characterize disturbance legacies or determine how long
   they persist. We sought to quantify the characteristics and persistence
   of material legacies (e.g., biotic residuals of disturbance) that arise
   from variation in fire severity in an eastern ponderosa pine forest in
   North America. We compared forest stand structure and understory woody
   plant and bird community composition and species richness across
   unburned, low-, moderate-, and high-severity burn patches in a
   27-year-old mixed-severity wildfire that had received minimal post-fire
   management. We identified distinct tree densities (high: 14.3 +/- 7.4
   trees per ha, moderate: 22.3 +/- 12.6, low: 135.3 +/- 57.1, unburned:
   907.9 +/- 246.2) and coarse woody debris cover (high: 8.5 +/- 1.6\%
   cover per 30m transect, moderate: 4.3 +/- 0.7, low: 2.3 +/- 0.6,
   unburned: 1.0 +/- 0.4) among burn severities. Understory woody plant
   communities differed between high-severity patches, moderate- and
   low-severity patches, and unburned patches (all p<0.05). Bird
   communities differed between high- and moderate-severity patches,
   low-severity patches, and unburned patches (all p<0.05). Bird species
   richness varied across burn severities: low-severity patches had the
   highest (5.29 +/- 1.44) and high-severity patches had the lowest (2.87
   +/- 0.72). Understory woody plant richness was highest in unburned (5.93
   +/- 1.10) and high-severity (5.07 +/- 1.17) patches, and it was lower in
   moderate- (3.43 +/- 1.17) and low-severity (3.43 +/- 1.06) patches. We
   show material fire legacies persisted decades after the mixed-severity
   wildfire in eastern ponderosa forest, fostering distinct structures,
   communities, and species in burned versus unburned patches and across
   fire severities. At a patch scale, eastern and western ponderosa system
   responses to mixed-severity fires were consistent.}},

Abstract = {{Complex environments support high biodiversity and diverse microhabitat
   availability, which may reduce the intensity of competition among
   species. Both natural and anthropogenic disturbances reduce the
   structural complexity of habitats, leading to homogenization. High
   abundances of common, generalist species in disturbed habitats may be
   driven by reduced competition from specialists in similar habitats. We
   quantified habitat availability for and utilization of three
   co-occurring arboreal geckos (Australian native house geckos {[}Gehyra
   dubia], northern velvet geckos {[}Oedura castelnaui] and eastern
   spiny-tailed geckos {[}Strophurus williamsi]) in four replicated grazing
   regimes in an experimental grazing trial in north-east Queensland,
   Australia. Native house geckos were most abundant in heavily grazed
   habitats, whereas the two other species rarely co-occurred (either with
   each other or with native house geckos). Geckos displayed resource
   partitioning of habitat features, such as tree species and structural
   characteristics. We found evidence of interspecific competition among
   gecko species, in which native house geckos shifted their habitat
   selection in the presence of velvet geckos. In the absence of other
   geckos, native house geckos preferred rough, peeling bark and dead
   trees, yet in the presence of velvet geckos, native house geckos shifted
   away from dead trees, and used more structurally complex trees, probably
   due to high niche overlap with velvet geckos. Native house geckos were
   more resistant to the negative effects of livestock grazing than either
   velvet or spiny-tailed geckos. In the absence of other species, native
   house geckos used a wider range of microhabitats. Synthesis and
   applications. Species assemblages are often the results of multiple or
   complex factors, including predation pressure, habitat availability or
   competitive interactions. The homogenizing effects on habitat structure
   caused by livestock grazing reduce diversity and suitability for
   microhabitat specialists. Reduced competition can therefore promote the
   abundance of microhabitat generalist species, such as Australian native
   house geckos, suggesting that livestock grazing leads to homogenization
   and simplification of habitat structure, which ultimately leads to
   changes in species composition through reduced competition.
   Understanding species' responses to disturbance, and more broadly,
   habitat complexity, is crucial for maintaining or increasing biological
   diversity in anthropogenically modified landscapes.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Populations of grassland songbirds continue to decline, and grasslands
   devoted to conservation are rare across the Great Plains. To gain the
   most value from grasslands for grassland birds, we must understand what
   types of management benefit these species. We evaluated the relative
   abundance of grassland birds on ownership types and the association of
   different land use activities with their abundance. We surveyed a wide
   range of grasslands (e.g., from idle to heavily managed, from remnant
   prairie to reconstructed) across western Minnesota and northwestern
   Iowa, USA, in 2013 and 2014. Sites surveyed covered a gradient of
   landscape context, management history (fire, grazing, reconstruction),
   and public and private ownership. We evaluated the influence of
   ownership and management history on the abundance of 12 species of
   grassland birds by comparing Akaike's Information Criterion values of
   linear models that included the variables of interest to models that
   included only local and landscape habitat factors. Ownership explained
   additional variation in bird abundance beyond local and landscape
   variables for 7 of the 12 species, and 5 species were more common on
   private lands. Fire or grazing history explained variation in bird
   abundance for 11 species, and 7 species had greater abundance on remnant
   prairie than on reconstructed grassland. For all but 1 species,
   ownership and management factors significantly improved models above a
   base model of local and landscape variables typically used to predict
   abundance. Our results suggest remnant prairie plays an important role
   for grassland birds, and that grazing could be a tool to increase
   abundance of some grassland bird species in the region. Furthermore,
   tracking management history of public lands in a consistent and
   accessible way could help improve landscape-based models for these
   species. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{432}},
Pages = {{799-811}},

Abstract = {{Data collected by forest inventories like the third National Forest
   Inventory (NFI-3, 2011-2012) in Germany was proposed to monitor forest
   biodiversity and evaluate existing forest management practices on a
   national scale. A data set was created from the NFI-3 data for analysis
   purposes which contained variables relevant to the habitat requirements
   of native forest bird species. Information on the distribution and
   abundance of 20 native forest bird species was taken from the Atlas of
   German Breeding Birds (2005-2009, 3003 grid cells). They form two
   important ecological groups: cavity-nesting and deciduous forest birds.
   For the first time, this data was combined with NFI-3 data and analysed
   using Random Forest models and partial dependence plots to determine
   which forest variables recorded by the NFI-3 were most closely related
   to forest bird species richness and diversity in temperate forests.
   It was shown that changes in forest bird species diversity and richness
   correlate with the NFI data but the different sampling methods of the
   NFI and bird species data also created methodological challenges which
   are discussed. The most important drivers of the richness and diversity
   of deciduous forest and cavity-nesting bird species are forest stand age
   and forest ownership. Deciduous forest and cavity-nesting birds show a
   preference for the way state, federal and municipal forests are managed
   over private forests. Private forests have significantly lower deadwood
   volumes and high proportions of coniferous trees, both of which are
   forest characteristics that lower the richness and diversity of bird
   species. Our findings show that efforts to protect forest birds should
   target managed forests older than 100 and 200 years and forests with
   total deadwood volumes > 46.3 m(3)ha. Protected areas also exhibited
   higher diversity and richness of forest birds which highlight their
   importance as suitable target areas for the protection of forest birds.}},

Abstract = {{Ensuring adequate conifer regeneration after high severity wildfires is
   a common objective for ecologists and forest managers. In the Klamath
   region of Oregon and California, a global hotspot of botanical
   biodiversity, concerns over regeneration have led to post-fire
   management on many sites, which involves salvage logging followed by
   site preparation, conifer planting, and manual shrub release. To
   quantify the impacts of post-fire management, we sampled 62 field sites
   that burned at high severity nearly 20 years ago in the Klamath-Siskiyou
   Mountain bioregion, stratifying by management and aspect. We measured
   cover of shrubs and trees and density and frequency of trees and used
   Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling to compare community composition,
   plant community assemblage based on regenerative traits, and density of
   tree species between aspect and management. On average, shrub cover
   exceeded the cover of conifers, hardwoods or grasses, regardless of
   management history or aspect. The average number of species was lower
   and resprouting species were less abundant on south aspect sites; seed
   banking species were most abundant on north aspects. Post-fire
   management was associated with greater cover of seed banking and
   nitrogen-fixing species but it did not affect diversity. Management had
   no impact on Douglas-fir regeneration, the main species of concern in
   the region. Regeneration of ponderosa pine was higher on sites with
   post-fire management, but only on south slopes. The frequency of
   Douglas-fir was associated with aspect, while the frequency of ponderosa
   pine was associated with management. Overall, our study demonstrates the
   important role that aspect plays in determining the effectiveness of
   management after high severity wildfires. Indeed, the effect of aspect
   on site conditions often overwhelmed the ability of management to
   influence community composition (including different regenerative
   strategies), species diversity, and regeneration. Managed sites differed
   from unmanaged sites in several diverse ways with varied implications
   for longer-term forest development. Managed sites had taller dominant
   conifers, which suggests that post-fire management could hasten the
   period needed to achieve fire resistance. Managed sites were similar in
   plant community composition but had more homogeneous structure-e.g.,
   managed sites had fewer snags, which are an important habitat feature
   for several bird species in the region. Finally, management was not
   associated with conifer regeneration success on north slopes, suggesting
   that interventions may not be needed uniformly across post-fire
   landscape. New policies of ecosystem-based management in the Klamath
   region should consider the important interactions between aspect and
   post-fire management, and tailor management practices based on specific
   objectives and landscape context.}},

Abstract = {{The article shows the effect of extensive and repeated forest fires on
   the floristic diversity of pine forests typical for the forest-steppe
   zone of the Eastern Transbaikal territory. Pine forest general
   description carried out according to the materials of the forest
   valuation of 1994, before the extensive fires. The floristic composition
   of long-term non-burning plant communities in different stages of
   secondary succession after fires was determined by the method of sample
   plots. Indexes of species abundance accumulation and rare species, and
   the share of forest and adventive plant species were used to estimate
   the biodiversity of plant communities. Pine forestland is formed by a
   variety of forest types, where rhododendron pine forests dominate by
   area; while cereal mixed herbs pine forests occupy the smaller area.
   Sedgy, mountain-lapideous, ledum and riverine pine forests occupy up to
   5 \% of the total area. Area ratio of monodominant and oligodominant
   forests to a certain extent associated with slope direction.
   Monodominant forests areas are larger than oligodominant forests areas
   on the slopes of the North-West and the South-West exposure; while
   oligodominant forests occupy large areas on southern, northern, western
   and eastern slopes. Young and middle-growth plantations were more than
   50 \% of the forestland before the extensive forest fires. There were
   about 40 \% of ripening forest stands and up to 10 \% of mature and over
   mature forest stands of the total forested area. The age ratio of
   plantation has changed a little after fires, however, old-growth
   plantations over 110-130 years old has failed. The number of plant
   species in the long-term non-burning forest areas is significantly
   higher than in burnt areas, logged lands and pine crops. The index of
   species abundance accumulation is higher in logged lands and plantations
   without burnings. The index of rare species have decreased from 1.25
   (long-term non-burning plantations) to 0.25 after fires. The share of
   adventive plant species as well as plants native to steppe communities
   had increased in burnt areas. As a research result, it was established
   that forest fires led to a significant decrease in forest cover, area of
   long-term non-burning forests, unique plantations of woody plants,
   species diversity, indexes of species abundance accumulation and rare
   species, the share of plant communities in forest species and
   colonization of plant communities in burnt areas by alien species. The
   results of the work can be used in assessment of the impact of climate
   change and fires on biological diversity of forest communities in the
   region, development of measures for biodiversity conservation, planning
   of forest thinning and reforestation, etc.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of birds inhabiting wetlands and grasslands are decreasing
   globally due to farmland expansion and subsequent agricultural
   intensification. In addition to conserving natural habitats, managing
   cultivated farmland and abandoned farmland are likely to be important
   future conservation measures; however, their relative suitability as
   avian habitat remains understudied. In this study, we evaluated five
   habitat types (wetland, pasture, cropland, abandoned farmland, and solar
   power plant) for openland birds in an agricultural landscape in central
   Hokkaido. northern Japan. Abandoned farmlands had bird species richness
   and total bird abundance values similar to those of wetlands. These
   values were generally higher in abandoned farmlands and wetlands than in
   croplands, pastures, and solar power plants. The per pair reproductive
   success of Stejneger's Stonechat Saxicola stejnegeri and the amount of
   its prey (arthropods) did not differ among the five habitat types. Tine
   species (Black-browed Reed Warbler Acrocephalus bistrigiceps, Common
   Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus, and Japanese Bush Warbler Cettia
   diphone) arrived earlier in wetlands than in other habitat types. These
   results suggest that, although protecting the remaining wetlands is of

Title = {{Are avian population targets achievable through programs that restore
   habitat on private-lands?}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has negatively affected biodiversity
   throughout the world. In the United States, population declines of many
   early successional bird species have been linked with habitat loss due
   to agriculture. In light of this, recent efforts have attempted to
   prioritize conservation actions at continental scales. Importantly,
   these efforts have used existing data to estimate the global population
   size for declining species and set future population goals. Though these
   efforts consider broad scales for conservation efforts and provide
   population targets, they lack explicit plans to achieve established
   goals. One way to achieve these population goals is through the process
   of habitat restoration, such as voluntary private-land conservation
   programs that restore habitat in agricultural landscapes and are
   implemented at a sufficiently large scale to achieve population goals.
   Our goal was to understand how private-land conservation programs can be
   used to achieve population goals for declining species. To do this, we
   examined the population-level impacts of the Conservation Reserve
   Enhancement Program, a program that has created more than 57,000 ha of
   restored habitat in Illinois, for four declining conservation priority
   species, the Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii bellii), Field Sparrow (Spizella
   pusilla), Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), and Willow Flycatcher
   (Empidonax trailli trailli). We surveyed 172 randomly chosen restored
   fields in 10 counties in central and west-central Illinois during the
   2012-2015 breeding seasons. We found that current private-land
   conservation efforts in Illinois are probably effective in achieving
   state population goals for rare species with restricted habitat
   preferences such as the Bell's Vireo and may be close to achieving the
   goal for the Willow Flycatcher. However, more than 10 times the current
   amount of restored habitat (similar to 1\% of land used for agriculture
   in Illinois) would be required to achieve the population goals set for
   all of our focal species. Our results suggest that achieving population
   goals for early successional bird species using land restored through
   private-land programs may be possible for some rare species, but the
   large amount of habitat needed for many species makes achieving these
   goals only possible with significant increases in private-land habitat.}},

Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-79}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Anthropogenic disturbance may cause birds to flush and relocate, abandon
   breeding sites, experience increased nest failure, or fledge fewer
   young. Ground-based military activities are of particular concern for
   ground-nesting birds because of the increased risk of nest destruction
   and trampling of vegetation. We investigated how different intensities
   of disturbance from ground-based military training affected reproductive
   ecology of Bachman's sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) from 2014-2016, on
   Fort Bragg Military Installation, North Carolina, USA. We designated 2
   training intensity regimes and monitored sparrows at 6 observation
   areas, 3 in high-intensity training areas (i.e., foot traffic every 1-3
   days) and 3 in low-intensity training (i.e., foot traffic <1 per month)
   areas. We compared seasonal productivity metrics and daily nest survival
   between training intensities. Additionally, we compared male sparrow
   relative abundance and micro-habitat use between high- and low-intensity
   training areas. We monitored 106 male territories and located 110 nests
   opportunistically and by tracking telemetered female sparrows. We used
   fixed-radius point counts to estimate relative abundance in each
   observation area and measured vegetation composition and structure at a
   subset of 10 locations in each male territory. Seasonal productivity
   metrics, daily nest survival, relative abundance, and vegetation
   composition and structure at male locations did not differ between areas
   with high and low military training intensity. In 2015, 1 sparrow nest
   was trampled by military personnel, but >= 1 nestling force-fledged and
   the nest was considered successful. Bachman's sparrow nesting ecology
   was not affected by intensity of ground-based military training
   activity, likely because activity was sufficiently dispersed across the
   landscape, even in high-intensity training areas. We recommend
   ground-based training attempts to minimize ground vegetation destruction
   by dispersing large groups and traversing variable routes when in
   forested uplands. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is driving species to shift their distributions toward
   high altitudes and latitudes, while habitat loss and fragmentation may
   hamper species ability to follow their climatic envelope. These two
   drivers of change may act in synergy, with particularly disastrous
   impacts on biodiversity. Protected areas, PAs, may thus represent
   crucial buffers against the compounded effects of climate change and
   habitat loss. However, large-scale studies assessing the performance of
   PAs as such buffers remain scarce and are largely based on species
   occurrence data. Conversely, abundance data have proven to be more
   reliable for addressing changes in wildlife populations under climate
   change. We evaluated changes in bird abundance from the 1970s-80s to the
   2000s inside and outside PAs at the trailing range edge of 30 northern
   bird species and at the leading range edge of 70 southern species.
   Abundances of retracting northern species were higher and declined less
   inside PAs at their trailing range edge. The positive effect of PAs on
   bird abundances was particularly marked in northern species that rely
   strongly on PAs, that is, their density distribution is largely confined
   within PAs. These species were nearly absent outside PAs in the 2000s.
   The abundances of southern species were in general lower inside PAs and
   increased less from the 70s-80s to 2000s. Nonetheless, species with high
   reliance on PAs had much higher abundances inside than outside PAs in
   the 2000s. These results show that PAs are essential in mitigating the
   retraction of northern species, but also facilitate northward expansions
   of southern species highly reliant on PAs. Our study provides empirical
   evidence documenting the role of PAs in facilitating species to adjust
   to rapidly changing climatic conditions, thereby contributing to the
   mitigation of impending biodiversity loss. PAs may thus allow time for
   initiating wider conservation programs on currently unprotected land.}},

Abstract = {{Land use changes occurring in Europe in recent decades are generating
   important changes in the forest landscape characteristics and are having
   important effects on avian species richness and abundance. This is
   particularly important for some bird species of particular conservation
   concern that require heterogenous landscapes where breeding habitats are
   proximal to foraging habitats. Among these birds, the European Turtle
   Dove Streptopelia turtur is particularly important because of its marked
   population decline. In southern Europe, forest landscapes have been
   considered important breeding areas for Turtle Doves. We assessed the
   influence of the foraging area characteristics - distance to cereal
   crops and wild seed species abundance - and water availability on Turtle
   Dove breeding habitat suitability in a Mediterranean forest landscape in
   southern Spain. Forty-six point locations were surveyed during the
   spring of 2014 and 2015 on two nearby farms of a forest protected area.
   The average local abundance of Turtle Doves found at each point location
   was 1.25 +/- 1.31 males, and it was significantly higher at the point
   locations closest to cereal crops, as well as at nesting sites where the
   wild seed species included in its local diet were abundant, especially
   Echium plantagineum. Distance to water in the studied range (average
   distance 475 m) did not show a significant effect on Turtle Dove local
   abundance, although the high availability of water in the study area
   could have a positive influence on the overall Turtle Dove breeding
   habitat suitability. To benefit Turtle Dove breeding habitat
   suitability, cultivated areas with cereals/legumes near those forest
   areas where Turtle Doves reproduce should be promoted. Likewise, the
   promotion of those herbaceous species that are locally important in the
   Turtle Dove diet, available, for example, through specific grazing
   management, should be taken into account when nesting habitat
   restoration is designed in forest areas, regardless of whether the
   distances to food resources are long.}},

Abstract = {{Forest biodiversity conservation requires precise, area-wide information
   on the abundance and distribution of key habitat structures at multiple
   spatial scales. We combined airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with
   color-infrared (CIR) aerial imagery for identifying individual tree
   characteristics and quantifying multi-scale habitat requirements using
   the example of the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) (TTW) in
   the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany). This bird, a keystone
   species of boreal and mountainous forests, is highly reliant on bark
   beetles dwelling in dead or dying trees. While previous studies showed a
   positive relationship between the TTW presence and the amount of
   deadwood as a limiting resource, we hypothesized a unimodal response
   with a negative effect of very high deadwood amounts and tested for
   effects of substrate quality. Based on 104 woodpecker presence or
   absence locations, habitat selection was modelled at four spatial scales
   reflecting different woodpecker home range sizes. The abundance of
   standing dead trees was the most important predictor, with an increase
   in the probability of TTW occurrence up to a threshold of 44-50 dead
   trees per hectare, followed by a decrease in the probability of
   occurrence. A positive relationship with the deadwood crown size
   indicated the importance of fresh deadwood. Remote sensing data allowed
   both an area-wide prediction of species occurrence and the derivation of
   ecological threshold values for deadwood quality and quantity for more
   informed conservation management.}},

   ecology in intensive agroecosystems}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{228}},
Pages = {{27-35}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Farmland landscapes in developed countries have undergone major habitat
   changes over the past 60 years leading to the decline of many species.
   Of these, the little bustard, a medium-sized, long-lived, ground nesting
   bird, has declined by 95\% in France over the last 35 years. Here we
   present the results of a 21 year survey of the nesting ecology of this
   elusive species, analyzing 157 breeding attempts, the largest data set
   ever collated for this species. Females had a strong preference for
   meadows for breeding, yet this habitat only represented 14\% overall
   habitat. Alfalfa alone accounted for 50\% of nest locations. However,
   apart from vegetation type, females did not show any other pattern of
   habitat selection (vegetation height, nest position within field, field
   under agri-environmental contract-AES-). In addition, the laying period
   was extremely extended, spanning almost 3 months. We did not detect any
   strong effect of crop, date or whether the nesting field was in AES or
   not, on clutch size, egg size and egg-laying date. However, there were
   long-term changes in breeding phenology (females breed earlier than 20
   years ago), and selection of vegetation between years and within years.
   Hatching success was very low (about half of the broods were destroyed
   by farm work), and both fecundity and productivity per female were found
   to be approximately one third of the values expected for a stable
   population. Overall, nesting females of Little Bustards select meadows
   in regard to their availability, but do not show any particular
   preference within meadows' vegetation structure or height. We show that
   in such system, meadows act as ecological traps, and furthermore,
   because females do not appear selective, it is impossible to manage
   meadows in order to limit this trap. We finally analyze whether the
   land-sharing AESs can conserve this species in intensive arable systems
   and conclude that the land sharing may not be sustainable. We discuss
   our results in light of the alternative of land sparing, and suggest
   that this is probably a better fit for the conservation of large-bodied
   bird species given their ecological constraints (large home ranges,
   presence of semi-natural landscape components and freedom from human
   interference).}},

Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{876-889}},

Abstract = {{Fire disturbance in tropical savannas is integral to maintaining habitat
   heterogeneity and biodiversity, but its impact on avian species is
   highly variable. Savannas in northern Australia have recently been
   invaded by gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus), a perennial tussock grass
   that fuels late season fires at eight times the intensity of native
   vegetation. As gamba grass rapidly outcompetes native species and
   promotes more frequent and intense fires, it greatly decreases landscape
   heterogeneity and alters the effect of fire in tropical savannas. To
   investigate how a small passerine, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus
   melanocephalus), responds to fire disturbance and gamba grass cover, we
   studied their fine-scale habitat use throughout the dry season before
   and after a high intensity fire. We used two spatially distinct
   approaches, radio-telemetry and a transect-based population census, to
   quantify fairywren habitat use at the group and population level,
   respectively. Radio-telemetry and transect surveys revealed no direct
   mortality associated with the severe bushfire during the middle of the
   study season, suggesting fairywrens are resilient in the short-term to
   fire disturbance. Our results indicate that fairywrens are largely
   flexible in their habitat use - instead of relocating after fire, they
   re-centre their home range around the most photosynthetically productive
   habitats, dominated by saplings. While we found substantial variation in
   habitat use among social groups, red-backed fairywren groups generally
   avoided dense habitat areas dominated by mature gamba grass. We conclude
   that red-backed fairywrens are resilient to fire and flexible in their
   habitat use in the short-term; however, in the long-term, gamba grass
   may pose a threat to population viability. The importance of flexible
   behavioural strategies in tropical passerines will increase as fire
   regimes are exacerbated by invasive species and climate change.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{227}},
Pages = {{305-312}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In line with the 2010 Aichi Convention for Biological Diversity, the
   European Union has a goal to restore 15\% of degraded ecosystems and
   their services by the year 2020 (target 2, Europe 2020). This includes
   restoration of semi-natural grasslands (SNGs). Management of both intact
   and restored SNGs is dependent on people's willingness to manage them.
   Due to low profitability, management abandonment still occurs all over
   Europe, which highlights the need to raise farmers' and landowners'
   perspectives. In this study, we combined survey data and in-depth
   interviews with farmers/landowners managing previously restored SNGs, to
   understand how they perceive the restoration process, the outcome and
   future management. Survey and interview data were analysed in relation
   to biodiversity and Agri-environmental payments data from the restored
   sites. Almost all respondents considered the restoration successful and
   the re-inventoried restored SNGs also showed an increase in plant
   diversity. Nevertheless, 10\% of the restored SNGs were abandoned again
   post-restoration and 40\% of the respondents were unsure if they would
   continue the management in the future. Abandoned management may cause a
   negative trend in terms of decreased biological, cultural and aesthetic
   values, in the local community, as well as for the society in general.
   Most respondents explained a strong dependency on Agri-environmental
   payments, both as a restoration incentive and for post-restoration
   management. Also non-financial support from authorities in form of
   feedback and advice was requested, as well as support from the local
   community and society as a whole. Future management in a longer time
   perspective was strongly coupled to the farm economy, i.e. received
   Agri-environmental payments at farm-level and profit from selling
   agricultural products, and whether the farmers had successors. We
   conclude that both social and ecological factors, here farm economy,
   authority support and proper management, must be in place for long-term
   success of grassland restoration.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{429}},
Pages = {{233-243}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is used in fire-prone environments worldwide to
   reduce fuel loads and the severity and spread of future wildfires.
   Forest habitat structures, such as large trees, dead trees and logs are
   highly flammable, yet also are essential for animal species that require
   hollows (cavities) as den sites for shelter and reproduction. We
   examined the effects of experimental prescribed burns on the use of den
   sites by a small marsupial, the yellow-footed antechinus Antechinus
   flavipes, in south-eastern Australia. Specifically, we radio-tracked
   individual A. flavipes to identify forest habitat structures preferred
   as den sites and recorded the fate of known den sites following patchy
   prescribed burns. We found that large living trees and dead trees were
   used as den sites disproportionately to their relative abundance in the
   forest. While all marked individuals of A. flavipes survived the
   immediate impacts of patchy prescribed burns, almost a third (16/52) of
   den sites identified before burning were lost, including 17\% of trees
   (4/23) and 48\% of logs (10/21). The vulnerability of den sites to
   prescribed burns can be attributed to the decay-dependent effect of fire
   on both trees and logs, whereby, the amount of damage from fire is
   related to the structure's pre-fire condition (i.e. whether dead or
   alive, amount of decay). Large trees and large logs are scarce in this
   dry forest ecosystem and their replacement is likely to take a century
   or more due to the slow growth rates of trees. The ecological impacts of
   prescribed burning on habitat structures used by A. flavipes and other
   hollow-using species can be moderated by: (1) carrying out patchy,
   rather than complete burns; (2) ensuring the inter-fire interval is
   sufficient to allow time for replenishment of resources; and (3)
   planning at a regional scale to maintain an appropriate spatial pattern
   of post-fire age-classes, including areas retained as long-unburned
   (e.g. > 50 years) in which resources such as deep litter, large logs and
   dead trees can accumulate.}},

Abstract = {{Tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) are important features for the
   conservation of biodiversity in forest ecosystems. Although other
   structural indicators of forest biodiversity have been extensively
   studied in recent decades, TreMs have often been overlooked, either due
   to the absence of a consensual definition or a lack of knowledge.
   Despite the increased number of TreM studies in the last decade, the
   role of drivers of TreM profile in primary forests and across different
   geographical regions is still unknown. To evaluate the main drivers of
   TreM density and diversity, we conducted the first large-scale study of
   TreMs across European primary forests. We established 146 plots in eight
   primary forests dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in the
   Carpathian and Dinaric mountain ranges. Generalized linear mixed effect
   models were used to test the effect of local plot characteristics and
   spatial variability on the density and diversity (alpha, beta, and
   gamma) of TreMs. Total TreM density and diversity were significantly
   positively related with tree species richness and the proportion of
   snags. Root mean square tree diameters were significantly related to
   alpha and gamma diversity of TreMs. Both regions reached similarly high
   values of total TreM densities and total TreM densities and diversity
   were not significantly different between the two regions; however, we
   observed between the two regions significant differences in the
   densities of two TreM groups, conks of fungi and epiphytes. The density
   and diversity of TreMs were very high in beech-dominated mountain
   primary forests, but their occurrence and diversity was highly variable
   within the landscapes over relatively short spatial gradients (plot and
   stand levels). Understanding these profile provides a benchmark for
   further comparisons, such as with young forest reserves, or for
   improving forest management practices that promote biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Different cutting regimes improve species and functional diversity of

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{To mitigate biodiversity loss, it is essential to understand how areas
   altered by human land use can act as alternative habitats for functional
   groups of species, which are in decline. In forested landscapes,
   power-line clearings can be valuable habitats for early successional
   plant species, which in turn provide important food resources for
   pollinating insects. However, we know little about how management
   practices affect plant diversity, or how changes in species diversity
   translate into the functional diversity of floral resources. We
   conducted an experiment at 19 sites in power-line clearings across
   southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was (1) cut and left to
   decay, (2) cut and removed, or (3) uncut. We assessed the effects of
   treatments on species diversity (richness, evenness, diversity) and
   functional diversity (functional evenness, functional dispersion) of
   understory plant communities of insect-pollinated plants. We also
   investigated the influence of environmental conditions within the
   power-line clearings, the surrounding landscape, and climatic factors on
   species and functional diversity. We found that the cut and cut-remove
   treatments were effective in increasing biological diversity of
   insect-pollinated plants. The species and functional diversity showed
   contrasting responses to treatments, and the treatment effects depended
   on the environmental context. This shows that ecosystem functioning is
   not necessarily predictable from the ecological processes that drive
   species composition. The treatment effects on species diversity were
   partly explained by the stress-gradient hypothesis; species richness was
   higher in the cleared plots in areas of low environmental stress from
   precipitation and elevation. In contrast, the treatment effects on
   functional diversity were positively influenced by productivity, stem
   density, temperature, available source habitats, elevation, and canopy
   density. Functional diversity, based on effect traits, should be
   emphasized when the aim is to maintain a broad range of pollination
   functions and services in power-line clearings. This study shows that
   inclusion of power-line clearings in conservation plans can mitigate
   biodiversity decline in forested landscapes. We recommend the cut-remove
   treatment in productive areas with available source habitats and high
   stem density. In low productive areas, with high stem density and high
   temperatures, the standard cut treatment is sufficient, but a higher
   cutting frequency is recommended.}},

   promote habitat for breeding and post-breeding spruce-fir avian
   assemblages in the Atlantic Northern Forest}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{The quantity of spruce-fir forest and some conifer-associated breeding
   bird abundances in the Atlantic Northern Forest have declined in recent
   decades emphasizing the need to better understand avian responses to
   forest management and to identify options that proactively conserve
   habitat for birds during the breeding and post-breeding period. We
   conducted avian point counts and vegetation surveys on publicly and
   privately-owned lands with known management histories to assess
   relationships between avian assemblages in harvest and post-harvest
   treatments that could provide habitat for passerine birds associated
   with the spruce-fir forest type. We sampled regenerating
   conifer-dominated stands 5-41 years-since-harvest (YSH) in three harvest
   treatments (selection, irregular first-stage shelterwood, and clearcuts)
   and three postharvest treatments including regenerating clearcuts
   treated with aerially applied herbicide (e.g., glyphosate),
   precommercial thinning (PCT), both herbicide and PCT, and mature stands
   (>= 48 YSH). Spruce-fir obligate and associate birds were more abundant
   in stands with greater spruce-fir tree composition (>= 70\% and >= 60\%,
   respectively). Avian richness of spruce-fir obligates, associates, and
   species of concern was greater in clearcuts and clearcuts with
   post-harvest treatments. Vegetative features associated with greater
   richness and abundance of spruce-fir birds, such as greater spruce-fir
   composition and smaller tree diameter at breast height, were prominent
   in regenerating clearcuts and post-harvest treatments and suggested that
   these management practices promote local abundances and richness of
   spruce-fir birds. Richness and abundances of spruce-fir birds were least
   in selection, shelterwood, and mature stands, and vegetative features
   associated with greater richness and abundance of spruce-fir birds were
   diminished in these stands. Forestry trends in Maine indicate that the
   extent of the clearcut suite of treatments has decreased on the
   landscape while selection and shelterwood harvests have increased. Thus,
   changes in incentives for managers to apply even-aged management coupled
   with postharvest applications of herbicides or precommercial thinning
   might mitigate further declines in habitat for spruce-fir passerines
   assemblages. A greater ratio of clearcuts with postharvest treatments
   11-40 YSH compared to other treatments (mature forest >= 48 YSH,
   selection and shelterwood 5-41 YSH) would maintain diverse spruce-fir
   bird communities on the landscape. Use of clearcuts with post-harvest
   treatments in the hemiboreal forests of northern New England, southern
   Quebec, and Maritime Provinces of eastern Canada may enhance habitat for
   breeding and post-breeding spruce-fir birds, especially where the
   quantity of conifer forests are declining and residual patches of
   conifers are increasingly fragmented.}},

Abstract = {{Forest structural complexity could be a good predictor of overall
   species diversity. Since tree harvesting has a negative effect on forest
   structure, it is important to analyse the effects of this disturbance on
   sensitive groups, as forest birds. In this study, we aimed to shed light
   on this aspect by analysing a set of univariate metrics in bird
   communities breeding in three coppiced forest habitats (coppiced of
   chestnut, coppiced of Turkey oak and high forest of beech) along a
   gradient in age classes. We hypothesised that, with increasing forest
   age, (i) breeding bird communities will progressively increase in
   diversity and, (ii) due to higher habitat heterogeneity due to
   coppicing, a higher species turnover in the first age classes could
   appear. In each forest habitat, all the metrics significantly increased,
   from recently coppiced to more mature forests, due to progressively
   higher availability of resources and niches along the gradient. When
   comparing paired forest habitats, abundance and richness were
   significantly different only in the two oldest age classes, highlighting
   that responses to different tree composition were more marked in the
   mature phase. In all forest habitats, species turnover (beta(w)
   diversity) decreased progressively along the age gradient and was
   highest in the youngest age classes where many vegetation layers were
   present. Due to different coppice management practices, growth regime
   and consequent habitat heterogeneity, chestnuts showed a different
   pattern when compared to other forest habitats, with an increase in
   species turnover (beta(w) diversity) at intermediate level. With
   increasing age of the forests, all the diversity metrics increased and
   species turnover decreased, highlighting the role of older forests as
   strategic habitats for highly structured bird communities.}},

Title = {{Collapse of a tropical forest bird assemblage surrounding a
   hydroelectric reservoir}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Hydroelectricity is the world's largest source of `renewable' energy,
   and deployment will expand considerably in the coming decade, with Asian
   countries installing the bulk of new generating capacity. Before
   construction of large hydropower projects, empirical evidence can be
   utilised to inform public involvement and to realistically ground
   decision-making processes such as impact mitigation planning and whether
   or not to build. This study explored changes in avian community richness
   and diversity among resident forest species surrounding the 165 km(2)
   Chiew Larn reservoir in southern Thailand, thirty years after
   inundation. Replicated avian point-counts were undertaken on 23 island
   sites and 24 nearby mainland transects. A total of 108 habitat structure
   surveys were conducted. Mainland and islands were composed of remarkably
   similar bamboo-dominated edge habitat. (log)Area described 82\% of the
   variability in species richness using general linear models and 74\% of
   the variability in community composition using Bray-Curtis non-metric
   multidimensional scaling. Species richness was similar on mainland and
   islands; however, the exponential of Shannon diversity was significantly
   higher on the mainland. Compared to a species pool of recent confirmed
   records in less disturbed habitat beyond the inundation zone, one fourth
   of species were missing from mainland sites. The avian community was
   dominated by a handful of disturbance tolerant species; furthermore,
   several wide-spread and ecologically tolerant species were also rare or
   missing. The disturbance-intolerant assemblage experienced collapse.
   Terrestrial and other understorey insectivores, species associated with
   mixed-species foraging flocks, middle storey sallying insectivores, and
   frugivores were severely depauperate, as were Sundaic endemics and
   species of conservation concern. An estimated 61 km(2) of degraded edge
   habitat surrounded the reservoir near the study area. Without taking the
   potential for serious mainland edge effects and associated human
   disturbance of habitat into consideration, planners will underestimate
   the potential impact of hydropower development on avian biodiversity.

Title = {{Disturbance shapes avian communities on a grassland-sagebrush ecotone}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Ecotones, or transitional zones between ecosystems, are often hotspots
   for biodiversity and targets for conservation. Where the Great Plains
   meet the sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe, an opportunity exists to
   conserve habitat for the two most imperiled avian guilds in North
   America, grassland and shrub-steppe birds. This ecotone creates a unique
   challenge with respect to the management of disturbance processes, such
   as fire and grazing, because grassland and sagebrush-shrubland birds
   respond quite dissimilarly to disturbance. To address this management
   challenge and maximize conservation opportunities, we examined the
   responses of grassland and sagebrush bird communities to disturbance at
   a grassland-sagebrush ecotone in northeast Wyoming, USA. Specifically,
   we surveyed bird communities on active black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys
   ludovicianus) colonies and burned areas, as well as on paired
   undisturbed points in 2016 and 2017. Bird community structure varied in
   response to both the presence and type of disturbance. Although alpha
   diversity of avian species was highest on undisturbed sites and burned
   areas, only prairie dog colonies provided breeding habitat for the
   imperiled shortgrass-obligate mountain plover (Charadrius montanus), and
   species turnover (beta diversity) was greatest between on-colony and
   off-colony points. Furthermore, bird communities were shaped by both
   disturbance-dependent (e.g., disturbance age) and
   disturbance-independent (e.g., topography and soils) landscape features.
   Managers must balance the benefits of high species diversity in
   undisturbed sagebrush with habitat requirements of other imperiled
   species like the mountain plover. This may entail prioritizing the
   amount and distribution of disturbances in relation to population goals
   for species of conservation concern while simultaneously maintaining a
   mosaic of all three patch types in this landscape.}},

Abstract = {{An increase in tree mortality is expected to occur worldwide due to
   climate-induced drought and increasing temperatures. The 2000-2002
   drought in the southwestern United States was one of the most severe in
   the last 50 years. It led to a severe outbreak of bark beetles that
   resulted in high mortality of pinon pine (Pinus edulis) trees on the
   Pajarito Plateau in Northern New Mexico beginning in 2002. Many areas in
   pinon-juniper habitat had entire stands of pinon die leaving only
   juniper (Juniperus spp.). Point count surveys were used to determine
   avian responses to tree mortality from 2003 to 2013. We also tested
   whether birds responded differently in sites that were mechanically
   thinned in 2002 and 2003 on Los Alamos National Laboratory property
   compared to sites not thinned. Junipers and dead pinon pines due to bark
   beetles and drought were removed on thinned sites. Richness, diversity,
   and abundance steadily declined after 2003. There was a 73\% decrease in
   abundance and a 45\% decrease in richness from 2003 to 2013. There was
   no difference in community composition between thinned and unthinned
   sites. Bird abundance and species richness declined faster in thinned
   sites than unthinned sites, but diversity decreased similarly in both
   treatments. Several species disappeared over time and some declined
   substantially. Our results suggest a delay in bird responses to tree
   mortality on the Pajarito Plateau. Pinon mortality may be a significant
   threat to bird communities in the southwestern U.S., and tree thinning
   to control fire may be an added risk.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural landscapes play an important role in biodiversity
   conservation. The Tree Pipit (Anthus trivialis) was once a widespread
   breeding bird in European farmlands. Today, however, its numbers are
   sharply declining in most European countries. The aim of our study was
   to compare territory densities of Tree Pipits in common pastures and
   control plots in the surrounding pre-alpine agricultural landscape in
   southern Bavaria (Germany). Additionally, we determined the drivers of
   territory and home-range establishment in Tree Pipits. Habitat
   composition in common pastures and control plots reflected distinct
   differences in land-use intensity. Common pastures had larger areas of
   nutrient-poor habitats and higher landscape diversity compared to
   control plots. In line with this, we detected a clear response of Tree
   Pipits to differences in habitat composition. Territories were nearly
   exclusively found in common pastures. Within the common pastures, Tree
   Pipits preferred those parts that had higher landscape diversity and,
   additionally, at the territory scale, larger areas of groups of trees.
   The common pastures are important refuges for the threatened Tree Pipit
   in the pre-alpine agricultural landscape of the study area. In contrast
   to the control plots, the common pastures provided (i) sufficient
   suitable song posts and (ii) heterogeneous vegetation with appropriate
   nesting sites and a high availability of arthropod food resources. Our
   study corroborates findings from other studies across Europe
   highlighting the prime importance of traditionally used wood pastures
   for the Tree Pipit, and for biodiversity in general.}},

Title = {{Opening the silvicultural toolbox: A new framework for conserving
   biodiversity in Chilean timber plantations}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{425}},
Pages = {{75-84}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Intensively managed timber plantations represent 7\% of global forest
   cover and may partially compensate for deforestation-related
   biodiversity loss, yet are often criticized as `green deserts' which
   support limited biodiversity. Growing concerns about the environmental
   impact of plantations in Chile have prompted numerous calls for a new
   forestry paradigm. Here, we systematically review the literature on
   biodiversity maintenance or loss in Chilean timber plantations and
   outline a new framework for biodiversity conservation therein,
   envisioning plantations as potential habitat that can be improved
   through informed management. Our review (N = 67 relevant publications)
   shows a strong taxonomic bias towards plants, mammals, birds, and
   invertebrates, as well as biases in the age and species composition of
   plantations studied. Most studies (78\%) examined Pinta radiata
   plantations, 48\% examined mature stands, and 46\% did not specify stand
   age. Research to date is difficult to translate into conservation
   policy, since most studies simply compare biodiversity within versus
   outside of plantations, and do not evaluate alternative management
   options. To better inform conservation, we identify six critical stages
   of plantation development during which management decisions may greatly
   influence biodiversity outcomes. Within each stage we discuss the
   effects of specific management practices on Chilean biodiversity,
   highlighting opportunities and key knowledge gaps. Strategies which
   promote structural complexity, understory cover, and landscape
   connectivity should help convert plantations into a less hostile matrix
   that provides adequate habitat for substantial native biodiversity.
   Given the global proliferation of plantations and their consequences for
   biodiversity, similar studies are needed in multiple regions of the
   world.}},

Abstract = {{Forest restoration, fuel reduction, and wildlife conservation management
   requires understanding if, and how repeated prescribed fire, fire
   severity, or mechanical methods can promote goals. We examined breeding
   bird response to repeated fuel reduction treatments by mechanical
   understory reduction (twice; Mechanical-only), prescribed burning (four
   times; Burn-only), or mechanical understory reduction plus burning (then
   three subsequent burns; Mechanical + Burn). Initial burns were hotter in
   Mechanical + Burn than Burn-only resulting in heavy tree mortality,
   canopy openness, thick shrub density, and abundant snags lasting several
   years. Relative density and species richness of birds increased in
   Mechanical + Burn within three breeding seasons of high severity burns,
   and remained greater throughout subsequent burn. Increases were due to
   an influx of species associated with young forest conditions, with
   little change in most mature forest species. Repeated burning in
   Mechanical + Burn likely impeded forest maturation, allowing many
   scrub-shrub bird species to persist. Species richness in Burn-only did
   not differ from any treatment, but modest increases over time were
   apparent as structural heterogeneity increased with delayed tree
   mortality. Cavity-nester density was highest in Mechanical + Burn, but
   remained high even as snags fell to pretreatment levels. Ground-nester
   density was lower in Mechanical + Burn than Control and Mechanical-only,
   but ground-nesting species responded differently. Open woodlands were
   not created by any treatment due to persistent re-sprouting of
   top-killed trees and shrubs. We note that breeding birds appear to
   respond similarly to high-severity burns and silvicultural treatments
   with heavy canopy reduction, offering possible alternatives in managing
   upland hardwood forests for diverse breeding bird communities.}},

Title = {{Bird Functional Traits Respond to Forest Structure in Riparian Areas
   Undergoing Active Restoration}},
Journal = {{DIVERSITY-BASEL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring wildlife responses is essential to assess restoration
   projects. Birds are widely used as bioindicators of ecosystem
   restoration, but most studies use only taxonomic descriptors to compare
   categories of reference and restoring sites. Here, we used forest
   structure as a continuous predictor variable to evaluate avifaunal
   taxonomic and functional indicators in riparian forest reference and
   restoration sites on southeastern Brazil. Reference sites were riparian
   forest remnants, and restoration sites were pasture before seedling
   reintroduction. Forest structure variables (mean tree height, canopy
   depth, mean diameter at breast height, basal area, tree layering, tree
   density, and grass cover) were reduced into two axes using a Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA), Forest Axis 1 (tree biomass vs. grass cover)
   and Forest Axis 2 (canopy depth vs. tree density). Bird species were
   classified in relation to five functional categories (i.e., diet,
   foraging stratum, nest height, cavity dependence for nesting, and forest
   dependence). Forest Axis 1 influenced the functional diversity of bird
   assemblages and the relative abundance within levels of each functional
   category (except for nest height). The relative abundance of all
   functional categories combined was also affected by Forest Axis 2.
   Therefore, forest structure affected the predominant functional traits
   of bird species in riparian sites under restoration. Sites with higher
   tree biomass were the richest, with canopy birds that were insectivores
   and frugivores of high forest dependence, whereas more open sites were
   associated with birds of low forest dependence and ground-foraging
   insectivores. Forest structures of similar-aged sites were strongly
   variable, due to natural and anthropic disturbances, so restoration age
   was a poor indicator of forest development. These unpredictable
   disturbances can change the development of sites under restoration, so
   that forest structure can be a better descriptor of the trajectory of
   these ecosystems.}},

   sharp decline as a result of the rapid specialization of land management
   that, through simplification, undermines multifunctionality.
   Understanding how changes in management influence these systems and
   their biodiversity is needed for prioritizing conservation efforts and
   for ensuring they remain HNV systems. On the basis of a field survey in
   58 plots distributed among 29 paddocks on 17 farms, we conducted an
   integrated analysis of the relationship between grazing intensity and
   biodiversity in montados of similar biophysical and structural
   characteristics. Data on management were obtained through interviews,
   and biodiversity data (vegetation, macrofungi, birds, herpetofauna) were
   obtained through specific field protocols. Additional spatial data, such
   as soil characteristics, slope, land cover, and linear landscape
   elements, were also analyzed. The results show no overall biodiversity
   variation as a result of different management practices. However,
   different groups of species react differently to specific management
   practices, and within a pasture, grazing impacts are heterogenous. In
   low grazing intensity plots, macrofungi species richness was found to be
   higher, while bird species richness was lower. Using tree regeneration
   as proxy for montado sustainability, results show less tree regeneration
   in areas with higher forage quality and more intense grazing. Pathways
   for future progress are proposed, including creating areas within a
   paddock that attract grazing away from where regeneration is desired.

Abstract = {{Large carnivore-human coexistence is a challenging issue in wildlife
   conservation worldwide. An adequate and diverse prey spectrum favours
   carnivore persistence. Prey depletion and habitat loss elicit conflict
   with humans and require sound conservation measures. We evaluated the
   conflict between common leopards and humans in a densely populated
   Himalayan forest area of Pakistan. In two decades, the local forests
   decreased at an average rate of 65.5 ha/year (6.6\%), with a concomitant
   increase in areas covered by human settlements (81.5\%) and agricultural
   lands (15.4\%). Ranging movements of a GPS/GSM-radiotagged male leopard
   over 16 months encompassed an area inhabited by c. 124,000 people.
   Livestock dominated the leopard's diet (absolute frequency of
   occurrence: 80\%), while wild ungulates were rarely eaten (absolute
   occurrence: 22\%). Domestic goats were the most frequent diet item
   (61\%), followed by domestic dogs (12\%) and Bos spp. (6\%). Wild prey
   included canids, small carnivores, rhesus monkeys, small mammals and
   gallinaceous birds. Socioeconomic implications of human-leopard
   coexistence were investigated: 18.5\% of the households interviewed (N =
   1016) suffered livestock depredation by leopards, with an overall loss
   of 123 USD/km(2)/year, in an area of 328 km(2). In the first c. 15 years
   of this century, about 2 attacks to humans/year were recorded, half of
   which were lethal, whereas c. 6 leopards/year were killed in
   retaliation. The common leopard is `critically endangered' in Pakistan
   mainly because of habitat loss and concurrent prey depletion. To
   increase the long-term survival of leopards and mitigate human-carnivore
   conflicts, priority should be given to restoration of a diverse natural
   prey assembly and protection of forest habitats, together with improved
   livestock management practices and livestock compensation. The latter
   will require a sustainable financial mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Weekly surveys following point count method during November 2016 to
   April 2017 in the campus of Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon
   Ratchasima province, resulted in the identification of 94 bird species
   belonging to 12 orders and 35 families. Altogether 3,328 individuals
   were observed. Out of 35 Families, Sturnidae and Sylviidae had the
   highest number of species (5 species each). Six simple dietary guilds
   were observed during the present study; the maximum number of species
   belonged to insectivore group and minimum to nectarivore. Analysis of
   data revealed that the average of species diversity index of the avian
   community (H') during the study period was 3.88. Using the Berger-Parker
   dominance value, we found the most abundant species was House sparrow
   (Passer domesticus), followed by Oriental turtle dove (Streptopelia
   orientalis), Peaceful Dove (Geopelia striata), Common Myna (Acridotheres
   tristis) and Red collared dove (Streptopelia tranquebarica). The
   threatened status of birds given in the checklist is as per IUCN Red
   List of Threatened Species 2017. The presence of Alexandrine parakeet
   (Psittacula eupatria) in the study, listed under the category `Near
   Threatened' in the IUCN Red List, is a matter of concern. The findings
   of the present study would provide the baseline information about the
   composition of the avian community and its distribution in the Suranaree
   University of Technology, which is an important ecosystem for the
   conservation of avian biodiversity. Many other areas adjacent to the
   campus also require attention for the inventory of avian communities.
   Therefore, a long-term database on exhaustive and intensive study of the
   North East Thailand is required.}},

Abstract = {{Williamson's Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus thyroideus) are montane woodpeckers
   threatened by widespread tree removal activities and climate change.
   Current forest management plans focus on nesting trees, but the
   incorporation of foraging trees would lead to a more effective
   management strategy to mitigate habitat loss for this species. We
   investigated the selection of foraging trees in forests managed for
   timber extraction and maintenance of wildlife values using foraging
   observations of 27 radio-tagged adult Williamson's Sapsuckers during the
   breeding season in 2 regions (Okanagan and Western) of their limited
   Canadian range. Characteristics of foraging trees (88\% of observations
   on live trees, 11\% on dead trees) differed with foraging mode. Large,
   live Douglas-firs (Pseudotsuga menziesii; >= 22.5 cm dbh) were used for
   gleaning and sap feeding on tree trunks in both regions, whereas trees
   used for trunk pecking were mostly large, senescent western larches
   (Larix occidentalis) in the Okanagan region and large, dead ponderosa
   pines (Pinus ponderosa) in the Western region (average dbh = 46 cm). For
   overall foraging activities, Williamson's Sapsuckers selected large,
   live Douglas-firs with signs of resin exudation and blistering
   (pitching), and avoided live lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta), quaking
   aspens (Populus tremuloides), and ponderosa pines. Larger trees and
   standing dead conifer trees were reused more often for foraging than
   smaller and live trees. The quality of Williamson's Sapsucker habitat
   could decrease over the long term if forest management practices reduce
   the overall size of trees or alter tree species composition to promote
   lodgepole pine. Forest management should focus on retaining and
   promoting large live Douglas-fir trees and large senescent or standing
   dead conifers (also used for nesting), which can be achieved by using
   thinning, prescribed fire, partial harvesting, and tree retention
   strategies.}},

   Tibetan Plateau case study}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{224}},
Pages = {{75-86}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Ecological restoration is becoming a primary strategy to increase
   provisions of ecosystem services and reverse biodiversity losses. In
   cultural landscapes undergoing land use extensification, rewilding has
   been proposed as a viable approach to reverse biodiversity loss through
   reducing human impacts. The world's largest ecological restoration
   campaign is taking place on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) to
   combat grassland degradation and enhance the upper stream region's water
   retention capacity. However, little is known about whether the
   large-scale rewilding also benefits the unique bird assemblage of the
   eastern QTP. Our study aims to make science-based conservation
   recommendations for the Tibetan avifauna by detecting their diversity
   and endemism distribution patterns at the local scale. In the breeding
   seasons of 2014 and 2015, we carried out bird surveys and conducted a
   habitat mapping using three Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We
   developed a comprehensive set of 2D and 3D habitat feature parameters
   from the high-resolution (10 cm level) UAV-derived images. Meanwhile, we
   employed the participatory GIS approach to acquire farm-scale human
   land-use data. Our results indicate that the distributions of avian
   diversity, endemism and abundance are not congruent across the eastern
   QTP, which calls for the conservation of different habitat types.
   Vertical and horizontal habitat heterogeneity maintain the local bird
   diversity with anthropogenic elements significantly enriching the
   overall bird abundance. Degraded pastures provided key habitats for two
   highly abundant endemic passerines the White-rumped Snowfinch
   Ortychosmuthus taczanowskii and the Ground Tit Pseudopodoces humilis. At
   the landscape scale, historical human-nature interactions between
   Tibetan nomads and the alpine environment formed the landscapes patchy
   vegetation structure. Our results reveal that the Tibetan cultural
   landscape maintains the structural heterogeneity needed to achieve
   multiple bird conservation objectives on the eastern QTP. Restoring the
   cultural landscape to a `natural' tall-grass or dense-shrubland state of
   high water-retention capacity may result in the loss of both
   high-abundance avian communities and endemic species diversity. Our
   empirical study also indicated that rewilding abandoned agricultural
   landscape will not necessarily lead to a desired conservation outcome,
   especially when the requirements of habitat specialists and endemics are
   not taken into account. Moreover, ecological restoration projects should
   evaluate the divergences between their ecosystem service and
   biodiversity objectives.}},

Abstract = {{There are currently competing demands on Europe's forests and the finite
   resources and services that they can offer. Forestry intensification
   that aims at mitigating climate change and biodiversity conservation is
   one example. Whether or not these two objectives compete can be
   evaluated by comparative studies of forest landscapes with different
   histories. We test the hypothesis that indicators of wood production and
   biodiversity conservation are inversely related in a gradient of long to
   short forestry intensification histories. Forest management data
   containing stand age, volume and tree species were used to model the
   opportunity for wood production and biodiversity conservation in five
   north European forest regions representing a gradient in landscape
   history from very long in the West and short in the East. Wood
   production indicators captured the supply of coniferous wood and total
   biomass, as well as current accessibility by transport infrastructure.
   Biodiversity conservation indicators were based on modelling habitat
   network functionality for focal bird species dependent on different
   combinations of stand age and tree species composition representing
   naturally dynamic forests. In each region we randomly sampled 25
   individual 100-km(2) areas with contiguous forest cover. Regarding wood
   production, Sweden's Bergslagen region had the largest areas of
   coniferous wood, followed by Vitebsk in Belarus and Zemgale in Latvia.
   NW Russia's case study regions in Pskov and Komi had the lowest values,
   except for the biomass indicator. The addition of forest accessibility
   for transportation made the Belarusian and Swedish study region most
   suitable for wood and biomass production, followed by Latvia and two
   study regions in NW Russian. Regarding biodiversity conservation, the
   overall rank among regions was opposite. Mixed and deciduous habitats
   were functional in Russia, Belarus and Latvia. Old Scots pine and Norway
   spruce habitats were only functional in Komi. Thus, different regional
   forest histories provide different challenges in terms of satisfying
   both wood production and biodiversity conservation objectives in a
   forest management unit. These regional differences in northern Europe
   create opportunities for exchanging experiences among different regional
   contexts about how to achieve both objectives. We discuss this in the
   context of land-sharing versus land-sparing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In a mountain context, the forest-shrub ecotone is an area of high
   biodiversity. Relatively little is known about the habitat requirements
   of birds in this habitat, yet it is facing potential threats from
   changes in grazing practices and climate change. Moreover, it is not
   clear at which scale habitat associations should be assessed in Alpine
   birds. Further information on key habitat components affecting bird
   communities of the ecotone is needed in order to inform management
   strategies to counteract potential habitat loss, and to better inform
   predictions of how bird communities may be affected by future
   environmental change. Data on bird occurrence and broadscale (land
   cover) and finescale (vegetation structure and shrub species
   composition) habitat variables were collected in an Alpine forest-shrub
   ecotone in Val Troncea (northwestern Italian Alps) in order to address
   two objectives: to identify the key habitat variables associated with
   the occurrence of individual species and with the diversity of the bird
   community; and, to assess which scale of habitat measurement
   (broadscale, finescale or both combined) is needed to model bird
   occurrence. Broadscale variables, or combinations of broadscale and
   finescale variables, tended to have the best performing models. When
   combined models performed best, shrub species identity was included in
   many cases. Shrubs also played an important role in explaining
   variations in species diversity and richness. Vegetation structure was
   of relatively little importance, either for individual bird species or
   for species richness and diversity. These findings suggest that
   management should strive to maintain a mosaic of habitats whilst
   minimizing forest encroachment, which could be achieved through targeted
   grazing. Broadscale habitat data and data on shrub species composition
   should provide a sufficient basis for identifying relevant
   species-specific habitat parameters in a mountain environment in order
   to model future scenarios of effects of habitat change on the bird
   community of the alpine forest-shrub ecotone.}},

Abstract = {{The Black Hills population of black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides
   arcticus) was petitioned, but deemed not warranted, to be listed as a
   threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act and
   more information on their population size in the region is needed. Our
   objective was to map abundance and provide a population estimate of
   black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains of
   South Dakota and Wyoming, USA. We conducted 3,666 and 3,384 5-minute
   point count surveys from late-March to late-June in 2015 and 2016,
   respectively. We characterized vegetation around each point using
   geographic information system-derived landscape variables and fit
   3-level hierarchical time-removal models in R package unmarked using
   gmultmix. The global abundance model received the most support and
   included year, latitude, and percent area of green trees, beetle-killed
   trees, dead trees, 1- to 2-year-old wildfire, 3-year-old wildfire, and
   4- to 5-year-old wildfire. Points with high percent cover of
   beetle-killed trees had the greatest density of black-backed
   woodpeckers, followed by 1- to 2-year-old wildfires. After 4 years,
   areas burned by wildfire supported lower densities of black-backed
   woodpeckers than undisturbed forests. Mean density was 0.528birds/km(2)
   in 2015 and 0.626birds/km(2) in 2016. There were an estimated 2,920 and
   3,439 black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge
   Mountains in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We suggest areas with high
   percent cover of beetle-killed trees may support high densities of
   black-backed woodpeckers and are important to sustaining populations
   when the availability of recent (<4 years old) wildfire is declining or
   scarce. Published 2018. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in

Abstract = {{Usable space for northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) has declined
   significantly over the past 3 decades in Texas because non-native
   grasses have replaced native vegetation. We hypothesized that burning
   patches in pastures dominated by buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare) and
   OldWorld bluestems (Bothriochloa spp. and Dichanthium spp.) followed by
   livestock grazing would increase limiting habitat attributes, thereby
   increasing usable space and bobwhite demographic parameters and
   population densities. Our study was conducted during 2009-2011 in
   LaSalle County, Texas on a ranch dominated by non-native grasses. Our
   experimental design was composed of 2 blocks with two 240-ha pastures,
   one control (graze only), and one treatment (patch-burn and graze) in
   each. We estimated grass standing crop in grazing exclosures
   (June-September) and habitat attributes along transects (October)
   2009-2011. Bobwhites were captured and monitored via radiotelemetry 2-3
   times/wk during March-November. Means of vegetation metrics important to
   bobwhites such as bare ground, traversibility, and forb and subshrub
   cover were similar between control and treatment units in post-treatment
   years. However, grass standing crop tended to be lower in treatment
   (June and August 2010 and September 2011-110.5 +/- 26.2 g/m(2)) compared
   with control units (June and August 2010 and September 2011-145.5 +/-
   58.6 g/m(2)). Plant species richness was also greater (21\%) in
   treatment (4.6 +/- 0.4/0.1 m(2)) compared with control units (3.8 +/-
   0.4/0.1 m(2)) during the last year of the study (P = 0.057). Patch
   heterogeneity was increased in treatment units. There was an increase in
   bobwhite densities in treatment units, although demographicmetrics
   remained similar between treatment and controls. Patch burning and
   grazing is a viable tool for managing monotypic non-native grasslands
   for bobwhites in semiarid environments. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Chaparral bird community responses to prescribed fire and shrub removal
   in three management seasons}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1615-1625}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Chaparral, a type of shrubland common throughout the California
   Floristic Province, is subject to management and removal in regions
   where wildfire threatens human lives and property. Management practices
   include conducting prescribed burns outside of the historical fire
   season and employing mechanical fuel reduction (mastication). As the
   wildland-urban interface grows, particularly in coastal California, more
   of this ecosystem is subject to active management.
   2. To understand the ecological implications of current California
   chaparral fire management practices, we studied bird species
   composition, abundance and foraging guilds in managed and unmanaged
   chaparral over 5 years. Study areas were located in Mendocino County in
   the coast ranges of northern California. We contrast six chaparral
   removal or ``fuels manipulation{''} treatments: (1) fall fire, (2)
   winter fire, (3) spring fire, (4) fall mastication, (5) spring
   mastication and (6) untreated control. Treatments and controls were
   implemented in plots 2 ha or larger, and replicated four times each.
   3. We find that species richness in prescribed fire treatments reaches
   comparable levels to controls in the first 3 years following treatment,
   whereas masticated units always have lower species richness. Generalized
   linear mixed models additionally confirm that mastication has highly
   negative effects on observed abundances of birds compared to controls
   and to prescribed fire.
   4. The season in which fuels reduction occurred was less important to
   species richness, although fall fire was more beneficial to bird
   abundance than spring or winter fire. Fire treatments in all seasons
   maintain the same general bird community structure as controls, while
   mastication results in strongly differentiated assemblages, increasing
   granivores while nearly excluding foliage gleaners.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We compare two California chaparral
   management techniques, prescribed fire and mastication, in three seasons
   (fall, winter and spring) in northern California, USA. We tracked
   chaparral bird community response in 23 experimental units for 2-5
   years. We conclude that prescribed fire and mastication are not
   interchangeable management techniques, and that mastication negatively
   impacts bird communities, altering guild structure and reducing both
   diversity and abundance.}},

Title = {{From unburnt to salvage logged: Quantifying bird responses to different
   levels of disturbance severity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1626-1636}},

Abstract = {{1. Forests world-wide are increasingly subject to natural and human
   disturbances, including wildfires and logging of varying intensity and
   frequency. Understanding how biodiversity responds to different kinds
   and combinations of natural and human disturbance is critical to
   enhanced forest management.
   2. We completed an 8-year study of bird responses across a spectrum of
   disturbance types in Australian mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans)
   forests following wildfires in 2009.
   3. We found evidence of a gradient in bird species richness over the
   study duration. It was highest in unlogged and unburned (least
   disturbed) sites, decreasing through burnt unlogged forest (subject to
   high or low intensity fire), lower still in logged forest, and lowest in
   the most disturbed sites (subject to salvage logging without island
   retention). Retention of uncut islands within logged areas increased
   bird species richness above that found in areas that had been clearcut.
   4. The greatest rate of increase per year after disturbance in bird
   species richness was on sites burnt by high-severity fire but which were
   not subject to any form of logging. The level of disturbance affected
   the composition of the bird assemblage. Sites that were unlogged and
   unburned were more likely to support species that were larger, more
   mobile, and nested at greater heights above the ground.
   5. Synthesis and applications. All forms of logging on burned sites
   impaired recovery in bird species richness relative to sites subject to
   high-severity fire. Alterations in stand structure and plant species
   composition (and hence modification in bird habitat suitability) due to
   logging are the most likely reasons for reduced bird species richness
   and delayed patterns of recovery. This study highlights the importance
   for native bird species of retaining patches of unlogged forest not only
   within otherwise clearcut forest, but also in areas that are burned and
   subject to salvage logging. We therefore suggest that the adoption of
   retention harvesting be expanded to include stands disturbed by
   wildfires.}},

Abstract = {{Between 2007 and 2008, we evaluated the seasonal richness, abundance and
   diversity of bird species in the Isla Mocha National Reserve, southern
   Chile. We recorded birds in point-count stations (radius = 50 m, length
   = 10 min) in five habitat types: coastline, pastureland, prairie with
   trees, forest-prairie ecotone, and Valdivian forest. We also include
   occasional records outside count points to determine species richness.
   In total, we recorded 70 species on the island. The habitat with higher
   species richness was the pastureland (29 species), followed by the
   forest-prairie ecotone, coastline (25 species, respectively), prairie
   with trees (21 species), and Valdivian forest (17 species). We did not
   detect seasonal patterns when we compared species richness among
   habitats. In all habitats, the abundance distribution among species
   showed the typical pattern of many organisms: few species were very or
   few abundant, and several had an intermediate abundance. However, the
   numerical dominance between species changed seasonally. The most regular
   species were Kelp Gull in the costline and pastureland, Chilean Lapwing
   in the pastureland, Black-chinned Siskin in the prairie with trees,
   Chilean Pigeon, Chucao Tapaculo and Thom-tailed Rayadito in the
   forest-prairie ecotone, and Chucao Tapaculo, Thom-tailed Rayadito, and
   Green-backed Firecrown in the Valdivian forest. All these species showed
   noticeable seasonal numerical fluctuations possibly caused by the
   recruitment of juveniles, reproductive congregation and/or variation in
   food availability. All habitats had a high diversity because they were
   rich in species and had high evenness among species regarding abundance.
   Avifaunally, the island Mocha represents a continental ``slice{''} of
   southern Chile as the similarity in habitat diversity of this island to
   the mainland result in similar bird assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide species density of hats is highest in forests ecosystems.
   European primeval forests are now reduced to a few small and isolated
   patches because almost all forests are subject to management. Therefore,
   knowledge about bats in ancient and near-natural forests in Europe is
   scarce. In the well-preserved forest stands of the Belovezhskaya Pushcha
   National Park in Belarus we studied the bat community (1), the presence
   of maternity colonies and their preference in tree roost selection (2)
   and parameters of roosts used by forest dwelling hats (3). By
   mist-netting surveys, we identified 13 hat species and acoustic data
   suggested the presence of another three species. We detected 15
   maternity colonies of seven bat species by radio-tracking reproductive
   females and 40 tree roosts within the forest. Roosts of Barbastella
   barbastellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Plecotus auritus were almost
   exclusively behind the loose tree bark of decaying trees, or within
   narrow crevices. Myotis nauereri and Nyetalus leisleri showed a
   preference towards hollows (e.g., woodpecker-made cavities) within oak
   trees (Quercus robur). Our study shows that all tree-dwelling bat
   species are highly dependent on natural processes within forests that
   allow the formation of roost sites. Therefore, we strongly support that
   the natural aging process of trees, as well as the consequences of
   natural disturbance (e.g. through weather), should be permitted. This
   should extend beyond the protected zones of National Parks. In contrast,
   sanitary cuttings decrease the habitat's suitability for forest-dwelling
   hats. Finally, our results indicate that the forest complex of
   Belovezhskaya Pushcha and Bialowi0.a is one of the most important bat
   areas in Europe.}},

Title = {{Interacting and non-linear avian responses to mixed-severity wildfire
   and time since fire}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire
   may help explain how pyrodiversity promotes biodiversity in fire-adapted
   systems. We built on previous research on avian responses to fire by
   investigating how complex effects of bum severity and time since fire
   influenced avian community composition across the northern Sierra
   Nevada, California. We conducted avian point counts from 2009 to 2015 in
   10 fires that burned between 2000 and 2014, resulting in a
   chronosequence of 1-15 yr post-fire. We estimated the effects of burn
   severity, time since fire, non-linear and interacting effects of fire
   severity and time since fire, pre-fire forest conditions, and several
   physiographic parameters on the density of 44 breeding bird species
   using hierarchical distance sampling models. In addition, we fit
   separate models to observations of each species in unburned forest to
   compare species' densities between burned and unburned forests. At least
   one of the non-linear or interaction fire effects was significant for 27
   (61\%) of the 44 bird species. The quadratic effect of time since fire
   was an important predictor of post-fire densities of 20 species,
   illustrating the dynamic nature of this post-wildfire avian community.
   Greater maximum densities were estimated at some combination of burn
   severity and time since fire than in unburned forest for 13 of the 44
   (30\%) species, only one of which reached maximum density following
   low-severity fire. In contrast, all of the 12 species that were more
   abundant in unburned forest reached maximum post-fire densities in fires
   that burned at low severity. Results from the study suggest that
   consideration of the non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity
   and time since fire is important to fully understanding post-wildfire
   responses for a majority of birds. Moreover, the study supports a
   growing body of literature that indicates mixed-severity fire is
   essential for conserving avian diversity in many fire-maintained
   systems.}},

Title = {{The persistence of Black-backed Woodpeckers following delayed salvage
   logging in the Sierra Nevada}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a snag-associated
   species that colonizes and utilizes patches of burned forests typically
   within 10 years of fire. Previous research has indicated that salvage
   logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a
   negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One
   strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on
   Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense
   snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely
   untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag
   islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve
   habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species.
   In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were
   effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following
   logging operations that covered 45\% of the burned area. We
   systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed
   Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and
   compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to
   other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined
   significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed
   Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral
   unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat
   for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this
   study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the
   first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year,
   which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed
   Woodpeckers postlogging.}},

Title = {{Effects of forest management on biodiversity in temperate deciduous
   forests: An overview based on Central European beech forests}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{213-226}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This overview of relationships between biodiversity and management
   focuses on Central European Fagus forests. Present management and
   conservation activities are embedded in the geographic and historic
   background of Central European forest flora, including endangered,
   protected, and plant species for which Germany has taken special
   responsibility to ensure their future survival. Managed and unmanaged
   forests are compared with respect to plants and other organisms. Based
   on the floristic background, management for climate change and
   consequences of conservation on a global ecological footprint will be
   discussed.
   The Central European tree flora contains only about 7\% of the tree
   diversity of East Asia. Only a few genera re-migrated to Central Europe
   after the Pleistocene, while others were lost during the Pleistocene,
   e.g. the genus Pseudotsuga.
   In this study the forest flora is characterized by specialized plant
   species that only grow in forests. These forest specialists contribute
   only 10\% of the plant species of the total German flora. This fraction
   is even less (4-5\%) for Romania which is generally regarded as a region
   with close to ``natural{''} forest conditions. Also, the forest flora of
   Germany and Romania contains fewer apomictic and hybrid plant species
   than the non-forest flora. No forest plant species have gone extinct in
   Germany in the past 250 years, which is the time since the first
   floristic documentation of a plant species that was lost in Thuringia,
   despite intense forest use including changes in dominant tree species.
   With respect to the Natura 2000 goals of maintaining species diversity
   of Europe, the deciduous forest, as managed by rotation forestry,
   contain more protected and endangered species, and species for which
   Germany has taken responsibility than protected forest. Forests managed
   with permanent forest cover (so-called ``management close-to-nature{''})
   contain fewer plant species than age-class (rotation) forestry. The
   abundance of dead wood-fungi and of soil bacteria is higher in rotation
   forest than in protected forests. For the initial phase of decay, a dead
   wood experiment identified two important tree species, Carpinus betulus
   and Picea abies, as the most preferred tree species for xylobionts.
   Carpinus has the most diverse fungal flora among all wood types and is a
   typical species for managed forests.
   The Natura 2000 habitat types were defined by plant species, but the
   assessment of ecosystem health is based on bird species in Central
   Europe. A time series extending from 1927 until 2015 indicates that most
   non-migratory forest bird species show an increasing abundance since
   1970. Adding migrating and rare bird species populations resulted in
   constant average abundances since 1970. There is no evidence that
   sustainable forest management has led to decreased biodiversity in
   Central Europe. In view of climate change and increasing presence of
   tree diseases, Europe should avoid enlarging its ecological footprint by
   taking Central European forests out of management.}},

Abstract = {{In the upper midwestern US and parts of Canada, forests dominated by
   Populus tremuloides (Aspen) are increasingly being considered as a
   bioenergy feedstock for power plants. When used for bioenergy, these
   forests are harvested at much younger ages than when they are used for
   more traditional products, such as pulpwood and lumber. To better
   understand the potential consequences of a shift in
   shorter-rotation-harvest strategies on avian communities, we employed
   point counts to examine bird community composition in a chronosequence
   (10-45 y since harvest) of 12 coppiced, even-aged Aspen stands. Young
   (8-15 y old), middle (20-44 y old), and mature (45 y old) stands had no
   significant differences in species richness or relative abundance, but
   distinct avian community assemblages were associated with each stand-age
   class. Four bird species were significantly associated with a particular
   age class. Maintaining a wide range of Aspen stand-age classes in the
   landscape appears to be the best strategy for conserving a diverse bird

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{624}},
Pages = {{1561-1576}},

Abstract = {{Birds are considered a good model for indicators of biodiversity
   response to habitat variations, as they are very sensitive to
   environmental change. However, continuous observations of habitat
   alterations from undisturbed landscapes to human-dominated ones, as well
   as the associated effects on bird biodiversity, are lacking. In this
   study, New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai, China was selected to illustrate
   the response of bird species, and thus biodiversity, to habitat loss and
   fragmentation. land use/land cover (LULC) data and bird records from
   2002 to 2013 were collected and analyzed. The results suggested that,
   due to urban sprawl, the area of wetland and shrub land had dropped by
   82.4\% and 87.3\% by the end of 2013. Four different urbanization stages
   were identified in terms of the spatio-temporal variations in the
   landscape. To measure bird biodiversity, species richness and relative
   abundance were calculated, and they could account for the overall trend
   in biodiversity but might mask the process of species replacement. As an
   indicator of biodiversity accounting, the mean species abundance (MSA)
   of the original species would not include exotic or invasive species in
   its calculation, and its value decreased from 100\% to 76.8\% to 52.2\%
   to 24.5\% in the four corresponding stages. Finally, suggested by
   redundant analysis, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on
   bird biodiversity differed in various bird communities, and the area and
   connectivity of wetlands were the most significant variables. Our
   findings could provide important information to inform bird biodiversity
   protection and habitat restoration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Understanding how the interplay between social behaviors and habitat
   structure influences space use is important for conservation of birds in
   restored habitat. We integrated fine-grained LiDAR-derived habitat data,
   spatial distribution of cavity trees, and spatially explicit behavioral
   observations in a multi-scale model to determine the relative importance
   of conspecific density, intraspecific interactions, and the distribution
   of cavities on space use by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis)
   on 2 sites in South Carolina, USA. We evaluated candidate models using
   information theoretic methods. Top scale-specific models included
   effects of conspecific density and number of cavity tree starts within
   200 m of Red-cockaded Woodpecker foraging locations, and effects of the
   number of intraspecific interactions within 400 m of Red-cockaded
   Woodpecker foraging locations. The top multi-scale model for 22 of 34
   Red-cockaded Woodpecker groups included covariates for the number of
   groups within 200 m of foraging locations and LiDAR-derived habitat with
   moderate densities of large pines (Pinus spp.) and minimal hardwood
   overstory. These results indicate distribution of neighboring groups was
   the most important predictor of space use once a minimal set of
   structural habitat thresholds was reached, and that placing recruitment
   clusters as little as 400 m from foraging partitions of neighboring
   groups may promote establishment of new breeding groups in unoccupied
   habitat. The presence of neighboring groups likely provides cues to
   foraging Red-cockaded Woodpeckers that facilitate prospecting prior to
   juvenile dispersal and, to a lesser extent, indicates high-quality
   forage resources. Careful consideration of local distribution of
   neighboring groups in potential habitat may improve managers' ability to
   increase Red-cockaded Woodpecker density on restored landscapes and
   mitigate isolation of Red-cockaded Woodpecker groups, a problem that
   negatively affects fitness across the species' range.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{88}},

Abstract = {{Landscapes are showing increased fragmentation and habitat loss due to
   land-use conversion and intensification, leading to species-poor and
   homogeneous communities. The identification of ecological thresholds
   above which major changes in community composition take place, may
   prevent the critical downfall of biodiversity while improving the
   effectiveness of conservation, resource management and restoration
   practices. In this study, we provide a new insight on how species
   distribute along a highly variegated agro-ecosystem in the Mediterranean
   region. We aim to define the thresholds of occurrence of a bird
   community inhabiting a tree canopy gradient, and determine the patterns
   of community change. We fit Huisman-Olff-Fresco models to bird
   occurrence data (assuming non-linear responses) to identify
   species-specific responses to the gradient, species richness, and
   turnover patterns. The tree canopy gradient is responsible for major
   changes in bird community likely related to the variation of the tree
   stratum and canopy enclosure which reflect different niche segregation
   opportunities. Maximum species richness was reached at 10\% canopy cover
   while total turnover rate was higher than expected from a null model up
   to 10\% canopy cover. Ecological thresholds can be used as indicators of
   specific resource limits responsible for changes in community
   composition and species occurrence, identifying where populations may be
   more sensitive. Choosing a single management scheme will invariably
   result in winners and losers, but optimal levels of management can be
   explored in order to maximize species diversity across Mediterranean
   agroecosystems.}},

   sustainable non-lethal techniques}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Resolving human-wildlife conflicts requires the assessment and
   implementation of appropriate technical measures that minimize negative
   impacts on socio-economic uses, including agriculture, and ensure the
   adequate protection of biological diversity. Rice paddies are widely
   distributed in the western Mediterranean region. Because of their high
   productivity, they can be a good habitat for waterbirds, including the
   purple swamphen Porphyrio porphyrio, particularly in areas where natural
   wetlands have been removed or reduced. As a result of its population
   growth, there have been increasing levels of damage caused by this
   species in rice fields due to stem-cutting and opening of bald patches
   in rice fields. With the aim of reducing damage, we evaluated the
   effectiveness of passive and active measures that would limit access to
   rice fields and deter/scare away purple swamphens in affected areas of
   the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). We selected the techniques according to the
   growth phase of rice and the activity of birds in the rice fields
   (perimeter fences and clearing vegetation around the rice plots during
   sprouting and growing phases, and falconry at maturation). There were
   positive results during the sprouting and growing phases thanks to
   fences and clearing vegetation, reducing the affected area by 37.8\%
   between treatment and control plots. This would mean an economic savings
   of 18,550 V/year in compensation payments by regional administrations
   including the investment in implementing and maintaining passive
   protection measures. Active deterrence through falconry did not reduce
   the level of damage. The analysis of purple swamphen home range,
   activity centers (centroids), and the proportion of locations in and
   outside of rice fields showed no differences before and after dissuasive
   practices. These results were influenced by multiple concurrent factors
   including weather, the structural configuration of the rice plots and
   their location. In summary, we recommend the establishment of protection
   measures (perimeter fences + clearing vegetation around the rice plots)
   to reduce the level of damage.}},

Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{The island of Borneo suffers from one of the highest deforestation rates
   in the world, primarily due to agriculture, logging, and other human
   activities. This habitat loss may be partly mitigated by reforestation
   programs in degraded landscapes, especially anthropogenic grasslands
   that have little conservation or economic value. By monitoring native
   bird communities, we evaluated the success of two small (<20 ha)
   community reforestation projects in Gunung Palung National Park in
   Indonesian Borneo. Birds responded rapidly following reforestation, with
   species richness doubling over 7 years at one site, and increasing by
   29\% in just 3 years at the other Final tallies (63-70 species per site)
   were comparable to those obtained in older secondary forests elsewhere
   in Borneo. Anthropogenic fire is the primary threat to reforestation
   success, but intensive fire prevention allows bird communities to
   recover from temporary setbacks. Absence of fire was thus the most
   important factor in recovery, and we detected no effect of replanted
   area on bird species richness. Our results suggest that by engaging
   local communities and ensuring long-term maintenance, even small
   reforestation sites in Borneo can provide immediate benefits for native

Volume = {{88}},

Abstract = {{We studied how interactions between disturbances, succession, human
   alterations and other habitat and landscape attributes affect bird
   community patterns in a lower reach of a large West Carpathian river Vah
   with complex disturbance and alteration histories. Breeding-bird
   communities, their habitats (54 variables) and surrounding landscapes
   (11 metrics) were sampled using standardized point counts with limited
   distances at 40 riparian sites divided among two transects along a 12.9
   km river stretch. The most frequent and abundant birds were generalists
   typically associated with forest edge habitats, such as Parus major,
   Sylvia atTicapilla, Fringilla coelebs, Oriolus oriolus, Phylloscopus
   collybita, Sturnus vulgaris, Turdus merula and Luscinia megarhynchos.
   Abundances show significant increase at the lower transect responding
   apparently to greater size and heterogeneity of riparian habitats and
   more abundant food supply linked to more diverse and intense human
   influences in a suburban zone. Both indirect (NMDS) and direct
   ordination (CCA) revealed remarkably large number of evenly important
   factors underlying riparian bird-habitat interactions. It suggests
   considerable environmental heterogeneity and complexity of these
   interactions as a likely outcome of long and complex disturbance and
   alteration histories of the area. Yet structure and relative importance
   of first two gradients (longitudinal and lateral linkages) remains
   simple and stable, complying well with predictions of river continuum
   concept and stream ecosystem theory. Of the nine statistically
   significant variables most strongly correlated with first two CCA axes,
   percentages of Helianthus tuberosus, footpaths, fields, Calystegia
   sepium and steep banks uphold our hypotheses predicting significant
   effects of invasive species, visitor disturbances, agricultural land use
   and unaltered river banks/bed on bird community composition and
   structure. A small but significant contribution of patch size standard
   deviation within a 150 m radius to the CCA model provides the sole
   evidence for a hypothesized effect of adjacent terrestrial landscapes on
   riparian bird communities over different scales of patch size
   variability. Percentages of fields, invasive species and vertical banks
   along with average tree diameter were also the most productive
   predictors across our generalized linear models of riparian bird species
   diversity, evenness and abundance. Adopting an integrated river basin
   management, maintaining or restoring both longitudinal and lateral
   connectivity, taking advantage of natural processes and traditional
   management practices to maintain or restore riverine biodiversity can be
   recommended by our data in support of more systematic and evidence-based
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental pollution is an important driver of biodiversity loss.
   Yet, to date, the effects of chemical exposure on wildlife populations
   have been quantified for only a few species, mainly due to a lack of
   appropriate laboratory data to quantify chemical impacts on vital rates.
   In this study, we developed a method to quantify the effects of toxicant
   exposure on wildlife population persistence based on field monitoring
   data. We established field-based vital-rate-response functions for
   toxicants, using quantile regression to correct for the influences of
   confounding factors on the vital rates observed, and combined the
   response curves with population viability modelling. We then applied the
   method to quantify the impact of DDE on three bird species: the
   White-tailed Eagle, Bald Eagle, and Osprey. Population viability was
   expressed via five population extinction vulnerability metrics:
   population growth rate (r(1)), critical patch size (CPS), minimum viable
   population size (MVP), probability of population extirpation (PE), and
   median time to population extirpation (MTE). We found that past DDE
   exposure concentrations increased population extirpation vulnerabilities
   of all three bird species. For example, at DDE concentrations of 25mg/kg
   wet mass of egg (the maximum historic exposure concentration reported in
   literature for the Osprey), r(1) became small (White-tailed Eagle and
   Osprey) or close to zero (Bald Eagle), the CPS increased up to almost
   the size of Connecticut (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey) or West Virginia
   (Bald Eagle), the MVP increased up to approximately 90 (White-tailed
   Eagle and Osprey) or 180 breeding pairs (Bald Eagle), the PE increased
   up to almost certain extirpation (Bald Eagle) or only slightly elevated
   levels (White-tailed Eagle and Osprey) and the MTE became within decades
   (Bald Eagle) or remained longer than a millennium (White-tailed Eagle
   and Osprey). Our study provides a method to derive species-specific

Abstract = {{Tillage soil erosion is seen as a great problem in the Mediterranean
   region and is worsened by the climatic conditions. Previous studies have
   shown a decrease in biodiversity in arable lands across Europe. Weeds
   are a major component of biodiversity within agro-ecosystems, but few
   studies have aimed to associate weed species with soil tillage
   intensity. We performed an analysis to test the potential short-term
   effects of different tillage systems on weed species under our study
   conditions. The emerged weed data were measured, comparing a
   conventional tillage system with conservational tillage systems (minimum
   tillage and no tillage) in 2 cropping systems (monoculture wheat and a
   rotation scheme of barley-legume-wheat-fallow). Compared with the tilled
   soil, higher weed density and weed species richness were observed in the
   conservation tillage plots. The weed density and weed species richness
   in the monoculture system were higher compared with those in the crop
   rotation system. We used classification and regression trees to analyze
   the relationship between the soil tillage systems and the weed
   community, taking into account the climatic conditions. The results
   indicate that different soil tillage systems produced tree models:
   Silene vulgaris (L.) was associated with the MT system and high and
   irregularly distributed rainfall; Hypecoum imberbe Sm. and Hypecoum
   procumbens (L.) were linked to MT plots with low and well-distributed
   precipitation rates; and Cardaria draba (L.) was present all years
   independently of climatic conditions but was never found in the NT
   system, so its presence could be regarded as an indicator of tillage
   intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances are important natural factors affecting biological
   diversity, community composition, and ecosystem structure. The European
   ground squirrel is a semi-fossorial organism, and through disturbances
   caused by burrowing activities, it can play an important role as an
   ecosystem engineer of grasslands in central and south-eastern Europe.
   The aim of this study was to assess the response of grassland vegetation
   to disturbances by the European ground squirrel. We conducted a pairwise
   survey within a 1-ha study site with homogenous environmental
   conditions. We compared the vegetation characteristics of 2 x 2-m plots
   placed on 30 mounds, with paired control plots situated at a distance of
   10 m from each mound. The results showed that plots disturbed by the
   European ground squirrel achieved a higher species richness and
   diversity and a distinct species composition compared to the undisturbed
   control plots. Vertical structure of vegetation was also significantly
   different with a higher proportion of the high and medium vegetation
   layers on the mounds. Shifts in the composition of plant life forms and
   life strategies were reflected by the reduction of graminoids and plant
   competitors, and support of forbs on the mounds. These findings suggest
   that the European ground squirrel helps to maintain heterogeneity in
   grassland ecosystems and creates patches of higher diversity and higher
   structural complexity in the relatively homogenous grassland vegetation
   of the Western Carpathians.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 15 requires global
   restoration of degraded ecosystems including complex examples. A case is
   made for the deliberate creation of woodlands with ancient
   characteristics. In the temperate biome, efforts to restore such
   communities will be accelerated by intervention facilitating natural
   succession. Negative rhetoric regarding the irreplaceability of ancient
   communities may hinder such considerations. Some facets of ancient woods
   are irreplaceable and their destruction is discouraged. Nevertheless, as
   human population and impact increase, this resource will degrade. Though
   understanding of many ecological processes is incomplete, ecological
   restoration requires proactivity. Physicians need not fully understand
   the healing process to rely upon it and, fortunately, ecology carries
   similar intangible reliables; natural succession occurs and complex
   communities actively self-assemble. Accepting this, then woodland with
   many characteristics of ancientness can be deliberately created.
   Thermodynamic principles may assist and seeking to initiate a
   biodiversity cascade is proposed as a pragmatic approach. The intricacy
   that defines ancient woodland might thus be assembled in timescales of
   less than a century. Ascension Island's anthropogenic cloud forest
   provides a precedent. For utilitarian purposes, human-mediated plant
   dispersal (deliveries of plants to the island), led to the
   transformation of species-poor, fern-dominated hillsides to species-rich
   cloud forest in about 100 years. How much more could be achieved with
   appropriate ecological intention?.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Habitat loss and fragmentation continue to threaten the
   survival of many species. One such species is the Blue Swallow Hirundo
   atrocaerulea, a critically endangered grassland specialist bird species
   endemic to sub-Saharan Africa.
   Objectives: Past research has shown a serious decline in range and
   abundance of this species, predominantly because of habitat
   transformation and fragmentation.
   Method: The influence of land cover on Blue Swallow habitat and foraging
   home range, in both natural and transformed habitats, was investigated
   by radio tracking adult birds.
   Results: Results showed that tracked birds spent over 80\% of their
   forage time over grasslands and wetland habitats, and preferentially
   used these ecotones as forage zones. This is likely owing to an increase
   in insect mass and abundance in these habitats and ecotones. There was
   reduced selection and avoidance of transformed habitats such as
   agricultural land, and this is a concern as transformed land comprised
   71\% of the home range with only 29\% of grassland and wetland mosaic
   remaining for the Blue Swallows to breed and forage in, highlighting the
   importance of ecotones as a key habitat requirement. The results
   indicate that management plans for the conservation of Blue Swallows
   must consider protecting and conserving natural habitats and maintaining
   mosaic of grassland and wetland components to maximise ecotones within
   conserved areas.
   Conclusion: To this end, the stewardship programme spearheaded by local
   conservation agencies, which aims to formally conserve privately owned
   patches of untransformed grassland and other natural habitats, may have
   a strong impact on the long-term persistence of Blue Swallow
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of a species' ecological requirements is a prerequisite for
   effective conservation, particularly if the species is assumed to be
   declining due to modification of its primary habitats. Information about
   habitat suitability allows both the inference of specific habitat
   management measures as well as population size estimates which can
   facilitate the setting up of conservation priorities. As one of the
   least known Palaearctic breeding birds, the current knowledge of
   Baillon's Crake Zapornia pusilla comprises only very general information
   about the species' ecological requirements, habitat selection, extent
   and dynamics of home ranges or population densities within its
   Palaearctic-Afrotropical range. We used a multi-scale approach to assess
   the species' habitat requirements in the Senegal River Delta, north-west
   Senegal. At the individual level, we calculated Manly selection indices
   for 17 radio-tracked Baillon's Crakes, allowing for different levels of
   resource availability. Considering the entire Djoudj area including the
   Parc National des Oiseaux du Djoudj (PNOD), we modelled presence
   probability as well as population density of Baillon's Crakes based on
   high-resolution satellite images and capture data from field surveys in
   2009-2013. Using 95\% kernels, home range size was on average 1.77 +/-
   0.86 ha with significant differences between habitats. Both at the
   individual as well as population level, Baillon's Crakes preferred edge
   structures, selecting for trampling paths and edges along open water
   bodies as well as boundaries of specific vegetation stands while species
   composition was of less importance. Based on the regression models, we
   identified 9,516 ha of suitable habitat within the Djoudj area and a
   potential population size of 10,714 individuals (range 3,146-17,408).
   Although global population estimates are highly tentative, we assume the
   Senegal River Delta and the PNOD of outstanding significance for African
   and possibly also European populations of Baillon's Crake.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Forests are the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems and their biological
   diversity includes trees, but also other plants, animals, and
   micro-organisms. One-third of the forested land is in boreal zone;
   therefore, changes in biological diversity in boreal forests can shape
   biodiversity, even at global scale. Several forest attributes, including
   size variability, amount of dead wood, and tree species richness, can be
   applied in assessing biodiversity of a forest ecosystem. Remote sensing
   offers complimentary tool for traditional field measurements in mapping
   and monitoring forest biodiversity. Recent development of small unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable the detailed characterization of forest
   ecosystems through providing data with high spatial but also temporal
   resolution at reasonable costs. The objective here is to deepen the
   knowledge about assessment of plot-level biodiversity indicators in
   boreal forests with hyperspectral imagery and photogrammetric point
   clouds from a UAV. We applied individual tree crown approach (ITC) and
   semi-individual tree crown approach (semi-ITC) in estimating plot-level
   biodiversity indicators. Structural metrics from the photogrammetric
   point clouds were used together with either spectral features or
   vegetation indices derived from hyperspectral imagery. Biodiversity
   indicators like the amount of dead wood and species richness were mainly
   underestimated with UAV-based hyperspectral imagery and photogrammetric
   point clouds. Indicators of structural variability (i.e., standard
   deviation in diameter-at-breast height and tree height) were the most
   accurately estimated biodiversity indicators with relative RMSE between
   24.4\% and 29.3\% with semi-ITC. The largest relative errors occurred
   for predicting deciduous trees (especially aspen and alder), partly due
   to their small amount within the study area. Thus, especially the
   structural diversity was reliably predicted by integrating the
   three-dimensional and spectral datasets of UAV-based point clouds and
   hyperspectral imaging, and can therefore be further utilized in
   ecological studies, such as biodiversity monitoring.}},

Title = {{Reduced gene flow in a vulnerable species reflects two centuries of
   habitat loss and fragmentation}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the effects of landscape modification on gene flow of
   fauna is central to informing conservation strategies that promote
   functional landscape connectivity and population persistence. We
   explored the effects of large-scale habitat loss and fragmentation on
   spatial and temporal patterns of gene flow in a threatened Australian
   woodland bird: the Grey-crowned Babbler Pomatostomus temporalis. Using
   microsatellite data, we (1) investigated historical (i.e.,
   pre-fragmentation) and contemporary (i.e., postfragmentation) levels of
   gene flow among subpopulations and/or regions, (2) identified
   first-generation migrants and likely dispersal events, (3) tested for
   signatures of genetic bottlenecks, (4) estimated contemporary and
   historical effective population sizes, and (5) explored the relative
   influences of drift and migration in shaping contemporary population
   structure. Results indicated that the functional connectivity of
   landscapes used by the Grey-crowned Babbler is severely compromised in
   the study area. The proportion of individuals that were recent
   immigrants among all subpopulations were low. Habitat fragmentation has
   led to a clear division between subpopulations in the east and west, and
   the patterns of gene flow exchange between these two regions have
   changed over time. The effective population size estimates for these two
   regions are now well below that required for long-term population
   viability (N-e<100). Demographic history models indicate that genetic
   drift was a greater influence on subpopulations than gene flow, and most
   subpopulations show signatures of bottlenecks. Translocations to promote
   gene flow and boost genetic diversity in the short term and targeted
   habitat restoration to improve landscape functional connectivity in the
   long term represent promising conservation management strategies that
   will likely have benefits for many other woodland bird species.}},

Abstract = {{With ongoing degradation of natural forests and spread of forest
   plantations, plantations must play an increasingly important role in
   biodiversity conservation. Study of habitat selection and reproductive
   success of surrogate species in plantations can guide forest management
   decisions for increasing biodiversity. In this paper we studied the
   suitability of exotic Eucalyptus plantations managed at low intensity in
   northwestern Spain as breeding habitat for Northern Goshawk (Accipiter
   gentilis), a top predator frequently considered a surrogate species in
   conservation.
   Goshawks showed high breeding density, high reproductive success and a
   regular spatial distribution of nesting territories. Territoriality was
   the most important determinant of habitat selection.
   Goshawks selected extra-mature Eucalyptus trees in areas of high
   structural complexity (high tree density, tree species richness, and
   number of tree strata) in the most heterogeneous forest stands
   (old-mixed Eucalyptus). Reproductive success decreased with increasing
   local density of breeding pairs, but reproductive success was not
   related to structural characteristics of nest stands.
   The studied plantations provided a suitable breeding habitat for
   Goshawks. The birds preferred to nest in large Eucalyptus trees with
   appropriate structure in their immediate surroundings. The strong
   preference of Goshawks for structurally mature forest patches may make
   them useful as a surrogate species for assessing the ability of forest
   management practices to promote overall biodiversity in exotic
   Eucalyptus plantations exploited at low intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, riparian ecosystems are in decline due to anthropogenic
   modifications, including damming. Reduced frequency and altered timing
   of flood events decreases sandbar deposition, which reduces habitat for
   sandbar-breeding birds, including the threatened Piping Plover
   (Charadrius melodus). In response to limited breeding habitat and small
   populations, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed 255 ha of
   sandbar habitat on the Missouri River, USA, from 2004 to 2009. During
   the breeding seasons of 2010 and 2011, historically high flows resulted
   in the creation of 1,046 ha of suitable sandbar habitat on the Missouri
   River. We compared the demographic responses of Piping Plovers to this
   anthropogenic and natural habitat creation. We found that demographic
   parameters, including nest success ((X) over bar (preflood) = 0.45 +/-
   0.02 SE vs. (X) over bar (postflood) = 0.74 +/- 0.02 SE), prefledging
   chick survival ((X) over bar (preflood) = 0.39 +/- 0.09 SE vs. (X) over
   bar (postflood) = 0.65 +/- 0.03 SE), and hatch-year survival ((X) over
   bar (preflood) = 0.16 +/- 0.03 SE vs. (X) over bar (postflood) = 0.46
   +/- 0.03 SE), were consistently higher on the flood-created habitat than
   on the engineered habitat, leading to population growth after the flood.
   These differences were related to increased sandbar habitat, low nesting
   densities, and decreased nest and chick predation. As ecosystems are
   increasingly altered, ecologists seldom have the opportunity to make
   appropriate comparisons between managed and natural ecosystem processes.
   Our results suggest that management intervention may not be an
   appropriate substitute for natural ecosystem processes in riparian
   ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the benefits of agri-environment schemes on farmland bird
   communities through a common species monitoring programme. A case study
   in northern Italy}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{160}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity in agricultural environments is considered to be undergoing
   steep declines in most European countries. Among taxa which experienced
   consistent decreases, birds are of central importance, both for their
   value as ecological indicators and for the high number of species of
   conservation concern associated with agricultural ecosystems.
   In this paper, using data from the Italian Common Breeding Bird
   monitoring programme collected in the period 2009-2014, we analysed the
   effect on breeding birds of four Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) in
   Emilia-Romagna region, one of the most important agricultural areas of
   Italy. Specifically we compared the values of three community parameters
   (total, farmland and generalist species richness) and the abundance of
   seven species (Alandn arvensis, Hirundo rustica, Motacilla fiava,
   Serinus serinus, Chloris chloris, Carduelis carduelis and Passer
   montanus) in areas covered by AES and not.
   The results of the analyses show that, at the scale we investigated, the
   positive effects of these measures are very limited and often not
   positive, particularly for farmland specialist species. These findings
   seem to suggest that the application of these measures, albeit
   widespread over the Region, is not able to counteract the negative
   effects of the simplification and impoverishment of the agricultural
   landscape. Our results show the AES management related more with single
   species metrics than community measures. Therefore to improve the
   effectiveness of AES, and to try to contrasts the dramatic decline of
   farmland bird species, we think these schemes should be designed on the
   specific needs of species and habitats of high conservation priority.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental rearrangements by ecosystem engineers influence food-web
   characteristics by altering resource accessibility/availability in the
   newly created habitat. However, the paucity of empirical studies on this
   indirect interaction has hindered the integration of ecosystem
   engineering and food-web theory. Here, we investigated the effect of the
   Canadian beaver Castor canadensis on the activity, realized fecundity
   and ecosystem functions provided by saproxylic beetles by quantifying
   beetle emergence holes on woody debris within the Kouchibouguac National
   Park, New Brunswick, Canada. We tested the hypothesis that perturbation
   induced by beaver activity enhances the activity and realized fecundity
   of saproxylic beetles by modifying their habitat and resource
   accessibility. We used 16 sites identified as beaver modified, each
   paired with a control site <500m away. At each site, we quantified
   insect emergence holes on snags at increasing distances from the
   watercourse. Our results suggest that engineered habitat patches enhance
   the activity and reproduction of saproxylic beetle species, small
   emergence holes from Scolytinae being only observed in abundance on
   small trees located close to the watercourse and large emergence holes
   from Cerambycidae being one third more abundant throughout
   beaver-modified sites. The complementary relationship between the
   Canadian beaver and saproxylic beetles demonstrates the potential for
   conservation measures encapsulating all of these organisms.}},

   literature review, we describe how that concern led to a landmark
   conservation agreement in 1916, between the United States and Great
   Britain (on behalf of Canada) to conserve migratory birds shared by
   Canada and the United States. Drawing on published literature and our
   personal experience, we describe how subsequent enabling acts in both
   countries gave rise to efforts to better estimate population sizes and
   distributions, assess harvest rates and demographic impacts, design and
   fund landscape-level habitat conservation initiatives, and organize
   necessary political and regulatory processes. Executing these steps
   required large-scale thinking, unprecedented regional and international
   cooperation, ingenuity, and a commitment to scientific rigor and
   adaptive management. We applaud the conservation efforts begun 100 years
   ago with the Migratory Bird Treaty Convention. The agreement helped
   build the field of wildlife ecology and conservation in the twentieth
   century but only partially prepares us for the ecological and social
   challenges ahead. (C) 2017 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated population models (IPMs) represent a formal statistical
   methodology for combining multiple data sets such as population counts,
   band recoveries, and fecundity estimates into a single unified analysis
   with dual objectives: better estimating population size, trajectory, and
   vital rates; and formally describing the ecological processes that
   generated these patterns. Although IPMs have been used in population
   ecology and fisheries management, their use in wildlife management has
   been limited. Data sets available for North American waterfowl are
   unprecedented in terms of time span (> 60 years) and geographic
   coverage, and are especially well-suited for development of IPMs that
   could improve the understanding of population ecology and help guide
   future harvest and habitat management decisions. In this overview, we
   illustrate 3 potential benefits of IPMs: integration of multiple data
   sources (i.e., population counts, mark-recapture data, and fecundity
   estimates), increased precision of parameter estimates, and ability to
   estimate missing demographic parameters by reanalyzing results from a
   historical study of canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria). Drawing from our
   own published and unpublished work, we demonstrate how IPMs could be
   used to identify the critical vital rates that have had the greatest
   influence on population change in lesser scaup (Aythya affinis),
   evaluate potential mechanisms of harvest compensation for American black
   ducks (Anas rubripes), or prioritize the most appropriate places to
   conduct habitat management to benefit northern pintails (Anas acuta).
   Integrated population models provide a powerful platform for evaluating
   alternative hypotheses about population regulation and they have
   potential to advance the understanding of wildlife ecology and help
   managers make ecologically based decisions. (C) 2017 The Wildlife

Abstract = {{Impacts on birds of intensive management practices and of landscape
   simplification have been widely studied, but there is a lack of
   knowledge about impacts on birds of landscapes associated with intensive
   livestock production. The objective of this work was to investigate
   changes in several bird community descriptors along different production
   gradients. Production of amble crops and from grazing livestock was
   computed over French agroecosystems and expressed in terms of edible
   energy. Using data from the French Breeding Bird Survey along with data
   from national agricultural statistics, we modeled the relationship
   between production and five bird community descriptors, namely,
   community trophic index, community specialization index, and three group
   specific species richness indices. Bird communities were shaped by two
   production gradients. Along a gradient of increasing crop production, we
   observed a shift from locally species-diverse communities dominated by
   generalist or grassland specialist species towards species-poor
   communities dominated by granivorous species specialized in arable
   habitats (all p-values <= 0.002). Second, we observed a shift towards
   homogenized communities dominated by generalists along a gradient of
   increasing livestock production (p-values 0.001). Our research
   highlights the need to consider crop and livestock separately when
   investigating their impacts on biodiversity. It also hints towards the
   need for differentiated strategies to protect farmland birds in crop
   regions and in livestock regions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Logging to ``salvage{''} economic returns from forests affected by
   natural disturbances has become increasingly prevalent globally. Despite
   potential negative effects on biodiversity, salvage logging is often
   conducted, even in areas otherwise excluded from logging and reserved
   for nature conservation, inter alia because strategic priorities for
   post-disturbance management are widely lacking.
   2. A review of the existing literature revealed that most studies
   investigating the effects of salvage logging on biodiversity have been
   conducted less than 5years following natural disturbances, and focused
   on non-saproxylic organisms.
   3. A meta-analysis across 24 species groups revealed that salvage
   logging significantly decreases numbers of species of eight taxonomic
   groups. Richness of dead wood dependent taxa (i.e. saproxylic organisms)
   decreased more strongly than richness of non-saproxylic taxa. In
   contrast, taxonomic groups typically associated with open habitats
   increased in the number of species after salvage logging.
   4. By analysing 134 original species abundance matrices, we demonstrate
   that salvage logging significantly alters community composition in 7 of
   17 species groups, particularly affecting saproxylic assemblages.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that salvage logging
   is not consistent with the management objectives of protected areas.
   Substantial changes, such as the retention of dead wood in naturally
   disturbed forests, are needed to support biodiversity. Future research
   should investigate the amount and spatio-temporal distribution of
   retained dead wood needed to maintain all components of biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic birds are important biotic components of Lake Ecosystem serving
   as indicator of pollution, sources of protein, fishing agent, income,
   recreation, tourism, sport and pest control. The aim of this study was
   to provide a baseline data and checklist of the bird assemblages in Asa
   Lake, Ilorin, Nigeria. Bird sampling was conducted weekly for 24 weeks,
   by walking 10 mS(-1) along a line transect on the bank of the lake. The
   populations were classified as rare, frequently seen and common based on
   the number of sightings, and abundance. Diversity indices such as
   dominance, evenness, Simpson diversity, Shanon-Weiner diversity,
   Marglef's richness were estimated. 13682 birds consisting of 17 species
   in 9 families were recorded in the lake. Species were found in highest
   number during the rains. Water fowl was the most abundant species
   42.21\%. African jacana was the least abundant constituting 0.67\%.
   Family Ardeidae was the most abundant in terms of species diversity.
   Three species were commonly seen, four frequently seen, while nine were
   rare. Diversity indices of the bird species were; (D) 0.045, (1-D) 0.95;
   (e<\^{}>H/S) 0.96, Margalef richness 3.67 and (H) 2.99. The assemblage
   of bird species in the lake was high due to the availability of food,
   submerged aquatic macrophytes seeds and foliage, large volume of water,
   surface area and depth of the lake and absence of large predators.
   Morphological characteristics and behavioural tactics of the birds were
   attributed to the high occurrence of some of the birds. For continued
   residency of the birds in the lake, lake best management practices
   (LBMP) should be implemented. Continuous monitoring of the birds (bio
   monitor) in the lake should also be done to give an insight into the
   ecological conditions of the lake and at the same time serving as
   aesthetic organisms in the lake.}},

Abstract = {{Land use has already reshaped local biodiversity on Earth, with effects
   expected to increase as human populations continue to grow in both
   numbers and prosperity. An accurate depiction of the state of
   biodiversity on our planet, combined with identifying the mechanisms
   driving local biodiversity change, underpins our ability to predict how
   different societal priorities and actions will influence biodiversity
   trajectories. Quantitative syntheses provide a fundamental tool by
   taking information from multiple sources to identify generalisable
   patterns. However, syntheses, by definition, combine data sources that
   have fundamentally different purposes, contexts, designs and sources of
   error and bias; they may thus provide contradictory results, not because
   of the biological phenomena of interest, but due instead to combining
   diverse data. While much attention has been focussed on the use of
   space-for-time substitution methods to estimate the impact of land-use
   change on terrestrial biodiversity, we show that the most common study
   designs all face challenges-either conceptual or logistical-that may
   lead to faulty inferences and ultimately mislead quantitative syntheses.
   We outline these study designs along with their advantages and
   difficulties, and how quantitative syntheses can combine the strengths
   of each class of design.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated how fire impacts the ecological coherence of Aleppo pine
   forests and their biodiversity over a 40-year period. The study area
   forms part of an insular ecosystem of Zakynthos Island (Zante) in
   western Greece, which forms part of the Ionian Islands. Post-fire
   effects were studied for both plant and bird diversity at 20 sampling
   plots, using stratified random sampling, during the summer of 2012. The
   plots were selected based on the frequency of burning since the 1970s.
   Sites were categorized as: 1) no burning for >40 years, 2) burnt once in
   the 1970s, 3) burnt twice, first in the 1970s and again in 2000-2010, 4)
   burnt three times, first in the 1970s. and twice more in 2000-2010, and
   5) burnt four times, first in the1970s, twice more in 2000-2010. and
   again in 2011. A total of 79 plant species and 26 bird species were
   recorded at the studied sites. One-way ANOVA analysis showed that fire
   intensity has a significant impact on alpha floristic diversity. Average
   plant species richness at sites that burned in 2011 was significantly
   higher than in those that burned in the 1970s. Detected differences in
   bird species richness were not significant; however, more species were
   documented in the forested habitats (unburnt for >40 years, and burnt in
   the 1970s). The highest Jaccard similarity index was observed between
   the sites that had not burned for more than 40 years and the sites that
   burned in the 1970s. The lowest floristic similarity to non-burnt sites
   was observed between the recently burnt sites in 2011 and the sites that
   burned in the 1970s. The lowest bird similarity was detected between
   recently burnt sites in 2011 and sites that had not burned for more than
   40 years. DCA ordination showed the presence of a clear fire gradient,
   from intensively burnt open sites to non-burnt forest sites. We suggest
   that fire is essential to maintain biodiversity in Aleppo pine forests,
   but only at intermediate frequency.}},

Title = {{Goat paddock grazing improves the conservation status of
   shrub-encroached dry grasslands}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Number = {{38}},
Pages = {{215-233}},
Abstract = {{European dry grasslands are predominantly semi-natural communities.
   Commonly, they have been used as pastures for sheep and goats. Due to
   their richness in biological diversity and the large number of
   threatened species, they are recognized as being of high conservation
   value. However, in the last few decades, a dramatic decline in dry
   grassland areas has been observed throughout Europe. Pasture abandonment
   followed by grass and shrub encroachment are the main causes of dry
   grassland loss, especially at isolated marginal sites. The introduction
   of goat paddock grazing can be an efficient method for restoring
   shrub-encroached dry grasslands, but most recommendations are still
   based on anecdotal evidence. Hence, this study investigated the impact
   of goat paddock grazing with a relatively high grazing pressure (0.6 to
   0.8 LU/ha/yr) over seven years on habitat structure and species richness
   in six encroached dry grassland localities of the lower Saale River
   valley in Central Germany. In each paddock, we analyzed 25-m(2) plots in
   highly (initial woody species cover of >= 25\%) and less encroached
   areas (initial woody species cover < 25\%) and compared the development
   of woody species, grass encroachment indicators, litter cover and the
   share of bare soil as well as the coverage and number of target and
   ruderal species with that of ungrazed control plots.
   We observed the following effects of restorative goat paddock grazing:
   Woody plants and litter layer cover declined significantly in all
   paddock plots. In addition, the share of bare soil increased
   significantly in the less encroached paddock plots. The number of target
   species increased significantly in the formerly highly encroached plots,
   whereas the already high target species richness slightly increased on
   originally less encroached plots. Besides short-lived target species,
   even red list species were able to colonize the grazed plots.
   Furthermore, we observed a slightly increasing number of ruderal
   species, but at a very low level of coverage. An opposite trend was
   recorded in the ungrazed plots: The cover of woody and competitive grass
   species, as well as litter coverage, increased significantly over time.
   While the cover of target species decreased significantly in the highly
   encroached plots, the number of target species stayed stable in both
   types of control plots, showing the restoration potential of the
   encroached grasslands.
   Based on our findings, we conclude that goat paddock grazing with a
   relatively high grazing pressure can be an effective tool to restore
   encroached dry grasslands. The reduction of encroachment and the
   increasing number of target species correlates with the improved
   conservation status of these highly valuable dry grassland habitat
   types. Finally, recommendations for the implementation of restorative
   goat grazing are given.}},

Abstract = {{In 2007, a fire burned over 100 000 ha along the Anaktuvuk River in
   Alaska, causing widespread ecological disturbance. Despite efforts to
   understand ecosystem recovery, little is known about higher trophic
   levels. Here, we present qualitative findings from a preliminary bird
   survey of the bum scar region, conducted in 2014, at three sites
   representing varying severity of burn damage. We found that abundance
   and species richness both appear higher at a site that experienced a
   moderate degree of burn damage than unburned control and severely burned
   sites. These findings suggest that the impacts of fires on bird
   communities may be minimal within 7 years post fire. Furthermore, our
   findings highlight the need for more rigorous efforts to understand the
   dynamics of tundra bird community fire recovery in a rapidly changing
   world.}},

Abstract = {{Moist evergreen forests of southwestern Ethiopia host high levels of
   biodiversity and have a high economic value due to coffee production.
   Coffee is a native shrub that is harvested under different management
   systems; its production can have both beneficial and detrimental effects
   for biodiversity. We investigated how bird community composition and
   richness, and abundance of different bird groups responded to different
   intensities of coffee management and the landscape context. We surveyed
   birds at 66 points in forest habitat with different intensities of
   coffee management and at different distances from the forest edge. We
   explored community composition using detrended correspondence analysis
   in combination with canonical correspondence analysis and indicator
   species analysis, and used generalized linear mixed models to
   investigate the responses of different bird groups to coffee management
   and landscape context. Our results show that (1) despite considerable
   bird diversity including some endemics, species turnover in the forest
   was relatively low; (2) total richness and abundance of birds were not
   affected by management or landscape context; but (3) the richness of
   forest and dietary specialists increased with higher forest naturalness,
   and with increasing distance from the edge and amount of forest cover.
   These findings show that traditional shade coffee management practices
   can maintain a diverse suite of forest birds. To conserve forest
   specialists, retaining undisturbed, remote forest is particularly
   important, but structurally diverse locations near the forest edge can
   also harbour a high diversity of specialists.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{179}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{94-104}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The decline of savanna habitat in the upper Midwest has resulted in a
   decline of savanna and grassland birds. Many savanna restoration efforts
   involve the re-introduction of fire, a method which kills fire-sensitive
   trees, often leaving them standing as snags. The purpose of this study
   was to assess how the number of snags (standing dead trees) is
   associated with the breeding bird community and to document how the
   number of snags at a site varied over a 23 y period of restoration by
   fire. The effect of snags on bird communities was studied by
   establishing bird census plots along a wide range of snag abundances. To
   determine for what purposes birds utilized snags, observers documented
   all visits during an hour-long period for pairs of a dead and live tree.
   Change in the abundance of snags over time was documented over 23 y in a
   16 ha grid. We found both bird species richness and abundance were
   positively associated with the number of snags and that birds used dead
   trees for mating and reproductive purposes more than live trees. We
   found the introduction of fire for restoration purposes initially
   resulted in an increase in the number of snags, but repeated fires
   eventually caused the number of snags to decline substantially. If a
   primary goal of savanna restoration is to enhance breeding bird
   community, our results show how burn regimes can be managed to maximize
   the number of dead tree snags for as long as possible.}},

Title = {{Avian community response to understory protection harvesting in the
   boreal forest of Alberta, Canada}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{407}},
Pages = {{9-15}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Traditional harvesting in western boreal forests seeks to approximate
   natural disturbances, such as wildfire. In mixedwood forests, understory
   conifers such as white spruce are typically destroyed during natural
   disturbance harvest (NDH). Understory protection (UP) is a harvesting
   approach that seeks to protect understory conifers during hardwood
   harvesting in mixedwood forests. While understory protection harvesting
   has been implemented for over a decade in Alberta, Canada, there has
   been no assessment of its use by birds. We surveyed birds in UP and NDH
   harvest blocks, and the nearby unharvested forest, and evaluated
   differences in species richness and community composition between the
   three treatment types. We found NDH had significantly higher species
   richness than unharvested forests, but did not differ from UP. The three
   treatments all had significantly different avian community compositions,
   and NDH showed no convergence with the unharvested forest over 15 years
   post-harvest. However, UP represented an intermediary between NDH and

Abstract = {{We analyzed the diet of Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) and
   Grasshopper Sparrow (A. savannarum) in three different sites and
   sampling periods across the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. DNA
   from seeds in regurgitated stomach contents was sequenced using NGS
   technology and identified with a barcoding approach using the P6 loop of
   the trnL intron as genetic marker. During each sampling period, we
   collected random soil samples to estimate seed availability in the soil
   seed bank. Due to the variability and size of the genetic marker, the
   resolution was limited to a family level resolution for taxonomic
   classification of seeds, but in several cases a genus level was
   achieved. Diets contained a high diversity of seeds but were dominated
   by a limited number of genera/families. Seeds from Panicoideae (from the
   genera Panicum, Setaria, Eriochloa, Botriochloa, and Hackelochloa)
   contributed for the largest part to the diets (53 +/- 19\%), followed by
   Bouteloua (10 +/- 12\%). Depending on the site and sampling period,
   other important seeds in the diets were Eragrostideae, Pleuraphis,
   Asteraceae, Verbena, and Amaranthus. The most abundant seeds were not
   always preferred. Aristida and Chloris were common in the soil seed bank
   but these seeds were avoided by both bird species. Baird's and
   Grasshopper sparrows did not differ in seed preferences. This work
   highlights the importance of range management practices that favor seed
   production of Panicoideae and Bouteloua grasses to enhance winter
   habitat use and survival of Baird's and Grasshopper sparrows in the
   Chihuahuan Desert.}},

   decades}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge for protected areas is providing wildlife with enough
   suitable habitat to cope with stochastic environment and increased
   pressure from the surrounding landscapes. In this study, we addressed
   changes in local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers (Campephilus
   magellanicus) occupying three national parks of central-southern Chile.
   We compared the breeding and postbreeding abundance of woodpeckers
   during the 1990s with the present (2016) abundance (n = 4 years), and
   assessed the extent to which abundance was explained by forest type and
   quality of foraging habitat (as quantified through the plant senescence
   reflectance index; PSRI). Results show a distinctive temporal variation
   in woodpecker abundance at each park, with local populations of
   Magellanic Woodpeckers declining by 42.2\% in Conguillio National Park,
   but increasing by 34.3\% in Nahuelbuta National Park. Woodpeckers
   responded to forest conditions within each park such that their
   abundance increased with high quality of foraging habitat, i. e., large
   PSRI values, and the presence of old-growth Monkey puzzle (Araucaria
   araucana) -Nothofagus pumilio mixed forest. Anecdotal evidence suggests
   that populations of woodpeckers in Conguillio National Park might have
   responded negatively to large-scale disturbances from recent forest
   fires affecting part of the forest area within park. Because stochastic
   events seemed to strongly mediate population changes, our findings
   suggest that regional conservation of Magellanic Woodpeckers requires
   expanding the current conservation area network in central-southern
   Chile.}},

Title = {{How well does forestry in Ontario's boreal forest emulate natural
   disturbances from the perspective of birds?}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Emulating natural disturbance has become a paradigm for biodiversity
   retention in forest management. This study evaluates the extent to which
   harvest management practices have created stands that emulate natural
   fire disturbance from the perspective of bird communities in Ontario,
   Canada. We compared the relative abundance of forest landbirds at the
   stand level in mature forest (> 80 years old) with that in
   early-regenerating (0-20 years) and midregenerating (21-80 years)
   forests originating from fire or timber harvest across the boreal forest
   of Ontario using over 7000 point counts. Our results indicate that
   forest harvest management practices in Ontario have created stands that
   only partially emulate natural fire disturbances in terms of the bird
   community composition. Total bird abundance and species richness were
   significantly lower postharvest than postfire in midregenerating
   forests, although they did not differ in early-regenerating stands.
   Species-level comparisons revealed several differences between
   postharvest and postfire stands, as well as among age classes. Although
   no species was completely missing from any stand type, 8\% of species in
   early-and 34\% in midregenerating stands were detected significantly
   less often in postharvest than postfire forests. Some other species were
   found significantly more often in postharvest stands, while the majority
   of species detected (84\% and 71\% in early-and midregenerating stands,
   respectively) showed no significant difference between disturbance
   types. Collectively, these results suggest that widespread replacement
   of fire with logging as the dominant disturbance type will shift the
   relative abundance of species within Ontario's boreal forest bird
   community. Quantifying the population-level implications of these shifts
   requires extrapolating these stand level effects to the landscape level,
   while considering the actual or anticipated abundance and distribution
   of forest age classes across the province under different forest
   management regimes.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{1418-1427}},

Abstract = {{Many objectives motivate ecological restoration, including improving
   vegetation condition, increasing the range and abundance of threatened
   species, and improving species richness and diversity. Although models
   have been used to examine the outcomes of ecological restoration, few
   researchers have attempted to develop models to account for multiple,
   potentially competing objectives. We developed a combined
   state-and-transition, species-distribution model to predict the effects
   of restoration actions on vegetation condition and extent, bird
   diversity, and the distribution of several bird species in southeastern
   Australian woodlands. The actions reflected several management
   objectives. We then validated the models against an independent data set
   and investigated how the best management decision might change when
   objectives were valued differently. We also used model results to
   identify effective restoration options for vegetation and bird species
   under a constrained budget. In the examples we evaluated, no one action
   (improving vegetation condition and extent, increasing bird diversity,
   or increasing the probability of occurrence for threatened species)
   provided the best outcome across all objectives. In agricultural lands,
   the optimal management actions for promoting the occurrence of the Brown
   Treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus), an iconic threatened species,
   resulted in little improvement in the extent of the vegetation and a
   high probability of decreased vegetation condition. This result
   highlights that the best management action in any situation depends on
   how much the different objectives are valued. In our example scenario,
   no management or weed control were most likely to be the best management
   options to satisfy multiple restoration objectives. Our approach to
   exploring trade-offs in management outcomes through integrated modeling
   and structured decision-support approaches has wide application for
   situations in which trade-offs exist between competing conservation
   objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Standing dead trees (or snags) are an important component of forest
   ecosystems, especially for tree cavity-nesting vertebrate species, but
   their prevalence in South African forests remains under studied.
   Consequently, we investigated forest structure, and the presence and
   abundance of snags in six southern mistbelt forests in the Eastern Cape,
   South Africa. These forests have had varying levels of timber extraction
   over the past 150years or more. We found snags were relatively rare in
   all six forests (<4.3\% of trees sampled). Mean diameter at breast
   height (dbh) of snags ranged from 52 to 82cm across the forests, with
   smaller snags in Kologha Forest and larger snags in Tyume Forest. A
   bimodal distribution of snag successional stages was found, with
   frequencies peaking at early and late stages, and few in the
   intermediate stages. Tree species diversity in the forests was
   relatively low (twelve-nineteen species across forests; only 28 species
   in total). There was no significant difference in dbh of trees between
   forests, with most occurring in the 20-29-cm dbh size class. Future
   studies are required to identify trees that most likely support suitable
   cavities for tree cavity-nesting bird species, and to determine
   cavity-nester assemblage requirements in southern African forests.}},

Abstract = {{Determining how ecological communities will respond to global
   environmental change remains a challenging research problem. Recent
   meta-analyses concluded that most communities are undergoing
   compositional change despite no net change in local species richness. We
   explored how species richness and composition of co-occurring plant,
   grasshopper, breeding bird and small mammal communities in arid and
   mesic grasslands changed in response to increasing aridity and fire
   frequency. In the arid system, grassland and shrubland plant and
   breeding bird communities were undergoing directional change, whereas
   grasshopper and small mammal communities were stable. In the mesic
   system, all communities were undergoing directional change regardless of
   fire frequency. Despite directional change in composition in some
   communities, species richness of all communities did not change because
   compositional change resulted more from reordering of species abundances
   than turnover in species composition. Thus, species reordering, not
   changes in richness, explains long-term dynamics in these grass and
   shrub dominated communities.}},

Abstract = {{Woodpeckers are a very good indicators of forest naturalness. The fact
   that many species of these birds are in decline in central and western
   Europe resulted from changes in forest management (e.g. favouring
   coniferous forest, removal of dead trees). The aim of this research was
   to evaluate the importance of patches of deciduous species for the
   occurrence of some specialized woodpeckers in the conditions of Scots
   pine dominated stands. The study focused on species associated with
   deciduous forest, i.e. middle spotted woodpecker Leiopicas medius (L.),
   white-backed woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos (Bechstein) and grey-headed
   woodpecker Picas canus (Gmelin). Statistical analyses were performed for
   the woodpeckers, which occurred in more than 10 territories. The studies
   were performed in 2015-2017 in the southern part of the Sandomierz Basin
   in three study areas (52,6-59 km(2)). Two plots were dominated by black
   alder Alnus glutinosa and oak Ouercus sp., while the third one was
   characterized by the highest share of black alder, followed by silver
   birch Betula pendula and oak. Deciduous trees at the age over 80 years
   accounted for less than 2\% of the total area of each plot. The most
   abundant bird species in patches of deciduous forest was the middle
   spotted woodpecker (25 territories), while the rarest was white-backed
   woodpecker (1 territory). Grey-headed woodpecker appeared in 12
   territories. The density of woodpeckers in deciduous forest areas ranged
   from 0.45 territories/100 ha for grey-headed woodpecker to 1.54
   territories/100 ha for the middle spotted woodpecker. In the alder
   patches we found all territories of grey-headed woodpecker, 24\%
   territories of the middle spotted woodpecker and single territories of
   white-backed woodpecker. The patches dominated by oak accounted for
   about 76\% of territories of middle spotted woodpecker. The average area
   of the patches with presence of middle spotted woodpecker and grey
   woodpecker was significantly higher than the patches where woodpeckers
   were absent. The middle spotted woodpecker occurred in the forest
   patches with the highest average age. Redundancy Analysis (RDA)
   demonstrated that the occurrence of middle spotted woodpecker was most
   strongly associated with the area of the patches over 10 ha, while the
   grey-headed woodpecker preferred mature forest stands of alder. These
   species abundance was negatively correlated with a patch area less than
   10 ha.}},

Title = {{Natural regeneration of tree species in pastures on peasant land in

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{249}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, large forested areas in southern Mexico have been
   degraded and even eliminated, often due to conversion of these areas to
   pastures for cattle grazing. Silvopastoral systems combine livestock
   raising with tree use, favor conservation of biological diversity, and
   provide a variety of services to the environment and to farmers. In this
   study, we evaluated tree regeneration in cattle pastures in the Tulija
   River Valley of Chiapas, Mexico. We argue that density of
   seedlings/saplings in the pastures studied is associated with the
   density of adult trees, with the type of dominant grass (induced or
   introduced), and with the practice of weeding around seedlings and
   saplings. We sampled trees in pastures according to categories of size,
   as well as herbaceous vegetation in 35 cattle pastures, and interviewed
   farmers with respect to their practices of weeding around seedlings and
   saplings. We evaluated species capacity for regeneration, and classified
   species as having adequate or limited natural regeneration capacity (ANR
   and LNR, respectively). Furthermore, we constructed a generalized least
   squares model to identify whether density of adult trees, type of grass
   cover (induced vs. introduced), and farmers practice of weeding affect
   the density of seedlings and saplings of tree species. Finally, we
   identified dispersal agents of each tree species recorded and then
   compared the relative abundance of seedlings/saplings with adult trees
   for each dispersal agent, using chi-square goodness-of-fit test. In the
   35 cattle pastures, we found 17 species (28\%) with ANR capacity, 90\%
   of which belonged to secondary vegetation, and 44 species (72\%) with
   LNR capacity; most of these belonged to late successional tree species.
   Density of seedlings/saplings was positively associated with density of
   adult trees and the practice of manual weeding. The greatest abundance
   of seedlings/saplings corresponded to species dispersed by cattle,
   followed by those dispersed by wind. For adult trees, the most common
   type of dispersal was by wind, followed by cattle. These results suggest
   that native tree species are principally dispersed by cattle and wind,
   and cattle have a positive effect on the regeneration capacity of the
   most abundant tree species in the pastures studied. We conclude that
   Chol Mayan silvopastoral management practices in the study communities
   in Chiapas, Mexico allow for and promote regeneration of native tree
   species, most of which belong to secondary vegetation, although some
   belong to late successional species. These simple management practices
   allow for harvesting some trees in the pasture while also maintaining
   the regeneration process.}},

Title = {{Species conservation profiles of endemic spiders (Araneae) from Madeira
   and Selvagens archipelagos, Portugal}},
Journal = {{BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The North Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and Selvagens present a
   unique biological diversity including, presently, 56 endemic spider
   species. Several recent projects provide valuable information on their
   distribution across most islands and habitats. To date, the only endemic
   spider assessed according to the IUCN Red List criteria is Hogna ingens.
   The objective of this paper is to assess all remaining endemic species
   and advise on possible future conservation actions critical for the
   survival of endangered species.
   New information
   Seven species were found to have a continuing decline in either range or
   population size. Their decline can be mostly attributed to habitat
   destruction or degradation, invasive plant species that reduce quality
   of habitat, forest fires at high mountain regions and possible
   competition for resources from invasive congeners. The tetragnathid M.
   barreti is considered as possibly extinct due to the suspected impact of
   a competing species. Although most endemic spiders from the Madeira and
   Selvagens archipelagos have relatively low extinction risk due to the
   good condition and protection of the laurisilva forests where many live,
   there are a number of species requiring urgent attention and protection
   measures. These include all cave and mountain-restricted species as well
   as those threatened by competing congeners or invasive plants. Extending
   current protected areas, restoring original habitats of threatened
   species and the control of invasive taxa should remain a priority for
   species survival.}},

Abstract = {{The invasion of exotic species is considered to be a major threat to the
   preservation of biodiversity. In the Parque Nacional de Brasflia
   (National Park of Brasflia), the invasive Melinis minutiflora (molasses
   grass) occupies more than 10 \% of the area of the park. The present,
   long-term, study compared two treatments of exposure to molasses grass:
   1) fire and 2) integrated management (fire + herbicide sprays + manual
   removal). The aerial biomass of molasses grass in the experimental area
   initially represented ca. 55 \% of the total aerial biomass, a
   percentage that apparently did not influence native plant species
   richness at this site. Fire alone was not sufficient to control molasses
   grass, which attained its pre-treatment biomass values after two years.
   Integrated management reduced, and maintained, biomass to less than 1 \%
   of its original value after ten years, and maintained this level
   throughout the study, demonstrating that it is a promising strategy for
   the recovery of areas invaded by molasses grass in the Cerrado. However,
   because of the recolonization by molasses grass, long-term monitoring
   efforts are targeting outbreaks, which would require immediate
   intervention in order to maintain the native biological diversity of the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{UK moorlands are semi-natural habitats managed for a mix of livestock,
   game shooting and forestry, among other activities. An assessment of the
   importance of characteristics that correlate with moorland bird
   populations of high conservation importance can inform appropriate
   management at appropriate locations. We use hierarchical partitioning to
   assess the absolute and relative importance of climate, topography,
   soil, landscape management (wider scale habitat configuration of
   forestry and agriculture) and site-based management (indices of predator
   control, and vegetation characteristics) in determining the abundance of
   a suite of upland birds in four regions of the UK. Unmeasured
   regionspecific effects often made the largest contribution to models.
   Physical characteristics (climate, topography, soil) were important and
   on average explained a similar amount of variation to site-based
   management. However, there was considerable interspecific variation in
   the importance of both. Landscape-scale variables were generally of low
   importance. An index of predator control was positively correlated with
   the abundance of Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica and two waders.
   Vegetation characteristics (composition and structure) were, together,
   strong correlates of the abundance of passerine species. Vegetation
   characteristics were as important as indices of predator control for
   waders and grouse. The importance of regional effects, physical
   characteristics and variables relating to management suggest targeting
   site-based management (such as predator control or vegetation
   management) to the areas where physical characteristics are most
   favourable. The most beneficial management will vary between species,
   necessitating a mosaic of management options across upland areas to
   benefit all species.}},

Title = {{Ecological restoration in boreal forest modifies the structure of bird
   assemblages}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{401}},
Pages = {{75-88}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Ecological restoration is increasingly recognised as a useful tool for
   biodiversity conservation in boreal forests. Most restoration methods in
   this environment aim to emulate natural disturbances, and thereby
   promote the development of key ecological structures. However, research
   about forest ecosystem restoration is still in its infancy and the
   responses of many boreal species groups remain to be described. We
   established a large-scale field experiment to evaluate the short-term
   effects of two restoration treatments - prescribed burning and gap
   cutting involving the creation of dead wood - on breeding bird
   assemblages in boreal Sweden. We censused breeding birds using territory
   mapping during two years in forest stands subjected to the two
   restoration treatments, in untreated controls and in old-growth
   references (nature reserves) (n = 10 per treatment). Averaged over the
   two census years, we found 1145 territories of 36 bird species. Total
   bird species richness and abundance did not differ among treatments.
   However, prescribed burning led to clear changes in the structure of the
   bird assemblages. When dividing species according to four functional
   categorizations (migration, foraging, nesting and successional stage),
   we found that the abundance of long-distance migrants, ground breeders,
   strong cavity excavators and species preferring early-successional
   habitat was higher in burned stands than in untreated controls and
   gap-cut stands, as was the species richness of bark feeders and strong
   cavity excavators. In contrast, abundance of off-ground breeders and
   species richness of crown feeders were lower following prescribed
   burning than in the controls. The gap cutting treatment did not have any
   significant effects on the bird assemblages. Ecological restoration
   through prescribed burning can be a useful tool for the conservation of
   boreal forest birds, including the ecologically important strong cavity
   excavators (i.e. woodpeckers (Picidae)). Forest managers should
   therefore be encouraged to use prescribed burning as a restoration tool
   to quickly provide habitat for bird species adapted to natural
   disturbances in boreal forest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and the Atlantic Forest of Brazil
   are two of the most fragmented biodiversity hotspots. Species area
   relationships predict that their habitat fragments will experience a
   substantial loss of species. Most of these extinctions will occur over
   an extended time, and therefore, reconnecting fragments could prevent
   species losses and allow locally extinct species to recolonize former
   habitats. An empirical relaxation half-life vs. area relationship for
   tropical bird communities estimates the time that it takes to lose
   one-half of all species that will be eventually lost. We use it to
   estimate the increase in species persistence by regenerating a forest
   connection 1 km in width among the largest and closest fragments at 11
   locations. In the Eastern Arc Mountains, regenerating 8,134 ha of forest
   would create >316,000 ha in total of restored contiguous forest. More
   importantly, it would increase the persistence time for species by a
   factor of 6.8 per location or 2,272 years, on average, relative to
   individual fragments. In the Atlantic Forest, regenerating 6,452 ha of
   forest would create >251,000 ha in total of restored contiguous forest
   and enhance species persistence by a factor of 13.0 per location or
   similar to 5,102 years, on average, relative to individual fragments.
   Rapidly regenerating forest among fragments is important, because mean
   time to the first determined extinction across all fragments is 7 years.
   We estimate the cost of forest regeneration at \$21-\$49 million
   dollars. It could provide one of the highest returns on investment for
   biodiversity conservation worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, the conversion of annual-rotation based crops or
   grassland areas into non-food perennial crops has been increasingly
   prevalent in European farming systems. This shift is associated with
   major changes in management practices and has created new environmental
   conditions and resources for wildlife. Impacts on birds have been
   examined for bioenergy agricultural systems, such as miscanthus
   plantations and short-rotation willow coppice. However, they remain
   largely unknown for Christmas tree plantations (CTPs) that have recently
   increased considerably in some European countries. We examined the
   extent to which CTPs alter bird species assemblages in the farmland
   areas of southern Belgium, where they mainly replace intensive
   grassland. The abundance of birds was recorded during the breeding
   season in randomly selected sites located in grassland and in CTP.
   Results show that introduction of CTP into landscapes dominated by
   grassland with low hedge densities locally increases bird species
   richness and abundance without leading to biotic homogenization.
   Differences in species richness and abundance between grassland and CTP
   decrease with increasing hedge densities. A community analysis indicates
   that the plantation of Christmas trees enriches the bird assemblage of
   intensive grassland areas. In intensive grassland with few hedges,
   small-size CTPs could constitute an option to increase structural
   heterogeneity and provide new potential breeding conditions for some
   farmland birds. However, questions remain about the genuine quality of
   the resources available in CTP and further research is needed to examine
   the breeding success and survival of birds that settle in this type of
   habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Managing ecological disturbances at different spatial scales is
   paramount for maintaining or restoring faunal diversity in grasslands.
   Whereas some studies have reported varying net effects of livestock
   disturbance intensity upon species richness in grasslands, most analysis
   reveal strong effects on beta-diversity. However, beta-diversity can be
   further partitioned into a nestedness and turnover components, which
   allows complementary insights on the effects of disturbance on
   biodiversity across spatial scales. Here we tested for differences in
   avian species richness and beta-diversity across three intensity levels
   of livestock disturbance in southern Brazilian grasslands under
   commercial livestock production. We also tested how disturbance
   influences the nestedness and turnover components of beta-diversity
   separately. We found no difference in rarified-extrapolated species
   richness between disturbance levels. In contrast, we found a significant
   difference in species composition between disturbance levels, which was
   attributable to the turnover, but not to the nestedness component.
   Specifically, livestock disturbance had a predictable effect upon
   beta-diversity, with turnover of species composition occurring along the
   gradient of vegetation height in pastures. Our study illustrates the
   importance of differentiating the turnover and nestedness components of
   beta-diversity to detect effects of disturbance gradients on
   biodiversity patterns. We argue that conservation strategies should
   focus on preserving the mosaic of short- and tall-grass physiognomies
   associated with the disturbance gradient imposed by livestock
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Monoculture farming is pervasive in industrial oil palm agriculture,
   including those RSPO plantations certified as sustainably managed. This
   farming practice does not promote the maintenance of farmland
   biodiversity. However, little scientific attention has been given to
   polyculture farming in oil palm production landscapes. Polyculture
   farming is likely to increase the floristic diversity and stand
   structural complexity that underpins biodiversity. Mist nets were used
   to sample birds at 120 smallholdings in Peninsular Malaysia. At each
   site, 12 vegetation structure characteristics were measured. We compared
   bird species richness, abundance, and composition between monoculture
   and polyculture smallholdings and used predictive models to examine the
   effects of habitat quality on avian biodiversity. Bird species richness
   was significantly greater in polyculture than that of monoculture
   smallholdings. The number of fallen and standing, dead oil palms were
   also important positive predictors of species richness. Bird abundance
   was also strongly increased by standing and dead oil palms and decreased
   with oil palm stand height. Our results indicate that polyculture
   farming can improve bird species richness in oil palm production
   landscapes. In addition, key habitat variables that are closely
   associated with farming practices, such as the removal of dead trees,
   should and can be managed by oil palm growers in order to promote
   biodiversity. To increase the sustainability of oil palm agriculture, it
   is imperative that stakeholders modify the way oil palms are currently
   planted and managed. Our findings can guide policy makers and
   certification bodies to promote oil palm production landscapes that will
   function more sustainably and increase existing biodiversity of oil palm
   landscapes.}},

   responses of species both within and across taxonomic groups,
   prescribing fire regimes based on the response of one or only a few
   species may have negative consequences for other species. Here, we
   integrate data collected from a series of independent but complementary
   studies spanning a 75 + year chronosequence in a semi-arid shrubland
   ecosystem in south-western Australia to consider how fire management can
   best promote biodiversity both within and across taxonomic groups
   (plants, birds, small mammals, and reptiles). Younger fire ages (6-14
   years) contained sparse shrubs, large areas of bare ground, and lacked a
   distinct litter layer and canopy. The oldest vegetation (60-85 years)
   had a distinct canopy, a well-developed litter layer and cryptogamic
   crust, higher variability in patch width, and more woody debris. Plant
   species richness and diversity decreased with time since fire, whereas
   bird species richness and diversity increased with time since fire, and
   mammal and reptile species richness and diversity showed no trend. The
   composition of all four taxonomic groups varied according to time since
   fire and the presence of 11 species was confined above or below certain
   fire-age thresholds. Our results support the need to maintain a mix of
   both younger and older fire ages across the landscape to maximise
   species diversity, and highlight the particular importance of older fire
   ages for many species. Future fire management for biodiversity
   conservation will benefit from identifying and reconciling cross-taxa
   contrasts and complementarities.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) uses data from the North
   American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to assist in monitoring and
   management of some migratory birds. However, BBS analyses provide
   indices of population change rather than estimates of population size,
   precluding their use in developing abundance-based objectives and
   limiting applicability to harvest management. Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa)
   are important harvested birds in the Atlantic Flyway (AF) that are
   difficult to detect during aerial surveys because they prefer forested
   habitat. We integrated Wood Duck count data from a ground-plot survey in
   the northeastern U. S. with AF-wide BBS, banding, parts collection, and
   harvest data to derive estimates of population size for the AF.
   Overlapping results between the smaller-scale intensive groundplot
   survey and the BBS in the northeastern U. S. provided a means for
   scaling BBS indices to the breeding population size estimates. We
   applied these scaling factors to BBS results for portions of the AF
   lacking intensive surveys. Banding data provided estimates of annual
   survival and harvest rates; the latter, when combined with
   parts-collection data, provided estimates of recruitment. We used the
   harvest data to estimate fall population size. Our estimates of breeding
   population size and variability from the integrated population model (N
   = 0.99 million, SD = 0.04) were similar to estimates of breeding
   population size based solely on data from the AF ground-plot surveys and
   the BBS (N = 1.01 million, SD = 0.04) from 1998 to 2015. Integrating BBS
   data with other data provided reliable population size estimates for
   Wood Ducks at a scale useful for harvest and habitat management in the
   AF, and allowed us to derive estimates of important demographic
   parameters (e.g., seasonal survival rates, sex ratio) that were not
   directly informed by data.}},

Volume = {{212}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{39-47}},

Abstract = {{Using habitat mitigation to minimize or offset negative impacts of land
   use change on biodiversity is increasingly common and widespread. For
   example, where natural disturbance is undesirable (e.g., wildfire in oil
   and gas fields), mechanical approaches are frequently used to replace
   natural disturbance and improve habitat for particular species. However,
   the consequences of such actions for diverse animal assemblages have
   gone largely unexamined. To assess whether mitigation targeting single
   species can emulate natural processes and improve habitat for multiple
   species, we investigated the short-term response of birds and mammals to
   mechanical tree reduction and natural wildfire in a landscape altered by
   energy development. We found that no mammal species responded positively
   to mitigation for energy development in our study region. In contrast,
   four mammal species were positively associated with fire, and only a
   single species responded negatively. Similarly, only a single species of
   bird responded positively to mitigation. Fire had a positive effect on
   the density of three bird species and a negative effect on six bird
   species. We show that habitat mitigation intended to emulate natural
   disturbances and mitigate the negative effects of energy development has
   mixed but largely negative short-term consequences for birds and
   mammals. To sustain biodiversity in places undergoing rapid land use
   change, mitigation should explicitly measure both intended and
   unintended effects on diverse taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use change is the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss in the
   tropics. Biodiversity models can be useful tools to inform policymakers
   and conservationists of the likely response of species to anthropogenic
   pressures, including land-use change. However, such models generalize
   biodiversity responses across wide areas and many taxa, potentially
   missing important characteristics of particular sites or clades.
   Comparisons of biodiversity models with independently collected field
   data can help us understand the local factors that mediate broad-scale
   responses. We collected independent bird occurrence and abundance data
   along two elevational transects in Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania and the
   Taita Hills, Kenya. We estimated the local response to land use and
   compared our estimates with modelled local responses based on a large
   database of many different taxa across Africa. To identify the local
   factors mediating responses to land use, we compared environmental and
   species assemblage information between sites in the independent and
   African-wide datasets. Bird species richness and abundance responses to
   land use in the independent data followed similar trends as suggested by
   the African-wide biodiversity model, however the land-use classification
   was too coarse to capture fully the variability introduced by local
   agricultural management practices. A comparison of assemblage
   characteristics showed that the sites on Kilimanjaro and the Taita Hills
   had higher proportions of forest specialists in croplands compared to
   the Africa-wide average. Local human population density, forest cover
   and vegetation greenness also differed significantly between the
   independent and Africa-wide datasets. Biodiversity models including
   those variables performed better, particularly in croplands, but still
   could not accurately predict the magnitude of local species responses to
   most land uses, probably because local features of the land management
   are still missed. Overall, our study demonstrates that local factors
   mediate biodiversity responses to land use and cautions against applying
   biodiversity models to local contexts without prior knowledge of which
   factors are locally relevant.}},

Abstract = {{Weed management is a critical issue as it is faced with a daunting set
   of challenges linked to crop productivity and farmland biodiversity.
   Developing new strategies for weed management requires a clear
   understanding of the relative role of local management and landscape
   heterogeneity on weeds. Yet few studies have investigated the combined
   effect of these factors on a variety of weed metrics that reconcile
   agronomical and ecological aims. Here, we analyzed the relative role of
   local management intensity and landscape heterogeneity according to the
   distance to field margin on four weed metrics (species richness,
   density, biomass and seed rain) and community composition in 257 fields
   (beet, maize, spring and winter rape fields) across Great Britain.
   Generalized mixed effect models followed by a model averaging procedure
   were applied on weed metrics and permutational multivariate analyses of
   variance were applied on weed species composition. Our analysis
   confirmed the overriding role of the distance to field margin on weeds.
   Although weed density and seed rain negatively responded to local
   management intensity, they did not respond in the same way to landscape
   configurational heterogeneity, namely the field size. We found
   interactions between management intensity and landscape heterogeneity
   but only in relation to weed biomass in beet and spring rape fields and
   to seed rain in beet fields. The relative importance of local management
   intensity and landscape heterogeneity varied depending on the distance
   to field margin, which can be attributed to spatial heterogeneity in
   management practices. We recommend that not only species richness but
   also a wide range of metrics should be considered in weed studies as
   they did not responded in the same way to local and landscape factors.
   We conclude that weed management strategies should be thought by
   integrating a multi-level approach as the combined effects of local
   management and landscape heterogeneity are likely to both reduce weed
   infestation whilst enhancing biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity of semi-natural grasslands depends on the management
   practices used. However, management systems suitable for one taxon, such
   as plants, can be detrimental to other taxa, such as insects, and vice
   versa. This study attempts to support conservation management planning
   by clarifying the effects of different grassland management practices on
   species richness and species composition of vascular plants,
   butterflies, moths, orthopterans and ground beetles, also taking into
   account the effects of climate and the landscape context. The study was
   performed in the White Carpathians Protected Landcape Area and UNESCO
   Biosphere Reserve (Czech Republic), which is famous for its grasslands
   with the globally highest fine-scale plant species richness. Different
   management practices (mowing, grazing, abandonment and mixed management;
   the latter including the previous three) were applied for at least five
   consecutive years at 34 sites, where plants and different insect groups
   were subsequently sampled. Effects of management on species richness of
   different taxonomic groups were assessed using generalised linear
   models, whereas the effects on species composition were assessed using
   redundancy analysis. Management influenced plant, butterfly and moth
   species richness, but the effects of particular management practices on
   all species and species of regional conservation importance differed
   between these taxonomic groups. Plant and moth species richness
   increased with mowing, but moth species richness decreased with grazing.
   Mixed management favoured plant and butterfly richness. Plant species
   composition was infuenced by mowing, grazing and mixed management while
   that of moths by mowing and grazing. Orthopterans and ground beetles did
   not respond significantly to management. Our results indicate that
   conservation management should comprise the traditional practices that
   have historically contributed to the formation of the biological
   diversity of the semi-natural grasslands in the study area. In
   particular, grazing may not be optimal for traditional hay-meadows and
   mowing should be carried out similarly as in pre-intensive farmland,
   creating spatio-temporal heterogeneity rather than uniformly cutting
   large grassland areas during a short period. In general, the optimal
   management should be heterogeneous, applying different practices in a
   mosaic or at different times during the season.}},

Title = {{Regional-scale effects override the influence of fine-scale landscape
   heterogeneity on rice arthropod communities}},

Abstract = {{Irrigated rice croplands are among the most biologically diverse
   agroecosystems globally; however, intensification and simplification of
   farmed areas into homogeneous monocultures can lead to biodiversity loss
   and a reduction of associated ecosystem services such as natural pest
   regulation. Understanding how landscape heterogeneity affects the
   diversity of arthropod communities is therefore crucial for the
   sustainable management of rice agroecosystems. Here, we examine the
   influence of fine-scale landscape heterogeneity and regional-scale
   effects on the arthropod communities of three rice-production regions in
   the Philippines. Our analysis of 213 arthropod morphospecies (37,339
   individuals) collected using two sampling methods at 28 field sites
   indicated that the rice agroecosystems in each study region had unique
   arthropod assemblages, likely reflecting region specific environmental
   and land-use conditions. For all sites together, we found no effect of
   fine-scale landscape context (classified as rather high or low
   heterogeneity sites) on assemblage structure (arthropod abundance,
   species richness or diversity). When assemblages were analyzed
   separately, significant effects of fine-scale landscape context were
   only detected in one region and for two functional groups (predators and
   detritivores). Elevation gradient, used as a proxy for regional-scale
   effects in the study regions, explained more than 60\% of variance in
   assemblage structure. Total arthropod abundance and rarefied species
   richness were negatively related to elevation, suggesting that
   regional-scale effects rather than fine-scale landscape heterogeneity
   explained the composition of rice-arthropod communities in landscapes.
   To further disentangle the complex effects of broad-scale environmental
   drivers versus fine-scale landscape complexity on arthropod communities
   and biocontrol services, future research in rice agroecosystems should
   focus on a more detailed quantification of landscape heterogeneity and
   examine its effect at multiple spatial scales.}},

Volume = {{284}},

Abstract = {{The worldwide increase in human outdoor activities raises concerns for
   wildlife. Human disturbances, even at low levels, are likely to impact
   species during sensitive periods of the annual cycle. However,
   experimental studies during the putative sensitive period of territory
   establishment of birds which not only investigate low disturbance
   levels, but which also exclude the effect of habitat modification (e.g.
   walking trails) are lacking. Here, we experimentally disturbed birds in
   forest plots by walking through twice a day during territory
   establishment. Later we compared the breeding bird community of
   experimentally disturbed plots with that of undisturbed control plots.
   We discovered that the number of territories (-15.0\%) and species
   richness (-15.2\%) in disturbed plots were substantially reduced
   compared with control plots. Species most affected included those
   sensitive to human presence (assessed by flight-initiation distances),
   open-cup nesters and above-ground foragers. Long-distance migrants,
   however, were unaffected due to their arrival after experimental
   disturbance took place. These findings highlight how territory
   establishment is a sensitive period for birds, when even low levels of
   human recreation may be perceived as threatening, and alter settlement
   decisions. This can have important implications for the conservation of
   species, which might go unnoticed when focusing only on already
   established birds.}},

Title = {{Switch to a Novel Breeding Resource Influences Coexistence of Two
   Passerine Birds}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{A crucial step in adapting to urban habitat is switching to novel, often
   man-made, resources. Switching to a novel resource can influence the
   dynamics of species coexistence, particularly if it alters trade-offs in
   performance. While such switches are frequently documented, their
   influence on species coexistence has been difficult to assess because it
   requires knowledge of performance trade-offs in the context of both
   historical and novel resource use. Western and mountain bluebirds
   provide a unique system in which to investigate the effects of a
   resource switch on species coexistence because both depend on secondary
   nest cavities to breed and, across a large part of their range, have
   switched to using man-made nest boxes. Western bluebirds are less
   dispersive, but more aggressive, than mountain bluebirds leading to a
   successional pattern of species replacement in many nest box
   populations; however, there is evidence of continued coexistence in
   natural post-fire habitat. Nest boxes differ from natural cavities in
   both distribution, which may affect the dynamics of interference
   competition between the species, and thermal conductance, which may
   impact competition by altering survival of ectothermic young. Here, we
   use a combination of experimental manipulations of nest box density and
   more than a decade of fitness and incubation temperature data to
   investigate whether altered resource distribution or thermal environment
   best explain patterns of species replacement in nest box populations. In
   both species, we found that females breeding in nest boxes were unable
   to maintain normal incubation temperatures during inclement weather and
   experienced similar offspring mortality patterns. Moreover, climatic
   variation across populations did not predict species' relative
   abundance. Instead, experimental manipulation of nest box density showed
   that mountain bluebirds persisted longer when nest boxes were
   distributed farther apart, suggesting that nest box distribution may be
   a key factor in understanding how human-created habitat impacts
   coexistence of bluebird species. These results emphasize that knowledge
   of species interactions in the historical habitat is crucial to
   understanding population dynamics as species transition to novel,
   man-made habitat.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to bird population
   persistence. Yet, our understanding of the demographic factors behind
   the adverse effects of fragmentation remains limited for many species.
   We studied the breeding demographics of the Bachman's Sparrow Peucaea
   aestivalis), a species of conservation concern that is associated with
   highly imperiled longleaf pine ecosystems in the southeastern United
   States. We quantified the effects of local-and landscape-scale factors
   on different components of reproductive success i.e., pairing success
   and probability of fledging offspring) for 96 male sparrows at eight
   sites in southeastern North Carolina. Pairing success of monitored
   sparrows was 69\%, and 77\% of paired males fledged >= 1 offspring.
   Habitat amount in the surrounding landscape, rather than local habitat
   quality, was the most influential predictor of pairing success for male
   Bachman's Sparrows. In contrast, we documented no predictors of
   successfully fledging offspring for paired males. We infer that reduced
   pairing success is limiting reproduction in isolated landscapes and may
   be a contributing factor for the low occupancy and declines of Bachman's
   Sparrow in our study region. Overall, our results suggest that managers
   can promote breeding opportunities for Bachman's Sparrows by
   prioritizing resources to patches near large, preexisting longleaf pine
   forest to ensure >= 20\% habitat within the surrounding landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Surrogate grasslands established through federal set-aside programs,
   such as U.S. Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program
   (CRP), provide important habitat for grassland birds. Warm season grass
   CRP fields as a group have the potential for providing a continuum of
   habitat structure for breeding birds, depending on how the fields are
   managed and their floristic composition. We studied the nesting activity
   of four obligate grassland bird species, Bobolink (Dolichonyx
   oryzivorus), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), Grasshopper Sparrow
   (Ammodramus savannarum), and Henslow's Sparrow (A. henslowii), in
   relation to vegetative composition and fire management in warm season
   CRP fields in southwest Wisconsin during 2009-2011. Intraspecific
   variation in apparent nest density was related to the number of years
   since the field was burned. Apparent Grasshopper Sparrow nest density
   was highest in the breeding season immediately following spring burns,
   apparent Henslow's Sparrow nest density was highest 1 y post burn, and
   apparent Bobolink and Eastern Meadowlark nest densities were higher in
   post fire years one to three. Grasshopper Sparrow nest density was
   highest on sites with more diverse vegetation, specifically prairie
   forbs, and on sites with shorter less dense vegetation. Bobolink,
   Eastern Meadowlark, and Henslow's Sparrow apparent nest densities were
   higher on sites with deeper litter; litter was the vegetative component
   that was most affected by spring burns. Overall nest success was 0.487
   for Bobolink (22 d nesting period), 0.478 for Eastern Meadowlark (25 d
   nesting period), 0.507 for Grasshopper Sparrow (22 d nesting period),
   and 0.151 for Henslow's Sparrow (21 d nesting period). The major nest
   predators were grassland-associated species: thirteen-lined ground
   squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), striped skunk (Mephitis
   mephitis), milk snake (Lampropeltis triangulum), American badger
   (Taxidea taxus), and western fox snake (Elaphe vulpina). Overall
   depredation rate was not affected by the number of years since the site
   had been burned. The diversity of vegetation on warm season CRP fields
   created by management using fire provides a continuum of structure for
   obligate grassland birds to use for breeding and habitat for a diversity
   of nest predators.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic loss of biodiversity is often indicated by the
   disappearance of top predators. However, some of them have adapted to
   man-made agricultural landscapes. Among raptors, one such example is the
   Lesser Spotted Eagle. We compiled an exhaustive data set on foraging
   habitat composition of this species by direct field mapping and detailed
   land cover maps to study the effect of various agricultural management
   practices on its occupancy of home ranges and productivity, as well as
   on its habitat utilization and hunting success. Home ranges of the
   Lesser Spotted Eagle contained more natural grasslands (7.6\%) and other
   agricultural biotopes (29.9\%) than expected by random, and they
   preferred to breed close to managed agricultural biotopes. They hunted
   preferably on grasslands, where they spent 86\% of their time,
   especially on managed grasslands, but avoided arable fields. In total,
   51\% of the Lesser Spotted Eagle attacks were successful, and we
   detected no differences in hunting success among habitats. Nests of
   successfully breeding birds were surrounded by more crops/cultivated
   grassland on a rotational basis (19.0\%), as well as by managed natural
   grassland (1.1\%), than those of unsuccessful pairs (16 and 0.7\%,
   respectively). We also detected a negative impact of oilseed rape fields
   and mowed cultivated grassland on the reproductive success of the Lesser
   Spotted Eagle, but these effects were not consistent over the years. Our
   results suggest that, although the Lesser Spotted Eagle is well adapted
   to foraging in traditional farmland, it is threatened by changes in
   agricultural practices and an increasing sown area of some crops, such
   as oilseed rape. Cultivation of various crops and retaining of
   grasslands, interspersed with set-aside and non-agricultural habitat
   patches, promoted by the European Union greening policy, would be
   favourable to the Lesser Spotted Eagle.}},

Title = {{Livestock grazing supports native plants and songbirds in a California
   annual grassland}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{Over eight years we measured the effects of plant community composition,
   vegetation structure, and livestock grazing on occurrence of three
   grassland bird species-Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), Horned
   Lark (Eremophila alpestris), and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus
   savannarum)-at sites in central California during breeding season. In
   California's Mediterranean-type climatic region, coastal and inland
   grassland vegetation is dominated by exotic annual grasses with
   occasional patches of native bunchgrass and forbs. Livestock grazing,
   primarily with beef cattle, is the most widely used management tool.
   Compared with ungrazed plots, grazed plots had higher bare ground,
   native plant cover, and vertically heterogeneous vegetation. Grazed
   plots also had less plant litter and shorter vegetation. Higher native
   plant cover, which is predominantly composed of bunchgrasses in our
   study area, was associated with livestock grazing and north-facing
   aspects. Using an information theoretic approach, we found that all
   three bird species had positive associations with native plant abundance
   and neutral (Western Meadowlark, Grasshopper Sparrow) or positive
   (Horned Lark) association with livestock grazing. All species favored
   flatter areas. Horned Larks and Western Meadowlark occurred more often
   where there were patches of bare ground. Western Meadowlarks and
   Grasshopper Sparrows were most common on north-facing slopes, suggesting
   that these species may be at risk from projected climate change. These
   findings demonstrate that livestock grazing is compatible with or
   supports grassland bird conservation in Mediterranean-type grasslands,
   including areas with high levels of exotic annual grass invasion, in
   part because grazing supports the persistence of native plants and
   heterogeneity in vegetation structure. However, conservation of
   low-lying grasslands with high native species presence, and active
   management to increase the abundance of native plant species are also
   likely to be important for sustaining grassland birds long-term.}},

Title = {{Man-made perching sites - electricity pylons accelerate fleshy-fruited
   plants succession in farmlands}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{231}},
Pages = {{51-56}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Electricity pylons and power lines in an agricultural environment serve
   as artificial perching sites for many birds. For this reason, seeds of
   fleshy-fruited plant species are predominantly deposited in these
   places. In the present study we show that electricity pylons may play an
   important role in the succession of fleshy fruited shrubs and trees in
   intensive farmland. The aim of the study was to evaluate the importance
   of electricity pylons as artificial perching sites and thus as important
   locations enabling earlier succession and colonisation by fleshy-fruited
   plant species. The study was conducted during June and July 2013 in the
   Wielkopolska province of western Poland in intensive farmland with
   numerous small isolated forest patches. In total, we found 22
   fleshy-fruited and 10 dry-fruited tree and shrub species under
   electricity pylons, of which 30\% were alien species. The density of
   fleshy-fruited species under pylons was significantly higher in
   comparison with control plots, in which 85\% of tree and shrub species
   were alien species. Padus serotina and Sambucus nigra were the species
   most frequently found under pylons. Plants of non-endozoochorous origin
   (i.e. anemochorous Pinus sylvestris, Betula pendula) were fewer in
   number. As a result, the share of fleshy-fruited species was much
   greater than those of wind-dispersed pioneer species. This is because
   fleshy-fruited species are able, thanks to artificial perching sites, to
   appear earlier than they would under natural conditions, in which these
   species follow the expansion and development of pioneer anemochorous
   species acting as natural perching sites. The presence of the
   electricity pylons compensates for a lack of natural perching sites in a
   homogenous landscape under intensive agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {{Megaregions among the large marine ecosystems of the Americas}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Pages = {{52-62}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We organized environmental observations (Sea Surface Temperature,
   chlorophyll concentration, and primary productivity) and biological
   diversity indices based on reconstructed fisheries landings obtained
   from the Sea Around Us project to address two objectives: 1) to
   understand whether adjacent Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) of the
   Americas form megaregions for assemblages of commercially-valuable fish;
   and 2) to assess changes in the diversity of fisheries landings in LMEs
   of the Americas over time (1982 to 2010). To test for similarities
   between LMEs, we used the seascape approach of unsupervised clustering
   of annual mean environmental observations and fisheries-derived
   diversity indices. Beta-diversity estimates based on fisheries landings
   were used to evaluate the degree to which species spanned LMEs. Temporal
   trends were computed for each dataset by linear least-squares. Three
   megaregions emerged when considering similarities in species composition
   of fisheries landings, fisheries-derived diversity indices, and
   characteristic environmental conditions among LMEs. These include (A)
   the South Brazil Shelf, East Brazil Shelf, and North Brazil Shelf LMEs,
   (B) the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf LMEs, and
   (C) the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf, Scotian Shelf, and
   Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf LMEs. No megaregions emerged for the Pacific
   Ocean. While there were some shared species assemblages between the
   California Current and the Gulf of Alaska, the Gulf of California, and
   the Pacific Central-American Coastal LMEs, these showed different
   average environmental conditions and fishery-derived diversity indices,
   so they did not cluster as a megaregion. In the Pacific Ocean, the high
   dissimilarity in the fisheries is in part related to different top-down
   pressures and strong regional differences in oceanographic properties,
   including upwelling and impacts of El-Nino Southern Oscillation events.
   Overall, between 1982 and 2010, seven LMEs diversified their fisheries
   (Pacific Central-America Coastal, Patagonian Shelf, South Brazil Shelf,
   East Brazil Shelf, North Brazil Shelf, Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf,
   and Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf). This may be due to a number of reasons
   including decreasing fishing pressure but expansion of target stocks due
   to management quotas, changes in regional markets, competition, effort,
   or a decrease in particular target stocks. Three LMEs showed
   increasingly less diversified fisheries, namely the California Current,
   the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf, and the Caribbean Sea LMEs. While
   in some cases this may be related to historical overfishing, such as in
   the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf LME, the California Current LME has
   been subjected to strong and conservative management practices. The
   Caribbean Sea LME was likely subjected to heavy fishing at a time of
   rapid environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Adults and juveniles of some forest breeding birds shift habitat use
   during the post breeding season from late to early successional forest.
   Juveniles of smaller passerine species are difficult to radio-track, and
   there is limited information on their habitat preferences, especially
   once they become older and independent. We determined if independent
   hatch-year birds captured in early-successional habitat remained there
   for extended periods, or if these habitats were only occupied
   infrequently during foraging activities. We determined habitat use for
   Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla), Worm-eating Warblers (Helmitheros
   vermivorum) and Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) during the independent
   post-fledging period in the Missouri Ozarks. We placed radio
   transmitters on 29 hatch-year birds captured in clearcuts and attempted
   to relocate them for 24 days in the summer of 2012. All three species
   had a greater relative probability of use of clearcut forest stands with
   small trees than older forests. Ovenbirds and Worm-eating Warblers
   remained in the early-successional habitat where initially captured,
   whereas Red-eyed Vireos used both late and early-successional habitat.
   Management efforts have primarily focused on breeding habitat for
   migratory songbirds, but the post-breeding period could be equally
   important given that hatch-year birds can spend an equal or greater
   amount of time in this stage. More information is needed to determine
   how widespread this habitat shill is for mature forest-breeding birds.}},

Abstract = {{Nature in cities is concentrated in urban green spaces, which are key
   areas for urban biodiversity and also important areas to connect people
   with nature. To conserve urban biodiversity within these natural
   refugia, habitat restoration such as weed control and revegetation is
   often implemented. These actions are expected to benefit biodiversity,
   although species known to be affected by urbanization may not be
   interacting with restoration in the ways we anticipate. In this study,
   we use a case study to explore how urban restoration activities impact
   different bird species. Birds were grouped into urban sensitivity
   categories and species abundance, and richness was then calculated using
   a hierarchical species community model for individual species responses,
   with urban class used as the hierarchical parameter. We highlight
   variable responses of birds to revegetation and weed control based on
   their level of urban sensitivity. Revegetation of open grassy areas
   delivers significant bird conservation outcomes, but the effects of weed
   control are neutral or in some cases negative. Specifically, the species
   most reliant on remnant vegetation in cities seem to remain stable or
   decline in abundance in areas with weed control, which we suspect is the
   result of a simplification of the understorey. The literature reports
   mixed benefits of weed control between taxa and between locations. We
   recommend, in our case study site, that weed control be implemented in
   concert with replanting of native vegetation to provide the understory
   structure preferred by urban sensitive birds. Understanding the impacts
   of revegetation and weed control on different bird species is important
   information for practitioners to make restoration decisions about the
   allocation of funds for conservation action. This new knowledge can be
   used both for threatened species and invasive species management.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain systems are often recognised as biodiversity hotspots; however,
   most montane forests are human-modified. Understanding the conservation
   value of human-modified forests is essential to mountain biodiversity
   conservation. In this study, mist-nets and point-counts were used to
   compare the bird communities of primary forests on ridges in the Ailao
   Mountains of Yunnan, China, and secondary forests, firewood forests, and
   pine plantations in nearby lower elevation zones. We found that
   community turnover among habitats was very high using both methods.
   Although the percentage of forest interior species and insectivores in
   each habitat was higher in the primary forests than in the
   human-modified forests, relatively high percentages of forest interior
   species and insectivores were recorded in the human-modified forests.
   Moreover, many bird species, forest interior species, insectivores and
   babblers were only recorded in the human-modified forests. Our study
   indicated that the primary forests are important for sustaining mountain
   bird diversity. However, given that primary forests are restricted to
   ridges, secondary forests, firewood forests, and pine plantations at
   lower elevations also play important roles in bird conservation in
   mountainous regions by increasing landscape diversity and partially
   offsetting species loss from primary forests. Therefore, conservation
   efforts should also be concentrated on human-modified forests at lower
   elevations in mountainous regions in south-west China.}},

Abstract = {{Urban vacant lots can vary considerably in their vegetation structure,
   from dense, shrubby habitats to wooded remnant fragments that may
   provide habitat for a variety of birds. By identifying which features
   promote diverse bird communities, we can determine at which scale
   management practices should focus and the necessary habitat structure
   and composition features. We surveyed 150 vacant lots throughout
   Baltimore, Maryland for their bird communities, lot vegetation, and
   landscape-level forest cover. An ordination of the bird community
   indicated a response to a gradient of canopy cover and canopy height at
   the vacant lot. We also found that forest cover within 100 m of the
   vacant lot was the most important predictor of abundance for five bird
   species of interest. Species richness was spatially autocorrelated among
   sites, indicating that bird communities may also be driven by species'
   dispersal and environmental gradients across the city. Overall, bird
   communities are responding to habitat features across multiple scales,
   from the vacant lot vegetation, to landscape-level forest cover, to
   city-wide dynamics. Thus, we recommend management practices to focus on
   increasing city-wide forest cover in order to increase species richness,
   yet with awareness regarding where the lot occurs within the city.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{242}},
Pages = {{34-42}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Airport properties often include agricultural land cover that can
   attract wildlife species hazardous to aircraft, despite recommendations
   against row crops near air operations areas. However, few studies have
   directly quantified bird use of corn, wheat, and soybean fields relative
   to bird-aircraft collision (strike) hazard levels to support land cover
   recommendations. Therefore, we compared bird use among corn, wheat and
   soybean fields and predicted that corn and wheat would attract bird
   species recognized as hazardous to aviation. We also anticipated that
   soybeans would pose minimal attraction to such birds. Here, hazard
   ranking (low to extremely high) reflects the percentage of strikes
   involving a species that resulted in damage to aircraft. We investigated
   bird use among 22 corn, wheat, and soybean fields near Oak Harbor, OH,
   using approximately weekly point transects from 2013 to 2014. We used
   generalized distance sampling models and analysis of variance using
   distance matrices to determine bird abundance and community responses to
   row crop land coverages and crop height. We observed 4331 birds of 40
   species, with most birds observed in wheat fields (n = 2555 birds) and
   standing stubble (n = 2409 birds). Large flocks occurred more in corn
   and wheat fields than soybean fields, but soybean fields harbored
   greater cumulative hazard scores than corn, likely due to consistent
   detections of small, non-flocking birds in soybean fields. Crop type and
   height had greater influence on medium- and high-hazard level bird
   species than other hazard levels. Density of medium- and high-hazard
   level birds increased with increasing crop height in soybean and wheat
   fields with wheat fields having slightly greater densities than
   soybeans. Corn fields also had the greatest bird densities in the
   tallest crop height categories. Categories of very and extremely
   high-hazard level bird species were rarely detected, but their abundance
   peaked in crops 0-15 cm, similar to low-hazard level bird species.
   However, model selection results included null models for very and
   extremely high-hazard level bird species suggesting minimal effects.
   Overall, our results suggest that all three crop types can harbor birds
   hazardous to aircraft, and crop height can enhance bird use. Although
   not directly tested in our study, land management surrounding airports
   may benefit most from alternative land covers (e.g., biofuel crops), but
   additional research is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of invasive plant control on native animals are rarely
   evaluated. Using data from an eight-year study in southeastern
   Australia, we quantified the effects on native bird, mammal, and reptile
   species of (1) the abundance of the invasive Bitou Bush,
   Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata, and (2) a Bitou Bush control
   program, which involved repeated herbicide spraying interspersed with
   prescribed burning. We found that overall species richness of birds,
   mammals, and reptiles and the majority of individual vertebrate species
   were unresponsive to Bitou Bush cover and the number of plants. Two
   species including the nationally endangered Eastern Bristlebird
   (Dasyurus brachypterus) responded positively to measures of native
   vegetation cover following the control of Bitou Bush. Analyses of the
   effects of different components of the treatment protocol employed to
   control Bitou Bush revealed (1) no negative effects of spraying on
   vertebrate species richness; (2) negative effects of spraying on only
   one individual species (Scarlet Honeyeater); and (3) lower bird species
   richness but higher reptile species richness after fire. The occupancy
   of most individual vertebrates species was unaffected by burning; four
   species responded negatively and one positively to fire. Our study
   indicated that actions to remove Bitou Bush generally have few negative
   impacts on native vertebrates. We therefore suggest that controlling
   this highly invasive exotic plant species has only very limited negative
   impacts on vertebrate biota.}},

Abstract = {{The native vegetation of the Sabana de Bogota's flat area has been
   replaced by agricultural lands, pastures and urbanizations over the
   years. The last relict of this native vegetation is a small forest (ca
   10 ha) at Hacienda Las Mercedes, in the northern border of Bogota. The
   forest's small size and isolation from other areas of natural vegetation
   have resulted in the loss of many species. The problem was exacerbated
   by uncontrolled growth of invasive vegetation (vines and wild
   blackberry). However, in recent years restorative action including
   control of these vegetation has been undertaken and the forest is now
   immerse in a natural reserve where more restorative actions are being
   planned. Using point count stations the authors recorded all the birds
   seen and heard in 2001-2002 and in 2014 in order to evaluate the changes
   in the bird community and estimate the effects of the restorative
   actions. We recorded 27 forest species in the first census and 30 in the
   second. The relative abundance of at least 1/3 of the species also
   increased indicating a positive result in the forest restoration. The
   results highlight the capacity of degraded ecosystems to recover and the
   importance of continuing the restorative actions in the reserve area.}},

Abstract = {{Tree microhabitats (cavities, conks of fungi, bark features) play an
   important role for both rare and specialized species biodiversity; their
   preservation should therefore be targeted by biodiversity-friendly
   forest practices. However, when compared to other old-growth
   characteristics like deadwood or large trees, tree microhabitats have
   only recently been studied so related scientific knowledge is still
   relatively limited. Defining target values for microhabitat densities in
   managed forests is mostly based on expert knowledge rather than
   quantitative empirical data.
   We compared the densities of microhabitat-bearing trees between managed
   forests, where wood is still harvested, and strictly protected forest
   reserves, where harvesting has been abandoned, in 17 French forests (222
   plots) located in both lowlands and mountain regions. We found that
   microhabitat densities are generally higher in strict forest reserves
   than in managed forests and that this difference is mainly driven by
   standing dead and large living trees. Though scarce, standing dead trees
   over-contribute to the difference observed while large trees played a
   lesser but significant role. In addition, contrary to results obtained
   for other old-growth characteristics (such as deadwood volumes), the
   difference between managed and strict forest reserves was higher in
   mountain than in lowland forests. For individual microhabitats, five out
   of eleven microhabitats in mountains and only one in lowland (woodpecker
   cavities) were significantly more numerous in strict forest reserves
   than in managed forests. Finally, total microhabitat density and density
   of specific microhabitats such as cavities and bark features increased
   with time since the last harvest. This increase was also mainly
   supported by standing dead microhabitat-bearing trees. Compared to
   previous studies in comparable contexts, the densities we estimated were
   generally higher; however, such comparisons could only be made for the
   most documented microhabitat types.
   Our results support the idea that management abandonment favours the
   abundance and diversity of microhabitats. However, microhabitat dynamics
   remain poorly known and only long-term monitoring will help understand
   underlying mechanisms of recruitment. In the meantime, our results may
   inspire forest managers in their application of daily
   biodiversity-friendly practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Aridity influences the recovery of vegetation and shrubland birds after
   wildfire}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires play a determining role in the composition and structure of
   many plant and animal communities. On the other hand, climate change is
   considered to be a major driver of current and future fire regime
   changes. Despite increases in drought in many areas of the world, the
   effects of aridity on post-fire colonization by animals have been rarely
   addressed. This study aims to analyse how a regional aridity gradient
   affects post-fire recovery of vegetation, bird species richness and the
   numbers of four early to middle-successional warbler species associated
   with the shrub cover. The database contains bird relative abundance and
   environmental variables from 3072 censuses in 695 transects located in
   70 recently burnt areas (1 to 11 years after wildfire) in Catalonia
   (Spain), which were sampled between 2006 and 2013. Generalized linear
   mixed models (GLMMs) showed that plant cover was affected by time since
   fire, aridity and forest management. However, only the highest
   vegetation height layer (>100 cm) recovered slower in arid areas after
   fire. Time since fire positively influenced bird species richness and
   the relative abundance of the four focal species. The post-fire recovery
   of Melodious (Hippolais polyglotta) and Subalpine warblers (Sylvia
   cantillans) was hampered by aridity. Although this was not demonstrated
   for Dartford (S. undata) and Sardinian warblers (S. melanocephala),
   their occurrence was low in the driest areas during the first three
   years after fire. Overall, this study suggests that future increases in
   aridity can affect plant regeneration after fire and slow down the
   recovery of animal populations that depend on understorey and
   shrublands. Given the recently highlighted increases in aridity and fire
   frequency in Mediterranean-climate regions, improved knowledge on how
   aridity affects ecological succession is especially necessary.}},

Title = {{Street trees reduce the negative effects of urbanization on birds}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{The effects of streets on biodiversity is an important aspect of urban
   ecology, but it has been neglected worldwide. Several vegetation
   attributes (e.g. street tree density and diversity) have important
   effects on biodiversity and ecological processes. In this study, we
   evaluated the influences of urban vegetation-represented by
   characteristics of street trees (canopy size, proportion of native tree
   species and tree species richness)-and characteristics of the landscape
   (distance to parks and vegetation quantity), and human impacts (human
   population size and exposure to noise) on taxonomic data and functional
   diversity indices of the bird community inhabiting streets. The study
   area was the southern region of Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais, Brazil), a
   largely urbanized city in the understudied Neotropical region. Bird data
   were collected on 60 point count locations distributed across the
   streets of the landscape. We used a series of competing GLM models
   (using Akaike's information criterion for small sample sizes) to assess
   the relative contribution of the different sets of variables to explain
   the observed patterns. Seventy-three bird species were observed
   exploiting the streets: native species were the most abundant and
   frequent throughout this landscape. The bird community's functional
   richness and Rao's Quadratic Entropy presented values lower than 0.5.
   Therefore, this landscape was favoring few functional traits. Exposure
   to noise was the most limiting factor for this bird community. However,
   the average size of arboreal patches and, especially the characteristics
   of street trees, were able to reduce the negative effects of noise on
   the bird community. These results show the importance of adequately
   planning the urban afforestation process: increasing tree species
   richness, preserving large trees and planting more native trees species
   in the streets are management practices that will increase bird species
   richness, abundance and community functional aspects and consequently
   improve human wellbeing and quality of life.}},

Title = {{Management factors affecting densities of common grassland birds of high
   elevation grasslands of eastern South Africa: Ingula as a case study}},
Journal = {{AVIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: World-wide grassland birds are in decline due to habitat
   loss and degradation resulting from intensive agricultural practices.
   Understanding how key grassland habitat attributes determine grassland
   bird densities is required to make appropriate conservation decisions.
   We examine drivers of bird densities in a South African grassland area
   that has been managed for biodiversity conservation with reduced grazing
   pressure.
   Methods: We estimated the density of the eight most common grassland
   bird species encountered in our area to evaluate the effects of recent
   grassland management changes on the avifauna. We collected data on birds
   and habitat from the austral summers of 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and
   2010/2011. We used hierarchical distance sampling methods to estimate
   density of birds relative to two main habitat variables, i.e., grass
   cover and height. In addition, we used regression splines within these
   distance sampling models as a more flexible description of suitable
   ranges of grass height and cover for each species.
   Results: For most species, density is related to grass height and cover
   as expected. The African Quailfinch (Ortygospiza atricollis) and Common
   Quail (Coturnix coturnix) preferred relatively short and open grass. The
   Yellow-breasted Pipit (Anthus chloris), African Pipit (Anthus
   cinnamomeus) and Red-capped Lark (Calandrella cinerea) preferred short
   and relatively dense grass, while the Wing-snapping Cisticola (Cisticola
   ayresii) preferred grass of intermediate height and cover. The Cape
   Longclaw (Macronyx capensis) and Zitting Cisticola (Cisticola juncidis)
   preferred tall and dense grass. Our results agree with previous studies
   that grass height combined with grass cover are the most important
   habitat features that managers should manipulate in order to increase
   the density of target species. The regression splines show that the
   effect of these two habitat variables on density is well described by
   linear relationships for most species.
   Conclusions: This study supports previous studies suggesting that
   grazing and fire are important tools for management to use in order to
   create a mosaic of grass height and cover that would support high
   densities of desired species. We suggest that conservation managers of
   these grasslands combine fire and grazing as management tools to create
   suitable habitats for grassland birds in general.}},

Abstract = {{Southwestern dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium vaginatum subsp. cryptopodum)
   parasitizes ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). It can kill severely
   infected trees and induce the growth of dense masses of branches that
   can affect foraging and nesting habitat for wildlife. We tested the
   hypothesis that higher densities of breeding birds would be correlated
   with higher levels of southwestern dwarf mistletoe in ponderosa pine
   forests of Arizona. We estimated densities of 15 species of breeding
   birds and measured 26 habitat elements in 19 stands. Average dwarf
   mistletoe ratings (DMR) ranged from 0.0 (uninfested) to 3.7 (severely
   infested). Although we observed higher densities with higher infestation
   of dwarf mistletoe for 2 bird species and lower densities for 3 bird
   species, the effect of dwarf mistletoe on these was minor. Instead,
   higher snag density, an indirect measure of past mistletoe infestation,
   was a more important predictor of bird density. With greater snag size
   or density, the species richness and densities of 3 bird species
   increased. Because dwarf mistletoe infection can create snags, retaining
   groups of dwarf mistletoe-infected trees in ponderosa pine stands will
   provide a continued source of snags, which are important habitat for
   many wildlife species.}},

Abstract = {{Reintroduction projects aim to reestablish a self-sustaining population
   of an endangered species within its historical range. Adequate
   post-release monitoring by gathering demographic data is important to
   evaluate the success of a reintroduction. Survival and reproduction
   rates of a reintroduced population can be compared with a
   self-sustaining wild population to evaluate the success of a
   reintroduction. In early 2007, Nipponia nippon (Crested Ibis) was
   reintroduced into the Qinling Mountains (Shaanxi, Central China). In
   this study, we attempt to evaluate the demographic status of the
   reintroduced population. Age-specific survival rates of 56 released
   adults and 77 wild-born fledglings were estimated using mark-recapture
   data obtained from 2007 to 2014. Survival rates for the yearlings
   (0.599, with 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.467-0.719) were lower
   than the estimates from a wild population in Yangxian County, but the
   survival rates of the adults (0.678, with 95\% CI: 0.603-0.745) were
   similar. The number of breeding pairs gradually increased since 2008,
   although breeding success (52.5\%) was somewhat less than that of the
   wild population (67.6\%). The stochastic estimation of population growth
   rate (1.084 with 95\% CI: 1.069-1.098) and population size (5-fold
   increase) estimated from an age-classified Leslie matrix indicate that
   the reintroduced population of the Crested Ibis is more likely in
   regulation phase over the next 25 years. We conclude that the
   reintroduction of the Crested Ibis in Qinling Mountains has great
   promise, and progress toward a self-sustaining population has been made
   under some interventions. Governments, local communities, and scientists
   need to facilitate habitat restoration for the long-term survival of
   this endangered species.}},

   Mistletoes also create microhabitat features known to be important to
   wildlife by causing deformations in their host trees. However, links
   between availability of mistletoe-formed microhabitat and wildlife
   diversity has not been well-studied. We investigated this relationship
   by quantifying microhabitat features and avian abundance and diversity
   related to infection by oak mistletoe (Phoradendron villosum (Nutt.)
   Nutt. ex Engelm.) in Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana Douglas ex
   Hook.). Quercus garryana woodlands support several avian species of
   conservation concern, so understanding the influence of mistletoe on
   wildlife habitat is critical. Our results suggest that (i) structural
   heterogeneity within tree crowns is positively associated with mistletoe
   load; (ii) avian species richness and abundance are positively
   associated with mistletoe load; and (iii) the fruit of P. villosum is an
   important food for Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana) and other wildlife
   in late autumn and early winter. If a goal of restoration is to maintain
   habitat for oak-associated bird species, managers should consider the
   retention of some oaks hosting mistletoe.}},

Abstract = {{Savanna vegetation is controlled by bottom-up (e.g. soil and rainfall)
   and top-down (e.g. fire and herbivory) factors, all of which have an
   effect on biodiversity. Little is known about the relative contribution
   of these factors to biodiversity, particularly the long-term effects of
   top-down disturbance on patterns of woody plant composition. The aim of
   this study was to identify if various degrees of disturbance regimes
   create distinct woody species community assemblages. Data were collected
   over 1820 plots across Kruger National Park, South Africa. Woody species
   were identified and categorized into one of three height classes: shrub
   (0.75-2.5m), brush (2.5-5.5m), and tree (>5.5m). Species richness and
   composition were calculated for each site and height class. A
   combination of long-term fire and elephant density data were used to
   delineate areas with varying degrees of top-down disturbance (i.e. low,
   medium and high). Using these degrees of disturbance, species
   composition was identified and community assemblages constructed
   according to each disturbance regime. Our results suggest that areas
   with similar disturbance regimes have similar species composition. Shrub
   composition was mainly responsive to the number of fires between the
   years 1941-1990, while tree composition was more responsive to elephant
   disturbance. A few dominant species were found equally under all degrees
   of disturbance at all height classes, while others were more regularly
   found under specific disturbance regimes at particular height classes.
   This study highlights that while species richness does not appear to be
   influenced by long-term, top-down disturbance regimes, species community
   composition may be responsive to these disturbances. Most species and
   structural classes persisted across all disturbance regimes, but the
   long-term effects of top-down disturbances can influence compositional
   and structural biodiversity. This information provides context for
   management policies related to artificial water provision, elephants and
   fire.}},

Abstract = {{Every stage of succession may provide certain species with habitat
   requirements which are impossible in other stages of succession. This
   study attempts to evaluate the different stages of succession in terms
   of composition and structure of bird populations in Hyrcanian forests.
   Bird-habitat relationships were investigated by comparing vegetation
   characteristics in three successional stages including late, initial
   stage, and urban areas. Bird richness, diversity, and abundance were
   measured within a 25-m radius of each of the 120 sampling points in
   various stages of succession and urban areas from May to April (2014) in
   the Ziarat catchment. This study indicated that every stage of
   succession may support certain species. Based on bird-habitat
   associations along the various stages of succession, two groupswere
   distinguished. Conventional comparative analysis separated two groups of
   understory birds: interior specialists and edge specialists. The
   interior-specialist group was positively correlated with the number of
   dead trees, tall trees with high values of dbh and height and canopy
   cover. In contrast, edge specialists groups mainly included terrestrial
   insectivores and were positively correlated with open area and shrub
   cover, and percentage of shrub cover between 1 and 2 m in height. In
   summary, bird communities in Hyrcanian forests are highly dynamic in
   different vegetation covers suggesting that it is critical to increase
   diverse and abundant bird populations by conserving forests composed of
   mosaics of differently disturbed stands and mature forest patches.}},

Title = {{Are old boreal forests a safe bet for the conservation of the avifauna

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{385}},
Pages = {{127-139}},

Abstract = {{Old boreal forests are considered quality habitats for birds associated
   with decaying and dead trees. However, the quantity and quality of these
   structural attributes in old forest stands are likely to be influenced
   by important latitudinal changes in tree species composition and
   productivity from the southern boreal mixed to the northern coniferous
   forests. We measured habitat occupancy of cavity and bark nesting birds
   in old forests when the boreal forest landscape shifts from a mixed to a
   dominant coniferous matrix in the Clay Belt of Quebec and Ontario, a
   region where paludification dominates. Using playback calls, songs, and
   recent woodpeckers' foraging signs on trees, we measured the occurrence
   and foraging habitat use of 11 bird species associated with deadwood in
   86 unmanaged forest stands along a forest age gradient in both mixed and
   coniferous stands. In coniferous stands dominated by black spruce,
   deadwood birds showed a modal distribution in response to the aging of
   black spruce forests that reached a peak in stands of 160 years and then
   declined. Unproductive paludified stands, which made up more than 40\%
   of our study area, were associated with a significantly lower species
   richness of deadwood birds. At the opposite, although they represented
   less than 4\% of the forest cover in our study area, old boreal
   mixedwood forests (>90 years) were highly utilized habitats by deadwood
   birds. Structural diversity of trees (diversity of degradation stages
   and diameter of trees) was the variable that best explained species
   richness of this functional group of birds whereas at the individual
   species level, the quantity and quality of dead trees (degradation and
   size) in stands best explained species occurrence and abundance of
   foraging signs. Conservation efforts for deadwood birds should focus on
   old productive stands of both mixed and coniferous composition. However,
   our study pinpoints old mixed wood stand as habitats of special concern
   given their disproportionate importance for deadwood birds in northern
   boreal forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{What drives current population trends in forest birds - forest quantity,
   quality or climate? A large-scale analysis from northern Europe}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{385}},
Pages = {{177-188}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Changes in forestry practices and on-going climate change may both have
   large impacts on forest bird populations. However, large-scale analyses
   of the effects of temporal changes in forest structure on forest bird
   numbers are largely lacking. We compared temporal trends from two
   Swedish nationwide long-term monitoring schemes, the Swedish Bird Survey
   (1998-2015) and the Swedish National Forestry Inventory (1983-2014),
   giving representative values for both forest and bird changes over an
   area of 35 million ha. Since 1998 the total area of middle-aged and
   mature forest increased by 6.4\%. In parallel, several forest structures
   potentially beneficial to birds (dead wood, retention trees on clear
   cuts, multi-layer forests, old forest and broadleaved forest) increased
   somewhat in abundance, most likely as a result of legislation changes
   and increasing areas under forest certification schemes. Summer
   temperatures also increased, with warm summers dominating since 2002. In
   1998-2015, the population sizes of 58 forest bird species on average
   increased, as did the number of species observed per route, with no
   general difference between forest specialists (16 species) and
   generalists (42 species). However, from around 2005, the positive trends
   in bird numbers and many forest structures have levelled out. An
   analysis of species population trends in relation to a measure of
   climate sensitivity (Species Temperature Index, STI) suggested that
   forest birds, just like Swedish birds in general, have indeed been
   affected by a warming climate. But given their STI, forest birds on
   average had more positive trends than non-forest birds, suggesting that
   other factors than climate have affected them positively. Strong
   candidate factors are the documented changes in forest quality and
   quantity. Whereas our data and analyses are correlational, and no firm
   conclusions on causality therefore can be drawn, it is reasonable to
   assume that the recent increases in forest quantity, forest quality, and
   summer temperatures, all have contributed to the general increase in
   forest bird numbers in Sweden. But the relative contribution of these
   driving forces remains to be determined. When it comes to the
   potentially positive effects of improving forest quality in terms of
   increases in old forest, stratification, retention trees and dead wood,
   it is noteworthy that many of the positive trends in forest structures
   since the mid-1990s seem to have ceased recently. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Human actions have led to loss and degradation of wetlands, impairing
   their suitability as habitat especially for waterbirds. Such negative
   effects may be mitigated through habitat management. To date scientific
   evidence regarding the impacts of these actions remains scarce. We
   studied guild specific abundances of breeding and staging birds in
   response to habitat management on 15 Finnish wetlands. In this study
   management actions comprised several means of vegetation removal to
   thwart overgrowth. Management cost efficiency was assessed by examining
   the association between site-specific costs and bird abundances. Several
   bird guilds exhibited positive connections with both habitat management
   as well as with invested funds. Most importantly, however, red-listed
   species and species with special conservation concern as outlined by the
   EU showed positive correlations with management actions, underlining the
   conservation value of wetland management. The results suggest that
   grazing was especially efficient in restoring overgrown wetlands. As a
   whole this study makes it clear that wetland habitat management
   constitutes a feasible conservation tool. The marked association between
   invested funds and bird abundance may prove to be a valuable tool for
   decision makers when balancing costs and impact of conservation measures
   against one another.}},

Title = {{Avian Species and Functional Diversity in Agricultural Landscapes: Does
   Landscape Heterogeneity Matter?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 26}},
Abstract = {{While the positive relationship between avian diversity and habitat
   heterogeneity is widely accepted, it is primarily based on observed
   species richness without accounting for imperfect detection. Other
   facets of diversity such as functional diversity are also rarely
   explored. We investigated the avian diversity-landscape heterogeneity
   relationship in agricultural landscapes by considering two aspects of
   diversity: taxonomic diversity (species richness) estimated from a
   multi-species dynamic occupancy model, and functional diversity
   (functional evenness {[}FEve] and divergence {[}FDiv]) based on traits
   of occurring species. We also assessed how agricultural lands enrolled
   in a conservation program managed on behalf of declining early
   successional bird species (hereafter CP38 fields, an agri-environment
   scheme) influenced avian diversity. We analyzed breeding bird data
   collected at CP38 fields in Mississippi, USA, during 2010-2012, and two
   principal components of environmental variables: a gradient of
   heterogeneity (Shannon's landscape diversity index) and of the amount of
   CP38 fields (percent cover of CP38 fields; CP38). FEve did not show
   significant responses to environmental variables, whereas FDiv responded
   positively to heterogeneity and negatively to CP38. However, most FDiv
   values did not significantly differ from random expectations along an
   environmental gradient. When there was a significant difference, FDiv
   was lower than that expected. Unlike functional diversity, species
   richness showed a clear pattern. Species richness increased with
   increasing landscape heterogeneity but decreased with increasing amounts
   of CP38 fields. Only one species responded negatively to heterogeneity
   and positively to CP38. Our results suggest that the relationships
   between avian diversity and landscape heterogeneity may vary depending
   on the aspect of diversity considered: strong positive effects of
   heterogeneity on taxonomic diversity, but weakly positive or
   non-significant effects on functional diversity. Our results also
   indicate that effectiveness of CP38 in conserving avian diversity,
   particularly, taxonomic diversity, could be limited without the
   consideration of landscape heterogeneity.}},

Volume = {{237}},

Abstract = {{Despite the introduction of agri-environmental schemes, no general
   increase of farmland biodiversity in Europe has been observed. Farmers
   take decisions about the implementation of agri-environmental schemes at
   the farm scale, and it is thus highly relevant to assess the
   relationship between farm management and biodiversity at this scale to
   increase the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes. The present
   study quantifies to what extent and with which practices farmers can
   influence biodiversity on their farm and to what extent conditions
   outside farmers' control may mediate biodiversity.
   We grouped 27 variables into four variable sets: (1) ecological
   compensation (mainly semi-natural habitats), (2) in-field options (e.g.
   no growth regulator, insecticide and herbicide treatment), and (3) farm
   characteristics, which can be influenced by farmers (e.g. land-use
   types) as well as (4) farm settings, which cannot be influenced by
   farmers (e.g. altitude). As biodiversity metrics, plant, grasshopper,
   butterfly and bird richness and abundance of farmland target species
   were assessed on 133 farms of the Swiss Central Plateau from 2009 to
   2011. Variance partitioning and generalised linear mixed models were
   used to analyse the impact of each variable set on farmland species
   diversity.
   Our results provide evidence that farmers can indeed positively
   influence biodiversity by ecological compensation and in-field options.
   The variables of the ecological compensation set explained the highest
   proportion in the variation of plant richness and butterfly abundance.
   We found a significant positive relationship between in-field options
   and plant abundance. Our study illustrated that the effects of
   biodiversity-related farming practices differ between species and
   biodiversity metrics. Conditions outside farmers' control explained a
   high variation in grasshopper and bird diversity. One variable within
   the set of farm settings, the degree of consolidation, had a significant
   negative impact on five out of eight biodiversity metrics (plant,
   butterfly and bird richness; plant and bird abundance). We demonstrate
   that farmers can substantially enhance biodiversity on their farms and
   provide knowledge on how such biodiversity improvements can be achieved
   by farmers. Further, we highlight the value of new biodiversity-related
   management practices such as in-field options. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{384}},
Pages = {{389-399}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Determining species occurrence in ecosystems of high conservation
   concern is especially important for recommending habitat management
   techniques and identifying suitable restoration sites. We investigated
   (1) how stand- and landscape-scale attributes affect occupancy of
   priority bird species associated with longleaf pine (Pines palutris)
   ecosystems, (2) if these priority birds can be used as indicator species
   for desired open pine forest structure, and (3) if these indicator
   species are positively correlated with greater avian richness. We
   compared priority bird occupancy among 12 stand types (habitat types)
   throughout the historic range of longleaf pine in Mississippi. We found
   stands resembling the historic longleaf pine ecosystem were positively
   associated with Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) and
   Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) occupancy probabilities, but were
   not significantly correlated with Northern Bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus) or Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla) occupancy. Both of
   which were too generalized in their occurrence to be useful indicators.
   Red-cockaded Woodpecker and Bachman's Sparrow occupancy probabilities
   positively correlated with desired forest structure metrics of longleaf
   pine ecosystems such as low midstory density (<10\%) and basal area
   (9.2-16.1 m(2)/ha) and 40-60\% canopy cover suggesting they are
   effective indicators of historic longleaf pine conditions. Co-occurrence
   of Red-cockaded Woodpecker and Bachman's Sparrow was positively
   correlated with avian richness, indicating these species can be used in
   conjunction as effective indicators for desired open pine endpoints used
   for restoration and management. Inclusion of priority bird species in
   management efforts provides assurance that restored areas will
   incorporate desired forest structure endpoints that have been linked to
   open pine priority bird presence. Correlation between priority bird
   species and avian species richness ensures restored areas provide
   suitable habitat for local avian communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Forest attributes and their abundances define the stand structural
   complexity available as habitat for faunal biodiversity; however,
   intensive anthropogenic disturbances have the potential to degrade and
   simplify forest stands. In this paper we develop an index of stand
   structural complexity and show how anthropogenic disturbances, namely
   fire, logging, livestock, and their combined presence, affect stand
   structural complexity in a southern Global Biodiversity Hotspot. From
   2011 to 2013, we measured forest structural attributes as well as the
   presence of anthropogenic disturbances in 505 plots in the Andean zone
   of the La Araucan o A a Region, Chile. In each plot, understory density,
   coarse woody debris, number of snags, tree diameter at breast height,
   and litter depth were measured, along with signs of the presence of
   anthropogenic disturbances. Ninety-five percent of the plots showed
   signs of anthropogenic disturbance (N = 475), with the combined presence
   of fire, logging, and livestock being the most common disturbance (N =
   222; 44\% of plots). The lowest values for the index were measured in
   plots combining fire, logging, and livestock. Undisturbed plots and
   plots with the presence of relatively old fires (> 70 years) showed the
   highest values for the index of stand structural complexity. Our results
   suggest that secondary forests <70year post-fire event, with the
   presence of habitat legacies (e.g. snags and CWD), can reach a
   structural complexity as high as undisturbed plots. Temperate forests
   should be managed to retain structural attributes, including understory
   density (7.2 +/- 2.5\# contacts), volume of CWD (22.4 +/- 25.8 m(3)/ha),
   snag density (94.4 +/- 71.0 stems/ ha), stand basal area (61.2 +/- 31.4
   m(2)/ha), and litter depth (7.5 +/- 2.7 cm). Achieving these values will
   increase forest structural complexity, likely benefiting a range of
   faunal species in South American temperate forests.}},

Pages = {{253-259}},
Abstract = {{The expansion of coal-fired power stations in South Africa has resulted
   in growing environmental concerns as they are the largest emitters of
   sulphur dioxide (SO2). Sulphur dioxide emissions from power plants pose
   a potential threat to avian populations. However, the effect of SO2
   pollution on bird communities is poorly understood. Using point counts
   we investigated the relationships of bird species richness and
   species-specific density with SO2 concentrations around Matimba power
   station. Environmental parameters were derived from remotely sensed data
   and data reduction was performed using principal component analysis.
   Generalised linear mixed models were then used to infer the
   relationships of bird species richness and species-specific densities
   with SO2 concentrations and the environmental variables. Our results
   revealed that SO2-polluted air had no influence on bird species richness
   and densities in our study sites, but SO2 levels were below annual
   national ambient air quality standards. Vegetation productivity was
   found to have a greater influence on species densities than SO2
   pollution. Monitoring of bird population changes around Matimba power
   station once neighbouring Medupi power station is fully operational is
   recommended, as SO2 content of the air will increase significantly, and
   species may be sensitive to this increase in SO2 levels.}},

Abstract = {{Bird-plant species associations can be an important component of habitat
   selection in forest birds. We assessed tree species preferences of
   foraging insectivorous birds in a primeval beech-fir forest in
   north-west Slovakia, hypothesizing that bird population densities are
   negatively associated with foraging specialization. We sampled foraging
   behaviour by random point observations from mid-May until the end of
   July during 1997-2003. Significant preference or avoidance patterns were
   found in 16 of 17 bird species. Based on the tree preference index, we
   distinguished four main foraging specializations: generalists, deciduous
   specialists, coniferous specialists, and dead wood specialists. Many
   bird species showed strong preferences for such rare and uncommon tree
   species as wych elm (Ulmus glabra), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), and
   Norway spruce (Picea abies). European beech (Fagus sylvatica), hazel
   (Corylus avellana), and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) were generally avoided.
   Birds with low densities tended to be most selective, but that effect
   was not statistically significant. Population variability was not
   significantly associated with foraging specialization. We hypothesize
   that impoverishment of tree species diversity within forest stands could
   lead to less diverse bird assemblages composed of species specialized on
   those tree species remaining and of generalist foragers able to adapt to
   a wide range of foraging substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Existing fire policy encourages the maintenance of ecosystem integrity
   in fire management, yet this is difficult to implement on lands managed
   for competing economic, human safety, and air quality concerns. We
   discuss a fire management approach in the mid-elevations of the Sierra
   Nevada, California, USA, that may exemplify similar challenges in other
   fire-adapted regions of the western USA. We also discuss how managing
   for pyrodiversity through mixed-severity fires can promote ecosystem
   integrity in Sierran mixed conifer and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
   Laws) forests. To illustrate, we show how coarse-filter
   (landscape-level) and complementary fine-filter (species-level)
   approaches can enhance forest management and conservation biology
   objectives as related to wildfire management. At the coarse-filter
   level, pyrodiverse mixed-severity fires provide landscape heterogeneity.
   Species and ecosystem characteristics associated with pyrodiversity can
   be maintained or enhanced by accommodating moderately severe fires,
   which hasten restoration by recreating a complex vegetation mosaic
   otherwise at risk from suppression. At the fine-filter level, managers
   can select focal species and species of conservation concern based on
   the degree to which those species depend on fire and accommodate their
   specific conservation needs. The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus {[}Swainson, 1832]) is an ideal focal species for monitoring
   the ecological integrity of forests restored through mixed-severity
   fire, and the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis
   {[}Xantus de Vesey, 1860]) is a species of conservation concern that
   uses post-fire habitat mosaics and is particularly vulnerable to
   logging. We suggest a comprehensive approach that integrates wildland
   fire for ecosystem integrity and species viability with strategic
   deployment of fire suppression and ecologically based restoration of
   pyrodiverse landscapes. Our approach would accomplish fire management
   goals while simultaneously maintaining biodiversity.}},

Title = {{The Effects of Rainfall, Temperature, and Wind on a Community of Montane
   Birds in Shei-Pa National Park, Taiwan}},
Journal = {{ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{56}},
Abstract = {{Montane birds are regularly exposed to extreme weather variations.
   Taiwan's subtropical montane avifauna has many endemic species which are
   regularly exposed to large weather fluctuations. From 2010 to 2013, we
   conducted monthly censuses to study the influence of monthly weather
   variations on species richness and bird density of a montane bird
   community (> 3000 m a.s.l.) in Shei-Pa National Park. Censuses were
   conducted along a trail which traverses four distinct habitats with
   increasing altitude: bush forest ecotone, post-fire grassland, conifer
   forest, and rocky bushland. The highly variable weather corresponded
   with large fluctuations in the bird community. We found that lower
   temperatures had a negative effect on species richness and bird density,
   and this effect was strongest in the highest elevation habitat, the
   rocky bushland. Rainfall was positively correlated with bird density,
   but only explained 15\% of the variation, while the effects of wind
   speed were inconsistent and small. This is the first study to
   demonstrate such weather effects in Taiwan and probably East Asia. We
   briefly discuss adaptations to harsh weather conditions in birds, which
   might be a profitable future research field for montane birds in Taiwan.}},

Title = {{Assessing the potential for avifauna recovery in degraded forests in
   Indonesia}},
Journal = {{RAFFLES BULLETIN OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{35-48}},
Abstract = {{Continuing disappearance and degradation of primary tropical rainforests
   in Indonesia, and the ongoing conversion of degraded forest to
   monoculture plantations, threaten many bird species with local
   extinction. Yet, information on bird populations from the Sundaic
   region, which covers western Indonesia, is generally lacking, limiting
   our understanding of species responses to disturbance, extinction risks,
   and potential ways to counteract local species extinction processes. On
   the Indonesian island of Sumatra, bird density information is only known
   from two studies ( on four hornbill species and one pheasant species).
   Here, we compare bird densities between less degraded and highly
   degraded forests within the Harapan Rainforest Ecosystem Restoration
   Concession in Sumatra. From a total of 148 bird species recorded,
   densities were calculated for 47 species with the highest encounter
   rate, 33 of which were recorded in forests of both disturbance levels,
   allowing comparisons to be made. We found five species with higher
   densities in the highly degraded forest and seven species with higher
   densities in the less degraded forest. While our species-specific
   results were generally consistent with previous biological insights,
   there were exceptions, such as a species previously considered to be
   sensitive to habitat degradation, the sooty-capped babbler Malacopteron
   affine, being more abundant in the highly degraded forest. Our study
   revealed that despite its condition, degraded forest retains much value
   for Sumatran lowland forest birds, providing a compelling argument for
   securing its important conservation status under improved management,
   rather than assigning it for clearance as typically happens.}},

Title = {{Wintering bird responses to the presence of artificial surface water in
   a semi-arid rangeland}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Provision of artificial surface water has been suggested as a management
   practice that can benefit wildlife in arid and semi-arid regions. With
   unprecedented droughts predicted for many of these areas in North
   America in coming decades, understanding species response to the
   provision of artificial surface water should be evaluated. Moreover, a
   dearth of knowledge exists in the understanding of avian response to
   artificial surface water during the non-breeding season. To address this
   lack of knowledge, we sampled the avian community at varying distances
   from water sources in Beaver County, Oklahoma, USA from February-March
   2013-2014. A total of 20 species were detected. We found no relationship
   to avian species richness and distance to water. Likewise, pooled data
   of detections across all species indicated no relationship in relation
   to artificial surface water. Analysis on individual species indicated
   that western meadowlarks Sturnella neglecta did not respond to water.
   However, American tree sparrows Spizella arborea (plateau model beta =
   0.05, SE = 0.01) were attracted to surface water sources up to a
   distance of 100 m (SE = 40.19 m). Furthermore, white-crowned sparrows
   Zonotrichia leucophrys (linear beta = -0.01, SE = 0.006) were attracted
   to surface water sources up to distance of 250 m. Additionally, analysis
   indicated that used water sources by American tree sparrows had
   significantly more mixed shrub cover (\%) when compared to unused water
   sources (beta = 6.04, SE = 2.64; p = 0.03) and that use of water sources
   by white-crowned sparrows was influenced by the amount of mixed shrub
   cover within 50 m of the water source (beta = 0.36, SE = 0.16; p =
   0.02). Our results suggest that some overwintering sparrows will alter
   space use in response to the presence of artificial surface water,
   however, it is unknown whether provision of water influences overwinter
   survival of sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{Recent and unprecedented scale of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus
   urophasianus) conservation in the American West enables assessment of
   community-level benefits afforded to other sagebrush-obligate species.
   We use North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) count data and
   machine-learning to assess predictors influencing spatial distribution
   and abundance of three sagebrush-obligate songbirds (Brewer's sparrow
   {[}Spizella breweri], sagebrush sparrow {[}Artemisiospiza nevadensis],
   and sage thrasher {[}Oreoscoptes montanus]). We quantified co-occurrence
   of songbird abundance with sage-grouse lek distributions using point
   pattern analyses and evaluated the concurrence of songbird abundance
   within sage-grouse habitat restoration and landscape protection.
   Sagebrush land-cover predictors were positively associated with the
   abundance of each songbird species in models that explained 16-37\% of
   variation in BBS route level counts. Individual songbird models
   identified an apparent 40\% threshold in sagebrush land-cover, over
   which songbird abundances nearly doubled. Songbird abundances were
   positively associated with sage-grouse distributions (P < 0.01);
   range-wide, landscapes supporting > 50\% of males on leks also harbored
   13-19\% higher densities of songbirds compared with range-wide mean
   densities. Eighty-five percent of the conifer removal conducted through
   the Sage Grouse Initiative coincided with high to moderate Brewer's
   sparrow abundance. Wyoming's landscape protection (i.e., ``core
   area{''}) strategy for sagegrouse encompasses half the high to moderate
   abundance sagebrush sparrow and sage thrasher populations. In the Great
   Basin half the high to moderate abundance sagebrush sparrow and sage
   thrasher populations coincide with sage-grouse Fire and Invasive
   Assessment Tool priorities, where conservation actions are being focused
   in an attempt to reduce the threat of wildfire and invasive plants. Our
   work illustrates spatially targeted actions being implemented ostensibly
   for sage-grouse largely overlap high abundance centers for three
   sagebrush obligate passerines and are likely providing significant
   conservation benefits for lesswell-known sagebrush songbirds and other
   sagebrush-associated wildlife. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of

Abstract = {{Habitat availability might be the most important determinant of success
   for a species reintroduction programme, making investigation of the
   quality and quantity of habitat needed to produce self-sustaining
   populations a research priority for reintroduction ecologists. We used a
   stochastic model of population dynamics to predict whether attempts to
   improve existing breeding territories using artificial nest platforms
   improved the population growth rate and persistence of a reintroduced
   population of Northern Aplomado Falcons Falco femoralis septentrionalis
   in South Texas. We further assessed whether the creation of new
   territories, i.e. conversion of entire areas to suitable habitat and not
   simply the erection of nest platforms, would lead to a subsequent
   increase in the nesting population. Our model was able to reproduce
   several characteristics of the wild population and predicted the number
   of breeding pairs per year strikingly well (R-2 = 0.97). Simulations
   revealed that the addition of nest platforms improved productivity such
   that the population would decline to extinction without them but is
   stable since their installation. Moreover, the model predicted that the
   increase in productivity due to nest platforms would cause the
   population to saturate available breeding territories, at which point
   the population would contain a moderate proportion of non-territorial
   birds that could occupy territories if new ones become available.
   Population size would therefore be proportional to the increase in
   available territories. Our study demonstrates that artificial nest-sites
   can be an effective tool for the management of reintroduced species.}},

Abstract = {{Military training areas (MTAs) cover 6\% of the earth's land surface,
   but the impact on biodiversity of weapons use in MTAs remains largely
   unknown. We quantified the effects of military training on vertebrates
   in a 5-year study at Beecroft Weapons Range in south-eastern Australia
   by contrasting the occurrence of birds, mammals and reptiles between 24
   sites within an area subject to repeated weapons use and a matched set
   of non-impacted sites. Species richness of mammals and reptiles was
   similar within versus outside the impact area, although many-individual
   species responded to fire, which occurred more frequently in impacted
   sites. Bird species richness, the occurrence of larger-bodied and
   migratory bird species, and the occurrence of most individual bird
   species, was reduced within the impact area. Many bird species that
   displayed low prevalence in impacted sites also declined over time
   across the whole study area. Differences in biota between the impact and
   non-impact areas were detectable after controlling for the effects of
   recent fire, suggesting that weapons use impacted vertebrates through
   mechanisms additional to altered fire regimes.
   Overall, our data indicated that Beecroft Weapons Range maintained
   considerable biodiversity value despite prolonged military use. Hence,
   MTAs have the potential to make a substantial contribution to
   conservation outside the formal protected area network. However,
   managers of MTAs need to explicitly state their environmental
   objectives. This is because management practices may be different if the
   aim is to maximize species richness rather than to secure populations of
   particular species. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{188}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, the species that we discover will be uncommon, area
   restricted, and vulnerable to extinction. I describe the natural history
   of a newly discovered seed-eating finch from the Rocky Mountain region,
   the South Hills crossbill (Loxia curvirostra complex). It relies on
   seeds in the closed cones of the fire-adapted Rocky Mountain lodgepole
   pine (Pinus contorta latifolia) and is found only in the higher
   elevations of two small mountain ranges in southern Idaho. Here
   crossbills and pine are engaged in a coevolutionary arms race. Although
   most of the seeds remain secured within the cones for decades until the
   heat of a stand-replacing fire causes the cone scales to separate, seeds
   become accessible to crossbills slowly as cones weather and gaps form
   between some of the scales. However, hot days (32 degrees C), especially
   four or more hot days, seem to mimic the effect of fire, apparently
   causing the immediate release of a fraction of the seeds. Such events
   caused a 20\% annual decline in crossbills that lasted up to 4 years and
   an 80\% decline in the population between 2003 and 2011. This is an
   example of a novel trophic mismatch between a consumer and its resource
   caused by a shift in the phenology of the resource arising from climate
   change. Not only do these phenological shifts have the potential to
   cause seed consumers to decline, these shifts are also likely to cause
   reduced recruitment of the plants. The South Hills crossbill is
   especially vulnerable and will likely go extinct this century before
   lodgepole pine is extirpated from the South Hills.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape-level wildfires have a major role in structuring faunal
   assemblages, particularly in fire-prone landscapes. These effects are
   mediated by changes to vegetation structure and composition that
   directly influence the availability of shelter, feeding and breeding
   resources. We investigated the response of a semi-arid shrubland bird
   community in Western Australia to the prevailing fire regime by
   examining the abundance, diversity and guild structure in relation to
   time since fire. We also examined vegetation structural attributes in
   relation to time since fire. We surveyed 32 sites ranging in age from 12
   to 84 years since last fire. A total of 845 birds from 40 species were
   recorded. Vegetation structure varied with fire history with old and
   very old sites characterised by less bare ground, more leaf litter cover
   and greater canopy cover. Bird community composition varied with time
   since fire, driven by increased bird species richness and abundance of
   insectivores, granivores/frugivores, golden whistlers, grey
   shrike-thrush and red-capped robins with time since fire. Frequent,
   intense landscape-scale fires transform the landscape into homogeneous
   young shrublands, which may render vegetation unsuitable for several
   species and guilds.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has been a major factor in the loss of
   global biodiversity. Still, agricultural landscapes provide important
   habitat for many bird species, particularly in the Central Valley of
   California, USA, where >90\% of the natural wildlife habitat has been
   lost. As wildlife professionals increasingly work with agricultural
   producers to promote wildlife-friendly' farming, it is important to
   understand the relative value of specific crops and field management
   practices to birds. The value to wintering waterbirds of seven
   treatments (crop and management practice combinations) across two crops
   (corn and winter wheat) was assessed at Staten Island in the
   Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta of the Central Valley. Significant
   variation in the relative abundance of waterbirds was found among
   management practices, and post-harvest flooding and chopping and rolling
   (mulching) of corn were most beneficial to waterbirds. As expected, most
   waterbirds were common in flooded treatments, but geese, cranes and
   long-legged waders also were numerous in some dry treatments. Our data
   suggest that a greater waterbird species richness and abundance can be
   achieved by maintaining a mosaic of dry and flooded crop types, varying
   water depths and continuing the chop-and-roll practice for flooded corn.
   The observed benefits of particular crops and field management practices
   in this study should aid in the development of incentive-based programs
   to improve the habitat value of other working lands both within, and
   outside, the Delta.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of biological diversity is one of the main goals for
   managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. Presence and
   abundance of microhabitats, such as tree cavities or bark pockets, can
   be conveniently used as indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of
   sustainable forest management measures. In Mediterranean forest
   ecosystems, the relationships between stand-structure attributes and
   species-diversity indicators are still poorly studied.
   We described the structural attributes, deadwood characteristics and
   microhabitat occurrence in a silver fir forest of Central Apennines
   (Italy), which has not been submitted to silvicultural interventions for
   several decades. We assessed linkages between these characteristics and
   the abundance, distribution and diversity of saproxylic beetle fauna. A
   systematic aligned sampling method was conduced on 240 ha, examining 50
   plots of 530 m(2) each. Saproxylic beetles were sampled using window
   flight traps and emergence traps in relation to abundance and species
   richness at the plot level, but also on decaying deadwood. The
   heterogeneity in types and frequencies of microhabitats, and the link
   between structural attributes associated with stand complexity and
   saproxylic species, were also analysed. With the aim of describing the
   complex saproxylic ecological network, beetle species were classified
   according to the type of interactions with wood and other insects fauna,
   but also in relation to the trophic guilds. Linear regressions were
   conducted for highlighting metric variability and relationships between
   parameters, while geostatistical analyses were used to describe the
   spatial variability of structural features and the spatial pattern of
   beetle distributions.
   Results of linear regression and geostatistical analysis showed how the
   saproxylic beetle community is influenced by the amount, type and stage
   of decay of deadwood, but also by the forest structural complexity and
   the occurrence of microhabitats. Gap dynamics and natural disturbances
   had effects on deadwood amounts and microhabitat abundance, which was
   significantly higher than in managed and structurally simplified forest
   stands. Most of the entomological variables (namely, Families, Species,
   Total individuals, Saproxylic individuals, Staphylinidae, Elateridae,
   Nothodes parvulus, Curculionidae, Ernoporus fagi, Phyllobius emery) were
   clumped, highlighting the existence of aggregation areas in the sampled
   forest. In several cases the insect distribution was linked to the
   spatial pattern of forest attributes, particularly deadwood components.

Abstract = {{Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are native and ubiquitous throughout much of
   the continental United States and are invasive in many countries around
   the world. Where they occur, raccoons are a known predator of
   ground-nesting birds and herpetofauna. Raccoons often are associated
   with hardwood trees; therefore, hardwood reduction in open pine (Pinus
   spp.) forests of the southeastern U.S. may reduce raccoon use while
   providing suitable habitat for upland ground-nesting species. As a
   result, some have suggested removal of undesirable hardwoods as a means
   to manage nest predation by altering raccoon behavior. However, effects
   of operationally removing hardwoods from an open pine matrix on raccoon
   home range size and habitat selection are unknown. We compared home
   range sizes and habitat selection of adult raccoons in a longleaf pine
   (Pinus palustris) dominated forest before and after large-scale,
   operational hardwood removal. Male raccoons had larger (P < 0.001) home
   ranges than females, but home range sizes did not differ (P = 0.54) by
   period (i.e., before or after hardwood removal). However, raccoon
   habitat selection at the home range scale varied (P = 0.02) between
   periods as did selection of habitats within the home range (P = 0.01).
   When selecting areas for home ranges, raccoons had greater (P = 0.01)
   affinity for young pine stands following operational hardwood removal.
   Within the home range, raccoons increased (P = 0.01) selection for
   wetlands and decreased (P = 0.02) selection for primary roads following
   hardwood removal. Raccoon habitat selection within the home range did
   not vary (P = 0.39) seasonally. Pine forests were important when
   establishing home ranges during both periods, but other habitats (i.e.,
   secondary roads, young pine, hardwood, and mixed pine-hardwood) became
   equally as important as pine following hardwood removal. Within the home
   range, hardwood stands remained the most important habitat feature
   before and after hardwood removal. Our results suggest that raccoons
   alter habitat selection in response to hardwood removal, which may
   affect patterns of nest predation by raccoons. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Response of understory vegetation to salvage logging following a
   high-severity wildfire}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Timber is frequently salvage-logged following high-severity
   stand-replacing wildfire, but the practice is controversial. One concern
   is that compound disturbances could result in more deleterious impacts
   than either disturbance individually, with mechanical operations having
   the potential to set back recovering native species and increase
   invasion by non-native species. Following the 2002 Cone Fire on the
   Lassen National Forest, three replicates of five salvage treatments were
   applied to 15 units formerly dominated by ponderosa pine, covering a
   range of disturbance intensities from unsalvaged to 100\% salvaged.
   Understory species richness and cover data were collected every two
   years between 2006 and 2012. Richness of both native and non-native
   species did not differ among salvage treatments, but both showed strong
   changes over time. While cover of forbs and graminoids did not differ
   with salvage treatment, cover of shrubs was significantly reduced at the
   higher salvage intensities. The three main shrub species are all
   stimulated to germinate by fire, potentially leaving seedlings
   vulnerable to any mechanical disturbance occurring immediately
   postgermination. Many other native perennial species emerge from
   rhizomes or other deeply buried underground structures and appear to be
   less affected by salvage harvest. Over time, the plant community in all
   salvage treatments shifted from dominance by shrubs and forbs to shrubs
   and grasses. Most of the grasses were native, except Bromus tectorum
   (cheatgrass), which was found in 4\% of measurement quadrats in 2006 and
   52\% in 2012. Our results indicated that understory vegetation change
   4-10 years post-high-severity wildfire appeared to be influenced more
   strongly by factors other than salvage logging.}},

Abstract = {{Increased market viability of harvest residues gleaned for forest
   bioenergy feedstocks may intensify downed wood removal, particularly in
   intensively managed forests of the Southeast. Downed wood provides food
   and cover for many wildlife species, including birds, yet we are aware
   of no study that has examined winter bird response to experimentally
   manipulated, operational-scale woody biomass harvests. Further, little
   research has investigated avian use of dovined wood following timber
   harvests. As such, our objectives were to: (1) evaluate effects of
   varying intensities of woody biomass harvest on the winter bird
   community and (2) document spatial associations between winter bird
   species and available habitat structure, including downed wood, in
   regenerating stands. In January and February of 2012-2014, we surveyed
   birds using a modified version of spot-mapping in six woody biomass
   removal treatments in North Carolina, USA (n = 4 regenerating stands).
   Treatments included clearcut harvest followed by: (1) traditional woody
   biomass harvest with no biomass harvesting guidelines; (2) 15\%
   retention with harvest residues dispersed; (3) 15\% retention with
   harvest residues clustered; (4) 30\% retention with harvest residues
   dispersed; (5) 30\% retention with harvest residues clustered; and (6)
   no woody biomass harvest (i.e., reference). We tested for
   treatment-level effects on avian relative abundance (overall and
   individual species), species diversity and richness, and counts of
   winter birds detected near (,41 m from pile), in, or on branches of
   downed wood piles and calculated proportional avian habitat use of
   harvest residues and vegetation in regenerating stands. In 69 visits
   over three winters, we observed 3352 birds in treatments. In 2013,
   counts of birds detected in piles were greater in the no biomass harvest
   and 30\% clustered treatments than the no biomass harvesting guidelines
   treatment. In 2012 and 2013 combined, mourning dove (Zenaida macroura)
   had greater relative abundance in the no biomass harvest treatment
   compared to the 15\% dispersed treatment and was more often detected
   within 1 m of downed wood piles than in vegetation. We counted more
   winter birds in and near adjacent forest edge than in treatment
   interiors each year. Overall, we detected minimal treatment effects on
   winter bird relative abundance and no effects on species diversity and
   richness. Relative abundance of winter birds increased over time as
   vegetative cover established in regenerating stands. Our results suggest
   woody biomass harvests in intensively managed pine forests had no effect
   on the winter bird community, but winter birds used harvest residues.
   Further, vegetation structure and composition, rather than availability
   of harvest residues, primarily influenced winter bird use of
   regenerating stands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Bioenergy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Forest regeneration following timber harvest is a principal source of
   habitat for early-successional birds and characterized by influxes of
   early-successional vegetation and residual downed woody material.
   Early-successional birds may use harvest residues for communication,
   cover, foraging, and nesting. Yet, increased market viability of woody
   biomass as bioenergy feedstock may intensify harvest residue removal.
   Our objectives were to: 1) evaluate effects of varying intensities of
   woody biomass harvest on the early-successional bird community; and (2)
   document early-successional bird use of harvest residues in regenerating
   stands. We spot-mapped birds from 15 April-15 July, 2012-2014, in six
   woody biomass removal treatments within regenerating stands in North
   Carolina (n = 4) and Georgia (n = 4), USA. Treatments included clearcut
   harvest followed by: (1) traditional woody biomass harvest with no
   specific retention target; (2) 15\% retention with harvest residues
   dispersed; (3) 15\% retention with harvest residues clustered; (4) 30\%
   retention with harvest residues dispersed; (5) 30\% retention with
   harvest residues clustered; and (6) no woody biomass harvest (i.e.,
   reference site). We tested for treatment-level effects on breeding bird
   species diversity and richness, early-successional focal species
   territory density (combined and individual species), counts of breeding
   birds detected near, in, or on branches of harvest piles/windrows,
   counts of breeding bird behaviors, and vegetation composition and
   structure. Pooled across three breeding seasons, we delineated 536 and
   654 territories and detected 2,489 and 4,204 birds in the North Carolina
   and Georgia treatments, respectively. Woody biomass harvest had limited
   or short-lived effects on the early-successional, breeding bird
   community. The successional trajectory of vegetation structure, rather
   than availability of harvest residues, primarily drove avian use of
   regenerating stands. However, many breeding bird species used downed
   wood in addition to vegetation, indicating that harvest residues
   initially may provide food and cover resources for early-successional
   birds in regenerating stands prior to vegetation regrowth.}},

Abstract = {{An emerging hypothesis in fire ecology is that pyrodiversity increases
   species diversity. We test whether pyrodiversity-defined as the standard
   deviation of fire severity-increases avian biodiversity at two spatial
   scales, and whether and how this relationship may change in the decade
   following fire. We use a dynamic Bayesian community model applied to a
   multi-year dataset of bird surveys at 1106 points sampled across 97
   fires in montane California. Our results provide strong support for a
   positive relationship between pyrodiversity and bird diversity. This
   relationship interacts with time since fire, with pyrodiversity having a
   greater effect on biodiversity at 10 years post-fire than at 1 year
   post-fire. Immediately after fires, patches of differing burn severities
   hold similar bird communities, but over the ensuing decade, bird
   assemblages within patches of contrasting severities differentiate. When
   evaluated at the scale of individual fires, fires with a greater
   heterogeneity of burn severities hold substantially more species. High
   spatial heterogeneity in severity, sometimes called `mixed-severity
   fire', is a natural part of wildfire regimes in western North America,
   but may be jeopardized by climate change and a legacy of fire
   suppression. Forest management that encourages mixed-severity fire may
   be critical for sustaining biodiversity across fire-prone landscapes.}},

Title = {{Drivers of Bird Species Richness within Moist High-Altitude Grasslands
   in Eastern South Africa}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Moist high-altitude grasslands in South Africa are renowned for high
   avifaunal diversity and are priority areas for conservation.
   Conservation management of these areas conflicts with management for
   other uses, such as intensive livestock agriculture, which requires
   annual burning and leads to heavy grazing. Recently the area has become
   target for water storage schemes and renewable electricity energy
   projects. There is therefore an urgent need to investigate environmental
   factors and habitat factors that affect bird species richness in order
   to optimise management of those areas set aside for conservation. A
   particularly good opportunity to study these issues arose at Ingula in
   the eastern South African high-altitude grasslands. An area that had
   been subject to intense grazing was bought by the national power utility
   that constructed a pumped storage scheme on part of the land and set
   aside the rest for bird conservation. Since the new management took over
   in 2005 the area has been mostly annually burned with relatively little
   grazing. The new management seeks scientific advice on how to maintain
   avian species richness of the study area. We collected bird occurrence
   and vegetation data along random transects between 2006 and 2010 to
   monitor the impact of the new management, and to study the effect of the
   habitat changes on bird species richness. To achieve these, we convert
   bird transect data to presence only data to investigate how bird species
   richness were related to key transect vegetation attributes under this
   new grassland management. First we used generalised linear mixed models,
   to examine changes in vegetation grass height and cover and between
   burned and unburned habitats. Secondly, we examined how total bird
   species richness varied across seasons and years. And finally we
   investigated which habitat vegetation attributes were correlated with
   species richness of a group of grassland depended bird species only.
   Transects that were burned showed a larger decrease in vegetation cover
   compared to transects that were not burned. Grass height increased over
   time. Bird species richness was highest in summer compared to other
   seasons and increased over time. Overall bird species richness increased
   over the three summer surveys but species richness of birds that prefer
   heavily grazed habitat showed little change over the three years.
   Changes in bird species richness were best explained by the model with
   grass height for combined species richness of grassland depended birds
   but also for birds that prefer heavy grazing when treated alone. On one
   hand birds that prefer moderate grazing were best explained by a null
   model. However, overall bird species richness was better positively
   correlated to grass height than grass cover or dead grass. We conclude
   that frequent burning alone with relatively reduced grazing led to
   higher but less dense grass, which benefited some species and
   disadvantaged others. We suggest that management of this grassland use
   combination of fire and grazing and leave some areas unburned to
   accommodates birds of various habitat needs.}},

Title = {{Impacts of survival and reproductive success on the long-term population
   viability of reintroduced great bustards Otis tarda in the UK}},

Abstract = {{Reintroductions aim to re-establish species within their historical
   ranges through the release of wild- or captive-bred individuals
   following extirpation (or extinction) in the wild. There is no general
   agreement on what constitutes a successful reintroduction but the
   probability of the population achieving long-term persistence should be
   addressed. Here we review a 10-year trial reintroduction of the great
   bustard Otis tarda, a globally threatened bird species, to the UK and
   assess the long-term population viability. Despite changes in rearing
   and release strategy, initial post-release survival probability remained
   consistently low, with only 11.3\% of bustards (n = 167) surviving from
   release to. year post-release. Nineteen breeding attempts were made by
   eight females; however, only one chick survived > 100 days after
   hatching, and no wild juveniles have recruited into the population.
   Using demographic rates from the UK population and wild populations
   elsewhere, and stochastic population modelling, we investigate the
   viability of this reintroduced population by predicting population size
   over the next 10 years. Under current demographic rates the population
   was predicted to decline rapidly. Self-sufficiency was predicted only
   using the highest estimates from the UK population for first-year and
   adult survival, and recruitment rates from wild populations elsewhere.
   Although changes have been made in rearing, release strategies, habitat
   management and release sites used, these changes appear to have a modest
   effect on long-term viability. Substantial improvements in survival
   rates and productivity are necessary to establish a viable great bustard
   population in the UK, and we consider this unlikely.}},

Title = {{Grazed wet meadows are sink habitats for the southern dunlin (Calidris
   alpina schinzii) due to nest trampling by cattle}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{20}},

Abstract = {{The effect of habitat management is commonly evaluated by measuring
   population growth, which does not distinguish changes in reproductive
   success from changes in survival or the effects of immigration or
   emigration. Management has rarely been evaluated considering complete
   life cycle of the target organisms, including also possible negative
   impacts from management. We evaluated the effectiveness of cattle
   grazing in the restoration of coastal meadows as a breeding habitat for
   small and medium-sized ground-nesting birds by examining the size and
   demography of a southern dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii) breeding
   population. Using a stochastic renesting model that includes
   within-season variation in breeding parameters, we evaluated the effect
   of grazing time and stocking rates on reproduction. The census data
   indicated that the population was stable when nest trampling was
   prevented, but detailed demographic models showed that the population on
   managed meadows was a sink that persisted by attracting immigrants. Even
   small reductions in reproductive success caused by trampling were
   detrimental to long-term viability. We suggest that the best management
   strategy is to postpone grazing to after the 19th of June, which is
   about three weeks later than what is optimal from the farmer's point of
   view. The differing results from the two evaluation approaches warn
   against planning and evaluating management only based on census
   population size and highlight the need to consider target-specific life
   history characteristics and demography. Even though grazing management
   is crucial for creating and maintaining suitable habitats, we found that
   it was insufficient in maintaining a viable population without
   additional measures that increase nest success. In the presently studied
   case and in populations with similar breeding cycles, impacts from nest
   trampling can be avoided by starting grazing when about 70\% of the
   breeding season has past.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a major ecological process in ecosystems globally. Its impacts
   on fauna can be both direct (e.g., mortality) and indirect (e.g.,
   altered habitat), resulting in population recovery being driven by
   several possible mechanisms. Separating direct from indirect impacts of
   fire on faunal population recovery can be valuable in guiding management
   of biodiversity in fire-prone environments. However, resolving the
   influence of direct and indirect processes remains a key challenge
   because many processes affecting fauna can change concomitantly with
   time since fire. We explore the mechanisms influencing bird response to
   fire by posing the question, can temporal changes in vegetation
   structure predict changes in bird occurrence on sites, and can these be
   separated from other temporal changes using the surrogate of time since
   fire? We conducted a 12-yr study of bird and vegetation responses to
   fire at 124 sites across six vegetation classes in Booderee National
   Park, Australia. Approximately half of these sites, established in 2002,
   were burned by a large (>3000 ha) wildfire in 2003. To disentangle
   collinear effects of temporal changes in vegetation and direct
   demographic effects on population recovery that are subsumed by time
   since fire, we incorporated both longitudinal and cross-sectional
   vegetation effects in addition to time since fire within logistic
   structural equation models. We identified temporal changes in vegetation
   structure and richness of plant and bird species that characterized
   burned and unburned sites in all vegetation classes. For nine bird
   species, a significant component of the year trend was driven by
   temporal trends in one of three vegetation variables (number of
   understory or midstory plant species, or midstory cover). By contrast,
   we could not separate temporal effects between time since fire and
   vegetation attributes for bird species richness, reporting rate, and the
   occurrence of 11 other bird species. Our findings help identify species
   for which indirect effects of vegetation dominate recovery and thus may
   benefit from vegetation management where conservation actions are
   required and, conversely, those species for which direct effects of time
   since fire drive recovery, where simply leaving a system to recover
   following the last disturbance will be sufficient.}},

Abstract = {{Increased demand for oil palms has led to a massive expansion of logging
   and conversion of peat swamp forests in Southeast Asia. Although palm
   oil is a primary driver of economic growth, the unsustainable expansion
   of the oil palm industry has led to the widespread degradation of peat
   swamp forests. Birds have been studied to determine their responses to
   landscape changes in the North Selangor Peat Swamp Forest (NSPSF). We
   captured 1045 birds from 72 species of the NSPSF and 168 individual
   birds from 13 species in oil palm plantations using mist-netting. Our
   results show that peat swamp forest supports more bird species than the
   oil palm areas. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling revealed that both
   vegetation types had an influence on bird species composition. SIMPER
   analysis also showed that the percentage of the assemblage similarity
   within the oil palm areas was 51.30 \%, while it was 31.32 \% in the
   peat swamp. We found that the populations of frugivores, insectivores,
   and omnivores were significantly higher in the peat swamp forest,
   whereas there was no significant difference in the granivores between
   the two sites. To conserve peat swamp forests, stakeholders should
   implement habitat restoration, maintain landscape connectivity, and
   retain a forest area network.}},

Abstract = {{Forests have high biodiversity, but are under threat worldwide.
   Sustainable forest management such as close-to-nature silviculture is
   needed. In this context forest management practices should be tested in
   regard to biodiversity. Therefore, we investigated the influence of gap
   formation and logging intensity on different functional groups in a
   close-to-nature managed fir-beech forest. Plots were selected in three
   areas in the Dinaric Mountains in Slovenia. In every area, nine plots
   were selected per area, of which three were established as control
   plots, three were treated with 50\% logging and three with 100\%
   logging. In every plot, the species of different functional groups were
   observed: ectomycorrhizal fungi, ferns, graminoids, forbs, hoverflies,
   carabid beetles and birds. For each of these groups, the species
   richness, species assemblage dissimilarity and indicator species were
   calculated for the different treatments. Ectomycorrhizal fungi and birds
   both responded to high logging intensity with a sharp decrease in the
   number of species; however, the results for ectomycorrhizal fungi were
   highly nested, while some additional bird species appeared. Graminoids
   and forbs were positively affected by logging intensity and saw
   increases in the number of species. Forbs had an almost completely new
   species assemblage compared to the forest species assemblages.
   Hoverflies were most favored by 50\% logging, as these plots contained
   species from open areas and forest. Ferns and carabid beetles did not
   exhibit a response to different logging intensities. The number of
   indicator species was highly affected by the total number of species of
   the groups. However, which treatment they indicated was independent of
   the species richness but varied strongly per species group. The
   variability in responses shows that functional groups react differently
   to logging intensities, and the use of more functional groups improved
   the detection of changes due to logging. Fifty percent removal of the
   growing stock retained the diversity of most of the studied groups. The
   association of the group to vegetation structure, host species
   specificity or abiotic factors made them more responsive to the change
   associated with retention logging. The results are discussed in the
   context of forest management implications in regard to biodiversity. (C)

   development activities create patches on the landscape that modify the
   structure and integrity of ecosystems. Understanding the agents of
   change, where they occur, and how much of the landscape they are
   affecting will assist resource managers in making difficult decisions.
   To fulfill this goal, the National Park Service implemented a long-term
   monitoring program to quantify landscape dynamics across 1.5 million ha
   within and adjacent to eight national parks in the Upper Midwest United
   States using an automated satellite-based change detection program
   called LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and
   recovery). The disturbance agents detected inside parks included beaver,
   blowdown, development, fire, flooding, insect/disease, and forest
   harvest. Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore had the largest percentage of
   area affected inside a park (11.83\%, 1.96\% per yr), and Isle Royal
   National Park had the lowest percentage of land affected (0.03\%, 0.05\%
   per yr). Tree defoliation due to insect/disease affected the largest
   percentage of land inside parks (1.56\%, or 0.26\% per yr) but did not
   result in tree mortality. Adjacent to parks, disturbance agents detected
   included agriculture, beaver, blowdown, development, insect/disease,
   fire, flooding, and forest harvest. Lands adjacent to Pictured Rocks
   National Lakeshore experienced the highest rate of disturbance (8.75\%,
   1.45\% per yr), largely due to forest harvests. The lands adjacent to
   the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area experienced the
   lowest percentage of change (0.62\%, 0.10\% per yr), with development
   activities being responsible for most of the change. Forest harvesting
   was the major change agent outside six of the eight parks, an indication
   of how important the wood products industry is in the region and the
   level to which this region is forested. These national parks are acting
   as integral buffers from adjacent lands that either do not have the
   ability or lack the capacity to allow the ecosystem to function without
   intensive management efforts.}},

Title = {{Evaluating potential trade-offs among fuel treatment strategies in
   mixed-conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Fuel treatments in fire-suppressed mixed-conifer forests are designed to
   moderate potential wildfire behavior and effects. However, the
   objectives for modifying potential fire effects can vary widely, from
   improving fire suppression efforts and protecting infrastructure, to
   reintroducing low-severity fire, to restoring and maintaining variable
   forest structure and wildlife habitat. In designing a fuel treatment,
   managers can alter the treatment's prescription, placement, and extent
   (collectively the ``treatment strategy{''}) to optimally meet one
   objective. However, the potential for trade-offs among different
   objectives is rarely tested systematically in fire-prone landscapes. To
   evaluate trade-offs in mechanical fuel treatment objectives related to
   fire severity, smoke production, forest heterogeneity, and avian
   wildlife habitat, we used a cross-platform modeling approach based on
   spatially explicit modifications of forest structure data for a 7820-ha
   landscape in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California. We examine whether (1) a
   more uniform treatment strategy aimed at fire hazard reduction (FHR) had
   negative effects on wildlife diversity, (2) a strategy focused on
   protecting the wildland-urban interface (WUI) left other portions of the
   landscape vulnerable to high-severity fire, and (3) increasing the
   extent of fuel treatments across the landscape led to greater reductions
   in fire severity and smoke emissions. When approximately 13\% of the
   landscape was treated, the proportion of the landscape vulnerable to
   high-severity fire decreased by 13-44\%, with the more uniform FHR
   strategy leading to greater reductions. Slight increases in predicted
   avian species richness that followed all treatment strategies were not
   closely linked to increases in canopy variability. The WUI protection
   strategy led to considerable reductions in fire severity at the
   landscape scale. Increasing the extent of treatments to 30\% of the
   landscape did little to further reduce the area vulnerable to
   high-severity fire, with additional reductions of 4-7\% depending on the
   prescription. However, increasing the extent of treatments reduced the
   extent of harmful downwind smoke impacts, primarily by reducing rate of
   fire spread. Treatment strategies will depend on specific management
   objectives, but we illustrate that trade-offs are not necessarily
   inherent in general outcomes of fuel treatments.}},

Title = {{Assessing the efficacy of community-based natural resource management
   planning with a multi-watershed approach}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{120-128}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Community-based natural resource management groups often develop plans
   with management objectives and conservation goals for specified areas.
   However, assessments of the environmental outcomes achieved by such
   planning initiatives are rare at large scales because of: 1) the lack of
   appropriate data collection and monitoring, 2) difficulty in isolating
   the effects of management actions from external environmental variables,
   and 3) the inherent variability in implementation timing across multiple
   managed areas. We developed a methodology that partially overcomes these
   common barriers. Using a unique time-related measure and trend analysis,
   we tested our methodology with community-based natural resource
   management plans across Illinois along with plant and bird community
   data. We found evidence that community-based natural resource management
   planning is having positive ecological influences across these habitats.
   Effects were most evident for habitat-dependent and area-sensitive bird
   species, and for bird species richness, which showed a positive
   threshold change 78 years post plan implementation. We recommend our
   analytical framework and methods for those working to link management
   actions with ecological change. Our approach is particularly relevant
   for community based natural resource management groups looking to
   implement self-assessment and adaptive management, as well as bridging
   organizations (e.g., state or federal agencies) seeking to assist
   community-based natural resource management groups in management
   efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most ecosystems are impacted by multiple local and long-distance
   stressors, many of which interact in complex ways. We present a
   framework for prioritizing ecological restoration efforts among sites in
   multi-stressor landscapes. Using a simple model, we show that both the
   economic and sociopolitical costs of restoration will typically be lower
   at sites with a relatively small number of severe problems than at sites
   with numerous lesser problems. Based on these results, we propose using
   cumulative stress and evenness of stressor impact as complementary
   indices that together reflect key challenges of restoring a site to
   improved condition. To illustrate this approach, we analyze stressor
   evenness across the world's rivers and the Laurentian Great Lakes. This
   exploration reveals that evenness and cumulative stress are decoupled,
   enabling selection of sites where remediating a modest number of
   high-intensity stressors could substantially reduce cumulative stress.
   Just as species richness and species evenness are fundamental axes of
   biological diversity, we argue that cumulative stress and stressor
   evenness constitute fundamental axes for identifying restoration
   opportunities in multi-stressor landscapes. Our results highlight
   opportunities to boost restoration efficiency through strategic use of
   multi-stressor datasets to identify sites that maximize ecological
   response per stressor remediated. This prioritization framework can also
   be expanded to account for the feasibility of remediation and the
   expected societal benefits of restoration projects.}},

Abstract = {{The biodiversity and naturalness of forests that cover stream valleys in
   submontane areas have not been investigated as intensively as riparian
   forests along large lowland rivers. In this study we compared data on
   total bird assemblages and on selected indicator species detected in
   forests along submontane stream valleys ('Vall') with those detected in
   forests covering submontane slopes and tops in the foothills ('Hill') of
   the Western Carpathians, considering also environmental characteristics
   of the studied locations. The aim of this study was to verify the
   hypothesis that forests along submontane stream valleys harbour
   significantly richer and more diverse bird communities and that they are
   an important habitat for rare and threatened species. We found that the
   species richness, abundance of birds and bird diversity were almost
   twice as high in `Vall' than in `Hill' locations and that indicator
   species mostly or exclusively inhabit `Vall' locations. Moreover,
   species diversity was highly and positively correlated with higher tree
   species diversity and a higher amount of large trees and dead wood, but
   negatively correlated with logging intensity. The results of our study
   confirmed that forested river valleys in submontane areas play an
   important role as refugia both for rare and endangered bird species as
   well as for the whole bird assemblage. This study is the first to
   present an assessment of this type of habitat for birds in the Western
   Carpathians. Forests along submontane stream valleys, if protected or
   unmanaged, could be treated as reference areas for nature and
   biodiversity conservation.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{To account for ecological objectives in forest management planning,
   potential habitats need to be mapped, characterized and evaluated for
   utility in alternative management practices. Airborne laser scanning
   (ALS) is increasingly used to derive predictive maps of habitat quality.
   Unlike ecologically driven approaches that require spatially and
   temporally co-located training data of the specific species, we tested
   whether indicative information on the habitat potential could be
   obtained by means of an unsupervised classification of ALS data. Based
   on a literature review, altogether five ALS features quantifying
   vegetation height, cover and diversity were expected to capture the
   essential variation in the habitat requirements of western capercaillie
   (Tetrao urogallus L.) and hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia L.), which are
   the most important game birds occurring in the studied area. The
   features were extracted from sparse density, leaf-off ALS data at a
   resolution of 256 m(2) and partitioned using an unsupervised k-means
   algorithm. By analysing the persistence of the cluster ensemble formed
   by the partitioning, altogether 158 plots in 16 structural classes were
   assigned for field measurements to determine which real-world forest
   phenomena affected the clustering. The clustering was found to stratify
   the area mainly in terms of size-related attributes such as timber
   volume and basal area. The understorey, shrub and herb layers had less
   correspondence with the clustering, indicating that an unsupervised
   classification is not directly suitable for habitat mapping. The result
   was improved using empirical threshold values for the ALS features
   determined according to the plots labelled as the most potential
   habitats in the field measurements. This semi-supervised classification
   of the data indicated 4 per cent of the total forest area as suitable
   for the specific species, which appears a reasonable estimate of the
   core area of the habitats considered. Overall, the partitioning formed
   aggregated, stand-like spatial patterns, even though the neighbourhoods
   of the individual 256 m(2) cells were not considered at all. The result
   could be further refined by spatial optimization to produce indicative
   maps for forest management planning with ALS as the sole data source.}},

Title = {{Are forest gullies refuges for birds when burnt? The value of
   topographical heterogeneity to avian diversity in a fire-prone landscape}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{200}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In forest ecosystems, uniformity in fire spread may be moderated by
   topography such that sheltered areas (e.g. gullies) escape fire.
   However, gullies are not immune to fire and, under extreme fire weather
   conditions, can burn. This may compromise their habitat value, and
   diminish differences in faunal communities across topographical
   gradients. We investigated the extent to which differences in avian
   communities persist when subjected to uniform fire severity and fire
   history across the gully and slope components of a forest site. We
   predicted that there would be less difference with increasing fire
   severity or long absence of fire. Birds were surveyed at 91 paired
   gully/slope sites in foothill eucalypt forests, two to three years after
   a large, severe wildfire in southeastern Australia. Sites were
   stratified in relation to four levels of fire severity (unburnt through
   to crown burnt) and two levels of fire history prior to the wildfire
   (burnt < 3 years, or > 20 years). Under similar conditions of fire
   severity and fire history, gullies maintained greater species richness
   and abundance than did slopes; averaging 13\% greater species richness
   and 32\% greater abundance, along with a distinct bird assemblage.
   However, contrary to predictions, topographical differences for most
   avian responses did not diminish with increasing fire severity or in the
   long absence of fire prior to the wildfire. This study highlights the
   value of forest gullies in maintaining or facilitating the recovery of
   distinct avian communities after wildfire, even when the gullies
   themselves have been burnt. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As biodiversity hotspots are often characterized by high human
   population densities, implementation of conservation management
   practices that focus only on the protection and enlargement of pristine
   habitats is potentially unrealistic. An alternative approach to curb
   species extinction risk involves improving connectivity among existing
   habitat patches. However, evaluation of spatially explicit management
   strategies is challenging, as predictive models must account for the
   process of dispersal, which is difficult in terms of both empirical data
   collection and modelling. Here, we use a novel, individual-based
   modelling platform that couples demographic and mechanistic dispersal
   models to evaluate the effectiveness of realistic management scenarios
   tailored to conserve forest birds in a highly fragmented biodiversity
   hotspot. Scenario performance is evaluated based on the spatial
   population dynamics of a well-studied forest bird species. The largest
   population increase was predicted to occur under scenarios increasing
   habitat area. However, the effectiveness was sensitive to spatial
   planning. Compared to adding one large patch to the habitat network,
   adding several small patches yielded mixed benefits: although overall
   population sizes increased, specific newly created patches acted as
   dispersal sinks, which compromised population persistence in some
   existing patches. Increasing matrix connectivity by the creation of
   stepping stones is likely to result in enhanced dispersal success and
   occupancy of smaller patches.Synthesis and applications. We show that
   the effectiveness of spatial management is strongly driven by patterns
   of individual dispersal across landscapes. For species conservation
   planning, we advocate the use of models that incorporate adequate
   realism in demography and, particularly, in dispersal behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{In many parts of the world forest disturbance regimes have intensified
   recently, and future climatic changes are expected to amplify this
   development further in the coming decades. These changes are
   increasingly challenging the main objectives of forest ecosystem
   management, which are to provide ecosystem services sustainably to
   society and maintain the biological diversity of forests. Yet a
   comprehensive understanding of how disturbances affect these primary
   goals of ecosystem management is still lacking. We conducted a global
   literature review on the impact of three of the most important
   disturbance agents (fire, wind, and bark beetles) on 13 different
   ecosystem services and three indicators of biodiversity in forests of
   the boreal, cool- and warm-temperate biomes. Our objectives were to (i)
   synthesize the effect of natural disturbances on a wide range of
   possible objectives of forest management, and (ii) investigate
   standardized effect sizes of disturbance for selected indicators via a
   quantitative meta-analysis. We screened a total of 1958 disturbance
   studies published between 1981 and 2013, and reviewed 478 in detail. We
   first investigated the overall effect of disturbances on individual
   ecosystem services and indicators of biodiversity by means of
   independence tests, and subsequently examined the effect size of
   disturbances on indicators of carbon storage and biodiversity by means
   of regression analysis. Additionally, we investigated the effect of
   commonly used approaches of disturbance management, i.e. salvage logging
   and prescribed burning. We found that disturbance impacts on ecosystem
   services are generally negative, an effect that was supported for all
   categories of ecosystem services, i.e. supporting, provisioning,
   regulating, and cultural services (P < 0.001). Indicators of
   biodiversity, i.e. species richness, habitat quality and diversity
   indices, on the other hand were found to be influenced positively by
   disturbance (P < 0.001). Our analyses thus reveal a disturbance
   paradox', documenting that disturbances can put ecosystem services at
   risk while simultaneously facilitating biodiversity. A detailed
   investigation of disturbance effect sizes on carbon storage and
   biodiversity further underlined these divergent effects of disturbance.
   While a disturbance event on average causes a decrease in total
   ecosystem carbon by 38.5\% (standardized coefficient for stand-replacing
   disturbance), it on average increases overall species richness by
   35.6\%. Disturbance-management approaches such as salvage logging and
   prescribed burning were neither found significantly to mitigate negative
   effects on ecosystem services nor to enhance positive effects on
   biodiversity, and thus were not found to alleviate the disturbance
   paradox. Considering that climate change is expected to intensify
   natural disturbance regimes, our results indicate that biodiversity will
   generally benefit from such changes while a sustainable provisioning of
   ecosystem services might come increasingly under pressure. This
   underlines that disturbance risk and resilience require increased
   attention in ecosystem management in the future, and that new approaches
   to addressing the disturbance paradox in management are needed.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Desertification and climate change are degrading large areas of arid and
   semiarid habitat in many regions. In response, many countries have
   implemented revegetation programs, commonly using Atriplex nummularia,
   native to Australia. Although not intrinsically targeted at habitat
   restoration, these programs aim to restore (stabilize) erosional
   processes and provide livestock forage (usually goats, sheep). Few
   investigators have assessed the utility of these novel habitats for
   native fauna. In a recent, extensive survey of small mammal communities
   in lands revegetated with A. nummularia in north-central Chile, we
   captured a single animal, the marsupial (Thylamys elegans). We also
   captured no birds in our live traps and saw numerous darkling beetles in
   traps. These striking results contrasted with data from a nearby
   ungrazed park with natural vegetation where 10 small mammal species are
   known with total abundances ranging from 15 to 80 animals in similar
   sampling efforts. These revegetated lands provide poor habitat for
   native mammals, and we argue that revegetation efforts should include
   proactive risk assessment and cost-benefit analyses in a structured
   decision-making framework. In addition, managers should target increased
   plant species diversity to support broader biological diversity in
   addition to the need to control erosion. Although our work has focused
   on revegetation with Atriplex, numerous other plant species have been
   intentionally introduced to arid lands, usually for economic reasons;
   many of these, like Atriplex, have unintended consequences for native
   biota.}},

   Selection when Managing Grasslands for a Threatened Species}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Habitat selection that has fitness consequences has important
   implications for conservation activities. For example, habitat
   characteristics that influence nest success in birds can be manipulated
   to improve habitat quality with the goal of ultimately improving
   reproductive success. We examined habitat selection by the threatened
   streaked horned lark (Eremophila alpestris strigata) at both the
   breeding-site (territory) and nest-site scales. Larks were selective at
   both spatial scales but with contrasting selection. At the territory
   scale, male larks selected sparsely vegetated grasslands with relatively
   short vegetation. At the nestsite scale, female larks selected sites
   within territories with higher vegetation density and more perennial
   forbs. These nest-site scale choices had reproductive consequences, with
   greater nest success in areas with higher densities of perennial forbs.
   We experimentally manipulated lark habitat structure in an attempt to
   mimic the habitat conditions selected by larks by using late summer
   prescribed fires. After the burn, changes in vegetation structure were
   in the direction preferred by larks but habitat effects attenuated by
   the following year. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating
   habitat selection at spatial scales appropriate to the species of
   interest, especially when attempting to improve habitat quality for rare
   and declining species. They also highlight the importance of conducting
   restoration activities in a research context. For example, because the
   sparsely vegetated conditions created by fire attenuate, there may be
   value in examining more frequent burns or hotter fires as the next
   management and research action. We hope the design outlined in this
   study will serve as an integrated research and management example for
   conserving grassland birds generally.}},

Abstract = {{Natural disturbances, such as fire, windstorms and insect outbreaks, are
   important drivers of biodiversity in forest ecosystems, but at the same
   time cause large economic losses. Among the natural disturbances in
   Europe, windstorms cause the highest economic loss. After such storms,
   damaged forest stands are commonly salvage logged to restore economic
   value. However, such interventions could affect species assemblages of
   various taxonomic groups, including breeding birds. Despite these
   potential effects, investigations of the impacts of post-storm logging
   are largely lacking. We thus investigated assemblages of breeding birds
   in 21 logged and 21 unlogged windstorm-disturbed forest plots and 18
   undisturbed, control forest plots using fixed-radius point-stop counts
   three, five and seven years after a windstorm within the Bavarian Forest
   National Park as part of the European Long-Term Ecosystem Research
   Network. We recorded 2100 bird individuals of 55 bird species. Bird
   assemblages were predominantly altered by the consequences of the
   windstorm and affected only to a minor degree by subsequent logging of
   storm felled trees. Nevertheless, bird species richness was
   significantly reduced by post-storm logging within the first season. In
   general, the windstorm led to a shift in bird assemblage composition
   from typical forest species towards open- and shrub-land species.
   Assemblages of logged and unlogged disturbed plots consisted mainly of
   long-distance migrants and ground-foraging bird species, whereas
   assemblages of undisturbed control plots consisted of resident species
   that forage within vegetation. Both unlogged and logged storm-felled
   coniferous forest stands were inhabited by endangered or declining bird
   species, such as Water Pipit (Anthus spinoletta) on logged plots and
   Eurasian Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) on unlogged plots. Indicator
   species analyses suggested that species of unlogged storm disturbed
   plots depended on storm-created legacies, such as pits and snags, for
   foraging and nesting. Hence, we recommend reducing post-storm logging of
   these legacies to support species restricted to unlogged disturbed
   forest. To increase the diversity of breeding birds on the landscape
   scale, diverse logged and unlogged post-disturbance stands should be
   provided, which could be gained by a partial benign neglect strategy of
   storm disturbed forest stands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Many migratory grassland passerines complete their annual life cycle
   within the United States and investigations into wintering ecology of
   these species are scarce, particularly in ecoregions where habitat
   quality is considered to be compromised, such as the coastal prairie of
   Texas. During 2008-2010, we investigated wintering grassland bird
   ecology as related to coastal prairie composition and management
   practices on the mid-upper Texas coast. To quantify grassland bird
   composition and density among management regimes, we performed 260
   transect surveys on 40 different study site pastures deployed among 7
   different management regimes, varying in plant community composition as
   well as frequency (or occurrence) of burning, grazing, and mowing from
   29 October 2008-7 April 2009 and 17 November 2009-17 March 2010. A total
   of 79 bird species (48 species in 2008-2009 and 66 species in 2009-2010)
   were recorded during this study. Sites that were recently (<2 years
   prior) grazed, burned, or mowed tended to have the greatest species
   richness of obligate grassland bird species. Management regime and the
   resulting habitat characteristics also appeared to influence densities
   of Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), Sedge Wren (Cistothorus
   platensis), and Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), with the former two
   species selecting areas that had not been recently burned, grazed, or
   mowed and were characterized by greater vertical vegetation density and
   litter depth, respectively. Conversely, Sprague's Pipit selected
   recently burned, grazed, or mowed prairies, characterized by less litter
   depth and percentage of shrubs nearby. More cosmopolitan species, such
   as Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and Savannah Sparrow
   (Passerculus sandwichensis) occurred equally among management regimes.
   Despite similar species richness in floristically disturbed sites,
   nonnative vegetation appeared to negatively influence species with
   specific habitat requirements such as Sprague's Pipit, Sedge Wren, and
   Le Conte's Sparrow. In order to increase wintering avian diversity,
   coastal prairie habitat conservation and management in Texas should
   focus on restoring management regimes (i.e., burning, mowing, and
   grazing) that create heterogeneous environments, while maintaining
   native vegetation communities.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{256-264}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a natural process and the dominant disturbance shaping plant and
   animal communities in many coniferous forests of the western US. Given
   that fire size and severity are predicted to increase in the future, it
   has become increasingly important to understand how wildlife responds to
   fire and post-fire management. The Angora Fire burned 1243 hectares of
   mixed conifer forest in South Lake Tahoe, California. We conducted avian
   point counts for the first 3 years following the fire in burned and
   unburned areas to investigate which habitat characteristics are most
   important for re-establishing or maintaining the native avian community
   in post-fire landscapes. We used a multi-species occurrence model to
   estimate how avian species are influenced by the density of live and
   dead trees and shrub cover. While accounting for variations in the
   detectability of species, our approach estimated the occurrence
   probabilities of all species detected including those that were rare or
   observed infrequently. Although all species encountered in this study
   were detected in burned areas, species-specific modeling results
   predicted that some species were strongly associated with specific
   post-fire conditions, such as a high density of dead trees, open-canopy
   conditions or high levels of shrub cover that occur at particular burn
   severities or at a particular time following fire. These results
   indicate that prescribed fire or managed wildfire which burns at low to
   moderate severity without at least some high-severity effects is both
   unlikely to result in the species assemblages that are unique to
   post-fire areas or to provide habitat for burn specialists.
   Additionally, the probability of occurrence for many species was
   associated with high levels of standing dead trees indicating that
   intensive post-fire harvest of these structures could negatively impact
   habitat of a considerable proportion of the avian community.}},

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{508-517}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are
   likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are
   supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy
   and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes.
   2. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of
   landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given
   occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape
   with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then
   subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts
   for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across
   heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at
   fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single
   home range or territory.
   3. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests.
   Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density
   given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory
   size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and
   home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers
   at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with
   independently collected survey data, showing that the model is
   successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as
   relative abundance within and among fires.
   4. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for
   fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet
   elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for
   many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological
   exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range
   size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the
   Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers
   to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing
   for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation
   efforts that require snag removal.}},

Title = {{Avian relationships with wildfire at two dry forest locations with
   different historical fire regimes}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Wildfire is a key factor influencing bird community composition in
   western North American forests. We need to understand species and
   community responses to wildfire and how responses vary regionally to
   effectively manage dry conifer forests for maintaining biodiversity. We
   compared avian relationships with wildfire burn severity between two dry
   forest locations of Arizona and Idaho. We predicted different responses
   to wildfire between locations due to regional differences in historical
   fire regime. We conducted point count surveys for 3 yr following
   wildfire (Arizona: 1997-1999; Idaho: 2008-2010) and used multispecies
   hierarchical models to analyze relationships of bird occupancy with burn
   severity. Consistent with our prediction for mixed-severity fire regimes
   characterizing the Idaho location, we observed proportionately more
   positive species occupancy relationships and, consequently, a positive
   species richness relationship with burn severity in Idaho. We also
   observed the opposite pattern in Arizona, which was congruent with our
   prediction for the low-severity fire regime characterizing that
   location. Cavity nesters and aerial insectivores occupied more severely
   burned sites following wildfire, corresponding with predicted increases
   in nesting substrate and foraging opportunities for these species. In
   contrast, canopy-nesting foliage gleaners and pine seed consumers
   exhibited negative relationships with burn severity. Our results were
   consistent with predictions based on species life histories and with
   patterns from the literature, suggesting generality of observed
   relationships and locational difference in relationships with wildfire.
   We therefore suggest that optimal management strategies for maintaining
   avian diversity could differ regionally. Specifically, intensive fuels
   management may be ecologically less appropriate for promoting
   biodiversity in areas such as the Idaho location where mixed-severity
   wildfires and dense forest stands were historically more common.}},

Abstract = {{Forests with old-growth white pines have been severely reduced compared

   birds over 10 years in four mixedwood types: old pine, mature pine,
   mature nonpine, and selection-harvested stands. We expected that old
   pine stands would be selected by some species because of abundant snags
   and large trees for foraging. We assessed habitat use among years and
   changes following harvesting. Counts of nomadic species varied across
   years but counts for others did not. Species used old and mature pine
   mixedwoods equally and more than nonpine or harvested stands in winter
   and for breeding, but old stands were not preferred. Important variables
   included percent pine and large tree density. Selection harvesting
   benefitted Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers but reduced counts of Black-capped
   Chickadees and Brown Creepers. Black-capped Chickadees changed habitats
   between seasons and in some years. Black-backed Woodpeckers were most
   common in pine stands but abundant in harvested stands for 2 years
   following cutting. Regardless of stand age, large (>40 cm) pines provide
   important habitat for residents and cavity nesters.}},

Abstract = {{Spreading of viticulture may pose serious threats to biodiversity and
   adequate policies targeted at decreasing its impact are urgently
   required. Current knowledge of viticulture effects on biodiversity is
   scarce and studies on bird communities in vineyards are even scarcer.
   We surveyed avian assemblages in Trentino vineyards (North-East Italy)
   in both breeding and wintering seasons to evaluate the effect of: i)
   landscape, ii) management and iii) topographic-climatic characteristics
   on birds and to derive implications for conservation. We calculated four
   community indexes (species richness, abundance, evenness and
   conservation index) and modelled their relative variation according to
   18 environmental variables belonging to the three above-mentioned
   groups.
   Landscape models performed better than the others, except for winter
   evenness, for which management models were the most supported ones.
   Generally, models considering the three groups together explained more
   variation than models from an individual group.
   Landscape (and agricultural) heterogeneity, extent of marginal habitats,
   density of traditional elements (hedgerows, tree rows, isolated trees
   and rural buildings) all had positive effects, whereas vineyard cover
   had negative impact on the value of the four community indexes.
   Organic management had no apparent effect on avian communities. We
   detected a seasonal difference in the effects of environmental
   characteristics on bird communities, which suggested that local
   conservation efforts could be tuned according to the seasonal importance
   of vineyards in different regions.
   Key measures to promote biodiversity in vineyards include maintaining
   patches of residual habitats in the vineyard matrix and enhancing
   heterogeneity. Marginal features appeared particularly important in the
   homogeneous landscape of intensive vineyards to favour bird communities.

Title = {{Effects of an ongoing oak savanna restoration on small mammals in Lower
   Michigan}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{367}},
Pages = {{120-127}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Oak (Quercus spp.) savannas have declined drastically in the midwestern
   United States since European settlement. Oak savanna restoration
   projects are primarily driven by species closely linked to this habitat
   type, such as the federally endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides
   melissa samuelis). However, it is essential that other species are
   monitored during restoration. Small mammals, due to their importance in
   ecosystem function, are particularly useful to study. The United States
   Forest Service is currently conducting an oak savanna restoration in the
   Manistee National Forest in Lower Michigan using forest thinning and
   prescribed burning. To understand management impacts on small mammal
   communities, we live trapped small mammals in each of the mechanically
   thinned plots (i.e., bulldozer, masticator, and shear cutter) and
   control plots in five blocks over six years (2008-2013), as well as
   measured vegetation variables each year. Initially, we used a
   permutation multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA) to determine
   if there were treatment and year interactions for both small mammal
   community assemblages and vegetation variables. We then compared changes
   in small mammal diversity, relative abundance, and vegetation variables
   among treatments using exploratory randomized block design analysis of
   variances (ANOVAs). Canopy cover was significantly lower in bulldozer
   and shear cutter thinned plots than control plots five years following
   thinning. We observed significant treatment by year interactions in how
   the small mammal community responded. A large increase in relative
   abundance of white-footed mice occurred one year post-thinning in all
   treatments. Within 1-2 years of treatment, thirteen-lined ground
   squirrels and meadow jumping mice, both open-canopy grassland species
   became established on thinned plots. The retention of brush piles in
   bulldozer and shear cutter plots provided important refuge habitat for
   small mammals following thinning, Restoration efforts were beneficial to
   the small mammal community overall and promoted grassland species to
   immigrate into the restored area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Conservation practitioners frequently have limited information on the
   structure and function of the ecosystems they wish to preserve, and as a
   result, they may use shortcuts to guide conservation actions. One such
   shortcut is the umbrella species approach, whereby conservation actions
   are geared toward one or a few key species, with the assumption that the
   entire community will benefit. However, fitness-habitat associations and
   resource use may vary across space and across management regimes, and so
   too may the utility of umbrella species as ecosystem surrogates. The
   federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) has
   been used as an umbrella species in the restoration of the longleaf pine
   ecosystem of the southeastern US. Restoration efforts were based on
   early habitat selection information in largely degraded landscapes. We
   examined patterns of resource selection of 97 social groups of
   red-cockaded woodpeckers in a restored landscape in northwest Florida.
   Similar to previous studies in degraded landscapes, woodpecker groups
   selected forest stands containing higher densities of large pines and
   lower densities of small pines for foraging. However, we found no
   evidence for another aspect of habitat selection widely documented in
   degraded habitat, the avoidance of areas with substantial components of
   hardwoods. These results align with new woodpecker fitness-habitat
   associations within restored landscapes and lend support to previous
   findings that current ecosystem restoration efforts in the study area,
   namely prescribed burning, may have reduced hardwood densities to below
   those at which they have negative impacts. The red-cockaded woodpecker
   has served as an effective umbrella species in degraded longleaf
   ecosystems by promoting management, especially prescribed burning, that
   benefits many other species. Whether it will continue to do so in
   restored habitat is not yet clear, but its tolerance of a range of
   hardwood conditions provides reason for optimism.}},

Title = {{The biodiversity contribution of wood plantations: Contrasting the bird
   communities of Sweden's protected and production oak forests}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{365}},
Pages = {{51-60}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The oak-dominated woodlands and forests of northern Europe have
   experienced dramatic declines due to agriculture, urbanization, and
   conifer-dominated production forestry. These losses have had a
   substantial negative impact on biodiversity due to the large number of
   forest species which depend on oak and the environments oak-dominated
   forests provide. Production oak stands may serve as a means of
   supplementing or complementing the habitat provided by the limited
   remaining natural oak remnants in this region. Here we evaluate the
   extent to which oak plantations in temperate southern Sweden provide
   habitat and resources for bird communities, by surveying and contrasting
   the bird species composition and diversity found in mature and young
   production oak stands (5 and 8 replicates respectively) and protected
   oak-dominated remnant forests (5 replicates). The mature production
   stands possessed a bird community partially overlapping in bird species
   composition, and comparable in species richness (34 species) to that
   found within protected oak forests (39 species). Furthermore, the
   production oak forests surveyed hosted threatened or near threatened
   bird species, including black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), goldcrest
   (Regulus regulus), starling (Sturnus vulgaris), and yellowhammer
   (Emberiza citrinella). Though production oak forests cannot replace the
   habitat provided by protected oak forests, these stands do appear to
   provide conditions consistent with the habitat and resource requirements
   of a diverse cross-section of bird species in this region, including
   species of substantial conservation concern. Production oak forests thus
   have the capacity to make a positive contribution to biodiversity
   conservation, as well as providing a diverse range of goods and services
   to society. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Abundance, size, and spatial distribution of standing dead trees
   (snags), are key indicators of forest biodiversity and ecosystem health.
   These metrics represent critical habitat components for various wildlife
   species of conservation concern, including the Black-backed Woodpecker
   (Picoides arcticus), which is strongly associated with recently burned
   conifer forest. We assessed the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning
   (ALS) to detect and characterize conifer snags and identify Black-backed
   Woodpecker habitat using previously derived empirical thresholds of
   conifer snag basal area. Over the footprint of the Rim Fire, a megafire
   that extended (similar to 104,000 ha) through a heterogeneous mosaic of
   conifer forests, oak woodlands, and meadows in the Sierra Nevada
   mountains of California, we identified conifer snags and estimated their
   basal area from single-tree ALS-derived metrics using Gaussian processes
   in four major steps. First, individual trees were mapped using the
   Watershed Segmentation algorithm, resulting in 87\% detection of trees
   with stem diameter larger than 30 cm. Second, the snag/live
   classification model identified snags with an overall accuracy of
   91.8\%, using the coefficient of variation of height and intensity
   together with maximum intensity and fractional cover as the most
   relevant metrics. Third, the conifer/hardwood snag classification model
   utilizing the maximum height, median height, minimum intensity, and area
   metrics separated snag forest types with an overall accuracy of 84.8\%.
   Finally, a Gaussian process regression model reliably estimated conifer
   snag stem diameter (R-2 = 0.81) using height and crown area, thus
   significantly outperforming regionally calibrated conifer-specific
   allometric equations. As a result,-80\% of the snag basal area have been
   mapped. Optimal and potential habitat for Black-backed Woodpecker
   comprise 53.7 km(2) and 58.4 km(2), respectively, representing 5.1 and
   5.6\% of the footprint of the Rim Fire. Our study illustrates the
   utility of high-density ALS data for characterizing recently burned
   forests, which, in conjunction with information about the habitat needs
   of particular snag-dependent wildlife species, can be used to assess
   habitat characteristics, and thus contribute greatly to forest
   management and biodiversity conservation. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The South African Fynbos biome, a global biodiversity hotspot with high
   endemism and species richness, has six endemic bird species. These are
   important not only intrinsically, but also for ecological functioning
   and as flagships for South Africa's economically valuable avitourism
   sector. Little is known about population sizes or realised distribution
   ranges of these six species, but projected range modelling based on
   occurrence from the South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP) has
   suggested these species are vulnerable to climate change. We estimate
   global population sizes for these six endemics based on densities
   calculated from two intensive biome-wide point count surveys in 2012. We
   modelled regions of suitable climatic space, from which we established
   that mean annual temperature and the temperature of the warmest quarter
   of the year appear to limit Cape Rock-jumper Chaetops frenatus and
   Protea Canary Serinus leucopterus ranges. Both species have seen an
   apparent > 30\% decrease in range and reporting rates (a proxy for
   abundance) in the twenty years between SABAP atlas periods (1987-1991
   and 2007-ongoing). The Cape Rock-jumper result is unexpected: encounter
   rates are higher in shorter vegetation, dry slopes and habitats with
   more recent occurrence of fire - all proxies for proximate causes of
   climate change on the Fynbos. Although coastal plains are highly
   transformed, mountain Fynbos is the best protected of all the world's
   Mediterranean-climate habitats, with relatively little anthropogenic
   land transformation. Long term weather datasets from the Fynbos
   demonstrate significant warming since 1960. We conclude from these lines
   of evidence that these decreases are consistent with the loss of
   suitable climate space and inability of these species to adjust
   physiologically to increasing temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Context An increasing number of studies have investigated the impact of
   environmental heterogeneity on faunal assemblages when measured at
   multiple spatial scales. Few studies, however, have considered how the
   effects of heterogeneity on fauna vary with the spatial scale at which
   the response variable is characterised.
   Objectives We investigated the relationship between landscape properties
   in a region characterised by diverse fire mosaics, and the structure and
   composition of avian assemblages measured at both the site-(1 ha) and
   landscape-scale (100 ha).
   Methods We surveyed birds and calculated spatial landscape properties in
   sub-tropical woodlands of central Queensland, Australia.
   Results Environmental heterogeneity, as measured by topographic
   complexity, was consistently important for bird species richness and
   composition. However, the explanatory power of topographic complexity
   varied depending on the spatial scale and the component of diversity
   under investigation. We found different correlates of richness within
   particular foraging guilds depending on the scale at which richness was
   measured. Extent of long-unburnt habitat ({[} 10 years since fire) was
   the most important variable for the landscape-scale richness of
   frugivores, insectivores and canopy feeders, whereas environmental
   heterogeneity in the surrounding landscape was more important for
   site-scale richness of these foraging guilds.
   Conclusions The response of species richness to landscape
   characteristics varies among scales, and among components of diversity.
   Thus, depending on the scale at which a biodiversity conservation goal
   is conceptualised-maximising richness at a site, or across a
   landscape-different landscape management approaches may be preferred.}},

Abstract = {{Effective ecological restoration actions should be able to recover
   ecosystem processes that influence community development in the long
   term. However, there is scarce information on how landscape factors
   promote or accelerate fauna recovery. We used a landscape framework to
   evaluate how functional groups respond to natural regeneration in a
   highly fragmented region of Atlantic Forest. Using bird functional
   groups sampled in 15 regenerating forest fragments, we built and ranked
   models using a model selection approach to test the relative effect of
   landscape variables on each group. Our results showed that bird
   community recovery is not determined by the duration of the regeneration
   process (i.e. forest age), but by how the species responds to the
   landscape context. Functional diversity and the abundance of the
   functional groups were mainly related to composition metrics, whereas
   the functional metric affected only specific groups. Our findings
   highlight the importance of considering the landscape level to ensure
   both the colonization of fauna and the restoration of ecological
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{Fire suppression in southern Appalachian pine-oak forests during the
   past century dramatically altered the bird community. Fire return
   intervals decreased, resulting in local extirpation or population
   declines of many bird species adapted to post-fire plant communities.
   Within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, declines have been strongest
   for birds inhabiting xeric pine-oak forests that depend on frequent
   fire. The buildup of fuels after decades of fire suppression led to
   changes in the 1996 Great Smoky Mountains Fire Management Plan. Although
   fire return intervals remain well below historic levels, management
   changes have helped increase the amount of fire within the park over the
   past 20 years, providing an opportunity to study patterns of fire
   severity, time since burn, and bird occurrence. We combined avian point
   counts in burned and unburned areas with remote sensing indices of fire
   severity to infer temporal changes in bird occurrence for up to 28 years
   following fire. Using hierarchical linear models that account for the
   possibility of a species presence at a site when no individuals are
   detected, we developed occurrence models for 24 species: 13 occurred
   more frequently in burned areas, 2 occurred less frequently, and 9
   showed no significant difference between burned and unburned areas.
   Within burned areas, the top models for each species included fire
   severity, time since burn, or both, suggesting that fire influenced
   patterns of species occurrence for all 24 species. Our findings suggest
   that no single fire management strategy will suit all species. To
   capture peak occupancy for the entire bird community within xeric
   pine-oak forests, at least 3 fire regimes may be necessary; one applying
   frequent low severity fire, another using infrequent low severity fire,
   and a third using infrequently applied high severity fire.}},

Abstract = {{The recent decline of Mediterranean oak woodlands in SW Iberian
   Peninsula is related to insect pests which affect both cork oak (Quercus
   suber) and holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia). We identified twenty-six
   bird species as potential regular predators of twenty major pests by
   reviewing the diet of breeding, wintering and resident species in this
   ecosystem. Foraging guilds are strongly associated with predation at
   distinct stages of the pests' life-cycle: ground-foragers prey on
   overwintering pupae and larvae of seed-borers, tree-foragers prey on
   eggs, larvae and pupae of defoliating and wood-boring pests, and
   aerial-sweepers prey on airborne imagines. Bird predation can cover the
   complete life-cycle of pest species because different species may be
   complementary due to a dissimilar exploitation of foraging niches and
   periods. Small generalist tree-foraging passerines are important pest
   predators given their high densities and widespread distribution in
   Mediterranean oak woodlands, but management practices can have a
   significant negative effect in their populations.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of species vulnerability to climate change should increase
   the effectiveness of interventions in the current decline in
   biodiversity. Species vulnerability to climate change is a consequence
   of their sensitivity and adaptive capacity, in combination with their
   exposure to climate change. We apply a vulnerability assessment
   framework to 243 bird species inhabiting the tropical savannas of
   northern Australia. We build on previous vulnerability studies by
   including detailed data for variables relating to species sensitivity to
   change (relative abundance, clutch size, sensitivity to fire and
   distribution area), species adaptive capacity (movement behaviour and
   dietary breadth) and proportional changes predicted for their geographic
   range (i.e. exposure to climate change). These are integrated to provide
   a ranking of vulnerability. Our analysis found that birds of Australian
   tropical savannas cluster together with high sensitivity, with a few
   wide-ranging increasing species with very low sensitivity. Australian
   tropical savanna birds have a range of adaptive capacities, and the
   impact of climate change on these species is predicted to be
   substantial. Two already endangered species are among the most
   vulnerable. Species largely restricted to Cape York Peninsula (a
   geographically distinct region) had the greatest overall vulnerability;
   these species were, in general, sensitive due to small distributions,
   sensitivity to fire frequency and had a lower capacity for dispersal. It
   will be important for the future of Australian tropical savanna birds to
   mitigate ecological threats and maintain extensive areas of suitable
   habitat to facilitate species dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Capsule At two demonstration farms, Game \& Wildlife Conservation
   Trust's Loddington Farm in Leicestershire and Royal Society for the
   Protection of Birds's Hope Farm in Cambridgeshire, targeted management
   led to much faster increases in avian abundance than in the surrounding
   regions.
   Aims To compare changes in avian abundance at Loddington Farm since 1992
   and Hope Farm since 2000, and relate these to regional trends in bird
   abundance and to the habitat and predator management conducted at the
   two sites.
   Methods Loddington Farm is a mixed arable 292-ha farm in a partially
   wooded landscape in Leicestershire. It was managed as a shoot from 1993
   to 2002, combining habitat management with predator control (stopped in
   2002) and winter grain provision (ceased in 2006). Hope Farm comprises a
   181-ha mainly arable farm in an open landscape in Cambridgeshire, where
   habitat management for farmland birds has taken place since 2002. At
   both sites, breeding bird abundance has been monitored annually.
   Information on farm management was translated into three variables
   measuring annual provision of nesting cover, summer food and winter
   food. The number of Carrion Crow and Magpie territories was used as an
   index of predator abundance.
   Results Avian abundance increased at both farms much faster than within
   their respective regions. Recovery of priority species was positively
   correlated with the provision of summer foraging habitats and negatively
   correlated with the provision of supplementary grain during winter. The
   latter finding was counterintuitive and may reflect an increase in
   hedgerow provision that coincided with the cessation of grain provision
   at both farms. The increase in bird abundance was not sustained at
   Loddington Farm in the absence of predator control, although it was at
   Hope Farm where predator densities were markedly lower.
   Conclusion The data from Hope Farm suggest that where predator densities
   are relatively low (<3 Crow + Magpie pairs/km(2) locally, <0.2
   Foxes/km(2) in spring regionally), recovery of farmland birds can be
   achieved through habitat management alone. Where predator densities are
   high (>5 corvid pairs/km(2) and >1.1 foxes/km(2)), as at Loddington
   Farm, species recovery, particularly of open-cup nesting species, may
   require predator control as well as habitat management. Further study is
   needed to confirm this tentative conclusion from only two sites.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical rainforests are the cradle of life (perfect conditions for
   life) on Earth, i.e., rich in plant species composition (>250 plant
   species/hectare) and fauna diversity (>50\% of animal species in the
   world). Rainforests occur near the Earth's equator and cover 6\% of the
   Earth's surface across the tropical regions and are characterized by wet
   climate, i.e., heavy rainfall (125-660 cm), relative humidity (77-88\%)
   and temperature (20-34 degrees C). They are dominated by a wide range of
   broad-leaved trees that form dense canopy and the most complex
   ecosystem. Currently, the tropical rainforest ecosystem is changing
   faster than ever in human history due to anthropogenic activities, such
   as habitat loss and degradation due to deforestation for timber and
   conversion into agriculture fields (oil palm plantation), mining, fire,
   climate change, etc. The habitat loss and degradation had adversely
   influenced the distribution and richness of the fauna species. The
   current information on the fauna diversity of tropical rainforest is not
   sufficient and in the future, more research is required to document the
   various community parameters of the fauna species in order to conserve
   and protect them. For better future, conservation, and management, we
   must identify the major drivers of changes and how these factors alter
   the tropical rainforest.}},

Abstract = {{Weinvestigated bird habitat relationships in extensive eucalypt forest
   in the Blue Mountains, NewSouth Wales, in 1986-87, assessing the
   importance of fire regime variables compared with other habitat
   variables. Our study sites encompassed a wide range of postfire ages,
   fire frequencies and fire severity, but we found no major bird community
   differences corresponding to differences in fire regime. The more common
   forest bird species appeared well adapted to fire regime variation in
   the 1980s. Tree canopy height was a far greater influence, with more
   species and more birds in taller forests (interpreted as a result of
   higher soil fertility leading to higher productivity of bird foods and
   greater structural complexity in taller forests). Other trends were
   fewer birds where there was a rainforest understorey under the eucalypts
   (reflecting the general scarcity of rainforest birds in the Blue
   Mountains), and more birds where nectar-rich flowers were more abundant
   (reflecting the abundance of nectarivorous birds in the Blue Mountains,
   especially over winter). The climate has changed since the 1980s and
   fires threaten to become much more severe, extensive and frequent. How
   these changes will impact on forest birds, and what management responses
   are required, is a critical area for further study.}},

Pages = {{21-37}},
Abstract = {{Degradation of ecosystems and introductions of invasive species pose a
   threat to global biodiversity. Ecosystem restoration and revegetation
   actions are important for amending habitat loss and for the protection
   of species of plants and animals. Iceland has the highest rate of soil
   erosion and desertification in Northern Europe and counteractions to
   erosion and revegetation measures have taken place for over a century.
   We studied the effect of revegetation on the density and composition of
   birds and invertebrate abundance in 26 survey areas comparing: a)
   unvegetated eroded areas, b) native heathlands restored on eroded land,
   and c) revegetation by the introduced and exotic Nootka lupin (Lupinus
   nootkatensis) on eroded land. Birds were counted on transects and
   invertebrates sampled with a sweep net. Both revegetation methods
   greatly increased the abundance of birds. The highest total numbers of
   invertebrates and birds were recorded on land revegetated with Nootka
   lupin. On average 31 birds km(-2) were recorded on barren land, 337 on
   heathland and 627 in Nootka lupin. Bird species composition differed
   between the two revegetation methods. Restored heathland provided
   habitat for waders of internationally decreasing populations, whereas
   Nootka lupin stands harboured more common bird species. Golden Plover
   (Pluvialis apricaria) and Dunlin (Calidris alpina) were most common on
   restored heathland, while Snipe (Gallinago gallinago) and Meadow Pipit
   (Anthus pratensis) were most common in Nootka lupine. The abundance of
   birds was positively correlated with that of invertebrates. The
   abundance of different bird species differed by successional stage in
   each habitat. The study showed the generally positive effects of
   revegetation on animal biodiversity and also how different revegetation
   methods produce different trajectories of ecosystem development.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{470-478}},
Abstract = {{Capsule: Restoration of grasslands on ski-pistes caused a recovery in
   the bird community, but not to the extent that it was equivalent to a
   natural Alpine grassland community.Aim: To test whether revegetation of
   ski-pistes in open habitat areas results in bird community
   recovery.Methods: The bird communities in two ski resorts in the Italian
   Maritime Alps were surveyed using a standardized area count method in
   three different plot types: non-restored ski-pistes (newly constructed),
   restored ski-pistes and control plots in grassland far from
   ski-pistes.Results: In 49 independent plots, 32 species were recorded.
   Species richness and abundance of birds were significantly higher on
   restored than on non-restored ski-pistes, independently of the species
   group considered and the analyses carried out. Bird community parameters
   of restored ski-pistes were still lower than those of natural grassland,
   as shown by results of typical grassland species.Conclusion: Our results
   suggest that an apparently successful restoration of ski-pistes may be
   not enough to promote a complete recovery of bird communities. The
   complete recovery of local bird communities may be promoted only if an
   integral recovery of the original vegetal communities is achieved. We
   suggest the best conservation option is to adopt techniques to maintain
   as far as possible original grassland if construction of new ski-pistes
   is unavoidable.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{We conducted bird surveys in 10 of the first 11 years following a
   mixed-severity fire in a dry, low-elevation mixed-conifer forest in
   western Montana, United States. By defining fire in terms of fire
   severity and time-since-fire, and then comparing detection rates for
   species inside 15 combinations of fire severity and time-since-fire,
   with their rates of detection in unburned (but otherwise similar) forest
   outside the burn perimeter, we were able to assess more nuanced effects
   of fire on 50 bird species. A majority of species (60\%) was detected
   significantly more frequently inside than outside the burn. It is likely
   that the beneficial effects of fire for some species can be detected
   only under relatively narrow combinations of fire severity and
   time-since-fire. Because most species responded positively and uniquely
   to some combination of fire severity and time-since-fire, these results
   carry important management implications. Specifically, the variety of
   burned-forest conditions required by fire-dependent bird species cannot
   be created through the application of relatively uniform low-severity
   prescribed fires, through land management practices that serve to reduce
   fire severity or through post-fire salvage logging, which removes the
   dead trees required by most disturbance-dependent bird species.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the relative abundance of hole-nesting birds in four
   Mediterranean forest types, each of which has undergone different
   patterns of forest management. Nine species were sampled in 24 study
   plots, to compare cork oak forest, turkey oak forest, holm oak forest
   and pine plantation. The abundance of hole-nesters was greater in cork
   oak forest and turkey oak forest. Three species were most frequently
   detected: Great Tit (Parus major), Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) and
   Nuthatch (Sitta europaea). Bird abundance was significantly lower in
   holm oak forest, particularly in the cases of Great Spotted Woodpecker
   (Dendrocopos major), Green Woodpecker (Picus viridis), Nuthatch and
   Short-toed Treecreeper (Certhia brachydactyla). The Great Spotted
   Woodpecker showed a positive correlation with the abundance of three
   secondary cavity nesters: Nuthatch, Short-toed Treecreeper and Starling;
   in contrast, Green Woodpecker showed a negative correlation with
   Starling. Habitat structure varied significantly among forest types,
   especially the mean and maximum tree height, these being lower in
   holmoak forest. The Great Spotted Woodpecker proved to be a good
   indicator of less disturbed woodlands. In fact, maximum tree height
   turned out to be a significant and positive explanatory variable for
   woodpecker abundance. We consider that intensive coppicing and timber
   management in holm oak forest during the 20th century widely affected
   trees' age-profile, with consequences for their suitability for wood
   peckers and other hole-nesting birds. To monitor the response of
   hole-nesting birds to forest management in terms of abundance, we
   propose the use of the great spotted woodpecker as an indicator species.}},

Pages = {{69-78}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Population age structure is important for understanding population
   dynamics, but can be difficult to resolve in landbirds due to the
   limited number of age classes discernible by examining plumage. In
   forests of western North America, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides
   articus) typically colonize burned areas shortly after fire, but
   densities decline within 6-10 yr. This pattern is often assumed to
   result from adult Black-backed Woodpeckers abandoning territories when
   food resources wane, yet long-distance breeding dispersal is relatively
   rare in birds, whereas longdistance natal dispersal is more common. To
   determine whether colonization of newly burned areas is driven primarily
   by breeding dispersal of adults or natal dispersal by young birds, we
   captured 57 adult Black-backed Woodpeckers in 6 burned areas in
   California between 1 and 8 yr after fire. We used patterns of multiple
   feather generations retained among primary coverts, secondaries, and
   secondary coverts to assign birds to 1 of 5 age classes (second-,
   third-, and fourth-calendar-year; after-third-calendar-year; and
   after-fourth-calendar-year). Population age structure varied
   dramatically across burned areas, with a preponderance of
   second-calendar-year birds in the 1 yr and 2 yr postfire areas, and a
   preponderance of birds at least 3 yr old in the older postfire areas.
   Poisson generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) revealed that the effect
   of years since fire on woodpecker age was highly significant (z = 3.575,
   P < 0.001). Our results indicate that natal dispersal is the primary
   means by which Black-backed Woodpeckers colonize recently burned areas
   in western forests, and that breeding dispersal is uncommon. The decline
   of Black-backed Woodpecker populations 6-10 yr after fire likely
   reflects the lifespan of individual birds that colonized the burned
   area, or of offspring that they produced in the early postfire years.
   Our discrimination of Black-backed Woodpeckers into 5 age classes
   confirms previous suppositions about plumage-based age determination in
   woodpeckers, and is likely applicable to other woodpecker species.}},

Abstract = {{Monocultures of even-aged trees in short rotation are a forest system of
   low ecological complexity that has been described as unsuitable for the
   establishment of stable populations of forest birds. However, key
   habitat quality cues could make them attractive to forest specialists.
   This paper assesses the suitability of poplar plantations in the
   northeast of the Iberian Peninsula for a forest specialist, the Lesser
   Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor. Poplar stands occupy a small area
   of an agroforestry mosaic landscape where semi-natural Mediterranean
   woodland is predominant. Population size, nesting success, home ranges
   and habitat selection were studied by radio-tracking and monitoring
   during the breeding season and the winter. Poplar plantations were
   preferentially selected for breeding and foraging in the spring and the
   winter. Home ranges in the breeding season and the winter (32.4 and
   438.5 ha, respectively) were similar to those observed in semi-natural
   woodlands that have been studied in Europe. However, population density
   (0.25 territories/100 ha) was lower than that described in most European
   semi-natural woodlands. Nesting success was low (0.54), due to strong
   competition with other cavity nesters, predation of nests by the Greater
   Spotted Woodpecker, and loss of one of the adults. Fifty per cent of the
   foraging activity during the breeding season took place in an area of
   180 metres around the nest. The amount of standing dead wood in poplar
   stands was much higher than in the surrounding habitats and source
   areas. The moderate breeding success and the high rate of adult
   predation may suggest that poplar plantations act as an ecological trap,
   in which standing dead wood may be a habitat quality cue that attracts
   birds to this non-ideal habitat. Poplar plantations become even less
   suitable when most of the available habitat is felled at the same time.
   Suitable planning of poplar plantation rotations and recovery of
   riparian forest is the best way to ensure the survival of Lesser Spotted
   Woodpecker populations in the long term.}},

Title = {{The effect of stand-level habitat characteristics on breeding bird

Abstract = {{The effects of stand structure, tree species composition, proportion of
   habitat types and land use history on breeding bird assemblages in
   temperate mixed forests in Western Hungary were studied. The species
   richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole breeding bird
   assemblage and of some groups formed on the basis of nesting site and
   rarity were examined. Stand structural variables had the highest impact
   on the breeding bird assemblage, while tree species composition, the
   varying proportion of vegetation types and land use history had no
   significant effect. In the case of the species richness, the abundance
   and the composition of the whole assemblage, the most important
   variables were the mean diameter of trees, the vegetation cover of the
   forest floor and the dead wood volume. The explained variance in the
   linear models of different groups varied between 20\% and 60\%, and the
   relative importance of these three variables also differed considerably.
   These results indicate that forest management may considerably influence
   the diversity and the composition of birds, as all the structural
   elements affecting birds deeply depend on it. Within the shelterwood
   management system, the elongation of the rotation and regeneration
   periods, and the relatively high proportion of retention tree groups
   after harvest could contribute to the conservation of forest birds. Our
   results also showed that for the forest bird communities, both the
   prevalence of big trees and the presence of a dense understory layer are
   important. Management regimes which apply continuous forest cover might
   be more appropriate for providing these structural elements
   simultaneously on small spatial scales, and for the maintenance of a
   more diverse bird community, thus healthier forest ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The Atlantic Forest is one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots
   in the world due to habitat fragmentation. Restoration and connectivity
   of forest fragments are crucial to maintain viable populations of
   forest-dependent species. During winter and summer, we studied the bird
   diversity, its components and composition (including specialist and
   generalist species) in three different vegetation types: mature forest
   (MF), secondary forest (SF) and grassland (G) of an ecological corridor
   in Misiones, Argentina. We determined the influence of alpha diversity
   (of each habitat) and beta diversity (species turnover between habitats)
   on gamma diversity (regional diversity in the corridor), to provide
   conservation management recommendations. MF showed the highest values of
   bird diversity, richness, evenness and abundance, followed by SF and G,
   in both seasons. Only MF showed a possible seasonal variation in
   diversity and richness. The species composition of SF was similar to MF.
   However, G, where pasture specialist and edge species were the most
   common species recorded (70\% of its avifauna), had very low similarity
   to MF, where the most forest specialist species were found (53\%). As
   alpha diversities were higher than beta values, the bird diversity in
   the studied corridor mainly resulted from the diversity in each
   vegetation type, in both studied seasons. We therefore recommend
   preservation of both MF and recovering SF due to their high bird
   diversity and the presence of forest-dependent, threatened and endemic
   bird species. We also urge the creation of ecological corridors between
   protected forest remnants of the Atlantic Forest.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe, hunting and game management are centuries-old activities that
   have had profound effects on the landscapes and the biodiversity they
   support. Game management is a potentially important tool to enhance game
   populations and may also affect other wildlife. We investigated the
   relationship between red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa game management
   and steppe-bird abundance in central Spain. We surveyed 54 red-legged
   partridge hunting estates with varying game-management intensity in
   spring and/or summer in 2006 and 2008-2010. Information about game
   management was gathered through questionnaires to game managers. Birds
   were counted from fixed points and the amount of different land uses in
   each point was visually estimated. Our results show that the abundance
   of granivorous species (sandgrouse) increased significantly with the
   density of feeders, whereas non-granivorous species were more abundant
   in estates with more intensive fox control, although the latter
   relationship was weaker. Land-use variables, specifically agricultural
   lands, appeared in the models of all the groups considered. Therefore,
   there is an option for designing optimal management for red-legged
   partridge estates that potentially benefits non-target species: an
   effective combination of habitat management, adequate use of
   supplementary food and water, and possibly selective legal predator
   control when necessary and effective for the target game species,
   although the latter needs further investigation.}},

Title = {{Forest restoration to attract a putative umbrella species, the
   white-backed woodpecker, benefited saproxylic beetles}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Umbrella species are often spatially demanding and have limited ability
   to adapt to environmental changes induced by human land-use. This makes
   them vulnerable to human encroachment. In Sweden, broadleaved trees are
   disadvantaged by forestry, and commercially managed forests are often
   deprived of dead wood. This has led to a situation where previously
   widespread top predators in saproxylic food webs, such as the
   white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos), have become species of
   conservation concern. The white-backed woodpecker is generally
   considered an umbrella species, and it has been linked to forests with
   large volumes of dead wood from broadleaved trees. In recent years,
   forest stands have been restored for the white-backed woodpecker, but
   post-treatment evaluations have rarely included other species that also
   occur in broad-leaved forests (co-occurring species). Many co-occurring
   species are saproxylic beetles. In this study, we collected saproxylic
   beetles and environmental data in restored and commercially managed
   forests to evaluate if habitat restoration for the white-backed
   woodpecker also benefited other species with similar habitat
   associations. We found that volumes of coarse woody debris were higher
   in restored than in commercially managed forests, and that a majority of
   man-made snags and downed logs were created from birch trees (Betula
   spp.). Most spruce trees (Picea abies) were extracted during forest
   restoration, and this opened up the forest canopy, and created stands
   dominated by broadleaved trees. Many saproxylic beetles were more common
   in restored forests, and there were significant differences in species
   composition between treatments. These differences were largely explained
   by species traits. Effects of sun-exposure were particularly important,
   but many beneficiary species were also linked to dead wood from
   broadleaved trees. Red-listed saproxylic beetles showed a similar
   pattern with more species and individuals in restored sites. The
   white-backed woodpecker is still critically endangered in Sweden, but
   important prey species are already responding to forest restoration at
   the stand level. We recognize that landscape-level improvements will be
   required to bring the white-backed woodpecker back, but also that the
   umbrella species concept can provide a useful framework for successful
   forest restoration as many co-occurring saproxylic beetle species
   seemingly benefitted from restoration for the white-backed woodpecker.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Emissions from smelting not only contaminate water and soil with metals,
   but also induce extensive forest dieback and changes in resource
   availability and microclimate. The relative effects of such co-occurring
   stressors are often unknown, but this information is imperative in
   developing targeted restoration strategies. We assessed the role and
   relative effects of structural alterations of terrestrial habitat and
   metal pollution caused by century-long smelting operations on amphibian
   and reptile communities by collecting environmental and time- and
   area-standardized multivariate abundance data along three spatially
   replicated impact gradients. Overall, species richness, diversity, and
   abundance declined progressively with increasing levels of metals (As,
   Cu, and Ni) and soil temperature (T-s) and decreasing canopy cover,
   amount of coarse woody debris (CWD), and relative humidity (RH). The
   composite habitat variable (which included canopy cover, CWD, T-s, and
   RH) was more strongly associated with most response metrics than the
   composite metal variable (As, Cu, and Ni), and canopy cover alone
   explained 19-74\% of the variance. Moreover, species that use
   terrestrial habitat for specific behaviors (e.g., hibernation,
   dispersal), especially forest-dependent species, were more severely
   affected than largely aquatic species. These results suggest that
   structural alterations of terrestrial habitat and concomitant changes in
   the resource availability and microclimate have stronger effects than
   metal pollution per se. Furthermore, much of the variation in response
   metrics was explained by the joint action of several environmental
   variables, implying synergistic effects (e.g., exacerbation of metal
   toxicity by elevated temperatures in sites with reduced canopy cover).
   We thus argue that the restoration of terrestrial habitat conditions is
   a key to successful recovery of herpetofauna communities in
   smelting-altered landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Time and financial constraints often force conservationists to make ad
   hoc management decisions without sufficient knowledge to predict their
   effects. In particular, the effects of management on reproduction and
   survival are rarely evaluated and habitat dynamics are rarely taken into
   account. We evaluated the effects of three different forms of habitat
   alteration on the endangered Pale-headed Brushfinch (Atlapetes
   pallidiceps) in Ecuador during the phases of population increase and
   stabilization. More specifically, we monitored the effect of a natural
   experiment with three approaches (clearing, grazing and burning) to
   preserve the semi-open habitat of this species on the reproductive
   success of 220 breeding events over seven years and on the survival of
   73 adults over three consecutive years. Habitat alteration had
   contrasting effects on reproduction and survival. All approaches
   increased the number of fledged chicks per breeding event while the
   population stabilized, but not while it increased. However, vegetation
   burning reduced survival probability of adult individuals. In addition,
   survival was strongly correlated to the presence of water in the
   territories. Overall, we revealed that the negative effects of
   vegetation burning on survival overrode the positive effects on
   reproduction, and could if implemented at a larger scale destroy the
   conservation aim of increasing the population size. Importantly, we show
   that the effectiveness of management differs depending on the actual
   population trend. Our study therefore shows that the a posteriori
   evaluation of ad hoc vegetation control can constitute an integral part
   of adaptive management and thereby also of long-term conservation
   planning of endangered species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Large areas of montane forests are commercially harvested, while some
   other parts remain unmanaged. These conditions provide an opportunity to
   study the response of bird communities to forest management. Here we
   focused on the effects of tree species composition and tree age on bird
   species richness. We counted birds in two types of montane forest (beech
   and mixed) replicated in three age classes (managed 55-65 years, managed
   85-95 years, unmanaged over 200 years) in the Vtacnik Mountains,
   Slovakia. Number of bird species at individual study sites (local
   richness) was predicted solely by the tree age and not by the forest
   type. Specifically, the number of species was highest in the oldest
   stands, while the stands of 55-65 and 85-95 years did not differ from
   each other. By contrast, forest type seems important for total bird
   species richness (number of species recorded in all study sites of a
   given type) with more species recorded in mixed forests than in beech
   forests. The local richness seems thus limited by the amount resources
   available at a given site, which is highest in the oldest stands
   irrespective to forest type, probably due to largest amount of food,
   dead wood or tree cavities, being particularly suitable for habitat
   specialists. However, larger species pool in mixed forest, enriched by
   birds adapted to coniferous trees, increases the total number of species
   observed in this type. We thus recommend to shift the harvest to the
   highest possible age and to include some other tree species into parts
   of beech monocultures.}},

Title = {{Tradeoffs among ecosystem services in restored wetlands}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{191}},
Pages = {{341-348}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Land management decisions frequently involve choices that reflect
   tradeoffs among ecosystem services. These tradeoffs are not always
   apparent, and land managers unknowingly may make decisions that diminish
   the value of some services while enhancing the value of others. Offset
   policies, such as wetland mitigation in the United States, rely on the
   assumption that ecosystems can be restored to provide a full suite of
   services. Wetlands provide many ecosystem services such as water quality
   maintenance, carbon storage, flood abatement, and biodiversity support.
   Our objectives were to describe tradeoffs among ecosystem services in
   mitigation wetlands and identify abiotic and biotic drivers underlying
   these tradeoffs. We measured denitrification potential, organic matter
   decomposition, herbaceous biomass, and soil organic content as
   indicators of nutrient storage and removal services in 30 mitigation
   wetlands in Illinois, USA. Additionally, we estimated surface-water
   storage potential, and, since wetlands provide valuable biodiversity
   support, we determined the species composition of plant, anuran, and
   avian communities. We found a positive relationship among biodiversity
   indicators for different taxa. Denitrification potential and
   surface-water storage potential were positively correlated. However,
   there was a tradeoff between biodiversity support and nutrient cycling
   processes; soil organic matter, biomass, decomposition rates, and
   potential denitrification were greater at less biodiverse sites. Our
   findings indicate that optimizing restored wetlands for nutrient storage
   and removal may come at the expense of biodiversity. It is unrealistic
   to expect all services to be maximized at a restoration site. Therefore,
   restoration practitioners should prioritize services based on needs and
   opportunities given local and watershed contexts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Wintering ecology of sympatric subspecies of Sandhill Crane:
   Correlations between body size, site fidelity, and movement patterns}},
Journal = {{CONDOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{Body size is known to correlate with many aspects of life history in
   birds, and this knowledge can be used to manage and conserve bird
   species. However, few studies have compared the wintering ecology of
   sympatric subspecies that vary significantly in body size. We used
   radiotelemetry to examine the relationship between body size and site
   fidelity, movements, and home range in 2 subspecies of Sandhill Crane
   (Grus canadensis) wintering in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of
   California, USA. Both subspecies showed high interannual return rates to
   the Delta study area, but Greater Sandhill Cranes (G. c. tabida) showed
   stronger within-winter fidelity to landscapes in our study region and to
   roost complexes within landscapes than did Lesser Sandhill Cranes (G. c.
   canadensis). Foraging flights from roost sites were shorter for G. c.
   tabida than for G. c. canadensis (1.9 +/- 0.01 km vs. 4.5 +/- 0.01 km,
   respectively) and, consequently, the mean size of 95\% fixed-kernel
   winter home ranges was an order of magnitude smaller for G. c. tabida
   than for G. c. canadensis (1.9 +/- 0.4 km(2) vs. 21.9 +/- 1.9 km(2),
   respectively). Strong site fidelity indicates that conservation planning
   to manage for adequate food resources around traditional roost sites can
   be effective for meeting the habitat needs of these cranes, but the
   scale of conservation efforts should differ by subspecies. Analysis of
   movement patterns suggests that conservation planners and managers
   should consider all habitats within 5 km of a known G. c. tabida roost
   and within 10 km of a G. c. canadensis roost when planning for habitat
   management, mitigation, acquisition, and easements.}},

Abstract = {{Sable antelope, Hippotragus niger, populations have declined
   substantially in Kruger National Park, South Africa despite large-area
   protection from land use and poaching. Since Africa's large mammal
   populations are restricted to protected areas, understanding how to
   manage parks for biological diversity is critically important to the
   sustainability of faunal populations into the future. To better
   understand the drivers of sable decline, we analyzed landscapes where
   herds persist in the Pretoriuskop region of Kruger - identified by GPS
   collar telemetry data from eight individuals in five herds remaining in
   this area, and compared them to landscapes where sable herds have
   recently disappeared. We mapped these landscapes with satellite-based
   spectral data on vegetation greenness and fire frequency and Carnegie
   Airborne Observatory LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data on 3-D
   vegetation structure. Within their home ranges, sable herds consistently
   selected areas with high fire frequency, high tree cover and low shrub
   cover. However, there were no consistent differences in habitat features
   between the home ranges of current sable herds and areas formerly
   supporting herds. Locally deteriorating habitat conditions were
   therefore not responsible for the decline in sables in this region of
   the park. Our study also illustrates how multi-sensor, 3-D mapping of
   ecosystems provides a means to assess causes and consequences of
   changing animal habitats over time.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{To be successful, prescriptions for tropical forest restoration should
   facilitate natural recovery while also being easy to implement and
   inexpensive. In the Lake Ngardok Nature Reserve, Palau, we monitored
   native forest patches (4-275 m(2)) over 3 years to assess the influence
   of several low-cost restoration methods on patch expansion, growth of
   naturally established tree saplings, density of naturally establishing
   tree seedlings, growth of planted tree seedlings, flower and fruit
   production, and bird and flying fox visitations. Treatments included
   fertilization, trimming of surrounding herbaceous vegetation, mulching
   of patch perimeters, and planting native tree seedlings. Fertilized
   patches expanded faster and were associated with higher growth rates of
   perimeter saplings, higher fruit and flower production and growth of
   adjacent planted Acacia auriculiformis trees. Trimming perimeter
   vegetation led to higher tree seedling densities and species diversity,
   but both trimming and fertilizer effects on patch perimeter measures
   decreased over time. Pterocarpus indicus, a high value native legume,
   was the fastest growing planted tree species. The most common visitors
   were small, omnivorous, predominately endemic bird species. Visitations
   to fertilized patches were more frequent than to non-fertilized patches.
   The strongest predictors of visitation frequency were patch area, mean
   number of total fruits, and mean height of nearest neighboring trees. We
   conclude that forest succession can be accelerated by applying small
   amounts of fertilizer (approximately 22.5 g/m(2) per application) to
   enhance tree growth and increase visitation rates of native pollinators
   and dispersers.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires are a common natural disturbance in forested ecosystems and
   have a large impact on the microbial communities in forest soils. The
   response of soil fungal communities to forest fire is poorly documented.
   Here, we investigated fungal community structure and function across a
   152-year boreal forest fire chronosequence using high-throughput
   sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region and a
   functional gene array (GeoChip). Our results demonstrate that the boreal
   forest soil fungal community was most diverse soon after a fire
   disturbance and declined over time. The differences in the fungal
   communities were explained by changes in the abundance of basidiomycetes
   and ascomycetes. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi contributed to the increase
   in basidiomycete abundance over time, with the operational taxonomic
   units (OTUs) representing the genera Cortinarius and Piloderma
   dominating in abundance. Hierarchical cluster analysis by using gene
   signal intensity revealed that the sites with different fire histories
   formed separate clusters, suggesting differences in the potential to
   maintain essential biogeochemical soil processes. The site with the
   greatest biological diversity had also the most diverse genes. The genes
   involved in organic matter degradation in the mature forest, in which
   ECM fungi were the most abundant, were as common in the youngest site,
   in which saprotrophic fungi had a relatively higher abundance. This
   study provides insight into the impact of fire disturbance on soil
   fungal community dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Woodland, like many habitats throughout the world, has been severely
   affected by habitat loss and fragmentation. Woodland restoration
   programmes aimed at reversing habitat loss have been in place in many
   countries over the last 100 years. In particular, agri-environment
   schemes (AES) to increase the amount and quality of woodland on
   agricultural land have operated in Europe and Australia for decades
   (nearly 30 years in the United Kingdom). However, to date there has been
   very little assessment of their value to biodiversity. We assessed the
   potential benefits to biodiversity of woodlands planted during 1988-1991
   under a woodland grant scheme (WGS in Scotland), according to local and
   landscape-level habitat characteristics. Specifically, we (1) performed
   a linear discriminant analysis to compare the characteristics of 24 WGS
   sites to those of more mature semi-natural woodlands (34 sites > 60
   years old), and (2) used existing information on the influence of
   woodland characteristics on a biologically diverse group (i.e. moths) to
   quantify the benefits of WGS sites to biodiversity. The creation of new
   WGS patches increased woodland extent and connectivity in the landscape;
   however, planting that took place adjacent to previously existing
   woodland did not usually increase connectivity. WGS sites were mainly
   composed by broadleaved native tree species, but non-native species were
   also present. In general, WGS sites had lower tree species richness,
   proportion of native trees, tree basal area and amount of understory,
   and higher tree densities and canopy cover than more mature semi-natural
   woodlands. Overall, WGS sites were predicted to have lower moth
   abundance and species richness than older semi-natural woodlands.
   However, the magnitude of these differences depended on the habitat
   specificity and dispersal abilities of different moth groups, suggesting
   that WGS sites are better at providing suitable resources for generalist
   species and for species less limited by dispersal. Our findings have
   important implications for the way in which current woodland creation
   and management schemes operate in many countries and suggest that: (1)
   the creation of new woodlands should focus on planting native species,
   (2) woodland creation schemes are likely to be more beneficial for
   biodiversity if certain management practices (e.g. thinning to enhance
   structural diversity and accelerate the transition to later successional
   stages) accompany the provision of these grants, and (3)
   spatially-targeted woodland creation would further increase the
   contribution of AES woodlands to enhance biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{White-headed woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) are important cavity
   excavators that recently have become the focus of much research because
   of concerns over population declines. Past studies have focused on nest
   site selection and survival but information is needed on factors
   influencing their space use when away from the nest. We examined space
   use by white-headed woodpeckers during the nesting (May-Jul) and
   post-nesting (Jul-Oct) periods and compared the role of environmental
   factors (e.g., landcover) and socio-demographic factors (e.g., age,
   breeding success) in home range size and selection of location. Average
   size of 99\% kernel home ranges was 125ha (SD +/- 59ha; n=19) in the
   nesting period and 137ha (SD +/- 70ha; n=30) in the post-nesting period.
   Minimum convex polygons were generally comparable to or smaller than
   ranges reported from previous radio-telemetry studies with this species.
   Although bird weight and age best explained variation in home range size
   compared to other factors, neither parameter estimate was significant in
   our models. Thus, even though weight and age were the most-supported
   factors in our analysis, home range size was largely influenced by
   factors that we did not measure. We found that most woodpeckers selected
   home ranges within forest patches that had undergone a recent
   disturbance; these areas included forests that had recently been burned
   with prescribed fire by the United States Forest Service (82\%) or
   subject to disease (16\%). Most burned patches in our study were small
   (approx. 4.8ha) and occurred within otherwise live forest but had nearly
   complete mortality of adult trees. We suggest that recent forest
   disturbances, especially mixed-severity prescribed burns, may have been
   selected by white-headed woodpeckers because they created snags for
   nesting and future studies should explore this hypothesis. Because home
   range size was variable and not linked with productivity, it should not
   be used as an indication of habitat quality without more detailed
   studies on causal factors that affect space use in this species.

   Bird}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Land management intrinsically influences the distribution of animals and
   can consequently alter the potential for density-dependent processes to
   act within populations. For declining species, high densities of
   breeding territories are typically considered to represent productive
   populations. However, as density-dependent effects of food limitation or
   predator pressure may occur (especially when species are dependent upon
   separate nesting and foraging habitats), high territory density may
   limit per-capita productivity. Here, we use a declining but widespread
   European farmland bird, the yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella L., as a
   model system to test whether higher territory densities result in lower
   fledging success, parental provisioning rates or nestling growth rates
   compared to lower densities. Organic landscapes held higher territory
   densities, but nests on organic farms fledged fewer nestlings,
   translating to a 5 times higher rate of population shrinkage on organic
   farms compared to conventional. In addition, when parental provisioning
   behaviour was not restricted by predation risk (i.e., at times of low
   corvid activity), nestling provisioning rates were higher at lower
   territory densities, resulting in a much greater increase in nestling
   mass in low density areas, suggesting that food limitation occurred at
   high densities. These findings in turn suggest an ecological trap,
   whereby preferred nesting habitat does not provide sufficient food for
   rearing nestlings at high population density, creating a population
   sink. Habitat management for farmland birds should focus not simply on
   creating a high nesting density, but also on ensuring heterogeneous
   habitats to provide food resources in close proximity to nesting birds,
   even if this occurs through potentially restricting overall nest density
   but increasing population-level breeding success.}},

Title = {{Using fledged brood counts of hedgerow birds to assess the effect of
   summer agri-environment scheme options}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{376-383}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A key aim of many European agri-environment schemes (AES) is to improve
   biodiversity on farmland. In recent years, several countries have been
   looking at long term trends in the spring adult population size of a
   target group of farmland birds as an indicator of this. The overall
   trend in these indicators is however not upwards. While this might
   suggest we need to look at the design and deployment of habitat
   management options within schemes, there is an increasing view that we
   also need to refine and improve our indicators, or the way we monitor
   them.
   Relating spring adult bird population size to AES options is problematic
   not least because of the time lag between the deployment of those
   designed to enhance bird breeding success in summer, and the spring
   surveys the following year. At the other end of the scale detailed
   studies of breeding success in farmland birds have practical/cost
   restraints. We argue that to understand the impact on farmland birds of
   particular summer options within AESs we need to be able to estimate the
   breeding success of local bird populations quickly and cheaply. This
   would enable us to relate particular AES options to the breeding
   performance of the birds actually using them.
   Complementing a previous study of woodland birds, we assess the
   likelihood of encountering fledged broods of hedgerow nesting bird
   species during transect surveys without finding nests, and then apply a
   simple mark-recapture analysis technique to provide an index of breeding
   success for those species. Following spring adult assessments, counts of
   fledged broods were undertaken four times a week during April, May, June
   and July, in four 2.5 km hedgerow transects, at four sites in southern
   England in 2010. Mean daily detection probabilities of fledged broods of
   16 common hedgerow birds were calculated from these counts using the
   software Presence. For 15 out of these 16 species these detection
   probabilities were sufficiently high for a programme of fledged brood
   surveys, involving just two or three visits per week from mid-May to
   mid-July, to provide a useful estimate of breeding success.
   The survey technique and associated analyses make certain assumptions
   when providing estimates of breeding success and these are discussed.
   Little is known about initial dispersal in passerine fledglings and a
   study in hedgerows may be useful here. However our pilot study suggests
   that the method could have application as a relatively easily derived
   productivity index for hedgerow birds, and hence an additional method
   available to study the impact of certain AES options on indicator
   species, or for research studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Habitat Types at Mount Kilimanjaro}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{In most habitats, vegetation provides the main structure of the
   environment. This complexity can facilitate biodiversity and ecosystem
   services. Therefore, measures of vegetation structure can serve as
   indicators in ecosystem management. However, many structural measures
   are laborious and require expert knowledge. Here, we used consistent and
   convenient measures to assess vegetation structure over an exceptionally
   broad elevation gradient of 866-4550m above sea level at Mount
   Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Additionally, we compared (human)-modified
   habitats, including maize fields, traditionally managed home gardens,
   grasslands, commercial coffee farms and logged and burned forests with
   natural habitats along this elevation gradient. We distinguished
   vertical and horizontal vegetation structure to account for habitat
   complexity and heterogeneity. Vertical vegetation structure (assessed as
   number, width and density of vegetation layers, maximum canopy height,
   leaf area index and vegetation cover) displayed a unimodal elevation
   pattern, peaking at intermediate elevations in montane forests, whereas
   horizontal structure (assessed as coefficient of variation of number,
   width and density of vegetation layers, maximum canopy height, leaf area
   index and vegetation cover) was lowest at intermediate altitudes.
   Overall, vertical structure was consistently lower in modified than in
   natural habitat types, whereas horizontal structure was inconsistently
   different in modified than in natural habitat types, depending on the
   specific structural measure and habitat type. Our study shows how
   vertical and horizontal vegetation structure can be assessed efficiently
   in various habitat types in tropical mountain regions, and we suggest to
   apply this as a tool for informing future biodiversity and ecosystem
   service studies.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of revegetation in providing habitat for fauna is
   expected to be determined both by within-site factors and attributes of
   the landscape in which a revegetation site occurs. Most studies of fauna
   in revegetation have been conducted in landscapes that have been
   extensively cleared, modified or fragmented, and in Australia,
   predominantly in the southern temperate zone. We investigated how
   within-site vegetation attributes and landscape context attributes were
   related to bird species richness and composition in a chronosequence of
   post-mining rehabilitation sites within an otherwise intact landscape in
   tropical northern Australia. Our working hypothesis was that bird
   species richness in rehabilitating sites would be positively related to
   site vegetation structure and landscape context including (1) proximity
   to woodland and (2) the proportion of woodland within a 500-m buffer of
   rehabilitation sites. Within each of 67 sites, we sampled vegetation
   once and surveyed for birds eight times over 16 months. Landscape
   context variables were calculated using GIS. There were large
   differences between bird assemblages of woodland and rehabilitation
   sites and between age classes of rehabilitation. Bird assemblages were
   strongly related to site vegetation attributes across all rehabilitation
   sites. Proximity to woodland was only related to bird assemblages in
   rehabilitation sites older than 4 years old. We conclude that the
   relative importance of landscape context and site variables at any point
   in time will be a function of how closely vegetation within the
   revegetation site matches the habitat resource requirements of

Abstract = {{Fire is one of the main threats facing the long-term survival of the
   forests in the Eastern Arc Mountains. Yet, our understanding of how it
   affects fauna, particularly birds, is still poor. A fire that originated
   on surrounding farmland burned approximately half of Kimboza Forest
   Reserve between 13 and 15 October 2010. To better understand how birds
   respond to fire, a short-term study of understorey bird diversity and
   abundance in this forest reserve was conducted by comparing burned and
   unburned sites twenty months post-fire. Capture rates were significantly
   higher at the unburned site compared to the burned site. Bird species
   diversity was also higher at the unburned site than at the burned site.
   Despite the brevity of the study, the results suggest that fire has
   negative effects on forest avifauna and forest fires need to be
   prevented at Kimboza Forest Reserve as they affect the distribution and
   diversity of understorey birds.}},

Abstract = {{Two fundamental questions for wetland restoration science are: how do
   early management practices affect long term plant species diversity, and
   how does diversity affect ecological function? Here, we report on a nine
   year study conducted in six replicate experimental wetland ecosystems
   designed to shed light on the impact of different planting treatments
   and nutrient enrichment on plant species diversity and on a variety of
   indicators of structure and function. Pairs of high-and low-intensity
   planting treatments were initiated with native seeds and vegetative
   propagules. In the high-intensity treatment, vegetative propagules that
   did not establish were replanted in years three and four. An unplanted
   treatment was seeded through natural recruitment alone. Annual
   inventories of the presence and percent cover of plant species were used
   to derive measures of native Shannon-Weaver diversity and the floristic
   quality assessment index (FQAI). We found that higher plant species
   diversity was achieved early and was sustained in planted versus
   unplanted wetlands. However, no differences were evident between
   high-and low-intensity planting treatments. Although the prevalence of
   dominant species shifted over time, overall measures of plant diversity
   did not change between early and later succession in either planted or
   unplanted treatments. We found no relationships between plant diversity
   and a variety of direct and indirect measures of ecosystem structure and
   function, including aquatic community metabolism, aboveground
   productivity, soil organic matter accumulation and nutrient
   concentration. Fertilizer was applied in years eight and nine to
   simulate nutrient loading from agricultural runoff. Plant species
   diversity had no detectable effects on nutrient uptake rates in response
   to fertilization. Conversely, fertilization did not measurably alter
   species diversity in the two years following addition. We conclude that
   early management efforts were important in achieving a sustained and
   resilient enhancement in plant species diversity, but that elevated
   biodiversity resulting from planting did not measurably alter function.
   We speculate that control of invasive species in all treatment groups
   during early years of management resulted in high species diversity
   levels in unplanted as well as planted groups and that species diversity
   levels in all wetlands were therefore well above levels at which effects
   of plant species diversity on ecosystem function saturate. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The Hyrcanian forests of northern Iran support a great diversity of bird
   species. Yet, the ecological relationships of cavity-nesting birds
   (CNBs), the main components of forest bird communities in this area,
   remain unknown. We examined the importance of ecological factors in 90
   study plots during the breeding season to predict the probability
   distribution and habitat suitability of primary cavity nesters (PCNs),
   secondary cavity nesters (SCNs) and weak primary cavity nesters (WPCNs).
   Ecological factors included forest structure, habitat complexity,
   geographical attributes and dead tree features. The significant habitat
   parameters determining the presence-absence of each CNB species were
   also determined. PCN richness and abundance were most influenced by the
   density of larger trees, snags (standing dead trees) and logs (fallen
   dead trees). The densities of snags, logs and larger trees and the
   extent of the shrub layer influenced distributions of SCNs. The Eurasian
   nuthatch (Sitta europaea) was the only WPCN identified, and its
   distribution was strongly affected by altitude and by larger snags and
   trees in complex habitats. Our results showed that CNB species could be
   classified in three groups: (1) species dependent on mature forests, (2)
   species dependent on younger forests and (3) species adaptable to
   different forest stages. Overall, snags and logs played vital roles in
   the habitat preferences of CNB communities as well as in forest
   structure and complexity.}},

Abstract = {{We combined data from the Atlantic Flyway Breeding Waterfowl Survey
   (AFBWS) and the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to estimate
   the number of wood ducks (Aix sponsa) in the United States portion of
   the Atlantic Flyway from 1993 to 2013. The AFBWS is a plot-based survey
   that covers most of the northern and central portions of the Flyway;
   when analyzed with adjustments for survey time of day effects, these
   data can be used to estimate population size. The BBS provides an index
   of wood duck abundance along roadside routes. Although factors
   influencing change in BBS counts over time can be controlled in BBS
   analysis, BBS indices alone cannot be used to derive population size
   estimates. We used AFBWS data to scale BBS indices for Bird Conservation
   Regions (BCR), basing the scaling factors on the ratio of estimated
   AFBWS population sizes to regional BBS indices for portions of BCRs that
   were common to both surveys. We summed scaled BBS results for portions
   of the Flyway not covered by the AFBWS with AFBWS population estimates
   to estimate a mean yearly total of 1,295,875 (mean 95\% CI:
   1,013,9401,727,922) wood ducks. Scaling factors varied among BCRs from
   16.7 to 148.0; the mean scaling factor was 68.9 (mean 95\% CI:
   53.5-90.9). Flyway-wide, population estimates from the combined analysis
   were consistent with alternative estimates derived from harvest data,
   and also provide population estimates within states and BCRs. We
   recommend their use in harvest and habitat management within the
   Atlantic Flyway. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work

Abstract = {{As urbanization accelerates, urban biodiversity conservation is becoming
   a great concern for the maintenance of urban ecosystem functions. In
   particular, forest bird communities in urban areas have been recognized
   as a conservation target because of their functions in food webs and
   ecosystem services. But our understanding of which local- and
   landscape-scale factors influence native bird communities within urban
   green spaces is still insufficient to provide managers with information
   for effectively planning biodiversity management programs. Here we
   examine how local habitat characteristics, human disturbance, and
   habitat connectivity influence the diversity of forest bird communities
   in 44 small forest patches (0.5-20.0 ha) embedded in an urbanized
   landscape. Patch size exerted a positive influence on the diversity of
   most bird functional groups, and it had the greatest effects on total
   abundance and species richness. The second most important factor was
   human disturbance. Remnant patches with lower levels of human
   disturbance had higher diversity than newly established patches where
   intense human activities occurred more frequently. In addition,
   vegetation complexity and habitat connectivity were positively related
   to total species richness and abundance, respectively, but they were
   less important. Management strategies for the conservation of urban
   forest birds, therefore, should consider not only local improvements in
   habitat structure - through increased patch size, reduced human
   disturbance, and increased vegetation complexity - but also the
   maintenance of habitat connectivity.}},

   following a high severity wildfire in a southern USA mixed pine/hardwood

Abstract = {{High severity forest fires are increasing in large areas of the southern
   and western United States as the climate becomes warmer and drier. Given
   their strong roles in ecosystem dynamics, documenting the response of
   bird communities to wildfires is important for improving our
   understanding and management of post-wildfire ecosystems. However,
   because wildfires are unplanned events, relatively few studies have been
   conducted to assess local-scale impacts on forest bird communities. In
   this study, we had the opportunity to use a before-after, control-impact
   (BACI) approach to assess the response of resident birds to high
   severity wildfires that occurred in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas in
   September and October 2011. We replicated a previous study using point
   count surveys to assess summer and winter bird community changes ca. 1
   year after the wildfires. We found that total number of detected
   individuals did not change following the wildfires, but winter bird
   species richness increased in burned habitat. Changes were apparent at
   the foraging guild-level for the winter bird community, with an increase
   in aerial insectivores and decrease in bark insectivores. Summer and
   winter bird community composition changes were apparent at the
   species-level and generally agreed with species-specific habitat
   preferences. For example, species such as eastern bluebirds and chipping
   sparrows that prefer open woodlands were positively associated with
   burned habitat. Our results provide quantitative evidence that high
   severity forest fires increased habitat suitability for many resident
   bird species. At the landscape-scale, fire-induced increases in habitat
   heterogeneity could result in higher bird diversity in the Lost Pines
   ecoregion. We expect bird community composition will be dynamic in the
   Lost Pines ecoregion over the next few decades as the burned habitat
   continues to change through successional processes and post-fire
   management actions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   understory biodiversity of Jatropha curcas plantations. Two kinds of
   mixed modes of J. curcas (mixed plantation with Macadamia integrifolia
   and mixed plantation with shrub species) and a pure plantation of J.
   curcas were planted, while the native vegetation served as a control.
   The plots were distributed along the gradients of forest management,
   succession and elevation by CCA analysis. Species richness was not
   significantly different for the different types of plantation, but the
   evenness of species could be affected, especially for the total
   community and the understory by planting J. curcas. The diversity and
   evenness indices of species were affected for the mixed plantation with
   different proportions of M. integrifolia, especially for the shrub
   layer, the Shannon diversity index and Pilou evenness index showed
   significant differences. And for the different mixed shrub species, only
   the Shannon diversity index and Pilou evenness index were significantly
   different. Finally, from the perspective of biological diversity,
   J.curcas plantation with shrub species would be a recommended planting
   model for ecological restoration in a dry-hot valley area, while J.
   curcas plantation with M integrifolia would be an effective planting
   model to balance crop yield and food security.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is an important disturbance regime that can structure wildlife
   communities and their habitats for many years. Using a
   before-after-control-impact framework, we evaluated the effect of the
   Quartz Fire on a mixed broadleaf-conifer forest and associated bird
   community in southwestern Oregon, USA, over 10 yr. To assess whether
   fire severity explained changes better than simply whether an area was
   burned, we used a tiered sampling approach by comparing unburned control
   points with either all burned points combined (burned) or those same
   points partitioned by severity level (low, moderate, high). As expected,
   overall tree cover decreased while cover of shrubs increased in response
   to greater fire severity. This pattern was most pronounced in
   high-severity areas, where tree cover declined by 40\% and remained
   depressed, but shrub cover recovered from 10\% the year following fire
   to 75\% by year 6. Ordinations of bird species density showed turnover
   in community composition in all burned areas combined, as well as in
   moderate-severity areas, shifting to a shrub-associated community 9 yr
   postfire. For individual species, annual density variations were best
   explained by fire for 14 of 37 species, with fire severity providing the
   best-fitting model for 7 species. Of those 7 species, 3 declined and 4
   increased with greater severity. When grouped into guilds, flycatching
   foragers and shrub nesters increased with greater fire severity. Our
   results illustrate the importance of mixed-severity wildfire in creating
   diverse vegetation structure and composition that supports distinct bird
   communities for at least a decade following fire.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of factors influencing animal abundance is important to
   wildlife biologists developing management plans. This is especially true
   for economically important species such as blackbirds (Icteridae), which
   cause more than \$100 million in crop damages annually in the United
   States. Using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, the
   National Land Cover Dataset, and the National Climatic Data Center, we
   modeled effects of regional environmental variables on relative
   abundance of 3 blackbird species (red-winged blackbird, Agelaius
   phoeniceus; yellow-headed blackbird, Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus;
   common grackle, Quiscalus quiscula) in the Prairie Pothole Region of the
   central United States. We evaluated landscape covariates at 3
   logarithmically related spatial scales (1,000ha, 10,000ha, and
   100,000ha) and modeled weather variables at the 100,000-ha scale. We
   constructed models a priori using information from published habitat
   associations. We fit models with WinBUGS using Markov chain Monte Carlo
   techniques. Both landscape and weather variables contributed strongly to
   predicting blackbird relative abundance (95\% credibility interval did
   not overlap 0). Variables with the strongest associations with blackbird
   relative abundance were the percentage of wetland area and precipitation
   amount from the year before bird surveys were conducted. The influence
   of spatial scale appeared smallmodels with the same variables expressed
   at different scales were often in the best model subset. This
   large-scale study elucidated regional effects of weather and landscape
   variables, suggesting that management strategies aimed at reducing
   damages caused by these species should consider the broader landscape,
   including weather effects, because such factors may outweigh the
   influence of localized conditions or site-specific management actions.
   The regional species distributional models we developed for blackbirds
   provide a tool for understanding these broader landscape effects and
   guiding wildlife management practices to areas that are optimally
   beneficial. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and

Abstract = {{Species distribution models should identify ecological requirements of
   species and predict their spatial density. However, data from remote
   sensing sources are often used alone as predictors in modelling
   distributions. Such data will only produce accurate models if features
   that are distinguishable by remote sensing are a good match to the
   environmental traits that delineate habitat requirements. Both the
   Goldcrest Regulus regulus and the Firecrest Regulus ignicapilla respond
   to complex features of habitats that are not described by simple remote
   sensing data. We tested the usefulness of remote sensing data as a
   predictor for two Regulus species according to data from 970 study plots
   sized 1 x 1 km. Predictors were aggregated using the PCAs and related to
   the Hayne estimator of species density using GAMs. The models based on
   both remote sensing data and detailed environmental data proved to be
   better than the model based only on remote sensing data and/or detailed
   forest structure data. The Goldcrest reached the highest density in
   areas with a high share of old spruce-dominated forests with a
   substantial share of the fir, avoiding the pine, and it preferred
   forests with a low number of tree species. In turn, the Firecrest
   favoured old forests, dominated by the spruce and the beech, with an
   admixture of single old fir and larch trees, avoiding the pine, and
   preferring forests with a high number of tree species. We suggest using
   not only free data sources, but also more detailed data containing
   thorough information on forest inventory derived from ground
   measurements.}},

   rates in Black-tailed Godwits Limosa limosa}},
Journal = {{IBIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{157}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{614-625}},

Abstract = {{Effective conservation of endangered species requires a solid
   understanding of the demographic causes of population change. Bird
   populations breeding on agricultural grasslands have declined because
   their preferred habitat of herb-rich meadows has been replaced by
   grassland monocultures. The timing of agricultural activities in these
   monocultural grasslands is critical, as they often coincide with the
   nesting phase of breeding birds. Here, we aim to identify the effect of
   habitat management and targeted nest protection on nest survival of
   Black-tailed Godwits Limosa limosa in the Netherlands, a population that
   has shown a 70\% reduction in breeding population size since the 1970s.
   To protect nests in monocultures from destruction, farmers are paid to
   either delay mowing or leave a patch of unmown grass around the nest, a
   patch which in practice varied in size. In herb-rich meadows, which are
   typically managed for bird conservation purposes, mowing occurs after
   hatching. Nest survival declined as the season advanced, more steeply on
   monocultures than on meadows. Targeted nest protection was only
   partially successful, as nest predation was considerably higher on mown
   grassland monocultures with small unmown patches around the nest than in
   mown monocultures with large unmown patches and in unmown fields.
   Increased predator densities over the years have been suggested as an
   important cause of the trend towards lower nest survival, but here we
   show that nest survival was higher on herb-rich meadows than on
   monocultures, and similar to the 1980s. It thus seems that increased
   predator densities are an increased threat during the egg stage only if
   habitat quality is low. High-quality habitat in the form of herb-rich
   meadows therefore provides a degree of protection against predators.}},

Volume = {{156}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater wetlands and marshes with extensive reed beds are important
   hotspots of biological diversity, but in the absence of proper
   management, they are subject to biotic homogenisation. We assessed the
   impact of spatiotemporally variable management by cattle grazing (for 4
   years) and late-summer burning (1 or 3 years before the study) on both
   songbirds and non-passerines in a previously homogeneous reed bed. We
   surveyed birds using a combination of line transects and point counts in
   a quasi-experimental design comprising six treatment levels. Management
   increased both the diversity of marsh habitats and the diversity of bird
   species. The species richness and abundance of non-passerines (ducks and
   geese, wading birds, gulls and terns, rails, coots and grebes) was
   higher in recently burned than in unburned or old-burned patches.
   Species richness of farmland songbirds was higher in grazed than in
   non-grazed patches, and the richness and abundance of reed songbirds was
   higher in unburned, old-burned, and grazed patches than in recently
   burned patches. Total Shannon diversity and evenness of birds was lowest
   in areas with the most intensive treatment (patches grazed and
   twice-burned), whereas Simpson diversity was highest in these areas.
   Non-managed patches had fewer species and individuals of all groups
   except reed songbirds. The proportion of old reed was low in recently
   burned and grazed patches, and was similarly high in all other treatment
   areas. No other property of reed stands was influenced by management,
   and both the allocation and the effect of management were independent of
   water level. Spatiotemporally variable management by cattle grazing and
   late-summer burning may thus simultaneously benefit several groups of
   birds. The effect of burning alone disappeared in 3 years, even in the
   presence of grazing; thus it must be repeated every 2-3 years. We
   conclude that both management actions are necessary to establish and
   maintain highly diverse habitats for marshland bird communities.}},

Abstract = {{Outbreaks by geometrid moths periodically cause mass mortality of trees
   and state changes in understorey vegetation in sub-arctic mountain birch
   forest in northern Scandinavia. In order to assess the short-term
   impacts of such disturbance on forest bird communities, we took bird
   censuses in forest where almost all birch trees had been killed by moth
   outbreaks 2-4 years before the study and in undamaged forest. The study
   was repeated in two locations (Kirkenes and Tana) with contrasting
   forest structure and fragmentation. Using a hierarchical community
   model, we show that the total abundance of birds in Kirkenes was only
   about 25 \% lower in damaged than undamaged forest and that species
   richness differed even less between the two forest types. Meanwhile,
   neither bird abundance nor species richness differed between damaged and
   undamaged forest in Tana. The observed patterns in abundance were mainly
   driven by a few very common species. Only a single species showed
   indication of being more abundant in damaged forest. Thus, our findings
   indicate that bird communities in sub-arctic mountain birch forest have
   a high degree of resistance to forest damage caused by moth outbreaks.
   We suggest that bird populations in outbreak-affected forest may be
   maintained by surviving trees and by standing dead tree trunks, which
   help maintain the vertical structure of the forest habitat. The fact
   that many of the studied bird species are habitat generalists may also
   explain their apparently weak responses to the damage caused by the
   outbreak. Our results do not point towards forest damage caused by moth
   outbreaks as a major driver of change in bird communities in the study
   system, although more long-term research is needed to substantiate this
   conclusion.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Traditional water supply systems in semi-arid agrarian ecosystems,
   mainly irrigation canals, contribute to the diversity of the landscape
   and influence the composition of species. To evaluate their effect on
   bird communities in the breeding season, we selected a rural area in
   southeastern Spain, where an intricate and extensive network of
   irrigation canals and cultivated areas is located between two wetlands
   declared as Natural Parks. Birds were counted at representative points
   distributed throughout the canal network at which we recorded several
   variables related to the physical features, the vertical and horizontal
   structure of associated vegetation, reed development (Phragmites
   australis) and land use in the neighboring areas. We detected 37 bird
   species, most of which were also breeding in the wetlands nearby. We
   used Hierarchical Partitioning analyses to identify the variables most
   strongly related to the probability of the presence of selected species
   and species richness. Vegetation cover and height close to the canals,
   together with reed development, were the most important types of
   variables explaining species presence and richness. We found that
   current management practices for reeds in canals are not well-suited for
   biodiversity conservation. We therefore propose alternatives that could
   be implemented in the area in cooperation with stakeholders. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is an often-used tool for managing or manipulating
   wildlife habitats. However, studies on the effects of prescribed fire on
   conservation-priority songbirds are limited. We examined effects of
   low-intensity prescribed burns on vegetation structure and composition,
   and on habitat use of 45 radiotagged male Swainson's warblers
   (Limnothlypis swainsonii) during the 2008 and 2009 breeding seasons in
   the St. Francis National Forest in eastern Arkansas, USA. We found that
   home ranges in areas with extensive burning (>50\% burned) were
   significantly larger ((x) over bar =14.4 ha, SE=3.5, n=13) than home
   ranges in areas with partial burning (<50\% burned; <(x)over bar>=6.1
   ha, SE=1.3, n=5) and unburned home ranges ((x) over bar =8.5 ha, SE=1.1,
   n=27). Burning decreased understory vegetation density, leaf-litter
   depth, and cover, but had no effect on density of woody stems, including
   giant cane (Arundinaria gigantean; a native bamboo that is thought to
   benefit from fire). Swainson's warblers did not completely avoid burned
   regions of their home ranges, but individuals selected dense understory
   habitats in burned and unburned areas, and burning appeared to intensify
   selection for areas with less-variable litter depth. Low-intensity
   burning appeared to have minimal impacts on Swainson's warbler habitat
   use, but did result in increased home-range size, possibly to compensate
   for burn-impacted habitat patches and to enable warblers to acquire
   adequate food resources. Based on our findings, we suggest that
   high-intensity fires or frequent burning could have significant negative
   impacts on Swainson's warbler habitat. Also, prescribed burning alone
   was not sufficient to restore remnant populations of cane or a dense
   understory. We suggest management involving canopy openings in
   combination with low-intensity fire may more likely promote the
   development of dense understory habitat, including giant cane preferred
   by Swainson's warblers and other understory-dependent birds. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The South African grassland system is home to over 3,300 plant species,
   15 of the country's 34 endemic mammal species, 12 of the 40 endemic bird
   species (four of which are globally threatened) and five RAMSAR wetland
   sites. To assess and address the ecological integrity of farmed
   grasslands we used process-oriented techniques, including nesting
   success and field metabolic rates (FMR) of birds, and an adaptation of
   the multi-taxon biodiversity intactness index (BII) using plant,
   arthropod and bird diversity data which is a comprehensive tool for
   assessing ecological integrity using multiple taxonomic groups. Current
   pastoral management practices have a significant detrimental effect on
   avian abundance, species richness, nest density and fledgling output.
   Overall energy turnover and BII values confirm the importance of
   conserved areas for birds in moist highland grassland systems and
   support the need for further conservation efforts in grassland systems
   by both private landowners and reserve managers. Findings based on both
   avian FMRs and the BII in this study were found to be comparable,
   lending support to the use of FMR as a rapid assessment technique for
   assessing ecosystem integrity for future studies of this nature.
   Scenarios of potential biodiversity improvement with changes in fire
   management regimes are also presented.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{186}},
Pages = {{233-240}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Changes in land use and land cover throughout the eastern half of North
   America have caused substantial declines in populations of birds that
   rely on grassland and shrubland vegetation types, including socially and
   economically important game birds such as the Northern Bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus; hereafter bobwhites). As much attention is focused on
   habitat management and restoration for bobwhites, they may act as an
   umbrella species for other bird species with similar habitat
   requirements. We quantified the relationship of bobwhites to the overall
   bird community and evaluated the potential for bobwhites to act as an
   umbrella species for grassland and shrubland birds. We monitored
   bobwhite presence and bird community composition within 31 sample units
   on selected private lands in the south-central United States from 2009
   to 2011. Bobwhites were strongly associated with other grassland and
   shrubland birds and were a significant positive predictor for 9 species.
   Seven of these, including Bell's Vireo (Vireo bell), Dicksissel (Spiza
   americana), and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), are listed
   as species of conservation concern. Species richness and occupancy
   probability of grassland and shrubland birds were higher relative to the
   overall bird community in sample units occupied by bobwhites. Our
   results show that bobwhites can act as an umbrella species for grassland
   and shrubland birds, although the specific species in any given
   situation will depend on region and management objectives. These results
   suggest that efficiency in conservation funding can be increased by
   using public interest in popular game species to leverage resources to
   meet multiple conservation objectives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of different intensities of forest management

   Stands managed for more than 100 years (cutting, planting, removal of
   dead wood) and stands that were partially protected in nature reserves
   (sporadic sanitary cutting, removal of dead wood until 2008) were
   compared with unmanaged stands in the Bialowieza National Park by
   surveying the bird community during three breeding seasons (2010-2012).
   Surveys were conducted within three forest habitats: spruce-pine
   (Pino-Quercetum), lime-hornbeam (Tilio-Carpinetum) and ash-alder
   (Fraxino-Alnetum). Results showed that habitat structure significantly
   affected the avian community. The basal area of live trees had a
   positive effect on abundance of birds, while the density of live trees
   had negative significant effect on bird abundance and species diversity.
   We also found significantly lower abundance of insectivorous birds and
   cavity-nesters in managed compared with unmanaged stands. Birds'
   assembly in the spruce-pine and ash-alder stands were most sensitive to
   management. These results show that management can be used to sustain

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that landscape-level changes, namely habitat
   loss and fragmentation, can play an important role in determining the
   distribution of species across a variety of ecological systems. However,
   the influence of these large-scale factors in relation to small-scale
   factors, such as local vegetation structure or composition, is poorly
   understood. We used Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) as a
   surrogate species to measure the relative importance of local vegetation
   and large-scale habitat distribution in the Onslow Bight region of North
   Carolina, USA. We conducted repeated point counts at 232 points within
   111 habitat patches between April 10 and July 20, 2011. We then fit a
   series of single-season occupancy models, including both local and
   landscape-level predictors, to identify those that best explained the
   distribution of Bachman's Sparrows. We documented a strong response to
   vegetation characteristics best maintained via prescribed fire, but the
   most influential predictor of Bachman's Sparrow occupancy was the amount
   of habitat within 3 km. Specifically, the probability of Bachman's
   Sparrow occurrence was close to zero in landscapes comprised of <10\%
   habitat, regardless of local vegetation conditions. Our results
   illustrate the strong influence of habitat loss on Bachman's Sparrow and
   likely on other members of this community, many of which are of high
   conservation concern.}},

Abstract = {{Dramatic fluctuations in food resources are a key feature of many
   habitats, and many species have evolved a movement strategy to exploit
   food resources that are unpredictable in space and time. The
   availability of food resources may be a particularly strong determinant
   of habitat quality for irruptive bird species. We studied the apparent
   foraging success of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), an
   irruptive species that responds opportunistically to pulsed food
   resources in burned forests and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations.
   Prior investigations revealed that the highest population growth rates
   of Black-backed Woodpeckers occurred in habitat created by summer
   wildfire, with intermediate population growth rates in MPB infestations,
   and the lowest population growth rates in habitats created by prescribed
   fire in fall. We tested whether apparent foraging success was associated
   with known habitat quality in order to assess the potential for food
   availability to regulate population growth. We counted the number of
   successfully captured wood-boring beetle larvae and ``small'' prey on
   each tree that a Black-backed Woodpecker used for foraging and modeled
   these counts as a function of habitat, tree diameter, number of years
   postfire, and tree disturbance category. Total apparent foraging success
   (the sum of observed captures of wood-boring beetle larvae and small
   prey per tree) did not vary across habitats, but woodpeckers foraging in
   habitats created by summer wildfire were expected to capture 2.2 and 2.0
   times more wood-boring beetles than woodpeckers foraging in habitats
   created by fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations, respectively.
   These results suggest that the availability of food resources may
   contribute to population regulation in this irruptive species.
   Furthermore, population growth in irruptive species may be highly
   sensitive to the availability of preferred food resources. Forests
   recently burned by summer wildfires provide relatively abundant food
   resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers and represent high-quality
   habitat for this species of conservation concern.}},

Abstract = {{By focusing on process-oriented data rather than inventory-type data,
   this study provides a robust understanding of the effects of
   agricultural management on grassland bird reproductive output in the
   moist highland grasslands (MHGs) of South Africa. Four-hundred and four
   nests of 12 grassland-breeding bird species were monitored in five
   different land-use types. Survivorship was modelled using Program MARK
   to assess the effects of these management practices on reproductive
   performance. Six of the species were modelled individually to assess
   speciesspecific responses. Both nest-site selection and nest success
   were driven by vegetation structure, which in turn is driven by habitat
   management. There was an increase in nesting success through the season
   for cup (ground) nesting birds as vegetation structural complexity
   increased through the breeding season (September to March). Nest success
   was driven by predation pressure rather than food availability. Analysis
   of the nesting success of the Yellow-breasted Pipit Anthus chloris
   indicated that unconserved areas house sink populations, confirmation of
   which would depend on a measure of adult survival. The generalist
   African Pipit Anthus cinnamomeus, on the other hand, thrived in
   disturbed, communally grazed lands. To conserve MHG bird species,
   managers should maintain a mosaic of burning regimes, with the majority
   burning biennially or less frequently.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of bird numbers through quantification of density and range
   sizes are necessary for decisions regarding conservation status, yet
   counts of birds are often confounded by uncertainty of detection. The
   status of the endemic birds of the Fynbos biome is of interest due to
   their conservation value in a global biodiversity hotspot, the
   ecological services they provide, and their importance for the
   avitourism industry. We conducted an extensive repeated point-count
   survey across the Fynbos biome, South Africa, to determine probability
   of detection and covariates of site occupancy for 27 bird species.
   Detection of most species was influenced by time of day, temperature or
   vegetation height. Important covariates influencing site occupancy were
   vegetation height, altitude, time since fire and habitat type. Site
   occupancy for four fynbos-endemic species was positively associated with
   increasing altitude. We further conducted point counts and mist-netting
   in eastern regions of the Fynbos biome to calculate local density and
   standardised capture rates. A linear regression analysis showed that
   capture rates were a function of bird densities, but that several
   species were captured at higher rates than expected, notably
   nectarivorous species. During mist-netting a relative abundance count
   was conducted. We expected deviation of the fit of the regression of
   capture rates on relative abundance to correlate with detection
   probability, because we expect this index to underestimate skulking and
   cryptic species, but there was no correlation. Estimated species
   richness indices were highest for the biome-wide survey, and lowest for
   mist-netting due to the body size limit imposed by the capture
   technique. Overall, we showed that point counts are an effective method
   for surveying birds in the fynbos and that mist-netting can be used to
   create an index of relative abundance for smaller species, but can be
   significantly affected by net placement.}},

Journal = {{PLoS One}},

Abstract = {{Whether by design or default, single species management often serves as
   an umbrella for species with similar habitat requirements. In recent
   decades the focus of National Forest management in the Sierra Nevada of
   California has shifted towards increasing closed canopy mature forest
   conditions through the protection of areas occupied by the California
   Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). To evaluate the
   implications of these habitat changes and the potential umbrella
   resulting from a system of owl reserves on the broader avian community,
   we estimated occupancy of birds inside and outside of Spotted Owl Home
   Range Core Areas in northeastern California. We used point count data in
   a multi-species hierarchical Bayesian model incorporating the detection
   history of 81 species over a two-year time period (2005-2006). A small
   set of vegetation cover and topography covariates were included in the
   model to account for broad differences in habitat conditions, as well as
   a term identifying whether or not a site was within a Core Area.
   Seventeen species had a negative Core Area effect, seven had a positive
   effect, and the rest were not significant. Estimated species richness
   was significantly different with 23.1 species per 100 m radius circle
   outside Core Areas and 21.7 inside Core Areas. The majority of the
   species negatively associated with Core Areas are tied to early
   successional and other disturbance-dependent habitats. Conservation and
   climate vulnerability rankings were mixed. On average we found higher
   scores (greater risk) for the species positively associated with Core
   Areas, but a larger number of species with the highest scores were
   negatively associated with Core Areas. We discuss the implications for
   managing the Sierra Nevada ecosystem and illustrate the role of
   monitoring broader suites of species in guiding management of large
   complex ecosystems.}},

Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{Currently, land abandonment constitutes a serious threat for many
   species tied to semi-natural grasslands. In southern Europe, the
   conservation of many grassland bird communities largely depends on
   low-intensity mountain farming. In this study, we analysed the effects
   of the main farming practices promoting grassland maintenance, i.e.
   grazing and mowing, on species richness of a Prealpine grassland bird
   community and on the breeding densities of the two commonest grassland
   species, the skylark (Alauda arvensis Linnaeus, 1758) and the tree pipit
   (Anthus trivialis Linnaeus, 1758). The two study sites were located
   between 1100 and 2000m above sea level in the Italian central Prealps.
   Grassland species richness was positively affected by grazing, and
   increased with increasing distance from the nearest woodland. Skylark
   density was positively influenced by mowing, grassland cover extent and
   distance from woodland, with the latter effect occurring only at a
   single study site. Finally, tree pipit density was positively affected
   by grazing. Our findings suggest that, in order to maintain open
   grasslands below the natural treeline and enhance the biodiversity of
   grassland bird communities, grazing should be preferred over mowing.
   Moreover, woodland edge effects may have a negative impact on mountain
   grassland bird communities. Advancing woodlands and abandonment of
   low-intensity farming and grazing practices may therefore constitute a
   serious threat for open-habitat specialist bird species of the Alpine
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is used as a management tool for biodiversity conservation
   worldwide. A common objective is to avoid population extinctions due to
   inappropriate fire regimes. However, in many ecosystems, it is unclear
   what mix of fire histories will achieve this goal. We determined the
   optimal fire history of a given area for biological conservation with a
   method that links tools from 3 fields of research: species distribution
   modeling, composite indices of biodiversity, and decision science. We
   based our case study on extensive field surveys of birds, reptiles, and
   mammals in fire-prone semi-arid Australia. First, we developed
   statistical models of species' responses to fire history. Second, we
   determined the optimal allocation of successional states in a given
   area, based on the geometric mean of species relative abundance.
   Finally, we showed how conservation targets based on this index can be
   incorporated into a decision-making framework for fire management.
   Pyrodiversity per se did not necessarily promote vertebrate
   biodiversity. Maximizing pyrodiversity by having an even allocation of
   successional states did not maximize the geometric mean abundance of
   bird species. Older vegetation was disproportionately important for the
   conservation of birds, reptiles, and small mammals. Because our method
   defines fire management objectives based on the habitat requirements of
   multiple species in the community, it could be used widely to maximize
   biodiversity in fire-prone ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Single large versus several small: The SLOSS debate in the context of
   bird responses to a variable retention logging experiment}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{339}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The Variable Retention Harvest System (VRHS) is a silvicultural system
   designed to reduce logging impacts and enhance biodiversity
   conservation. VRHS has been widely applied worldwide but several
   important questions remain about its effectiveness for biodiversity
   conservation. A key issue is whether dispersed or aggregated retention
   is more effective for conservation, and hence what size of retained
   patches of forest should be maintained within logged areas. Many studies
   have indicated that increasing the amount of the original stand retained
   during harvesting increases the amount of biodiversity conserved. But in
   a form of the SLOSS (single large or several small areas for
   conservation) debate, a critical question is: does one large retained
   island better conserve forest biota than several small islands of the
   same aggregated area? We addressed this question in an experiment in the
   Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of
   Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The experiment comprised seven
   blocks, each with four treatments - an unlogged control, a conventional
   15-40 ha clearfelled area, a 15-40 ha harvest unit with a single 1.5 ha
   retained ``island{''}, and a 15-40 ha harvest unit with three 0.5 ha
   islands. A subset of the treatment plots and harvest units in our
   experiment were burned in a major wildfire in 2009. Given this, a
   subsequent further question we posed was: are there additional effects
   on birds resulting from logging operations that were followed by
   wildfires.
   We identified a significant gradient in species richness across
   treatments with lowest values in conventional clearfelled areas and
   highest values in unlogged controls. Unexpectedly, we identified no
   significant island size effects on bird species richness. We found no
   individual species that were significantly more likely to occur in a
   single large island than several small islands. Nonmetric
   multidimensional scaling revealed significant differences in the
   composition of the bird community between treatments, consistent with
   our findings for some of the more common species of birds. Several
   species were significantly less likely to be recorded in clearfelled
   areas, although the Flame Robin was more likely to be recorded in them.
   When we removed clearfelled areas from our analyses, some species were
   significantly less likely to occur in retained islands than unlogged
   controls. The application of VRHS did not appear to mediate bird
   responses to wildfire relative to effects for birds observed in
   clearfelled harvest units that were subsequently burned in 2009.
   Our results suggest that VRHS has positive effects on bird biota in
   Mountain Ash forests. However, this study found no advantage of setting
   aside a single large island versus several small islands within a given
   harvest unit for bird species richness nor the occurrence of individual
   bird species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-scale vegetation cover is a common variable used to explain animal
   occurrence, but we know less about the effects of fine-scale vegetation
   heterogeneity. Theoretically, fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity is an
   important driver of biodiversity because it captures the range of
   resources available in a given area. In this study we investigated how
   bird species richness and birds grouped by various ecological traits
   responded to vegetation cover and heterogeneity. We found that both
   fine-scale vegetation cover (of tall trees, medium-sized trees and
   shrubs) and heterogeneity (of tall trees, and shrubs) were important
   predictors of bird richness, but the direction of the response of bird
   richness to shrub heterogeneity differed between sites with different
   proportions of tall tree cover. For example, bird richness increased
   with shrub heterogeneity in sites with high levels of tall tree cover,
   but declined in sites with low levels of tall tree cover. Our findings
   indicated that an increase in vegetation heterogeneity will not always
   result in an increase in resources and niches, and associated higher
   species richness. We also found birds grouped by traits responded in a
   predictable way to vegetation heterogeneity. For example, we found small
   birds benefited from increased shrub heterogeneity supporting the
   textual discontinuity hypothesis and non-arboreal (ground or shrub)
   nesting species were associated with high vegetation cover (low
   heterogeneity). Our results indicated that focusing solely on increasing
   vegetation cover (e.g. through restoration) may be detrimental to
   particular animal groups. Findings from this investigation can help
   guide habitat management for different functional groups of birds.}},

Abstract = {{Tidal freshwater forested wetlands are dynamic, complex ecosystems that
   typically occur in large, floodplain river estuaries throughout the
   world. The estuarine portion of the Columbia River, in the Pacific
   Northwest region of North America, is exceptionally large and extends
   from the Pacific Ocean to the head of tide at Bonneville Dam, located at
   river kilometer (RKm) 233. Our study focused on the freshwater portion
   of the estuarine gradient (RKm 40 to RKm 233) of the Columbia River
   estuary and the corresponding continuum of hydrologic regimes and biotic
   communities. Several diverse forested wetland community types occurred
   along this freshwater estuarine gradient with major shifts in community
   composition corresponding to the transition from predominantly tidal to
   predominantly fluvial hydrologic regimes. We quantitatively
   characterized the floristic structure, species composition, and species
   richness of these tidal wetlands. Additionally, we documented variation
   in the avifaunal and insect assemblages associated with the floral
   structure. We found that freshwater tidal forested wetlands in the lower
   reaches of the estuary were characterized by high vegetation species
   richness and complex forest and scrub-shrub ecosystems, while tidal
   wetlands in the upper reaches of the estuary displayed a greater
   diversity of wetland ecosystems (forested, scrub-shrub, emergent, and
   aquatic bed) but comparatively lower species richness. A transitional
   area in the mid-estuary contained forested wetlands that exhibited some
   similarities to estuarine forested wetlands in both the upper and lower
   reaches. Likewise, avifauna and insect assemblage composition
   transitioned along the tidal freshwater estuarine gradient. Differences
   in geomorphological and hydrological regimes along the estuarine
   gradient appear to be the factors controlling the variation in tidal
   freshwater forested wetland characteristics and species composition. A
   thorough understanding of this complex and understudied system is
   necessary for predicting the potential impacts of hydrologic regime
   alterations and climate change and for guiding ongoing restoration
   efforts in the region.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{We used publically available data on duck breeding distribution and
   recently compiled geospatial data on upland habitat and environmental
   conditions to develop a spatially explicit model of breeding duck
   populations across the entire Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). Our spatial
   population models were able to identify key areas for duck conservation
   across the PPR and predict between 62.1 - 79.1\% (68.4\% avg.) of the
   variation in duck counts by year from 2002 - 2010. The median difference
   in observed vs. predicted duck counts at a transect segment level was
   4.6 ducks. Our models are the first seamless spatially explicit models
   of waterfowl abundance across the entire PPR and represent an initial
   step toward joint conservation planning between Prairie Pothole and
   Prairie Habitat Joint Ventures. Our work demonstrates that when spatial
   and temporal variation for highly mobile birds is incorporated into
   conservation planning it will likely increase the habitat area required
   to support defined population goals. A major goal of the current North
   American Waterfowl Management Plan and subsequent action plan is the
   linking of harvest and habitat management. We contend incorporation of
   spatial aspects will increase the likelihood of coherent joint harvest
   and habitat management decisions. Our results show at a minimum, it is
   possible to produce spatially explicit waterfowl abundance models that
   when summed across survey strata will produce similar strata level
   population estimates as the design-based Waterfowl Breeding Pair and
   Habitat Survey (r(2) = 0.977). This is important because these
   design-based population estimates are currently used to set duck harvest
   regulations and to set duck population and habitat goals for the North
   American Waterfowl Management Plan. We hope this effort generates
   discussion on the important linkages between spatial and temporal
   variation in population size, and distribution relative to habitat
   quantity and quality when linking habitat and population goals across
   this important region.}},

   modeled after natural disturbances. We assessed convergence of birds,
   plants, and habitat structures in aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands
   harvested with structural retention by Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries
   Inc. (Al-Pac) 15 years ago with similar aged fire area, and examined a
   chronosequence of younger and older burned aspen stands from Alberta
   Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) sites. Most habitat structures
   and many bird and plant species in the 15 year harvest areas were at
   levels similar to 20-40 year or >40 year fire areas. Snags, moss, and
   lichen cover, and a few groups of species were at lower levels in the
   harvest areas than comparable aged fire areas or older stands.
   Agglomerative clustering showed the plant community to be most similar
   to >40 year burned stands, with the bird community intermediate between
   >20 year and <20 year fire areas. A novel likelihood-based analysis of
   species estimated the 15 year harvest areas to have a community similar
   to forest sites with 36.8\% human footprint, indicating substantial
   recovery of the harvest areas. Harvesting aspen stands with structural
   retention appears to be effective at allowing most biodiversity
   components to recover rapidly.}},

   one-third of river sections in the drainages studied. Simultaneously,
   large amounts of gravel, clay and woody debris were removed from river
   channels, and river channels became overgrown by dense vegetation.
   Regulation works carried out in river channels, previously restored by
   severe flood, led to a strong decline in breeding bird assemblages (23\%
   decrease of species richness and 33\% decrease of population abundance).
   These results show that river regulation can significantly alter the
   structure of breeding bird assemblages, and such change is generally
   negative for bird diversity (especially for rare and vulnerable
   species). Riverine habitats are some of the most important biodiversity
   hotspots and major routes of migration for organisms in Europe, so the
   degradation of riverine ecosystems can have a catastrophic impact on
   nature in the entire European Union.}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean basin exhibits a multitude of forest habitats affected
   by former and current exploitation and management. Recent afforestation
   programs have resulted in an increase in the proportion of coniferous
   trees, while oak stands, formerly utilized for coppicing and grazing,
   are abandoned or converted into coniferous plantations. The loss of oak
   stands might negatively affect birds dependent upon broadleaved forests.
   Studies confirming or rejecting that statement are scarce, particularly
   in the eastern part of the region. Using a study area in southwestern
   Turkey we applied a guild-based approach to investigate how pine and oak
   stands across a chronosequence differ in their capacity to support
   forest bird assemblages. Variables describing the vegetation were
   sampled to characterize the stands and relate bird assemblages to stand
   structure. Bird abundance and species richness was positively associated
   with age for both stand types. Richness and diversity was highest in oak
   stands, while there were no differences in bird abundance between the
   two forest types. Pine stands supported a different bird species
   composition compared to oak stands of the same age. Stand age and
   structure, rather than forest type, held the highest explanatory powers
   for bird assembly structure. Primary cavity-nesters and ground-nesters
   were more abundant in oak stands, possibly reflecting differences in
   stand structure and resource distribution. To support these birds with
   suitable habitats, oaks stands need conservation. Management practices
   in pine stands should strive for increasing the amount of old trees and
   retain vegetation in the understory to benefit breeding birds. (C) 2014

   Eucalyptus plantations}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{336}},
Pages = {{174-182}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Managing for wildlife in human-dominated matrices outside natural
   reserves has great importance to improve the efficacy of conservation
   efforts aiming to protect and restore biodiversity. As such, it is
   critical to understand which features of the matrix enhance habitat
   suitability to the remaining species and also to evaluate species
   responses to alternative management practices. We used hierarchical
   modeling to estimate the effect of stand level management practices
   adopted in Eucalyptus plantations on site occupancy by birds while
   accounting for species detection failure. Our models incorporated
   site-specific traits, such as management practice type and landscape
   attributes of each sampling unit. They also incorporate species-specific
   traits, particularly main foraging stratum. The major factor associated
   with differences in site occupancy by birds within our study site is the
   management practice type. Scattered native trees and early successional
   stage understory within mature stands were associated with an increase
   in the proportion of bird species from the regional pool that was able
   to occupy the silvicultural matrix. Landscape attributes had a
   relatively minor effect on site occupancy in our study area. We
   concluded that site occupancy by birds is positively associated with
   increasing spatial complexity within Eucalyptus stands, with species
   responding to the retention of native scattered trees and understory
   presence. Forestry managers interested in improving the conservation
   value for birds of Eucalyptus plantations in tropical areas should
   maintain existing native trees and adopt practices that trigger
   understory regeneration during site preparation and stand rotation. (C)

   ponds: the importance of the hydroperiod}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{416}},
Abstract = {{We examined correlates of amphibian and waterbird diversity related to
   management practices, with a focus on timing of flooding, at shallow
   ponds used for common carp Cyprinus carpio culture in Eastern Poland.
   The age of the stocked fish was a strong predictor of amphibian
   diversity, with higher scores obtained in ponds with young-of-the-year
   carp compared to ponds containing older (and larger) fish. Pond cover by
   emergent vegetation was positively related to diversity of both
   taxonomic groups. The timing of filling affected the taxonomic richness
   of the ponds; in contrast to ponds filled in early spring (March-early
   April), early breeding amphibian species were not recorded in ponds
   filled later (early May). However, amphibian diversity did not differ
   between earlyand late-flooded ponds. Early availability of filled ponds
   favored waterbird species richness and diversity, and the hydroperiod
   effect overcame the effect of fish age/size. Dissimilar responses to
   hydroperiod onset may reflect differences between amphibian and bird
   communities in the nature and strength of interactions with fish. Timing
   of flooding, which appears to be a neglected determinant of biodiversity
   in anthropogenic wetlands, should consider the breeding and migration
   phenology of wildlife species and the presence and population structure
   of fish.}},

Abstract = {{The Flooding Pampas is the most important livestock region of Argentina,
   but is a region where replacement of originally natural, perennial
   tussock grasses by pasture species is changing the heterogeneity of the
   grassland system. We evaluated the response of grassland bird
   assemblages of the Flooding Pampas to planting of Lotus tenuis (Lotus)
   pasture, which mainly modifies vegetation structure by reducing vertical
   heterogeneity. Species richness and abundance of birds were compared
   between fields of Lotus pasture and semi-natural grasslands. Avian
   species richness and abundance were both greater in semi-natural
   grassland than in Lotus pasture. When grouped by nesting habits
   (grassland specialists, generalists), species richness and abundance of
   grassland specialists was greater in semi-natural grassland, whereas
   richness and abundance of generalist species was greater in Lotus
   pasture. An indicator-species analysis showed that five grassland birds
   were closely linked to semi-natural grassland vegetation, with two of
   those species - Hudson's Canastero (Asthenes hudsoni) and Bay-capped
   Wren-Spinetail (Spartonoica maluroides) of conservation concern. 1 In
   contrast, generalist species, such as Southern Lapwings (Vanellus
   chilensis) and Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia), were associated with
   Lotus pasture. Planting of Lotus pasture has negative effects on species
   that naturally occur in tussock grassland. Grassland management methods,
   such as intercropping and rotational grazing, could help reconcile the
   effects of livestock production and the conservation grassland bird
   conservation in the Flooding Pampas.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2471}},
Pages = {{19-25}},
Abstract = {{A primary concern for human-wildlife interactions is the potential
   impacts resulting from wildlife (primarily birds) collisions with
   aircraft. The identification of species responsible for collisions with
   aircraft is necessary so that airport management can develop effective
   strategies to reduce strikes with those species. Of particular
   importance in developing such strategies is the identification of
   regional, seasonal, and temporal patterns in collisions with
   unidentified bird species that may limit the effectiveness of regional
   habitat management to reduce bird strikes. The authors analyzed 105,529
   U.S. civil aviation strike records from 1990 to 2012 in the FAA's
   National Wildlife Strike Database to examine patterns of collisions
   involving unidentified birds. Factors that affected identification were
   airport certification class, FAA region, mass of struck species, state
   species richness (if damage was reported), and interactive effects
   between the last four factors. Identification varied by region and
   declined with increasing species richness; this identification was
   greater for general aviation (GA) airports and the mass of struck
   species, especially when damage was reported. Species identification
   might be improved by increasing reporting efforts relative to species
   richness, especially by GA airport managers and operations staff, who
   may have a higher propensity of reporting bird strikes, and by
   collecting more field-based data on avian populations. The results can
   provide guidance for the development of airport management and personnel
   training.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration of birds around airports has significantly increased
   the occurrence of aeronautical accidents worldwide. One of the main
   techniques to modify the avian habitat in airports, and therefore exert
   controls over bird population density, is to regulate the height of
   surrounding grasslands. The objective of this work was to record the
   seasonal use of habitat by birds in an airfield in Argentina, and to
   evaluate the effect of grassland height in the abundance of different
   components of the avian community. A total of 44 sampling events were
   carried out between October 2005 and July 2011, comprising all seasons.
   Short grassland areas (<= 30 cm), registered 53 \% of the total bird
   abundance, and were consistently for all seasons the most utilized
   habitat by those species that registered the highest abundances (e.g.
   Milvago chimango and Vanellus chilensis) and that pose a highest risk to
   aerial operations. In general, the species Patagioenas picazuro, Zenaida
   auriculata, Myiopsitta monachus and Sturnus vulgaris also made
   preferential use of short grassland areas rather than tall grasslands.
   Maintaining grassland areas at heights > 30 cm, might be a successful
   habitat manipulation strategy and represent a tool to control birds in
   South American airports. In turn, this would be a relatively simple and
   economic management strategy.}},

Abstract = {{In grassland ecosystems livestock grazing is one of the main activities
   that modify habitat and which can lead to positive or negative effects
   on birds. In the Sierras Grandes of Cordoba, Argentina, livestock
   grazing began early in the 17th century, causing severe soil erosion. To
   restore the grasslands, livestock were excluded from a large area in
   1997. However, the impact of grazing exclusion on endemic birds is not
   clear. We evaluated the effect of grazing exclusion on density and
   habitat attributes of populations of Long-tailed Meadowlarks (Sturnella
   loyca obscura). The highest density was recorded in ungrazed sites.
   Fitted models explained up to 75\% of the variability in density of
   Long-tailed Meadowlarks. Litter depth, percentage of bare soil (with
   positive effects), soil compaction (estimated as impedance) and
   percentage of moss cover (with negative effects) were the most important
   variables explaining the variation in the estimated density of birds. We
   concluded that 11 years of grazing exclusion favoured Meadowlark
   populations, providing increased availability of resources, mainly those
   related to soil quality. Hence, we recommend promoting alternative
   management practices, such as reintroduction of large native herbivores
   where possible and livestock grazing at reduced stocking rates, to
   counterbalance the cost of soil loss and the benefit that large
   herbivores provide to the system.}},

Abstract = {{Saltmarshes of Spartina densiflora in south-eastern South America have
   been modified by anthropogenic activities, mainly production of
   livestock. We examined the effect of the intensity of cattle production
   on the structure of saltmarsh vegetation and the effect of these changes
   to vegetation on the richness, composition and size of the avian
   populations and the abundance of nests. The levels of cattle production
   were based on the combined intensity of prescribed burning and cattle
   grazing, classed as: (1) High grazing - High burning (HH), (2) Low
   grazing - Low burning (LL) and (3) No grazing - No burning (NN). Cattle
   production altered the vegetation structure of saltmarshes and
   indirectly modified the richness, composition and size of their avian
   populations and the abundance of nests. Saltmarshes with either LL or NN
   production levels were inhabited by tall grassland specialists and
   generalists and by species specialised to live in a mosaic of short and
   tall grassland patches. Conversely, saltmarshes with HH production
   levels were inhabited by short-grassland specialists. That avian species
   diversity does not differ between S. densiflora saltmarsh subject to low
   or no human impacts has several potential interpretations, which are
   discussed. These findings have implications for management of grasslands
   to maintain avian diversity.}},

Title = {{Birds, charcoal and cattle: Bird community responses to human activities
   in an oak forest landscape shaped by charcoal extraction}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{335}},
Pages = {{118-128}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Oak forests around the world have been widely used to obtain firewood
   and produce charcoal and like other habitats have been affected by the
   increasing development of livestock activities. Oak forests from western
   Mexico are one of the five priority habitats for the conservation of
   birds at a continental level and are the repository of the highest
   number of endemic bird species in this megadiverse country. We studied
   how charcoal extraction and the use of oak forest for cattle grazing
   affect bird communities. We focused our work on oak forest patches with
   four different management units that include three successional stages
   that occur after most of the trees have been removed for charcoal
   production and cattle-grazing is conducted, and mature oak forest
   patches with little wood extraction and no cattle-grazing. We used
   unlimited radius point counts to survey avian communities, and compared
   their richness, composition, density, structure and similarity among the
   different management units. We found that resident bird species, summer
   migrants and Neotropical migrant bird species used the four management
   units differently. Resident bird species used all habitat units
   similarly. Winter migrants as a group were present in the different
   management units, however while some species used habitats with cattle,
   other species used habitats with no cattle-grazing. Finally, summer
   migrants used habitat units with tall trees and high values of tree and
   shrub richness, and tended to avoid the early successional unit. Both
   charcoal extraction and cattle grazing worked in synergy decreasing the
   species richness and the equity of the bird communities. Management
   strategies should include active conservation of undisturbed oak forest
   areas because they play an essential role to-maintain resident bird
   species in the landscape. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term landscape-scale experiments allow for the detection of effects
   of silviculture on bird abundance. Manipulative studies allow for strong
   inference on effects and confirmation of patterns from observational
   studies. We estimated bird-territory density within forest stands
   (2.89-62ha) for 19 years of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project
   (MOFEP), a 100-year experiment designed to study the effects of even-age
   and uneven-age management on wildlife. We spot-mapped territories of 15
   species in 228 stands for 5 years before treatment and 14 years after
   treatment to assess the effects of stand-level silvicultural treatments
   (clearcut, select cut, thin, and no-harvest) applied within even-age,
   uneven-age, or no-harvest (control) management sites and year on avian
   territory density. We used 2 a priori contrasts to compare pre-treatment
   bird densities with densities during early (3-5 yr) and late (12-14 yr)
   post-treatment periods. The interaction of silvicultural treatment and
   year had significant effects on the densities of all 15 species.
   Densities of hooded warbler (Setophaga citrina), indigo bunting
   (Passerina cyanea), prairie warbler (Setophaga discolor), and
   yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) increased significantly 3-5 years
   post-treatment with the greatest changes in clearcuts, but densities
   12-14 years post-treatment did not differ from pre-treatment densities.
   Densities of Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), wood thrush
   (Hylocichla mustelina), and especially ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla)
   had significant decreases in clearcut stands after treatment and lesser
   decreases in select cut or thin stands post-treatment. Densities of
   black-and-white warbler (Mniotilta varia), eastern wood-pewee (Contopus
   virens), and Kentucky warbler (Geothlypis formosa) increased in
   clearcut, thin, and select cut stands, but these increases were
   short-lived and sporadic by year after treatment. Densities of Acadian
   flycatcher and ovenbird remained lower in clearcut stands than
   no-harvest stands 13 years post-treatment. The results of this
   manipulative experiment were mostly consistent with our predictions of
   bird response to common silvicultural treatments in these forests.
   Managers can use these species-specific responses to silvicultural
   treatment to guide management decisions for target species or to balance
   management practices in a landscape to meet the needs of multiple
   species. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.}},

Title = {{Estimating density of secretive terrestrial birds (Siamese Fireback) in
   pristine and degraded forest using camera traps and distance sampling}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Tropical Asian Galliformes are secretive and difficult to survey. Many
   of these species are considered ``at risk'' due to habitat degradation
   although reliable density estimates are lacking. Using camera trapping
   and distance sampling data collected on the Siamese Fireback (Lophura
   diardi) in northeastern Thailand, we compared density estimates for
   pristine and degraded lowland forest. Density was poorly estimated using
   distance sampling, likely due to small sample size arising from poor
   visibility in dense vegetation and bird's sensitivity to observers. We
   analysed camera trap data using both count-based and
   presence/absence-based methods. Those density estimates had narrower
   confidence intervals than those obtained using distance sampling.
   Estimated density was higher in dry evergreen forest (5.6 birds km(-2)),
   than in old forest plantations (0.2 birds km(-2)), perhaps because dense
   forest habitats provide Firebacks with more resources and refuge from
   predation. Our results suggest that camera trap data can be used for
   estimating density of cryptic terrestrial bird species inhabiting
   tropical forest that lack unique identification markings. However, this
   technique requires that the effective sampling area is known and thus
   requires knowledge of the animal home range size. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Ecological impacts of habitat change on woodpeckers remain largely
   unstudied in regions other than Europe and North America. The
   sub-Himalayan sal Shorea robusta forests of northwest India have 17
   woodpecker species, and a history of management-induced habitat
   modification. We studied how habitat parameters affect woodpeckers at a
   community level (viz. total abundance and species richness) as well as
   at individual species level. We assessed woodpecker abundance, species
   richness and described habitat features at 8 sites representing a
   gradient of structure and composition in a sal-dominated landscape. We
   surveyed each site in 2-km-long transects 20 times over breeding and
   non-breeding seasons and evaluated habitat characteristics in 10
   circular and belt plots. We analysed woodpecker abundance, species
   richness, and abundance of individual species as functions of habitat
   variables and season. Woodpecker encounter rates and mean species
   richness, respectively, ranged from 1.5 to 10.0 birds/km and 1.7 to 6.9
   species per survey at individual sites. Distance-based estimates of
   densities for the most frequently-observed species were also obtained.
   Basal area (large trees) and density of snags positively influenced
   total woodpecker abundance and species richness, with snags being more
   important during breeding season. Basal area was important for Greater
   Flameback Chrysocolaptes lucidus, Grey-faced Woodpecker Picus canus,
   Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker Dendrocopos macei and Lesser Yellownape
   Picus chlorolophus. Snags, tree density, tree diameter and termitarium
   density appeared to affect Grey-capped Pygmy Woodpecker Dendrocopos
   canicapillus, Black-rumped Flameback Dinopium benghalense, Himalayan
   Flameback Dinopium shorii and Streak-throated Woodpecker Picus
   xanthopygaeus. Hence, for the conservation of native woodpecker
   communities in sal forests, it is necessary to retain large trees and
   standing dead wood.}},

Title = {{Occurrence patterns of Black-backed Woodpeckers in green forest of the
   Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, USA.}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a rare habitat
   specialist typically found in moderate and high severity burned forest
   throughout its range. It also inhabits green forest but little is known
   about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas,
   especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count
   and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011
   -2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green
   forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since
   1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high
   severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used
   occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found
   positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects,
   number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest,
   and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green
   forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site
   colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05
   and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals
   detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the
   landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively
   stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole
   pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these
   elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next
   century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers
   significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in
   efforts to conserve this rare species.}},

Title = {{Interactions between ecological disturbances: burning and grazing and
   their effects on songbird communities in northern mixed-grass prairies}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Historically, North American prairies were strongly influenced by two
   natural disturbances, fire and grazing, and their interaction. However,
   the frequency and size of fires has been greatly altered over time,
   while native ungulates have been replaced by livestock; this may have
   had strong ecological influences on modern prairies. The feedback
   hypothesis proposes that grazing by ungulates will increase the duration
   of fire effects because ungulates will be attracted to burned patches.
   We conducted point-count surveys in burned-grazed, burned-ungrazed,
   unburned-grazed, and unburned-ungrazed sites over a 5-year period
   following fires that occurred naturally in 2006 in southern
   Saskatchewan, Canada, to test predictions related to avian community
   composition related to the feedback hypothesis. Generalized linear mixed
   models were used to analyze interactions among burning, grazing, and
   time since burning. Six of the nine avian species we studied responded
   positively or negatively to burning or grazing, although there were few
   statistically significant effects on the vegetation structure variables
   we measured. We found mixed evidence that grazing increased the duration
   of effects of burning, cumulatively providing little evidence for the
   feedback hypothesis. Nonetheless, effects of burning and grazing
   differed from and interacted with one another; for example, short-term
   effects of burning on Sprague's Pipits (Anthus spragueii) and Baird's
   Sparrows (Ammodramus bairdii) were greater than effects of grazing, and
   effects of grazing and burning in combination were frequently greater
   than effects of a single disturbance. Therefore, both should be
   integrated into management for the conservation of grassland songbirds.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim of the study: The objective is to assess the influences of the tree
   stand age and other forestry management practices on species richness,
   composition, and distribution of the Patagonian pine plantation bird
   assemblages.
   Area of study: The work was carried out in forested plots of Ponderosa
   pine located at the Lanin National Park (Patagonia, Argentina).
   Material and methods: Birds were sampled using 25 m fixed radius point
   counts, at four plots varying in age, management, and forest structure.
   Main results: A total of 2090 individuals belonging to 34 bird species
   were observed, their numbers vary significantly depending on the
   different modes of plantation management. The population density of the
   14 most abundant bird species was compared among the four plantation
   plots and ten species don't show statistically significant differences
   in their population density among the different forest plots. The
   California Quail, the White-Crested Elaenia and the Southern House Wren
   showed higher densities in pine plantations with lower tree densities
   and fewer cutting treatments. The Diuca Finch had high densities in the
   younger plantations not subjected to any treatment.
   Research highlights: Most of these bird species are opportunistic and a
   few are found more regularly in these non-native woods than in other
   native forested or afforested areas. Our data suggest that a mixed
   scenario based on a mosaic of plantation with patches of native
   deciduous forest may help maximize the bird diversity in the management
   of northwestern Patagonian plantation landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Encroachment of woody plants is widespread in semiarid grasslands of the
   southwestern United States. Wildlife responses to shrub removal
   techniques in the region are relatively unknown. In 2008 and 2009, we
   examined avian responses to prescribed burning of ungrazed shortgrass
   prairie within a study area (4811 ha) near Amarillo, Texas, that is
   heavily encroached by honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and cholla
   (Opuntia spp.). Specifically, we compared relative abundance, species
   richness, and species diversity of breeding birds across large,
   spatially replicated experimental plots burned every 2 or 4 years since
   2002 and unburned controls. We found no significant differences in the
   mean relative abundance of most species across the treatments. However,
   Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), Cassin's Sparrow (Peucaea
   cassinii), and Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) were more abundant
   in less frequently burned plots and unburned controls. We found no
   differences in species richness or diversity across the treatments.
   Limited variation in avian responses across the treatments likely
   reflects the uniform pattern of vegetation structure we found across the
   plots, despite repeated application of prescribed fire at 2- and 4-year
   intervals over a 7-year period. Differences in bird species assemblages
   among the burn treatments might be more prominent in future years as
   prescribed burning continues.}},

Volume = {{281}},

Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Road building can lead to significant deleterious impacts on
   biodiversity, varying from direct road-kill mortality and direct habitat
   loss associated with road construction, to more subtle indirect impacts
   from edge effects and fragmentation. However, little work has been done
   to evaluate the specific effects of road networks and biodiversity loss
   beyond the more generalized effects of habitat loss. Here, we compared
   forest bird species richness and composition in the municipalities of
   Santarem and Belterra in Para state, eastern Brazilian Amazon, with a
   road network metric called `roadless volume (RV)' at the scale of small
   hydrological catchments (averaging 3721 ha). We found a significant
   positive relationship between RV and both forest bird richness and the
   average number of unique species (species represented by a single
   record) recorded at each site. Forest bird community composition was
   also significantly affected by RV. Moreover, there was no significant
   correlation between RV and forest cover, suggesting that road networks
   may impact biodiversity independently of changes in forest cover.
   However, variance partitioning analysis indicated that RV has partially
   independent and therefore additive effects, suggesting that RV and
   forest cover are best used in a complementary manner to investigate
   changes in biodiversity. Road impacts on avian species richness and
   composition independent of habitat loss may result from road-dependent
   habitat disturbance and fragmentation effects that are not captured by
   total percentage habitat cover, such as selective logging, fire,
   hunting, traffic disturbance, edge effects and road-induced
   fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem functionality is an increasingly important objective of
   ecological restoration. Despite this, a few studies have rigorously
   assessed reproductive functionality within restored plant populations,
   and it is largely assumed that pollinators follow restoration of plant
   communitiesbuild it and they will come. Here, we applied an ecological
   genetic approach to determine the impact of spatial separation on mating
   in Banksia menziesii (Proteaceae), a dominant bird-pollinated species of
   Banksia woodlands of Western Australia. All plants at three post-mining
   restored sites (n = 72 {[}13 years old], n = 21 {[}8 years old], and n =
   20 {[}9 years old]), as well as a sample from an adjacent natural
   reference site (n = 42), were genotyped at nine microsatellite loci.
   Seed set, mating system parameters, realized pollen dispersal through
   the assignment of paternity to seed, and avian pollinator species
   composition, abundance and behavior, were assessed. All patches
   displayed equivalent heterozygosity (H-e = 0.53-0.59) and very weak
   genetic divergence (F-ST 0.01). Seed of plants within restored sites
   showed complete outcrossing and relatively high seed set, 26\% of which
   were sired by pollen donors located beyond the local patch. Similar
   abundance and movement of nectar-feeding birds was observed in restored
   and natural sites, despite lower bird species diversity in the restored
   site, where a smaller, less aggressive species was dominant. Our results
   demonstrate the restitution of wide outcrossing in these restored
   Banksia patches within an active mine-site, and suggest that restored
   bird-pollinated Banksia populations are resilient to human impacts, due
   largely to their generalist pollinator requirements and highly-mobile
   avian pollinators.}},

Title = {{Influence of residual forest patches on post-fire bird diversity
   patterns in jack pine-dominated ecosystems of northern Lower Michigan}},

Abstract = {{Stand-replacing fires are part of the natural disturbance regime that
   maintain jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) forests of northern Lower
   Michigan. Currently, the occurrence and extent of wildfire is much
   reduced relative to the past and young jack pine plantations
   specifically managed for Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii Baird)
   are a prominent feature on the landscape. Stringers, or patches of
   residual prefire forest, are a unique feature left behind after
   wildfires which are not often accounted for in plantation management. In
   this study, we examined the ecological value of stringers from an avian
   biodiversity perspective by comparing bird assemblages found within
   stringers to those in the surrounding forest (non-stringers). Our
   objective was to answer two research questions: (I) do stringers have
   unique bird communities relative to the surrounding vegetation (forest
   or plantation)?; and (2) how much of the variation in bird communities
   can be explained by differences in vegetation structure and composition
   between stringers and non-stringers? We conducted breeding and
   non-breeding season point counts and used abundance data to compare bird
   species found within stringers and non-stringers at seven sites grouped
   by time since disturbance. Species richness was significantly higher (P
   = 0.01) in the stringers when the non-stringers were 30-40 years old,
   with 32 species discovered in the stringers and 29 species in the
   non-stringers. During the breeding season, bird assemblages differed
   between stringers and non-stringers when the non-stringers were <12
   years old (multi-response permutation procedures; T = -10.11, A = 0.07,
   P = <0.00), but no differences were observed when non-stringers were
   30-40 years old or >40 years old. Non-breeding bird communities differed
   between stringers and non-stringers only when the non-stringer was a
   recently planted (<5 years old) plantation (T = -2.15, A = 0.09, P =
   0.02). Differences in bird assemblages appear to be driven by the
   vegetation structure of stringers and non-stringers where fires were
   recent, but increasing similarity in vegetation structure occurs with
   time since fire; over time the importance of stringers for avian
   biodiversity is reduced. Our results suggest that stringers are
   important for bird communities, especially in recently disturbed areas,
   and that these biological legacies should be considered where jack pine
   management attempts to emulate natural patterns and processes. (C) 2014

Title = {{Associations between occupancy and habitat structure can predict avian

Abstract = {{Increasingly, fire is used as a management tool to mitigate wildfire
   risk and conserve biodiversity. Use of time since disturbance as a
   surrogate for faunal occurrence presents an appealing basis for
   biodiversity conservation; however, successional change in resource
   availability is often the direct driver of change in animal occurrence
   rather than time per se, and rates of resource development can be highly
   variable. To facilitate prediction of animal responses to disturbance,
   we sought to test whether time since fire (TSF) and habitat structure
   can predict bird occurrence. Time is only expected to predict occurrence
   if (i) species respond to structural resources and (ii) the abundance of
   these resources can be predicted by time. We examined the responses of
   15 bird species to habitat structure and TSF using a 70-year
   chronosequence spanning three forest types in southeast Australia.
   Habitat structure variables predicted the occurrence of 13 species, four
   of which also responded to TSF. The levels of associations between
   occurrence, structure and TSF varied among vegetation types but response
   shapes were generally consistent. The fact that the majority of species
   did not respond to TSF indicates that TSF is an inappropriate surrogate
   for avian occurrence in our study system. Further, it is unlikely to be
   a reliable surrogate for faunal occurrence in forests that exhibit
   variable rates of post-fire structural development. We suggest that
   relationships between TSF and structure can provide insight into the
   capacity of TSF to predict animal occurrence. They will also reveal the
   extent to which fire can be used as a tool for managing biodiversity,
   and species likely to benefit or be at risk from particular fire
   regimes. This is critical given projected increases in the frequency and
   extent of fire in many regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Population declines of several successional-scrub bird species are
   partly associated with decreased habitat availability as abandoned
   farmlands return to forest and recently harvested forests regrow.
   Restoration of mixed-oak (Quercus spp.) forest is also a concern because
   of widespread oak regeneration failure, especially on moist, productive
   sites where competition from faster-growing tree species is fierce
   following stand-replacing disturbances. Several silvicultural methods
   are proposed to promote oak regeneration but many are not experimentally
   tested, especially on productive sites. We surveyed birds in 19 stands
   to assess response to initial application of three proposed oak
   regeneration treatments on productive sites: prescribed burning (B); oak
   shelterwood by midstory herbicide (OSW); shelterwood harvests (SW); and
   controls (C), for one breeding season before, and two breeding seasons
   after, implementation. Relative density of successional-scrub species
   Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), Eastern Towhees (Pipilo
   erythrophthalmus), and Chestnut-sided Warblers (Setophaga pensylvanica)
   increased, while Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) decreased within 11 to
   18 months after SW harvests; understory disturbance treatments B or OSW
   had no effect. Our results indicated that partial harvests created
   habitat for breeding birds associated with both young and mature
   forests, whereas understory treatments had little effect. Additionally,
   we show that even small patches of young forest habitat are used by more
   individuals and more species of breeding birds than surrounding
   closed-canopy forest, and may benefit successional-scrub species by
   enabling their occurrence in an otherwise forested landscape. Absence of
   several lower-elevation successional-scrub bird species in our
   mid-elevation SW harvests suggests that comprehensive conservation in
   the southern Appalachians necessitates creating and maintaining young
   forest habitats across elevation gradients.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Tree cavities are vital resources for many animals, especially birds and
   mammals. We aimed to determine density of cavity resources in coniferous
   spruce-pine (Pinus/Picea genera) stands of the Bialowieza Forest,
   Poland, and to correlate their presence with tree species composition,
   and characteristics of trees and stands (condition, DBH, basal area). We
   conducted studies in spruce-pine stands with no (national park), medium
   (seminatural reserves), and high (managed forest) management activity.
   We measured all trees within 50-m 50-m sample plots (eight plots in each
   zone) and searched for all tree cavities. The highest density of
   cavities was observed in the national park (12.5/ha) and the lowest in
   managed plots (3.0/ha). Most cavities were found in dead trees (74.4\%),
   mainly in pines Pinus sylvestris L. The basal area of dead pines within
   the stand was the best predictor of cavity presence on sample plots. Our
   results confirm a key role of pine snags in natural coniferous stands.
   Forest management leads to dramatic reduction of tree cavity resources
   in managed stands. We suggest that the leaving or creation of pine snags
   is the most effective method of providing or retaining cavity resources
   in commercial coniferous forests in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Despite their key roles in agroecosystems, species diversity of arable
   plants is being severely reduced by agricultural intensification,
   although it remains unclear whether functional diversity is affected in
   a similar way. We analyzed the response of four functional traits of
   arable plants (specific leaf area, canopy height, seed mass and
   flowering onset) to agricultural intensification in Mediterranean arable
   plant communities. Two intensification gradients were obtained by PCA
   analysis on variables related either to management practices at the
   individual field scale or to the surrounding landscape structure and
   composition. Shifts in the community weighted mean (CWM) and the
   functional diversity (FD) of each trait along these intensification
   gradients were explored. The relationship between species richness and
   the FD of each trait (i.e. functional redundancy) along the same
   gradients was also analyzed. The responses of species richness and the
   considered functional traits were driven by intensification at the
   individual field scale, but not by intensification at the scale of the
   surrounding landscape. Species richness and FD of all the studied traits
   decreased with intensification, which favoured tall, heavy-seeded and
   early flowering species. The decrease of FD was non-linear for specific
   leaf area and seed mass, with maximum reductions at intermediate levels
   of intensification. Species richness and FD responses were decoupled,
   indicating that the functional redundancy in the studied communities
   responds to agricultural intensification in a non-linear fashion. Along
   the first stages of intensification, there was an important reduction in
   species richness that was not accompanied by changes in FD. Further
   levels of intensification resulted in substantial reductions in FD
   without changes in species richness. These findings provide new insights
   on how agricultural management interacts with plant communities through
   its non-linear effects on functional diversity and functional
   redundancy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Farmland biodiversity dramatically declined in Europe during the 20th
   century. Agri-environment schemes (AES) were introduced in the late
   1980s in European Union countries as a solution to combat biodiversity
   decline. We examined the effectiveness of AES in enhancing biodiversity
   in a new EU member country (Estonia) over the period of 2010-2012. We
   compared species numbers and abundance of bumblebees and birds, plus
   cover of flowers, between three farming systems in two regions of
   Estonia. Farm types included conventional and two under AES (organic and
   a less strict environmentally friendly management agreement).
   Environmentally friendly management practices in Estonia include
   diversified crop rotations, at least 15\% of arable land (including
   rotational grasslands) under legumes, permanent grassland strips,
   protection of landscape elements, reduced applications of agrochemicals,
   etc. The two selected regions (North and South) differed in landscape
   structure, soil types and crop yields. Flower cover and bird species
   richness and abundance without the dominant species (skylark) were
   higher on organic farms. Bumblebee species richness was significantly
   higher under both types of AES than under conventional farming. Flower
   cover, abundance and species richness of bumblebees and birds were
   significantly higher in the more heterogeneous landscapes of Southern
   Estonia. Environmentally friendly management may be a viable alternative
   to organic farming for a widely accepted, simple but large-scale
   greening of agricultural landscapes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Reservoir management on the Missouri River has changed the flow regime
   that once created dynamic emergent sandbar habitat (ESH) for the
   interior least tern (Sternula antillarum) and piping plover (Charadrius
   melodus). High flows that create large amounts of ESH are now rare, but
   the remaining interannual variability in river stage has strong effects
   on the amount of ESH available for nesting shorebirds. The scarcity of
   habitat has led the United States Army Corps of Engineers to develop an
   adaptive management plan for the restoration of ESH to support nesting
   terns and plovers. We describe the stochastic simulation models of ESH,
   plover populations and tern populations used in the adaptive management
   process, and examine the effects of river flow on projected outcomes of
   habitat restoration. The population models are most sensitive to
   uncertainty in adult survival rates. Model validation against historical
   amounts of ESH and population sizes suggests the model is a reasonable
   predictor of future dynamics. Flow variability contributes as much
   uncertainty as parameter estimation error to plover model projections
   but negligible uncertainty to the tern model. Autocorrelation in flow
   between years has stronger effects on population outcomes than the
   intensity of habitat restoration effort does. We compared population
   outcomes after a habitat-creating flow with population outcomes
   following habitat restoration and found that large pulses of habitat
   creation produced similar or better outcomes in the short term than low
   but consistent habitat restoration. However, bird populations fared
   better in the long term with low levels of restoration when
   habitat-forming flows were rare. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Bio-indicators are often proposed to set conservation priorities in
   forest habitat owing to the difficulties of determining forest intrinsic
   ecological value. Here, we tested the efficacy of a number of potential
   bird indicator groups in monitoring beech Fagus sylvatica forest status
   by analyzing their associations with the spatial and structural
   variables of forest vegetation that indicate key ecological patterns and
   processes. The density of cavity nesting birds, indicating the presence
   of limited forest resources (resource-limited indicators), was
   influenced by tree species diversity, vertical species mingling and
   diameter, parameters reflecting maturity, gap-dynamic processes, as well
   as resource and shelter availability. Heterogeneity in shrub species
   composition, another parameter depending on forest dynamics, was
   positively associated with the occurrence of Capercaillie, a
   ``flagship{''} species for forest conservation. The presence of
   woodpeckers, a ``keystone{''} group that provides shelter and foraging
   substrate to other organisms, was positively affected by the basal area
   of standing dead trees that is indirectly associated with natural
   nutrient availability. These findings suggest that single indicators
   fail to provide a complete assessment of forest status, and their use in
   monitoring or managing forest ecosystem need to be contextualized to
   specific ecological patterns. The combined use of several indicators,
   representing various taxa, functions and life histories, appears to be
   preferable, and is logistically feasible if these can be surveyed
   together. Several indicators would likely display a wider range of
   sensitivities to the modification of natural processes and permit more
   comprehensive tracking of forest dynamics than single flagship, keystone
   or resource-limited indicators.}},

Abstract = {{Census-based studies document changes in population size of animal
   species in response to wildfires, but mechanisms involving behavior of
   individuals and the effects on reproductive success are usually unknown.
   I developed a conceptual model explaining the persistence of
   cavity-nesting birds on the landscape after fires depending on carrying
   capacity (food supply) of the habitat and the philopatry and
   territoriality of the species. The breeding density, nest site
   characteristics, and reproductive success of Northern Flickers Colaptes
   auratus was studied before and after low-to moderate-severity fires on
   replicated plots. The density and spatial distribution of nests did not
   change in a consistent way after fires, but the rates of cavity
   excavation increased and characteristics of nest sites changed as such
   decay class of the tree. Laying dates were delayed and clutches were
   smaller in freshly excavated vs. reused cavities on the burned sites.
   Breeding philopatry caused a shift to older age classes in the
   population. Depredation of nests by small mammals increased during the
   first three years after fires, reducing the number of young produced per
   nest attempt on burned plots. The study shows that, even when fire does
   not reduce the density of breeding pairs, there may be detrimental
   effects detected only by monitoring the behavior and reproduction of
   individuals.}},

Title = {{Response of the two rare arable weed species Lithospermum arvense and

Abstract = {{Rare weeds are currently under pressure due to intensifying arable
   management practices, and as a consequence of climate change, these
   practices will likely become even more intensive, together with a
   greater uniformity of land use. As a result, ecological stresses will
   increase for most species of rare weeds, in some cases leading to their
   further decline or even extinction. Moreover, climate change will alter
   the suitability of the environment for many plants, since average
   temperatures are predicted to increase and precipitation extremes to
   become more common. For most arable weed species it is unclear, whether
   the anticipated changes in environmental conditions are disadvantageous
   or beneficial. Little is known about specific biological responses of
   rare weeds to climate changes, and this study attempts to close some of
   these knowledge gaps. Here, the rare arable weed Lithospermum arvense
   and the endangered arable species Scandix pecten-veneris were
   investigated with regard to the effects of higher temperature and
   different crop densities on flowering time, shoot development, plant
   height, dry mass and seed production. Semi-field experiments were
   conducted with winter wheat crop for 3 years, involving 48 climate
   cages, in which every second was a variant of warmer temperature and
   contrasting crop density. We observed that S. pecten-veneris flowered
   earlier under warmer conditions and had fewer seeds and less biomass in
   the dense wheat crop compared to control conditions, while L. arvense
   grew taller, it produced fewer seeds in the high density crop. We
   suggest that such data concerning the biological responses of weeds can
   improve the precision of bioclimatic distribution models. Finally, we
   discuss strategies, such as relocation or non-intrusive management
   practices, for preventing further disappearances of rare arable weeds.
   Our results should be of considerable interest for the fields of plant
   ecology, biodiversity research and conservation.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{327}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{To understand the ecological effects of forest restoration treatments on
   several old-growth forest stands in the Flathead National Forest of
   western Montana, USA, we surveyed birds at 72 points in treatment and
   control stands, and at more than 50 points in each of five potential
   reference stand conditions. We used a Before-After/Control-Impact design
   to assess treatment effects based on data collected 3 years before and 2
   years after treatment. We also examined the similarity in bird community
   composition among all stand types by using a nonmetric multidimensional
   scaling approach. Relative abundances of only a few bird species changed
   significantly as a result of restoration treatments, and these changes
   were characterized largely by declines in the abundances of a few
   species associated with more mesic, dense-forest conditions, and not by
   increases in the abundances of species associated with more xeric,
   old-growth reference stand conditions. Thus, bird communities in treated
   stands were more similar to those in untreated stands of the same forest
   type than to those found in any of the potential old-growth reference
   stands. Although more time may be required for some bird species to
   respond to treatments, our results suggest that treatment plot sizes
   were either too small to affect bird communities or that the forest type
   selected for treatment was not within the range of forest types that are
   well suited for this type of forest restoration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A study was carried out to find the local status and population count of
   selected passerine birds species in Lahore during 2008. Comparison was
   made by relating the population density of passerine birds with
   reference to flora of 3 old and 3 new sites in and around Lahore. The
   results of the study revealed that the changing habitat of Lahore due to
   human disturbance and non-availability of breeding sites for birds was
   the main reason behind the loss of passerine avian diversity. Secondly,
   the trend of planting decorative or ornamental plants such as Eucalyptus
   in Lahore was the key factor forcing birds to migrate. Relative
   abundance of native trees and density of observed passerine bird species
   was higher in old reference sites rather than in newly established parks
   of Lahore city because new parks in the city have highly disturbed
   habitat and more exotic tree varieties. Results of the present study
   revealed that one of the new parks, woodland wildlife park outside the
   city is still providing the natural habitat to birds due to less human
   disturbance. So there is dire need to build such parks which have more
   natural environment. Conservation of passerine avian diversity within
   city area can be progressed by managing the urban green space and
   plantation of native flora. After completion of study, it was
   recommended that only ecological restoration of damaged habitat at
   Lahore can turn back the tide of biodiversity loss.}},

Abstract = {{Wood-pastures are fragile ecosystems because they were formed by, and
   depend on specific, low-intensity multifunctional management. Although
   their ecological and cultural significance is high, wood-pastures are
   rapidly deteriorating all over Europe, mainly due to changing land use.
   We still lack a basic understanding of the ecological value of
   wood-pastures, and in which features they differ from other landscape
   elements. In this paper we investigated the ecological value of
   wood-pastures for passerine birds by (i) comparing bird assemblages of
   wood-pastures with those of closed forests and open pastures and (ii)
   exploring the relationships between variables describing wood-pastures
   and species traits of the bird assemblages. Our study region (Southern
   Transylvania, Romania) provides a unique opportunity to understand the
   importance of a traditional cultural and ecological environment for many
   different organisms. Wood-pastures had a higher overall number of bird
   species, and a higher spatial turnover in bird community composition
   than closed forests and open pastures. We found significant associations
   between bird species traits and habitat structural elements in
   wood-pastures such as large trees, oak- and pear trees and shrubs. Our
   findings suggest that traditional wood-pastures in Southern Transylvania
   have distinct and rich passerine bird communities. This richness is
   inextricably linked to the multifunctional, low-intensity land use
   traditionally applied in the wood-pastures that promotes high niche
   diversity. For effective conservation of the biodiversity of
   wood-pastures, a detailed understanding is needed of how different
   management regimes may influence the key structural elements of
   wood-pastures relevant for biodiversity and these should be protected.}},

Abstract = {{The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a species of
   conservation concern that is strongly associated with recently burned
   forests. Black-backed Woodpeckers are known to have variable home-range
   sizes, yet the ecological factors related to this variation have not
   been adequately explored and may hold insights into the natural history
   of the species and the management of its habitat. During 2011 and 2012,
   we radio-tracked Black-backed Woodpeckers nesting in 3 forested areas of
   California that burned between 2 and 5 years before the initiation of
   tracking. Among 15 individuals with robust tracking data, we found that
   home-range size varied by an order of magnitude, from 24.1 to 304.1 ha,
   as measured by movement-based kernel estimation. Using an
   information-theoretic approach, we evaluated the functional relationship
   between snag basal area an a priori key resource and home-range size,
   additionally controlling for sex, age, and years since fire as
   covariates. We found that snag basal area alone best predicted
   home-range size, explaining 54-62\% of observed variation. As snag basal
   area increased, home-range sizes exponentially decreased. This
   relationship held true both with and without the inclusion of 3
   individuals that nested in burned forest yet foraged predominantly
   outside the fire perimeter in unburned forest. Snag basal area, unlike
   other potential influences on home-range size, is an attribute that
   forest managers can directly influence. We describe a quantitative
   relationship between home-range size and snag basal area that forest
   managers can use to predict Black-backed Woodpecker pair density in
   burned forests and assess the likely population consequences of specific
   harvest treatments. Given that the birds in our study, foraging
   primarily in burned forest, all had home ranges with}},

Abstract = {{Proliferation of invasive plants in forest understories throughout North
   America has prompted restoration efforts focused on removal of invasive
   vegetation. Although the negative impacts of invasives on native plant
   communities are well documented, effects on forest bird communities
   remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we examined the response
   of avian communities to invasive plants in forest fragments across 4
   counties in northeastern Illinois, a region characterized by extensive
   urbanization. We surveyed breeding bird communities in 46 forest plots
   representing a gradient in abundance of invasive woody plants. We
   quantified vegetation structure and composition within plots, as well as
   landscape context. Exotic trees and shrubs were present on all but 3
   plots. Although native trees were common, native species represented
   <7\% of total stem density of shrubs. Measures of invasion were weakly
   correlated with those representing urbanization, yet broad-scale
   measures of urbanization such as building density and urban cover were
   strongly associated with avian community structure. At finer scales,
   measures of invasion were important predictors of the relative abundance
   of birds in several nesting and foraging guilds. Shrub nesters showed a
   positive response to invasive vegetation, whereas the relative abundance
   of aerial salliers and ground nesters decreased with increased
   proportions of invasive trees. Because restoration strategies aimed at
   the complete removal of invasive shrubs could diminish habitat quality
   for some species, thinning of understory vegetation or the removal of
   invasive trees may confer the greatest benefits to avian communities
   when few native understory plants are present.}},

Title = {{Breeding bird community response to establishing intercropped
   switchgrass in intensively-managed pine stands}},
Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{201-211}},

Abstract = {{Intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) between tree rows within
   young pine (Pinus spp.) plantations is a potential method to generate
   lignocellulosic biofuel feedstocks within intensively managed forests.
   Intensively managed pine supports a diverse avian assemblage potentially
   affected by establishment and maintenance of an annual biomass
   feed-stock via changes in plant communities, dead wood resources, and
   habitat structure. We sought to understand how establishing switchgrass
   on an operational scale affects bird communities within intercropped
   plantations as compared to typical intensively managed loblolly pine
   (Pinus taeda L.) forest. We conducted breeding bird point counts using
   distance sampling for three years (2011-2013) following establishment of
   intercropped switchgrass stands (6 replicates), traditionally-managed
   pine plantations, and switchgrass-only plots (0.1 km(2) minimum) in
   Kemper Co., MS. We detected 59 breeding bird species from 11,195
   detections. Neotropical migrants and forest-edge associated species were
   less abundant in intercropped plots than controls the first two years
   after establishment and more abundant in year three. Short distance
   migrants and residents were scarce in intercropped and control plots
   initially, and did not differ between these two treatments in any year.
   Species associated with pine-grass habitat structure were less abundant
   initially in intercropped plots, but converged with pine controls in
   subsequent years. Switchgrass monocultures provided minimal resources
   for birds. If songbird conservation is a management priority, managers
   should consider potential reductions of some breeding birds for one to
   two years following intercropping. It is unclear how these relationships
   may change outside the breeding season and as stands age. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{If differences in ecological requirements result in juvenile birds using
   different habitats from breeding birds, then habitat management to
   protect those birds must protect both breeding and post-breeding
   habitats. We examined habitat selection by juvenile black-capped vireos
   (Vireo atricapilla) following their independence from parental care, in
   2010-2013 on Fort Hood Military Reservation in central Texas, USA. The
   black-capped vireo is a federally endangered species that nests almost
   exclusively in shrub vegetation, but previous anecdotal observations
   indicate that juveniles may prefer riparian vegetation. We used mist-net
   capture rates and radio-telemetry to determine relative abundance of
   juvenile vireos across habitats, to quantify movement patterns and
   habitat selection, and to investigate how vegetation density and
   arthropod abundance influenced habitat selection. We captured juveniles
   at similar rates in shrub and riparian vegetation. Radio telemetry data
   indicated that juveniles selected riparian vegetation over most other
   available vegetation types, and tended to stay in riparian vegetation
   upon arrival. Juveniles selected areas characterized by more canopy
   cover, denser foliage, and more arthropods. Riparian vegetation provides
   this combination of features more than other vegetation types,
   indicating that cover and food are the basis for habitat selection by
   juveniles. Our results indicate that habitat conservation strategies for
   black-capped vireos should include protection of riparian vegetation
   near breeding areas, and more generally, that avian conservation
   strategies that focus only on breeding areas may potentially overlook
   other key habitats. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{325}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{The detection of thresholds in forest bird response to gradients in
   forest alteration is a powerful approach to quantify their ecological
   requirements and to develop evidence-based targets for conservation. For
   this purpose, we analyzed the response of 31 forest bird species to a
   gradient in forest alteration by human activities (e.g. fire; grazing;
   firewood collection) in the Kroumirie region of northwestern Tunisia. We
   surveyed forest birds using point counts at 48 stations located
   throughout Feija National Park. From a data set of 12 vegetation
   variables, we obtained a gradient in forest alteration using a principal
   component analysis. Then, we modeled the probability of detection of
   bird species along this gradient using logistic regression. We selected
   the five most sensitive species as target species as indicated by the
   area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). Then, we
   quantified thresholds in their probability of detection as a function of
   four habitat structure variables: density of large-diameter trees (dbh >
   30 cm), canopy closure, density of snags, and downed woody material.
   Nineteen of 31 species exhibited a significant response to forest
   alteration (PCA1), including 7 positive and 12 negative responses. Among
   these, the five best models (AUC > 0.8) corresponded to Levaillant's
   Woodpecker (Picus vaillantii), Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos
   major), Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocops minor), Short-toed
   Treecreeper (Certhia brachydactyla), and Atlas Flycatcher (Ficedula
   speculgera). On the basis of their threshold values, we recommend to
   protect stands with densities of large-diameter trees of at least 650
   stems ha(-1), and 207 stems ha(-1) of snags, to meet the structural
   requirements (90\% probability of detection) of the most demanding
   species, respectively Levaillant's Woodpecker and Atlas Flycatcher. (C)

Abstract = {{Human activity can dramatically affect biodiversity, often by
   introducing non-native species, or by increasing the abundance of a
   small number of native species. Management strategies aimed at
   conserving biodiversity need to be informed by the actual impacts of
   highly abundant species, whether native or introduced. In this study we
   examined characteristics of two bird species, introduced common mynas
   and native noisy miners, both of which are highly abundant in urbanised
   areas along the East coast of Australia. Current managerial practices
   have a strong focus on eradication of common mynas, while noisy miners
   are largely ignored. However, in this study noisy miners were found in a
   broader range of habitats, and in greater abundance, than common mynas;
   displayed more aggressive behaviour; and were linked to a decline in the
   diversity and abundance of other species where common mynas were not. We
   suggest that the adaptability of a species and the variety of habitats
   it can colonise may be a better predictor of its potential impact, than
   whether it is native or introduced.}},

Title = {{Synthesis of the conservation value of the early-successional stage in
   forests of eastern North America}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{As a result of changes in natural and anthropogenic disturbance regimes,
   the extent of early-successional forest across much of eastern North
   American is near historic lows, and continues to decline. This has
   caused many scientists to identify the conservation of
   early-successional species as a high priority. In this synthesis, we
   discuss the conservation implications of this loss of early-successional
   habitats using examples from the literature on songbirds.
   Early-successional ``shrubland{''} bird species require conditions and
   resources present in recently disturbed sites. These conditions are
   ephemeral and change rapidly over time as sites become dominated by
   later-seral species. Historical disturbance regimes such as wind-throw,
   fire and flooding have been altered or suppressed in eastern forests
   through human activity such as conversion of forests to younger aged
   stands more resistant to wind, fire suppression and mesophication of
   fire-adapted communities, and suppression of beaver activity and
   flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic disturbance has shifted over much
   of the region to types of land use that provide less shrubland habitat
   of lower quality than historically. Despite scientific evidence in
   support of this concern, there is still misunderstanding about the role
   of disturbance in maintaining biodiversity, and public opposition to
   management remains a challenge to conserving these communities.
   Contemporary approaches use natural disturbance regimes to inform
   management practices that employ historical agents where possible or
   surrogates when necessary to achieve desired future conditions defined
   on the basis of regional population or community status. Conservation of
   early-successional communities occurs within the context of other
   potentially conflicting ecological values, such as the conservation and
   enhancement of biologically mature forest. Recent findings, however,
   show shrubland habitat can augment diversity in forested landscapes by
   providing seasonal resources for mature-forest species, such as food or
   predator-free space for juvenile forest songbirds that seek out
   early-successional habitats during the transition to independence.
   Balancing the conservation of early-successional shrubland species with
   other, sometimes conflicting values is an active area of current
   conservation research. In some cases the conservation of shrubland birds
   can be coordinated with commercial activities like silviculture or
   maintenance of infrastructure (e.g. powerline corridors), although our
   work indicates that deliberate efforts expressly directed at
   conservation of early-successional shrubland species are more effective.

Abstract = {{Movement and space use of birds is driven by activities associated with
   acquiring and maintaining access to critical resources. Thus, the
   spatial configuration of resources within home ranges should influence
   bird movements, and resource values should be relative to their
   locations. We radio-tracked 22 Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla)
   and related their space use and home range sizes to available resources
   while taking nest site locations into account. We developed utilization
   distributions (UDs) from nuthatch locations, and treated the area of
   each 95\% isopleth as home range size and the height of the UD as
   relative probability of use. We fit models relating home range size to
   mean resource measures within home ranges, and used lognormal regression
   to relate intensity of use to resource metrics at random points by
   ranking linear mixed models. Nuthatch home ranges typically had two
   centers of activity. Areas of high use were associated with the density
   of recently killed snags (likely a foraging resource), recent prescribed
   fire, pine dominance, low tree stocking rates, and grassy herbaceous
   cover. Home ranges were generally large (median: 7.1 ha; range: 0.3-47.6
   ha), and smaller home range sizes were associated with pine dominance
   and higher nest snag density. Predicted home range sizes decreased by
   77\% and 69\%, respectively, when percent pine and nest snag density
   were maximized. Our results illustrate that movement decisions within
   home ranges are driven by both the availability and spatial distribution
   of resources, while ongoing savannah-woodland management is providing
   resources that are used by Brown-headed Nuthatches.}},

Abstract = {{Studies evaluating agri-environmental schemes (AES) usually focus on
   responses of single species or functional groups. Analyses are generally
   based on simple habitat measurements but ignore food availability and
   other important factors. This can limit our understanding of the
   ultimate causes determining the reactions of birds to AES. We
   investigated these issues in detail and throughout the main seasons of a
   bird's annual cycle (mating, postfledging and wintering) in a dry cereal
   farmland in a Special Protection Area for farmland birds in central
   Spain. First, we modeled four bird response parameters (abundance,
   species richness, diversity and ``Species of European Conservation
   Concern{''} {[}SPEC]-score), using detailed food availability and
   vegetation structure measurements (food models). Second, we fitted new
   models, built using only substrate composition variables (habitat
   models). Whereas habitat models revealed that both, fields included and
   not included in the AES benefited birds, food models went a step further
   and included seed and arthropod biomass as important predictors,
   respectively, in winter and during the postfledging season. The
   validation process showed that food models were on average 13\% better
   (up to 20\% in some variables) in predicting bird responses. However,
   the cost of obtaining data for food models was five times higher than
   for habitat models. This novel approach highlighted the importance of
   food availability-related causal processes involved in bird responses to
   AES, which remained undetected when using conventional substrate
   composition assessment models. Despite their higher costs, measurements
   of food availability add important details to interpret the reactions of
   the bird community to AES interventions and thus facilitate evaluating
   the real efficiency of AES programs.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial timber plantations severely impact biodiversity in Southeast
   Asia. Forest fragments survive within plantations, but their
   conservation value in highly deforested landscapes in Southeast Asia is
   poorly understood. In this study, we compared bird assemblages in acacia
   plantations and fragmented forests in South Sumatra to evaluate each
   habitat's potential conservation value. To clarify the impact of habitat
   change, we also analyzed the response of feeding guild composition. Five
   habitat types were studied: large logged forest (LLF), burnt logged
   forest (BLF), remnant logged forest (RLF), 4-year-old acacia plantation
   (AP4), and 1-year-old acacia plantation (AP1). Estimated species
   richness (Chao 2) was highest in LLF then AP4 and BLF, while AP1 and RLF
   had lower estimated species richness. Community composition was roughly
   divided into two groups by non-metric multidimensional scaling
   ordination: acacia plantation and logged forest. Sallying
   substrate-gleaning insectivores, such as drongos, broadbills, and some
   flycatchers, were restricted to LLF, whereas acacia plantation hosted
   many terrestrial frugivores, such as doves. Although fragmented forests
   in our study site lacked several common tropical forest species, these
   fragments provide an important habitat for some sallying and terrestrial
   insectivores. A network of small riparian remnant forests could be a
   complementary habitat for some species, while the conservation value of
   burnt forest might be low. In conclusion, the highly fragmented forests
   in plantations are suboptimal habitats for birds but are still very
   important, because large primary forest blocks have been nearly lost in
   the surrounding landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Compositional indicators (i.e. indices that focus on the identity of
   species, genes or phylogeny) have been widely used to estimate and
   monitor biodiversity, however, their use in combination with species
   and/or community functional characteristics remains limited. Using
   large-scale, spatio-temporal data, we use both compositional and
   functional indices to investigate land-use change impacts on the
   vegetation of a semi-natural grassland ecosystem (Machair) for fourteen
   regions in Scotland, UK. Our study aimed to identify national- and
   regional-scale temporal vegetation patterns, and through use of simple
   compositional and functional indices (e.g. Competitor, Stress, Ruderal
   and Ellenberg scores) link observed changes to agricultural
   intensification and/or land-use abandonment. Using linear-mixed
   modelling and nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling, we showed significant
   national and regional-scale changes in species composition over time.
   Increases in diversity, particularly gains in Machair grassland,
   identified several regions that may have benefited from past government
   incentivised schemes to protect the Machair, but which may also be
   suffering from an extinction lag. Shifts in plant functional signatures
   (CSR \& Ellenberg values) identified varying degrees of internal
   (competition) and external (land-use) factors, highlighting several
   regions where biodiversity change could be linked to reduced disturbance
   (i.e. lower grazing intensity) or greater disturbance (i.e. land-use
   intensification). Our results demonstrate the utility of simple
   compositional and functional indices for monitoring biodiversity of
   semi-natural grasslands and identifying land-use drivers of change
   across different spatial scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Rangeland birds in the Southern High Plains, USA evolved within a
   context of fire and grazing (i.e., pyric herbivory), a disturbance
   regime that played a dominant role in shaping rangelands in this region
   but has been absent since the 1880s. A management technique known as
   patch-burn grazing was used to mimic the heterogeneity in vegetation
   created by the historical disturbance regime of fire and grazing in sand
   sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia) rangelands. We compared nest survival of
   Cassin's sparrows (Peucaea cassinii), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla),
   and lark sparrows (Chondestes grammacus); species richness; and
   densities of 11 bird species between rangelands managed with patch-burn
   grazing and rangelands managed with traditional management (i.e.,
   seasonal grazing) in Oklahoma from 2006 to 2008. Estimates of nest
   survival were similar between patch-burn and traditional pastures
   (Cassin's sparrows: 51\% and 57\%; field sparrows: 18\% and 22\%; and
   lark sparrows: 14\% and 12\%, patch-burn and traditional, respectively).
   Species richness was higher in patch-burn pastures compared to
   traditionally managed pastures. Densities of the majority of avian
   species (73\%) were similar between treatments; however, lark sparrow
   densities were 5 times more abundant in patch-burn pastures and
   grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and brown-headed cowbirds
   (Molothrus ater) were >3 times more abundant on traditional pastures.
   Our results suggest that introducing patch-burn grazing management to
   sand sagebrush rangelands is not detrimental to nesting shrubland birds,
   and the creation of heterogeneity through patch-burn grazing can
   increase avian species diversity. Furthermore, some species such as lark
   sparrows may benefit from patch-burn grazing. Patch-burn management may
   be an important tool to assist in the recovery of biodiversity in this
   ecosystem. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly all remnants of temperate grasslands in southeastern South
   America are used for livestock ranching and are subject to habitat
   degradation resulting from this activity. Exploring how habitat features
   affect the composition of grassland avifaunal communities is a first
   step to understand how current cattle-ranching management practices
   impact avian diversity. We used canonical ordination to test for
   relationships between five habitat variables and the composition of the
   bird community in coastal grasslands in southern Brazil. We sampled
   pastures with different heights, from overgrazed short-grass to tall
   herbaceous vegetation. We recorded 1,535 individuals and 27 species of
   birds. The first ordination axis indicated a strong contribution of mean
   vegetation height on the composition of the bird community, whereas the
   second axis revealed the influence of herbaceous vegetation patchiness
   and woody vegetation cover. Three groups of species were revealed by the
   ordination: one more diffuse associated with intermediate and tall
   herbaceous vegetation, another with short grass, and a third with
   vegetation patchiness and woody vegetation. Species restricted to tall
   herbaceous vegetation are negatively impacted from habitat degradation
   resulting from overgrazing and trampling by livestock, and mowing and
   burning of tall plants. Occurrence of these species in our study area is
   related with the presence of swales immediately behind the dune system
   and where remnants of tall vegetation persist. Birds of pastures with
   ample cover of short herbaceous plants, including one globally
   threatened species and six other restricted to short-grass habitat,
   apparently benefit from local livestock management practices. Woody
   vegetation possibly functions as a keystone structure, enabling the
   occurrence in grasslands of avian species that rely on shrubby habitat.
   Although livestock ranching promotes the diversity of habitats by
   creating distinct patches of vegetation height in grasslands, current
   management practices directed to the maintenance of short grass pastures
   may eliminate an entire subset of species, including regionally
   threatened taxa, and reduce avian diversity. The maintenance of large
   patches of tall herbaceous plants is needed to ensure the survival of
   species reliant on this type of grassland structure in our study area.}},

Title = {{Trends in bird diversity over 12 years in response to large-scale
   eucalypt plantation establishment: Implications for extensive carbon
   plantings}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{322}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale plantations established for timber production or for carbon
   sequestration can dramatically transform landscapes, however little is
   known about the response of biodiversity. We report on trends in bird
   diversity during a 12 year longitudinal study on three large-scale
   plantations of locally indigenous eucalypts in northern New South Wales,
   Australia. The study began in a farmland mosaic and has continued to
   follow bird occupancy rates after the establishment of eucalypt
   plantations within the paddock areas. Bird surveys were undertaken at
   focal trees located in different classes of remnant vegetation, which
   became embedded within the plantations as well as in the plantation
   matrix itself. Reference sites were also located in adjacent blocks of
   forest. We found that species richness increased over time in the
   plantation matrix, as well as remnant vegetation embedded within the
   plantation (isolated trees, tree patches and remnants, but not riparian
   locations). When birds were classified as forest-dependent,
   forest-associated or mosaic generalist, the species richness of
   forest-associated birds increased and mosaic generalists decreased over
   time at selected remnant categories. Richness of forest-dependent birds
   did not change over time. After plantation establishment, bird
   composition at remnant locations gradually shifted towards that of
   forest, although all locations remained distinct from forest even after
   11 years of plantation growth. The response of 36 individual species was
   assessed with 47\% percent of species increasing over the 11 years and
   31\% of species declining. Notably the noisy miner, a hyper-aggressive
   species, decreased over time. We suggest a reduction in the occurrence
   of this species could be an important contributor to the increase in the
   diversity of smaller bird species. These include species of regional
   concern, such as the eastern yellow robin and the rufous whistler, which
   increased over the study period. Our results suggest that large-scale
   plantations of locally indigenous species contribute to ecological
   restoration of cleared landscapes. However, the plantation matrix after
   11 years provided less suitable habitat than nearby forest as it
   supported fewer species, especially for birds that are characteristic of
   forest. Retention of remnant vegetation at the time of plantation
   establishment, including large isolated paddock trees, contributed
   considerably to the biodiversity present in the plantations and is
   likely to provide key refuge areas during any subsequent harvesting.
   Continued collection of longitudinal data are needed to describe changes
   through the full plantation rotation and harvest, while the extent to
   which other taxa respond to eucalypt plantation establishment also
   requires documentation. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Landscapes in agricultural systems continue to undergo significant
   change, and the loss of biodiversity is an ever-increasing threat.
   Although habitat restoration is beneficial, management actions do not
   always result in the desired outcome. Managers must understand why
   management actions fail; yet, past studies have focused on assessing
   habitat attributes at a single spatial scale, and often fail to consider
   the importance of ecological mechanisms that act across spatial scales.
   We located survey sites across southern Nebraska, USA and conducted
   point counts to estimate Ring-necked Pheasant abundance, an economically
   important species to the region, while simultaneously quantifying
   landscape effects using a geographic information system. To identify
   suitable areas for allocating limited management resources, we assessed
   land cover relationships to our counts using a Bayesian binomial-Poisson
   hierarchical model to construct predictive Species Distribution Models
   of relative abundance. Our results indicated that landscape scale land
   cover variables severely constrained or, alternatively, facilitated the
   positive effects of local land management for Ring-necked Pheasants.}},

Abstract = {{We studied associations with winter habitat for seven species of birds,
   one species-group (eastern and western meadowlarks combined), and total
   sparrows at seven sites in the semidesert and plains grasslands of
   southeastern Arizona from 1999-2001, sampling with mist-nets and
   survey-transects. We measured structure and composition of vegetation,
   assessing vegetative differences among sites, and modeled associations
   between indices of avian abundance and six vegetative variables using
   generalized linear models. For all vegetative variables, there were
   significant differences among sites. Numbers of northern harriers
   (Circus cyaneus) were positively associated with total number of
   sparrows. Indices of abundance for individual species of birds were
   statistically correlated with various measures of structure and
   composition of vegetation. In particular, grasshopper (Ammodramus
   savannarum) and vesper (Pooecetes gramineus) sparrows were negatively
   associated with amount of bare ground; horned larks (Eremophila
   alpestris) were negatively associated with vertical grass density;
   Baird's sparrows (A. bairdii) were negatively associated with shrub
   density; meadowlarks (Sturnella magna and S. neglecta combined) were
   positively associated with native grass. Our results suggest that these
   species would benefit from management of habitat that affects the
   vegetative characteristics associated with their abundance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the abundance, distribution, nest-site
   characteristics and habitat analysis of woodpecker species in managed

   bird species. We found breeding evidence of six of the eight sedentary
   woodpecker species from Romania: Grey-headed-(Picus calms), Green-
   (Picus viridis), Great Spotted- (Dendrocopos major), Middle Spotted-
   (Dendrocopos medius), White-backed- (Dendrocopos leucotos) and Black
   Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius). The most abundant was the Middle Spotted
   Woodpecker. Middle Spotted-, Green- and Great Spotted Woodpeckers
   excavated nest-holes most commonly in oak (Quercus petraea), Black
   Woodpeckers in beech (Fagus sylvatica), Grey-headed Woodpeckers in aspen
   (Populus tremula). White-backed Woodpeckers used only oaks as
   nest-trees. Weak excavators selected large trees, dead trees or soft
   woods for nesting, but most of the species used primarily live trees for
   excavation. The average diameter of nesting tree, tree height, nest
   height and relative nest height did not increase with the body size of
   the woodpecker species. Nearest neighbor analysis indicated that the
   local distribution of woodpecker species in most forest fragments
   differs from randomness. Great Spotted Woodpeckers and Black Woodpeckers
   presented uniform distributions, while Middle Spotted Woodpeckers
   aggregated distribution. Tree diameter and diversity, relative abundance
   of oak and aspen but also altitude affected woodpecker abundance. Black
   Woodpecker and Middle Spotted Woodpecker presence depends on large trees
   and diversity of trees. The results will contribute to forest
   restoration operations.}},

Abstract = {{Williamson's Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus thyroideus (Cassin, 1852)) breeds
   primarily in managed forests in Canada. Its status as endangered will
   require reliable information to develop habitat management guidelines.
   Adults provision nestlings with ants gleaned from tree trunks, so we
   estimated the preferred nestling diet by comparing nestling fecal sac
   composition with the ant fauna collected in tree trunk traps. For ants,
   we determined nest densities and substrates by counts along transects
   within sapsucker nest areas. Ants made up 98\% of >10 000 arthropods
   identified in Williamson's Sapsucker fecal sacs. Of 11 ant taxa
   available, Williamson's Sapsucker consumed six, of which two
   large-bodied ant taxa, carpenter ants of Camponotus subgenus Camponotus
   and ants of the Formica rufa species group, were preferred. Together
   these two taxa averaged 80\% of the nestling diet by biomass and formed
   >48\% of the nestling diet at every nest examined (n = 89). Preference
   varied regionally: west of the Okanagan Valley, only the two
   large-bodied ant taxa already mentioned were preferred, in the
   Okanagan-Boundary and East Kootenay regions, smaller bodied ants of the
   genus Lasius were also preferred, although these comprised = 5\% of the
   nestling diet by biomass. Camponotus (Camponotus) spp. nests were 3.3
   times more common in wood than soil, and the F. rufa species group were
   entirely dependent on dead or decaying wood for nest substrate. Given
   the dependence of Williamson's Sapsucker on these ants, retention and
   recruitment of dead and decaying wood should be considered a management
   priority for Williamson's Sapsucker breeding habitat.}},

Title = {{Is there any empirical support for biodiversity offset policy?}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity offsets are seen as a policy mechanism to balance
   development and conservation goals. Many offset schemes employ habitat
   restoration in one area to recreate biodiversity value that is destroyed
   elsewhere, assuming that recovery is timely and predictable. Recent
   research has challenged these assumptions on the grounds that
   restoration implies long time delays and a low certainty of success. To
   investigate these assertions, and to assess the strength of empirical
   support for offset policy, we used a meta-analytic approach to analyze
   data from 108 comparative studies of secondary growth (SG) and
   old-growth (OG) habitat (a total of 1228 SG sites and 716 OG reference
   sites). We extracted species checklists and calculated standardized
   response ratios for species richness, Fisher's alpha, Sorenson
   similarity, and Morisita-Horn similarity. We modeled diversity change
   with habitat age using generalized linear models and multi-model
   averaging, correcting for a number of potential explanatory variables.
   We tested whether (1) diversity of passively and actively restored
   habitat converges to OG values over time, (2) active restoration
   significantly accelerates this process, and (3) current offset policies
   are appropriate to the predicted uncertainties and time lags associated
   with restoration. The results indicate that in the best case, species
   richness converges to OG reference values within a century, species
   similarity (Sorenson) takes about twice as long, and assemblage
   composition (Morisita-Horn) up to an order of magnitude longer (hundreds
   to thousands of years). Active restoration significantly accelerates the
   process for all indices, but the inherently large time lags,
   uncertainty, and risk of restoration failure require offset ratios that
   far exceed what is currently applied in practice. Restoration offset
   policy therefore leads to a net loss of biodiversity, and represents an
   inappropriate use of the otherwise valuable tool of ecosystem
   restoration.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Wooded habitats represent hotspots of urban biodiversity, however, urban
   development imposes pressure on biota in these refuges. Identification
   of the most influential habitat attributes and the role of local urban
   characteristics is crucial for proper decisions on management practices
   supporting biodiversity. We aimed to identify well manageable fine-scale
   habitat attributes to suggest specific, feasible and affordable
   management recommendations for green space in cities. We analysed
   species richness of woodland-associated bird communities and incidence
   of individual species at 290 sites in a wide variety of green areas
   scattered across the city of Prague, Czech Republic. Generalized linear
   mixed models (GLMM) and regression tree analyses were used to identify
   site-scale (100 m radius sampling sites) and local-scale (200 m and 500
   m radius plots) habitat attributes shaping the bird communities at
   individual sites. Logistic regression was used to assess the responses
   of individual species to habitat characteristics. Our results imply that
   at the site scale, management practices should focus on maintenance and
   promoting species-diverse and older tree stands, with a mixture of
   coniferous and deciduous trees. Water-bodies and accompanying riparian
   habitats should be maintained and carefully managed to preserve
   high-quality remnants of natural vegetation. Presence of a few old trees
   (about 12 \% of tree cover with DBH > 50 cm) or small urban standing
   water and watercourses enrich the bird community by at least two
   species. Species richness of woodland avifauna at particular sites is
   further supported by the total amount of tree cover in the surroundings,
   including scattered greenery of public spaces and private gardens. We
   conclude that proper management at site scale has the potential to
   increase biodiversity of the urban environment.}},

Abstract = {{Applications of remote sensing for biodiversity conservation typically
   rely on image classifications that do not capture variability within
   coarse land cover classes. Here, we compare two measures derived from
   unclassified remotely sensed data, a measure of habitat heterogeneity
   and a measure of habitat composition, for explaining bird species
   richness and the spatial distribution of 10 species in a semi-arid
   landscape of New Mexico. We surveyed bird abundance from 1996 to 1998 at
   42 plots located in the McGregor Range of Fort Bliss Army Reserve.
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values of two May 1997 Landsat
   scenes were the basis for among-pixel habitat heterogeneity (image
   texture), and we used the raw imagery to decompose each pixel into
   different habitat components (spectral mixture analysis). We used model
   averaging to relate measures of avian biodiversity to measures of image
   texture and spectral mixture analysis fractions. Measures of habitat
   heterogeneity, particularly angular second moment and standard
   deviation, provide higher explanatory power for bird species richness
   and the abundance of most species than measures of habitat composition.
   Using image texture, alone or in combination with other classified
   imagery-based approaches, for monitoring statuses and trends in
   biological diversity can greatly improve conservation efforts and
   habitat management.}},

Title = {{Temperate Mountain Forest Biodiversity under Climate Change:
   Compensating Negative Effects by Increasing Structural Complexity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 13}},
Abstract = {{Species adapted to cold-climatic mountain environments are expected to
   face a high risk of range contractions, if not local extinctions under
   climate change. Yet, the populations of many endothermic species may not
   be primarily affected by physiological constraints, but indirectly by
   climate-induced changes of habitat characteristics. In mountain forests,
   where vertebrate species largely depend on vegetation composition and
   structure, deteriorating habitat suitability may thus be mitigated or
   even compensated by habitat management aiming at compositional and
   structural enhancement. We tested this possibility using four
   cold-adapted bird species with complementary habitat requirements as
   model organisms. Based on species data and environmental information
   collected in 300 1-km(2) grid cells distributed across four mountain
   ranges in central Europe, we investigated (1) how species' occurrence is
   explained by climate, landscape, and vegetation, (2) to what extent
   climate change and climate-induced vegetation changes will affect
   habitat suitability, and (3) whether these changes could be compensated
   by adaptive habitat management. Species presence was modelled as a
   function of climate, landscape and vegetation variables under current
   climate; moreover, vegetation-climate relationships were assessed. The
   models were extrapolated to the climatic conditions of 2050, assuming
   the moderate IPCC-scenario A1B, and changes in species' occurrence
   probability were quantified. Finally, we assessed the maximum increase
   in occurrence probability that could be achieved by modifying one or
   multiple vegetation variables under altered climate conditions. Climate
   variables contributed significantly to explaining species occurrence,
   and expected climatic changes, as well as climate-induced vegetation
   trends, decreased the occurrence probability of all four species,
   particularly at the low-altitudinal margins of their distribution. These
   effects could be partly compensated by modifying single vegetation
   factors, but full compensation would only be achieved if several factors
   were changed in concert. The results illustrate the possibilities and
   limitations of adaptive species conservation management under climate
   change.}},

   birds}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Grassland birds have experienced greater population declines than any
   other guild of birds in North America, and yet we know little about
   habitat use and the affects of management during their non-breeding
   period on wintering grounds. The paucity of information on wintering
   grassland birds limits our ability to develop effective conservation
   strategies. We investigated habitat use by the winter bird community in
   grasslands with restored heterogeneity resulting from the interactive
   effects of fire and grazing. We used 500 m line transects distributed
   across patches (i.e., <13, 13-24, and >24 months post disturbance)
   resulting from spring burning with growing season grazing (April-Sept)
   and quantified avian relative abundance, community structure, and
   probability of patch occupancy while accounting for imperfect detection.
   Grassland structure that resulted from the fire-grazing interaction
   created heterogeneity among patches that influenced avian habitat use
   during winter. Generalist birds such as the Savannah Sparrow
   (Passerculus sandwichensis) and meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) were
   relatively common in all patch types while more specialized species such
   as the Smith's Longspur (Calcarius pictus) and Le Conte's Sparrow
   (Ammodramus leconteii) reached greatest abundance and probability of
   occupancy in the patches with the least and greatest time post
   disturbance, respectively. This research provides novel information on
   the response of wintering birds to restored ecological processes in
   grasslands and can improve efforts to create effective conservation
   strategies. Our findings add to a growing body of literature supporting
   the use of fire and grazing to create a shifting grassland mosaic that
   increases vegetation structural and compositional heterogeneity and
   maximizes native biodiversity within rangeland ecosystems through the
   conservation of natural patterns and processes.}},

Abstract = {{In many regions, planned burns are implemented to reduce fuel loads and
   mitigate wildfire risk; increasingly, they are also used to achieve
   conservation outcomes. However, there is uncertainty regarding how best
   to apply fire to landscapes in order to enhance biodiversity. The
   assumption that variable fire regimes are conducive to biodiversity
   conservation is appealing given its basis in landscape ecological
   theory, which predicts that spatially complex landscapes sustain greater
   biodiversity. This supposition is often used as a basis for fire
   management but has rarely been tested in the context of fire. We sought
   to test predicted positive relationships between bird diversity and both
   landscape diversity and configuration in the fire-prone Otway Ranges,
   southeast Australia, where vegetation transitions from treeless heath to
   tall open eucalypt forest across a rainfall gradient. We used a
   whole-of-landscape sampling approach, and mapped fire age classes and
   vegetation types separately within thirty-six 300 ha landscape sampling
   units. Bird surveys were undertaken at sub-sampling locations during two
   successive years, and presence-absence data were used to generate
   landscape-level estimates of species richness and turnover. Generalized
   linear mixed models, model selection and model averaging were used to
   investigate how birds responded to landscape diversity and configuration
   across the rainfall gradient. Species richness was positively associated
   with age class diversity, age class configuration and vegetation type
   diversity. Species turnover was positively associated with age class
   diversity in areas of lower rainfall but exhibited a negative response
   in areas of higher rainfall. Neither response variable was associated
   with vegetation type configuration. This study is one of few landscape
   scale analyses to provide empirical support for the widely held
   assumption that spatially variable fire regimes can increase the
   diversity of faunal assemblages. Further, our results demonstrated
   consistency in responses of species richness to fire-mediated landscape
   complexity across a rainfall gradient. Managers can potentially increase
   bird species richness by increasing both the diversity of fire age
   classes, and the complexity of age class configuration, within
   relatively small (300 ha) areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Refuges for birds in fire-prone landscapes: The influence of fire

Abstract = {{Unburnt patches within a fire boundary may act as refuges for fauna,
   facilitating their survival and persistence within fire-prone
   landscapes. Unburnt patches can arise due to various processes,
   including topographic variation, fire behaviour, and fuel reduction from
   recent burning. However, the value of unburnt patches of differing
   characteristics to the post-fire persistence of faunal communities has
   rarely been examined. In this study, we examined the relative importance
   of fire history and severity in predicting the occurrence of birds in a
   burnt forest landscape. We conducted surveys in mixed eucalypt forest of
   south-east Australia, 2-3 years after a high intensity, landscape-scale
   wildfire (>200,000 ha). Sites (n = 91) were selected to encompass fire
   severity ranging from unburnt patches to stands of crown-burnt forest.
   Fire history prior to the wildfire was defined as short (<3 years) or
   long (>20 years) time-since-fire. Unburnt patches of long
   time-since-fire were important avian refuges, harbouring 20-40\% more
   species, up to 56\% more individuals and an assemblage that was distinct
   from that at all sites burnt by the wildfire, including low severity
   ground fire. No difference in species richness or composition was
   detected between sites in unburnt patches of short or long
   time-since-fire; but bird abundance was 20\% lower in patches of short
   time-since-fire. Unburnt and ground-burnt patches of short
   time-since-fire provided habitat for more species and had distinct
   assemblages from that of severely burnt sites. For sites severely burnt
   in the wildfire, there was no difference in avifaunal richness,
   abundance or composition between those burnt twice in rapid succession
   and those not burnt for >20 years. Together, these results highlight:
   (1) the particular importance of unburnt vegetation remaining within
   fire-affected areas as faunal refuges, and (2) the potential for recent
   planned burns to contribute to refuge habitat if it avoids severe
   burning in a subsequent wildfire. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Improving Aquatic Warbler Population Assessments by Accounting for
   Imperfect Detection}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring programs designed to assess changes in population size over
   time need to account for imperfect detection and provide estimates of
   precision around annual abundance estimates. Especially for species
   dependent on conservation management, robust monitoring is essential to
   evaluate the effectiveness of management. Many bird species of temperate
   grasslands depend on specific conservation management to maintain
   suitable breeding habitat. One such species is the Aquatic Warbler
   (Acrocephalus paludicola), which breeds in open fen mires in Central
   Europe. Aquatic Warbler populations have so far been assessed using a
   complete survey that aims to enumerate all singing males over a large
   area. Because this approach provides no estimate of precision and does
   not account for observation error, detecting moderate population changes
   is challenging. From 2011 to 2013 we trialled a new line transect
   sampling monitoring design in the Biebrza valley, Poland, to estimate
   abundance of singing male Aquatic Warblers. We surveyed Aquatic Warblers
   repeatedly along 50 randomly placed 1-km transects, and used binomial
   mixture models to estimate abundances per transect. The repeated line
   transect sampling required 150 observer days, and thus less effort than
   the traditional `full count' approach (175 observer days). Aquatic
   Warbler abundance was highest at intermediate water levels, and
   detection probability varied between years and was influenced by
   vegetation height. A power analysis indicated that our line transect
   sampling design had a power of 68\% to detect a 20\% population change
   over 10 years, whereas raw count data had a 9\% power to detect the same
   trend. Thus, by accounting for imperfect detection we increased the
   power to detect population changes. We recommend to adopt the repeated
   line transect sampling approach for monitoring Aquatic Warblers in
   Poland and in other important breeding areas to monitor changes in
   population size and the effects of habitat management.}},

Abstract = {{AimTo quantify bird responses to a large unplanned fire, taking into
   consideration landscape-level fire severity and extent, pre-fire site
   detection frequency and environmental gradients.
   LocationSouth-eastern Australia.
   MethodsA major wildfire in 2009 coincided with a long-term study of
   birds and provided a rare opportunity to quantify bird responses to
   wildfire. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we modelled bird species
   richness and the detection frequency of individual species in response
   to a suite of explanatory variables, including (1) landscape-level fire
   severity and extent (2) pre-fire detection frequency, (3) site-level
   vegetation density and (4) environmental variables (e.g. elevation and
   topography).
   ResultsLandscape-level fire severity had strong effects on bird species
   richness and the detection frequency of the majority of bird species.
   These effects varied markedly between species; most responded negatively
   to amount of severely burned forest in the landscape, one negatively to
   the amount of moderately burned forest and one responded negatively to
   the total area of burned forest. Only one species - the Flame Robin -
   responded positively to the amount of burned forest. Relationships with
   landscape-scale fire extent changed over time for one species - the
   Brown Thornbill - with initially depressed rates of detection recovering
   after just 2years. The majority of species were significantly more
   likely to be detected in burned areas if they have been recorded there
   prior to the fire.
   Main conclusionsBirds responded strongly to the severity and spatial
   extent of fire. They also exhibited strong site fidelity even after
   severe wildfire which causes profound changes in vegetation cover - a
   response likely influenced by environmental features such as elevation
   and topography.}},

Abstract = {{Agroforestry for production and ecosystem health is a centuries-old form
   of ecosystem management used in many cultures indigenous to Mesoamerica,
   yet implications of such practices for biodiversity conservation are not
   well understood. Agroforestry systems were studied using interviews of
   farmers and field surveys of tree and bird diversity in three
   communities surrounding the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Campeche,
   Mexico to examine how differences in forest management practices affect
   forest biodiversity. Tree diversity and bird species richness were
   higher in areas surrounding communities that generated a greater variety
   of forest products and that cultivated ``restoration trees,{''} species
   planted to aid in regeneration of mature forest. We conclude that
   traditional ecosystem management methods in areas surrounding natural
   reserves as practiced by inhabitants who depend on resources in the
   reserve for survival are compatible with maintaining and perhaps
   enhancing diversity of bird and tree communities at the site level.}},

Title = {{Vegetation structure moderates the effect of fire on bird assemblages in
   a heterogeneous landscape}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{703-714}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Ecological theory predicting the impact of fire on ecological
   communities is typically focused on post-disturbance recovery processes
   or on disturbance-diversity dynamics. Yet the established relationship
   between vegetation structure and animal diversity could provide a
   foundation to predict the short-term effects of fire on biodiversity,
   but has rarely been explored. We tested the hypothesis that fire effects
   on bird assemblages would be moderated by increasing vegetation
   structure. We examined bird assemblages in burnt and unburnt sites at 1
   and 6 years after a wildfire, and compared richness and composition
   responses among and within three structurally distinct vegetation types
   in the same landscape: heath, woodland and forest. We found that
   short-term changes in bird assemblage composition were largest in simple
   heath vegetation and smallest in complex forest vegetation. The
   short-term change in species richness was larger in forest than in
   heath. We also found that among-site assemblage variability was greater
   shortly after fire in heath and woodland vegetation compared with forest
   vegetation. Our results indicate that complexity in vegetation
   structure, particularly overstorey cover, can act as an important
   moderator of fire effects on bird assemblages. Mechanisms for this
   response include a greater loss of structure in vegetation characterised
   by a single low stratum, and a proportionally greater change in bird
   species composition despite a smaller absolute change in species
   richness. We discuss our results in the context of a new conceptual
   model that predicts contrasting richness and composition responses of
   bird assemblages following disturbance along a gradient of increasing
   vegetation structure. This model brings a different perspective to
   current theories of disturbance, and has implications for understanding
   and managing the effects of fire on biodiversity in heterogeneous
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to estimate the effects of digging and usage
   of burrows by the European badger Meles meles and the red fox Vulpes
   vulpes on soil conditions and forest community. The study was conducted
   in pine and oak-pine forests of the Kampinos National Park (central
   Poland). Vegetation of burrow plots established at badger setts (N=19)
   and fox dens (N=14) was compared with vegetation of control plots
   located in similar but undisturbed habitat. Soil physicochemical
   properties at different disturbance levels (mounds, intermounds and
   reference areas) were also investigated. Animals considerably affected
   nutrient availability within the burrow plots, as they excavated
   material from deep soil horizons, which were less acidic and with higher
   K, Ca and Mg but poor in C and N. The effect was stronger in case of the
   badger, probably because it displaced larger amounts of material and
   disturbed wider areas. Despite the differences in the burrowing
   intensity, both carnivores triggered similar changes in plant
   communities. They increased herbaceous species richness and caused a
   shift in the herbaceous species composition (the burrow plots contained
   more fugitive species, i.e. short-living plants typical for disturbed
   environments, including ruderal forbs and nutrient demanding species).
   The carnivores also increased the species richness of fleshy-fruited
   shrubs and trees. In closing, badger setts and fox dens differed
   significantly from the forest matrix in terms of soil properties and
   vegetation. They contributed to habitat heterogeneity and biological
   diversity.}},

Title = {{Can snag creation benefit a primary cavity nester: Response to an
   experimental pulse in snag abundance}},

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Thresholds in response by cavity-nesting bird populations to variations
   in the snag resource are poorly understood. In addition, limited
   information exists on the value of artificially created snags for
   cavitynesting birds. Therefore, uncertainty exists in whether
   artificially created snags can yield a positive population response
   among snag-dependent birds. We used an experimental approach to assess
   the abundance and territory dynamics of a primary cavity nester, the
   red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), in response to three
   snag density treatments over an 8-year period following treatment
   installation in 2001. Treatments included snag removal, an unmanipulated
   control, and a snag pulse (snags experimentally created at 14 times
   control density). During the first two years post-treatment, abundance
   of red-headed woodpeckers did not differ among treatments. In 2004,
   woodpecker abundance in snag pulse plots surpassed that of other
   treatments and continued to increase until it peaked in 2007 (at nearly
   6 times than on control plots), after which it declined but remained
   greater than on control plots through 2009. Increased woodpecker
   abundance in high snag density areas was facilitated primarily by a
   decrease in home range size. Because the red-headed woodpecker is
   negatively affected by very low snag densities, yet is capable of
   exploiting pulses in the snag resource by dramatically increasing its
   abundance, we conclude that snag density regulates populations of this
   primary cavity nesting species and that snag creation can be an
   important tool in its conservation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation affect populations
   worldwide. For example, many bird populations of boreal forests have
   declined due to intensive forestry. To target conservation actions for
   such species, determining the key factors that affect their habitat
   selection is essential. Remote sensing methods provide highly potential
   means to measure habitat variables over large areas. We aim at
   identifying the key-features of habitats by utilizing remote sensing
   data. As a case example, we study the nest site selection of a primary
   hole-nesting passerine, the willow tit Poecile montanus, in a managed
   forest landscape. Using presence-absence data, we determine the most
   important habitat characteristics of the nest sites for three spatial
   scales by generalized linear mixed effect models. Our results highlight
   the importance of the availability of nesting sites - standing decaying
   deciduous trees - in the nest site selection of P. montanus. It seems to
   prefer moist habitats with high densities of deciduous trees and to
   avoid open areas, but does not require mature or intact habitats. Most
   of the nest site selection seems to occur within small scales. In this
   case, remote sensing data alone was insufficient for producing reliable
   models, but adding information of an ecologically important feature from
   direct field surveys greatly improved model performances. For the
   conservation and maintenance of dead wood dependent species, changes in
   forestry practices are necessary to keep the key characteristics of the
   habitat. Most importantly, continuous availability of standing decaying
   wood should be secured.}},

Title = {{Impact of cutting date on carabids and spiders in a wet meadow}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{185}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The impact of different cutting dates on two dominant groups of
   ground-dwelling arthropods (carabids and spiders) was assessed.
   Short-term impacts were assessed by comparing them before and after
   cutting. Arthropods were collected by pitfall traps located in three
   plots with different cutting dates between June and August and one uncut
   control plot. Trapping was performed during a 4-month period in the
   spring and summer 2011. In total, 26,392 spiders and 12,278 carabids,
   representing 56 and 82 species respectively, were collected. Overall,
   the effects of cutting were negative and mostly visible in the long term
   for carabids, with reduced abundances and species richness in cut plots,
   and in the short-term for spiders; several parameters (proportion of
   predators and polyphagous species, and body length) decreased after
   cutting while remaining stable in the control. Long-term cutting effects
   revealed almost no differences between plots cut at different dates
   whereas the short-term effects decreased slightly over time, with
   respect to the overall phenology of both groups. In conclusion, this
   study underlines the fact that cutting has drastic effects on
   ground-dwelling arthropods, and even late dates, which are supposedly
   positive for other animals like breeding birds, are deleterious for
   highly diverse and species-rich grassland groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Indicators for genetic and phenotypic diversity of Dactylis glomerata in
   Swiss permanent grassland}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{181-191}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Genetic diversity is the fundamental level of biological diversity. In
   the discussion of biological diversity in agricultural ecosystems, this
   level is of major importance, but often neglected. Tools for the direct
   measurement of genetic diversity, especially in highly diverse systems
   such as permanent grassland, are demanding and the relationship between
   genetic diversity and management practices or environmental factors is
   poorly understood. Genetic diversity of the common grassland species
   Dactylis glomerata was assessed using genetic diversity indices based on
   29 SSR markers. Phenotypic diversity within and among selected
   populations was evaluated in a replicated field experiment based on ten
   phenotypic plant characters of agronomic relevance. Twenty populations
   of D. glomerata from permanent grassland from the Swiss Alps were
   included in the analysis. We investigated correlations between genetic
   diversity (genotypic/phenotypic) and farming system
   (conventional/organic), management intensity (intensive/extensive),
   three plant species diversity indices, five ecological and five habitat
   parameters at collection sites. Genetic and phenotypic variability
   within and among populations of D. glomerata was large. The intensive
   management of permanent grassland reduced genotype diversity and genetic
   variation of the plant character `flowering time', while conventional
   farming systems increased the average expected heterozygosity within
   populations of D. glomerata. Populations from extensively managed
   sampling sites accommodated significantly smaller D. glomerata
   individuals. SSR markers and phenotypic characters proved to be valuable
   tools for the assessment of genetic and phenotypic diversity considering
   different perspectives. Management parameters were the main factors
   influencing genotypic diversity and phenotypic characteristics in
   natural populations of D. glomerata in permanent grassland. (C) 2013

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{170}},
Pages = {{110-119}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Conifer plantations are thought to provide lower-quality habitat for
   many old forest specialists because of their simplified stand structure
   and relative paucity of habitat elements such as dead wood. However, at
   the landscape scale, plantations may have a positive influence on
   biodiversity, e.g. through landscape supplementation. Here, we test the
   quality of older spruce plantations as breeding habitat for forest birds
   at local and landscape levels. We compared bird species assemblages of
   40-50 year-old native spruce plantations with those of mature,
   naturally-regenerated conifer forests using a Bayesian hierarchical
   model, which accounts for imperfect detection of species. Median species
   richness was higher in naturally-regenerated conifer stands than in
   spruce plantations (29.2 vs. 24.4; 95\% probability interval = 3.9-5.7),
   which probably reflects the absence of primary cavity nesters from many
   stations within plantations. In contrast, more species of canopy nesters
   were detected in plantations. The proportion of naturally-regenerated
   conifer forest in the landscape was a predictor of species occurrence
   for five ground nesters, four primary cavity nesters, and two weak
   excavators. Older spruce plantations did not provide suitable habitat
   for some species, mainly cavity nesters. Snag densities in plantations
   were lower than the estimated threshold requirements for several
   cavity-nesting birds. Hence, mature, naturally-regenerated forest
   patches are essential components of intensively-managed forest
   landscapes to maintain rich forest bird assemblages. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Population declines of birds that breed in early-successional shrubland
   habitat are of great concern to conservationists throughout the
   northeastern United States. To help increase the efficiency and
   effectiveness of efforts to conserve these species and their habitats,
   we studied birds in temporary forest openings created through even-aged
   timber harvest, and permanent wildlife openings maintained through
   mechanical treatment and prescribed burning in the Northern
   Appalachians, USA in 2010 and 2011. We assessed the effects of treatment
   method, time since last treatment, and retained tree cover on shrubland
   bird abundance and habitat conditions. Burned and mechanically treated
   wildlife openings differed only in grass and fern cover. Both types of
   wildlife openings had more grasses and forbs, and less bare ground than
   silvicultural openings. Six out of 8 focal bird species were less
   abundant in silvicultural openings than in wildlife openings. In
   contrast, abundance of only 1 species differed between burned and
   mechanically treated wildlife openings. Silvicultural openings supported
   the same species as wildlife openings, indicating that this management
   option could be used in place of more costly wildlife opening
   management. However, because birds were more abundant in wildlife
   openings, maintaining the current population size of shrubland birds
   under a management strategy based entirely on silviculture would require
   a 50-300\% increase in the area of silvicultural openings, depending on
   the species. Individual species peaked in abundance at different times
   post treatment, indicating that managers must maintain a range of
   early-successional conditions across the landscape to provide habitat
   for the entire suite of shrubland birds. Six species exhibited a
   negative relationship with the basal area of retained conifer cover, and
   7 species with deciduous tree cover, indicating that the retention of
   overstory trees in openings reduced their utility to early-successional
   birds. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society, 2014.}},

   (MPB) infestations. Forest management practices that reduce the amount
   of disturbed forest may lead to habitat loss for Black-backed
   Woodpeckers, which have recently been petitioned for listing under the
   Endangered Species Act. We studied home range size and resource
   selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers occupying habitat created by
   summer wildfire, fall prescribed fire, and MPB infestations in the Black
   Hills, South Dakota. We studied home range size and resource selection
   by attaching radio-transmitters to adult Black-backed Woodpeckers. We
   estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n = 28
   in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 19 in habitat created by fall
   prescribed fire, and n = 27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource
   selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian
   framework (n = 5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 16 in
   habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 8 in habitat created by
   MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2 year post summer
   wildfire habitat (mean home range size = 79 ha) and 2-year post fall
   prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size = 143 ha). Home range size
   was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size = 307 ha) and
   was greatest in 3-4 year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home
   range size = 430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size =
   460 ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a
   tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal
   area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest
   1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative
   value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more
   important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of
   1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200 ha by
   exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This
   recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in
   summer wildfires <200 ha and retaining at least 50\% of summer wildfires
   >400 ha. Ideally, recently burned forest patches should be composed of
   >= 27 m(2) basal area/ha of trees that burned at moderate or high
   severity, with at least 40\% of the basal area composed of trees >= 27

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of local habitat structure and surrounding
   landscape characteristics (proportion of land use types and
   connectedness) on species density and composition of bird communities
   inhabiting the interior of young tree plantations on former cropland in
   central Spain, which were motivated by the Common Agrarian Policy.
   Variation of species density (number of species/0.78 ha) among tree
   plantations showed different environmental associations across seasons:
   local habitat was more important than landscape characteristics during
   winter, whereas they were similarly important during spring. Species
   density increased with the development of the tree layer in winter and
   with the presence of urban areas around tree plantations and cover of
   the herbaceous layer within them in the breeding season. We identified
   15 species that exhibit high relative abundance in woodland habitats
   within the Mesomediterranean region of Central Spain that were absent in
   both seasons in the studied tree plantations, which were an attractive
   habitat for urban exploiter species but an unfavorable habitat for the
   regional forest species pool except for forest generalist species.
   Composition of bird assemblages was more related to local habitat
   structure than to landscape characteristics around tree plantations and
   was rather similar in winter and spring seasons. The very different
   effects of local habitat and landscape characteristics on bird
   communities make difficult suggesting management practices with positive
   effects for all avifauna species during the entire year. We conclude
   that the small size and low maturity of the studied tree plantations do
   not contribute to enhancing the bird diversity value of current CAP aids
   to afforest former cropland with pines in the Mediterranean region.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing may negatively impact bird nesting in wetland
   habitats. This study evaluated the effect of grazing on the nests of the
   Oriental pratincole (Glareola maldivarum) along the grassland of a
   wetland at six study sites with different densities of grazing cattle
   and buffalo. Species richness, density, cover, and height of vegetation
   in the study areas were different (P < 0.05). The density of cattle and
   buffalo at the various sites affected vegetation composition and amount,
   which in turn influenced bird nest density. The estimated trampling
   rates, number of fledglings, and number of trampled eggs were different
   among study sites (P < 0.05). The density of cattle and buffalo has an
   influence on nest failure rates. The factors that influenced the
   mortality rates of the Oriental pratincole were trampling and unhatched
   eggs. Only 48.5\% of the nests were successful at sites where cattle and
   buffalo continuously grazed in the grasslands at high densities. Thus,
   increases in the density of cattle and buffalo will reduce the number of
   nests of the Oriental pratincole, which may result in a reduction of the
   overall population in the future.}},

Title = {{Are invasive species drivers of native species decline or passengers of
   habitat modification? A case study of the impact of the common myna
   (Acridotheres tristis) on Australian bird species}},
Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Habitat modification and invasive species are significant drivers of
   biodiversity decline. However, distinguishing between the impacts of
   these two drivers on native species can be difficult. For example,
   habitat modification may reduce native species abundance, while an
   invasive species may take advantage of the new environment. This
   scenario has been described as the driver-passenger model, with
   passengers' taking advantage of habitat modification and drivers'
   causing native species decline. Therefore, research must incorporate
   both habitat modification and invasive species impact to successfully
   investigate native species decline. In this paper, we used the common
   myna (Acridotheres tristis) as a case study to investigate the
   driver-passenger model. We investigated changes in bird abundance, over
   2 years, in relation to different habitat types and common myna
   abundance. We hypothesized that the common myna is both a passenger of
   habitat change and a driver of some bird species decline. Our results
   indicated that the abundance of many native species is greater in high
   tree density nature reserves, while the common myna was uncommon in
   these areas. Common myna abundance was almost three times higher in
   urban areas than nature reserves and declined rapidly as tree density in
   nature reserves increased. Our findings indicated that the common myna
   is primarily a passenger of habitat change. However, we also observed
   negative associations between common myna abundance and some bird
   species. We stress the importance of simultaneously investigating both
   invasive species impact and habitat modification. We suggest habitat
   restoration could be a useful tool for both native species recovery and
   invasive species control. Understanding the drivers of native species
   decline will help inform impact mitigation and direct further research.}},

Abstract = {{In central Argentina, Serrano forest has a long history of fire
   disturbance; however, the impact of fire on avifauna remains unknown. We
   compared the avian-habitat relationships in forest patches with low,
   moderate, and high fire regimes using a community-level (species
   richness, abundance, ordination and guilds) and species-level (indicator
   species analysis) approach. In patches under each fire condition, we
   recorded bird community composition, richness and abundance, and
   different vegetation structure variables. The site under high-severity
   fire regime was structurally poor and had been converted from original
   forest to dense grassland. There, diversity of bird community was low,
   retaining approximately 30 \% of the species present in the least
   impacted site. Avian assemblage was dominated by generalist and open
   area birds. Guilds were underrepresented, showing an important reduction
   of foliage granivorous, nectarivorous, omnivores, and foliage and bark
   insectivorous, and absence of fly-catchers. Moreover, low abundance of
   forest understory, midstory, and canopy species and of birds belonging
   to open and closed nesting guilds was detected. By contrast, under low
   and moderate-severity fire regimes highest bird diversity as well as
   highest representativeness of most guilds was observed. Forest bird
   species were strongly associated with low fire disturbance, whereas
   moderate fire disturbance was characterized by the presence of forest
   and generalist species. Given the critical conservation status of
   Serrano forest in Crdoba, Argentina, habitat restoration and protection
   of forest relicts could be suitable measures to promote avifauna
   preservation.}},

Title = {{Conservation management of moorland: a case study of the effectiveness
   of a combined suite of management prescriptions which aim to enhance
   breeding bird populations}},

Abstract = {{Capsule A specific suite of moorland management prescriptions had no
   clear positive impact on breeding birds over ten years.Aims To test the
   expectation that a combination of grazing, and burning/cutting
   manipulations, the blocking of drains (affecting habitat quality and
   foraging resources) and the control of some predators (affecting
   survival and breeding success) will lead to an increase in numbers of
   breeding birds on 9.5km(2) of moorland in Scotland.Methods General
   Additive Modelling was used to compare bird population trends at the
   managed site against a control' of moorland-specific background trends
   (spatially and temporally smoothed) derived from an extensive UK-wide
   bird monitoring programme. Changes in vegetation, the effectiveness of
   predation control and influences of disturbance were also examined to
   attempt to identify potential mechanisms for population size
   changes.Results Breeding populations for most species showed either a
   more negative trend at the managed site (Red Grouse, Skylark and Meadow
   Pipit) or no significant difference was detected (European Golden
   Plover, Eurasian Curlew, Common Snipe and Winter Wren) when compared to
   moorland-specific background trends. Stonechats and Carrion Crows
   increased, despite the latter being actively removed as part of
   predation control measures. No general change in the vegetation was
   detected and no reasonable habitat-based cause for the observed declines
   in some species was apparent. There was also no convincing evidence for
   a negative effect on moorland birds of disturbance from a nearby mine.
   As crow control failed to stem their increase and with supportive
   evidence for a decline in the breeding success of Red Grouse, it is
   suggested that the control of predation was ineffective and may have
   contributed to some species declines.Conclusion There has been wide
   advocacy of, and considerable resources (e.g. through agri-environment
   schemes) devoted to, moorland habitat management for birds and yet
   declines continue. However, there are practical difficulties of
   establishing management that is effective in increasing moorland bird
   abundance. It appears likely that in areas where those birds are
   vulnerable to predation and its control is not effective, expectations
   of increasing bird populations in response to habitat management alone
   may be unrealistic.}},

Abstract = {{Arable weeds are a key component of the biodiversity of agroecosystems,
   but have faced a marked decline due to agricultural intensification.
   Recently, the crop edge has been considered as a potential refugia for
   many species. Indeed, weed species richness and abundance are higher in
   the crop edge than in the field margin and the field core. In this study
   we question whether weed functional diversity also varies among field
   elements and whether it is higher in the crop edge. We studied the
   interspecific and intraspecific variation of three functional traits
   (specific leaf area, canopy height and above-ground biomass) related to
   the response of weeds to competition and to agricultural practices, for
   seven weed species sampled in the crop edge, the field margin and the
   field core area in four winter-wheat fields. We show that trait values
   varied significantly with the species, the field element and their
   interaction. Within the field, all species had high specific leaf area,
   low canopy height and biomass, suggesting a shade-tolerance syndrome
   that could be a strategy in response to both competition with the crop
   and the disturbances induced by agricultural practices. In the crop
   edge, where the functional variation was the highest, two distinct
   functional strategies were observed, suggesting a resource partitioning
   under the predominance of weed-weed competition. In conclusion, the crop
   edge plays a key role in sustaining weed diversity, mostly because of
   its intermediate environmental properties that allow the coexistence of
   weeds with different ecological strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Some forest restoration techniques treat remnant shrubs as competitors
   of newly planted tree seedlings, often clearing shrubs and weeds before
   trees are planted, but such plants may have significant value in
   attracting seed dispersers. In this study we examined the role of
   remnant trees and shrubs in grassland as a tool for passive and low cost
   ecological restoration. We determined the species density and abundance
   of both seed rain and its vertebrate dispersers in relation to different
   microhabitats (shrub-like vs. tree-like vegetation vs. grassland
   patches) in a 20-ha clearing of weeds mixed with early successional
   woody vegetation in a lowland evergreen forest in southern Thailand. We
   quantified seed rain from 60 seed traps placed in each microhabitat, and
   compared differences in seed abundance and species richness, while also
   examining the effect of distance from the forest edge. We found that
   seed rain abundance and seed species richness were significantly
   different among microhabitats. Seed rain was highest under shrubs,
   followed by under trees and then grassland, whereas seed species
   richness was highest under trees, followed by under shrubs, and
   grassland. Distance from the forest edge affected seed rain abundance
   under trees only. Birds (bulbuls and flowerpeckers) were the main
   dispersers of seeds at trees and shrubs respectively, while bats were
   the primary dispersers for the grassland patches. Different seed
   disperser groups appear to have complementary roles, such that sites
   containing a mixture of vegetation types including early successional
   vegetation may attract significantly more seed dispersers.}},

Title = {{Vegetative and Bird Community Response to Management in a Mountain
   Longleaf Pine Forest}},
Journal = {{NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{8-23}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Over the last century, logging, land conversion, and fire suppression
   have reduced longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystems to a small
   fraction of their original range. Fire suppression, in particular, has
   facilitated encroachment by non-fire-tolerant trees and heavy litter
   buildup, leading to shifts in the native plant and animal community. In
   2001, efforts were initiated to re-establish parts of Berry College's
   (Floyd County, GA) fire-suppressed mountain longleaf pine forest using
   combinations of prescribed fire, clear-cutting, planting, and herbicide
   application. We designed this study to determine the effects of
   management practices thus far on vegetation structure and the bird
   community. In 2009, vegetation structure data were collected in longleaf
   pine stands comprising three management classes ranging from low-to
   high-intensity management. Bird surveys were conducted from summer 2009
   to spring 2010, and avifaunal community structure was related to
   vegetative characteristics within each stand. Unmanaged stands were
   strongly associated with common omnivorous, ground-foraging, and
   canopy-nesting birds of mixed woodlands. Intermediately managed stands
   contained mostly birds of mixed diet and aerial-and bark-feeding cavity
   nesters. Heavily managed stands were strongly associated with insect-,
   vertebrate-, seed-, and fruit-eating ground and shrub nesters, with
   several sightings of the near-threatened Bachman's sparrow (Peucaea
   aestivalis Lichtenstein). Intensity of management was positively
   correlated with canopy openness, understory development, and low litter
   levels. These vegetative differences helped explain the bird community
   makeup. We provide baseline data for assessing the impacts of management
   of mountain longleaf pine and similarly fire-suppressed forests on avian
   abundance and species richness.}},

Title = {{Carnivore distributions across chaparral habitats exposed to wildfire
   and rural housing in southern California}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{591-600}},
Abstract = {{Chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in southern California support
   biologically diverse plant and animal communities. However, native plant
   and animal species within these shrubland systems are increasingly
   exposed to human-caused wildfires and an expansion of the human-wildland
   interface. Few data exist to evaluate the effects of fire and
   anthropogenic pressures on plant and animal communities found in these
   environments. This is particularly true for carnivore communities. To
   address this knowledge gap, we collected detection-non-detection data
   with motion-sensor cameras and track plots to measure carnivore
   occupancy patterns following a large, human-caused wildfire (1134 km(2))
   in eastern San Diego County, California, USA, in 2003. Our focal species
   set included coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon
   cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus) and striped skunk (Mephitis
   mephitis). We evaluated the influence on species occupancies of the
   burned environment (burn edge, burn interior and unburned areas),
   proximity of rural homes, distance to riparian area and elevation. Gray
   fox occupancies were the highest overall, followed by striped skunk,
   coyote and bobcat. The three species considered as habitat and foraging
   generalists (gray fox, coyote, striped skunk) were common in all
   conditions. Occupancy patterns were consistent through time for all
   species except coyote, whose occupancies increased through time. In
   addition, environmental and anthropogenic variables had weak effects on
   all four species, and these responses were species-specific. Our results
   helped to describe a carnivore community exposed to frequent fire and
   rural human residences, and provide baseline data to inform fire
   management policy and wildlife management strategies in similar
   fire-prone ecosystems.}},

Title = {{How does woody succession affect population densities of passerine birds
   in New Zealand drylands?}},
Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{257-267}},
Abstract = {{The density of shrubs is increasing in many dry grassland ecosystems
   worldwide. In the dry interior of the South Island, New Zealand,
   secondary succession generates novel woody communities, as shrubs
   colonise anthropogenic grasslands where fire frequency has decreased.
   The avifauna of this dry region is also novel, with many indigenous
   birds extinct, extirpated or uncommon, and exotic species predominant.
   We studied how succession from grassland to shrubland habitats affects
   the abundance of dryland birds, by estimating population densities of
   nine common exotic and indigenous passerine bird species in dryland
   habitats in grassland, mixed grassland shrubland and shrubland, at three
   sites in Central Otago, South Island. We used distance sampling along
   line transects to estimate densities. Generally, succession from
   grassland to forest leads to decreased numbers of granivorous birds and
   feeding generalists, and increased numbers of insectivores. We therefore
   predicted that density of birds in five guilds would change as follows
   during succession to woodier habitats: (1) granivores: decrease, (2) a
   primarily ground-nesting, ground-feeding granivore-insectivore:
   decrease; (3) a tree- and shrub-nesting granivore-insectivore: increase;
   (4) ground-feeding insectivores: increase; (5) indigenous insectivores:
   increase. Our predictions were supported for only one guild.
   Yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella) (exotic primarily ground-nesting,
   ground-feeding granivore insectivore that prefers open country) declined
   in density as woody-species frequency increased. Exotic European
   goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) and common redpoll (C. flammea)
   (granivores) were most abundant at intermediate woodiness. Densities of
   other guilds did not vary consistently with woodiness. We conclude that
   continued succession to shrubland in Central Otago will have little
   effect on densities of many common exotic passerine birds, but may lead
   to local declines in yellowhammer, and ultimately goldfinch and redpoll.
   Our density estimates for silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) and grey
   warbler (Gerygone igata) were lower than densities reported in forests;
   therefore later stages of succession may benefit these widespread
   indigenous insectivores.}},

Title = {{Temporal changes in the breeding bird community caused by post-fire
   treatments after the Samcheok forest fire in Korea}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Samcheok forest fire of April 2000 was the biggest stand-replacing
   fire recorded in Korea, and led to the largest-scale salvage logging
   operation (performed until 2005) ever implemented. We investigated the
   effects of the treatments performed after the fire on the breeding bird
   community in 2002-2005 (the management period) and 2006-2008 (the
   post-management period). A total of 75 line transect surveys resulted in
   660 detections of 54 species in undisturbed stands (CO), in burned and
   naturally restored stands (NI), and in burned and logged stands (IT).
   Four species (Parus major, Aegithalos caudatus, Dendrocopos kizuki, and
   Parus ater) were identified as indicator species in CO which showed no
   temporal changes in bird communities and habitat structure. Among the
   various stand treatments, the standardized species richness was highest
   in CO (11.6 +/- A 4.6 species/transect in 2002-2005, 12.1 +/- A 3.5 in
   2006-2008), and this richness did not change over time. On the other
   hand, low richness was observed in NI (6.8 +/- A 2.6 in 2002-2005, 9.6
   +/- A 2.3 in 2006-2008), and the lowest richness was seen in IT (5.0 +/-
   A 2.4 in 2002-2005, 6.1 +/- A 1.8 in 2006-2008), but both of these
   increased over time. Although the bird abundances in NI and IT were
   lower than those in CO (38.0 +/- A 27.7 birds/transect in 2002-2005,
   31.3 +/- A 10.9 in 2006-2008), the abundances in NI (15.1 +/- A 8.6 in
   2002-2005, 17.6 +/- A 11.4 in 2006-2008) and IT (11.7 +/- A 8.3 in
   2002-2005, 10.0 +/- A 4.6 in 2006-2008) were not significantly
   different. There was no significant difference in abundance between time
   periods for any of the stand treatments. These results imply that NI
   (i.e., no salvage logging) allows greater bird richness but not
   abundance to be recovered compared to IT. No indicator species was
   consistently present in NI throughout the two time periods covered due
   to the rapid regrowth of vegetation, but four open-habitat dwellers
   (Falco tinnunculus, Phoenicurus auroreus, Emberiza cioides, and Sturnus
   cineraceus) colonized IT during the post-management period. The bird
   assemblage in IT, as assessed by canonical correspondence analysis,
   shifted to open habitats, while the avifauna in NI became similar to
   that in CO over time. While post-fire treatment can provide new
   colonization opportunities for open-habitat dwellers, the slow
   colonization process, the low species richness, and the low bird
   abundance observed in large areas of IT indicate that post-fire
   treatment using salvage logging inhibits the restoration of forest bird
   communities by producing a poorer breeding bird community that is very
   different from the original one. Based on these lessons from the
   response to the Samcheok forest fire, we suggest that preserving as much
   of the disturbed forest as possible is essential, and that the current
   approach to post-fire treatment-intensive salvage logging-needs to be
   revised to ensure the effective restoration of breeding bird communities
   in disturbed temperate pine forests.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of burrow digging and habitation by the
   European badger (Meles meles) and the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) on soil
   properties and the plant community. The vegetation of control plots
   located in a similar but undisturbed habitat was compared with that of
   18 burrow plots established at badger setts (N = 9) and fox dens (N = 9)
   in a lowland forest area in Poland. Soil physicochemical properties at
   different disturbance levels (mounds, intermounds and reference areas)
   were also investigated. The animals altered nutrient availability in the
   burrow plots considerably by excavating material from deep soil horizons
   that were less acidic and higher in K, Ca, Mg and available P but poorer
   in C and N. The effect was stronger for the badger, probably because it
   displaced larger amounts of material and disturbed wider areas. The
   activity of the two carnivores induced similar changes in plant
   communities. They increased herbaceous species richness and caused a
   shift in the herbaceous species composition: versus the control plots,
   the burrow plots contained more fugitive species (short-living plants
   typical for disturbed environments), among which ruderal forbs,
   including nutrient-demanding species, dominated. The carnivores also
   increased the species richness of fleshy-fruited shrubs and trees. The
   primary reason for this was probably not burrowing but endozoochorous
   seed dispersal. Overall, the results indicate that the badger setts and
   fox dens differ significantly from the forest matrix in terms of soil
   and vegetation parameters, and that they contribute to habitat
   heterogeneity and biological diversity.}},

Abstract = {{River restoration projects are increasingly common, but assessments of
   ecological responses and overall success of the vast majority of efforts
   are lacking. Information on potential positive ecological effects of
   restoration efforts can be used to justify further projects and refine
   methods. We examined responses of multiple trophic levels, aquatic
   insects and riparian birds, to a series of rock weirs installed in an
   Illinois river to stabilize the channel. We quantified adult insect
   emergence and performed weekly point counts of birds in spring at four
   weir and four non-weir (control) sites. Emerging insect abundance was
   higher at control sites, but species richness and diversity were higher
   at weir sites. Total insect emergence production did not differ between
   site types, but emergence production of larger-bodied taxa was higher at
   weir sites. Ordinations and analysis of similarity indicated differences
   in insect and bird assemblages between site types. Birds showed a
   positive numerical response to large-bodied emerging insects, and total
   bird abundance was higher at weir sites. Clutch size and feeding rates
   of a focal bird species, Prothonotaria citrea (Prothonotary Warbler),
   did not differ between sites, but the number of hatchlings and
   fledglings was higher at control sites. Molothrus ater (cowbird)
   parasitism was higher at weir sites, likely because of increased edge
   habitat associated with weir construction activities. Results show
   positive ecological impacts of in-stream restoration and provide
   justification for further efforts. However, forest disturbance
   associated with construction could offset some benefits to some species,
   and thus refinements to procedures may be necessary.}},

Title = {{Biotic congruence in humid tropical forests: A multi-taxa examination of
   spatial distribution and responses to forest disturbance}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{572-581}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity is vital for fully functional natural habitats, and the
   maintenance of biodiversity through effective conservation planning
   depends on reliable information on its spatial distribution and response
   to anthropogenic disturbance. However, gathering extensive data on
   multiple species is a difficult task, due to logistical and financial
   constraints and the lack of taxonomic expertise. A common resource to
   address this hurdle is the use of surrogate taxa: focusing on a limited
   set of species that provide information that can be extrapolated to
   wider patterns of biodiversity and ecological integrity. We examine this
   by (1) testing if species richness proportions among different
   taxa/methodology employed (ants, birds sampled with point counts, birds
   sampled with mist nets, dung beetles, trees and saplings) will be
   similar across different undisturbed Amazonian forests, and (2) if
   patterns of local congruence in richness and community composition are
   consistent in undisturbed forest and gradients of forest disturbed by
   forest fires. Our results indicate that species richness, across field
   sites, was positively associated at a regional scale. At a local scale,
   richness and community composition in unburned forest showed virtually
   no correlation between the taxa, but the inclusion of samples from
   burned forest increased the number of significant correlations.
   Vegetation (trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height) composition was
   the best indicator of overall community composition of all other taxa.
   The congruence of regional patterns of richness is likely a consequence
   of macro variables such as climate and biogeographical history, and
   should not be extrapolated to local scales. Although the use of
   community composition metrics increased congruence at a local scale, we
   highlight the importance of using a broad ecological gradient. (C) 2013

Title = {{Nest distribution and nest habitat of the Tibetan Partridge (Perdix
   hodgsoniae) near Lhasa, Tibet}},
Journal = {{AVIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Little is hitherto known about the breeding ecology of the
   Tibetan Partridge (Perdix hodgsoniae) which is endemic to the Tibetan
   plateau. Here we describe nest densities, inter-nest distances and
   general nest site characteristics in this gallinaceous bird species and
   explore the possibilities that certain shrub and plant types are
   preferred as nest surroundings.
   Method: A total of 56 nests were found over three breeding seasons near
   Lhasa, Tibet. Nest site characteristics were compared with random
   control plots and the proportions of specific plant species covering
   nests were compared with their estimated general occurrence in the study
   area.
   Results: Nest density in the two years with highest search effort was
   estimated at 1.43/km(2) and 1.04/km(2) but was clearly higher in the
   part of the study area facing north (1.86-2.35/km(2)) than that facing
   south (0.11-0.34/km(2)). The average nearest neighbour distance of nests
   was about 300 m. Nests were situated in relatively lush vegetation and
   covered by a total of eight shrub species and three herbs. In contrast
   to previous reports, Caragana shrub did not constitute an important part
   of the nest habitat. The flowering, non-thorny bush Potentilla fruticosa
   was significantly over-represented as nest cover, while Rhododendron
   nivale was similarly under-represented. Nest bush foliage covered a
   larger area of ground, and the shrub surrounding nests was generally
   denser, than in control samples. Also, nests were placed closer to paths
   and in areas with lower densities of Yak (Bos grunniens) dung than in
   control samples. Except that soil temperatures were lower on nest sites
   than on control sites, micro-climate variables measured in this study
   did not differ between nest sites and control plots.
   Conclusions: Opportunity for nest concealment is probably an important
   quality of the nest habitat in Tibetan Partridges, yet it is unclear why
   the species should prefer P. fruticosa as nest cover. It is possible
   that nest sites are chosen to secure escape exits in the case of
   approaching predators and to reduce the risk of nest trampling. Tibetan
   Partridges may also select nest sites according to micro-climate, either
   directly or indirectly through climate-related differences in shrub
   vegetation.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{280}},

Abstract = {{Although increasing efforts are being made to restore tropical forests,
   little information is available regarding the time scales required for
   carbon and plant biodiversity to recover to the values associated with
   undisturbed forests. To address this knowledge gap, we carried out a
   meta-analysis comparing data from more than 600 secondary tropical
   forest sites with nearby undisturbed reference forests. Above-ground
   biomass approached equivalence to reference values within 80 years since
   last disturbance, whereas below-ground biomass took longer to recover.
   Soil carbon content showed little relationship with time since
   disturbance. Tree species richness recovered after about 50 years. By
   contrast, epiphyte richness did not reach equivalence to undisturbed
   forests. The proportion of undisturbed forest trees and epiphyte species
   found in secondary forests was low and changed little over time. Our
   results indicate that carbon pools and biodiversity show different
   recovery rates under passive, secondary succession and that colonization
   by undisturbed forest plant species is slow. Initiatives such as the
   Convention on Biological Diversity and REDD+ should therefore encourage
   active management to help to achieve their aims of restoring both carbon

Abstract = {{Many woodpecker species are known to be sensitive to the removal of dead
   wood. In 1999-2001 and 2007-2009 woodpeckers and dead wood abundance
   were studied in coniferous stands of the Biaowiea Forest, Poland.
   Transects (3.9-6 km long) were established in three zones of different
   types of management: 1) primeval, unmanaged stands (BNP); 2) partially
   managed nature reserve (RES); 3) heavily managed stands (MAN).
   Woodpeckers were counted along transects three times per season, and
   tree stand measurements (number of standing and fallen trees, diameter
   at breast height, volume of fallen logs) were made once every three
   years. Woodpecker indices were highest in BNP and lowest in RES in both
   three-year study periods. The highest number of species (seven) was
   recorded in RES. Indices of four woodpeckers including two focal species
   (Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus and White-backed Woodpecker
   Dendrocopos leucotos) were dependent on the basal area of dead standing
   trees. The same relation was found for the whole woodpecker assemblage.
   The highest indices were recorded in BNP, where the highest density of
   dead standing trees was recorded, and the lowest in the MAN transect
   with the lowest density of dead trees. However in the RES plot the
   amount of dead wood was much lower than in the national park. We
   recommend that the management regulations in Polish nature reserves be
   changed. In coniferous reserves, it would be best to leave at least 2
   m(2) ha(-1) (basal area) of freshly killed spruce Picea sp. after each
   bark beetle outbreak.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have suggested that early successional habitats are
   important for fall migrant and resident birds. In light of this, we
   studied habitat relationships, preferred fruiting shrub species, and
   fruit consumption by birds in early successional habitats during the
   fall at Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge, Alabama, New York, USA. We
   used transects to count birds in 12 shrub and 6 early successional
   forest sites during 2008-2009, and collected data to construct habitat
   models. We examined frugivory using a paired open/enclosed fruit branch
   experiment and by analyzing fecal samples of birds captured in mist
   nets. More fall songbirds were detected in shrublands than in forests
   across the 2 years, although forests with well-developed understories
   also had high detection levels. Total bird abundance was positively
   related to fruiting species richness and negatively related to small
   woody stem (0.0-2.5 cm) abundance. Abundance of American Robins (Turdus
   migratorius) was positively related to total shrub cover and fruit
   abundance on common buckthorns (Rhamnus cathartica), and negatively
   related to small and large (2.5-8.0 cm) stem abundance. Abundance of
   Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) was positively related to
   fruiting shrub species richness. Abundance of Song Sparrows (Melospiza
   melodia) was positively related to gray dogwood (Cornus racemosa) fruit
   abundance, and negatively related to small stem abundance and bella
   honeysuckle (Lonicera X bella) fruit abundance. Fecal analysis suggested
   that birds as a whole disproportionately consumed fruit species relative
   to availability, and consumed more bella honeysuckle and common
   buckthorn than gray dogwood. Fewer fruits remained on open branches than
   enclosed branches, suggesting birds actively consumed fruits at our
   sites. Our results suggest that fall migrant and resident songbirds as a
   whole benefit more from mature shrublands that contain a diversity of
   fruiting shrub species than from early successional forests. While these
   characteristics may benefit the suite of fall migrants and residents at
   our location, appropriate habitat management may differ for other
   locations or migratory species.}},

Abstract = {{To halt biodiversity loss in the humid tropics of developing countries,
   it is crucial to understand the roles and effects of human-modified
   landscapes with fragmented forest remnants in maintaining biodiversity
   while fulfilling the demands of local communities and reducing poverty.
   To implement appropriate landscape planning for conserving biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning, appropriate information is required about
   parameters of habitat suitability among various anthropogenic habitats
   with a range of distances to forests and vegetation characteristics, but
   such information is limited. We examined differences in avian
   communities between a remnant forest and four types of man-made forest
   (two mature plantations and two agroforests) in a forest-agricultural
   landscape of West Java, and we analyzed the effects of both local and
   landscape factors on various types of species richness in this
   landscape. The results from non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed
   avifauna in the two types of agroforest was clustered separately from
   that in the remnant forest, mainly because drastic declines in the
   abundance of forest specialists (including IUCN red-listed species) and
   their replacement with open-habitat generalists. The mixed-tree
   agroforests were colonized by 30 \% of forest specialists and
   forest-edge species found in the remnant forest, and maintained the
   highest richness of species endemic to Indonesia among man-made forests,
   implying that some forest specialists and endemics might have adapted to
   ancient landscape heterogeneity. High proportion of insectivorous birds
   was found in the remnant forest (more than 50 \%) and drastically
   decline in man-made forests, although the species richness of
   insectivores did not decline significantly in broad-leaved plantations.
   We concluded that protection of remnant forests should be prioritized to
   conserve forest bird diversity. However, as different environmental
   factors affected the richness values of different ecological groups,
   appropriate landscape design and habitat management could improve
   functional diversity in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive conversion of natural areas for agricultural production has
   had many consequences, including reduced habitat for nesting birds.
   Increasing focus on habitat re-establishment has led to the
   establishment of patches of perennial herbaceous vegetation in these
   agricultural landscapes, although these often consist of monotypic grass
   fields with little vegetation diversity. In 2001 and 2002, we assessed
   songbird responses to mowing followed by a soil disturbance (disking)
   meant to increase vegetation diversity and abundance of arthropod food
   resources in conservation easements in East-central Iowa, USA. We
   randomly assigned fields to disking and control treatments and collected
   data on breeding bird density and species richness in these habitats
   before and after treatments were applied. Disking increased density of
   all species combined, several individual species including dickcissel
   (Spiza americana; a declining species of concern), and overall
   conservation value of bird communities in treated fields. Total bird
   density increased with disking when the size of disked area was
   relatively small, and dickcissels and American goldfinches (Spinus
   tristis) responded positively and negatively to block-shaped treatments,
   respectively. Most species either showed no response or increased in
   density with disking. Changes associated with disking treatments were
   likely related to changes in both vegetation structure and increased
   abundance and biomass of arthropod food resources. Disking appears to be
   an effective management practice for maintaining herbaceous habitats,
   increasing vegetation diversity and food availability for insectivorous
   birds, and increasing habitat quality for priority bird species. Given
   the increasing availability of monotypic grasslands in agricultural
   landscapes, this practice may provide a relatively inexpensive way to
   improve re-established habitats. (C) 2013 The Wildlife Society.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystem-based forest management strives to develop silvicultural
   practices that best emulate natural disturbances such as wildfire to
   conserve biodiversity representative of natural forest ecosystems. Yet,
   current logging practices alter forest structure and reduce the
   proportion of old-growth forest and, consequently, can exert long-term
   effects on the dynamics of forest biota. The stand-and landscape-scale
   factors driving bird community dynamics in post-disturbance environment
   remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined bird community
   dynamics along successional gradients in boreal ecosystems originating
   from fire and logging in landscapes dominated by old-growth forest. We
   tested if bird species richness and community compositions in
   clear-cutting stands became comparable to those in natural stands after
   70 years, and identified the relative contributions of stand-and
   landscape-scale forest attributes in bird community dynamics. Based on
   records of bird occurrences at 185 field sites in natural and
   clearcutting stands, we demonstrate that (1) both forest structures and
   bird communities underwent evident changes along successional gradients
   in post-clearcutting environment; (2) bird species richness and
   community composition in 60-to 70-years-old clearcutting stands still
   differed from those in 50-to 79-years-old natural stands, in spite of
   the fact that most forest attributes of clearcutting stands became
   comparable to those of natural stands after 40 years; and (3) landscape
   disturbances contributed more than stand characteristics in explaining
   the lack of convergence of mature forest species, residents, and
   short-distance migrants in post-clearcutting environment. Our study
   points out that more regards should be paid to improve the landscape
   configuration of the managed forests, and implies that old-growth forest
   retention within logged areas, combined with selection cutting and
   prolonged logging rotations, can better emulate fire and alleviate
   forest harvesting effects on bird community assemblages typical of
   natural boreal ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The alarming rate of ecosystem degradation has raised the need for
   ecological restoration throughout different biomes and continents. North
   European forests may appear as one of the least vulnerable ecosystems
   from a global perspective, since forest cover is not rapidly decreasing
   and many ecosystem services remain at high level. However, extensive
   areas of northern forests are heavily exploited and have lost a major
   part of their biodiversity value. There is a strong requirement to
   restore these areas towards a more natural condition in order to meet
   the targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Several northern
   countries are now taking up this challenge by restoring forest
   biodiversity with increasing intensity. The ecology and biodiversity of
   boreal forests are relatively well understood making them a good model
   for restoration activities in many other forest ecosystems. Here we
   introduce northern forests as an ecosystem, discuss the historical and
   recent human impact and provide a brief status report on the ecological
   restoration projects and research already conducted there. Based on this
   discussion, we argue that before any restoration actions commence, the
   ecology of the target ecosystem should be established with the need for
   restoration carefully assessed and the outcome properly monitored.
   Finally, we identify the most important challenges that need to be
   solved in order to carry out efficient restoration with powerful and
   long-term positive impacts on biodiversity: coping with
   unpredictability, maintaining connectivity in time and space, assessment
   of functionality, management of conflicting interests and social
   restrictions and ensuring adequate funding. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Habitat loss and degradation is the most pervasive threat to tropical
   biodiversity worldwide. Amazonia sits at the frontline of efforts to
   both improve the productivity of tropical agriculture and prevent the
   loss of biodiversity. To date our understanding of the biodiversity
   impacts of agricultural expansion in Amazonia is restricted to findings
   from small scale studies that typically assess the importance of a
   limited number of land-use types. Here we investigate local and
   landscape-scale responses of Amazonian avian assemblages to land-cover
   changes across a gradient of land-use intensity ranging from undisturbed
   primary forest to mechanised agriculture in 36 drainage catchments
   distributed across two large regions of the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We
   found that species richness of forest-associated birds declined
   progressively along this gradient, accompanied by marked shifts in
   assemblage composition. We found significant changes in species
   composition, but not richness, between primary forests that had been
   subject to different levels of disturbance from logging and fire.
   Secondary forests retained levels of species richness intermediate
   between primary forests and production areas, but lacked many
   forest-dependent species. Production areas (arable crops, cattle
   pastures and plantation forests) all retained far fewer species than any
   forest habitat, and were largely dominated by taxa commonly associated
   with open areas. Diversity partitioning revealed that species
   composition varied the most among undisturbed forest transects, and
   steadily decreased with increasing forest degradation and land-use
   intensity. Our results emphasise the importance of protecting both
   remaining areas of primary forest in private lands, as well as
   protecting the same forests from further disturbance events. (C) 2013

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Along with plant species composition forest structural complexity is an
   important determinant of forest biodiversity, but difficult to predict
   in space from field data. We analyzed forest structural complexity based
   on a comprehensive set of variables derived from nationally available,
   area-wide remote sensing, particularly LiDAR data. We generated
   variables related to vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity,
   as well as site factors potentially indicating the abundance of weakened
   trees or snags. We used them to predict the occurrence of four bird
   species with narrow and complementary structural habitat requirements,
   together being indicative of structurally diverse forests.
   Presence/absence data of Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Hazel Grouse
   (Bonasa bonasia), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Pygmy
   Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) from three biogeographic mountain regions in
   Switzerland were used to calibrate species distribution models (boosted
   regression trees BRT) for each species individually, as well as for the
   sympatric occurrence of at least three of the four target species. The
   predictive deviances explained (D-2) and the AUC values obtained from
   cross-validation ranged from 15.5\% to 63.1\% and 0.77\% to 0.97\%
   respectively. Sympatric species occurrence reflecting overall forest
   structural complexity was predicted best, with an outstanding accuracy.
   To support management and monitoring schemes we identified variable
   threshold effects based on partial dependence plots. Variables related
   to vertical foliage distributions were most important, followed by
   horizontal structural attributes such as canopy height variations,
   forest edges and gaps. Site factors such as topographic position
   improved all models and were most important for the species depending on
   weakened trees and dead wood. We conclude that recent advances in remote
   sensing allow for large-scale determination of forest structural
   characteristics suitable for developing species and habitat distribution
   models of considerable generality, while keeping an unprecedented level
   of detail. Our approach allows forest managers to amend regional and
   countrywide management plans with reliable maps depicting areas of high
   forest structural complexity and habitat quality, which will facilitate
   the integration of conservation-relevant information into
   multifunctional forestry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Colonization and extinction are primary drivers of local population
   dynamics, community structure, and spatial patterns of biological
   diversity. Existing paradigms of island biogeography, metapopulation
   biology, and metacommunity ecology, as well as habitat management and
   conservation biology based on those paradigms, emphasize patch size,
   number, and isolation as primary characteristics influencing
   colonization and extinction. Habitat selection theory suggests that
   patch quality could rival size, number, and isolation in determining
   rates of colonization and resulting community structure. We used
   naturally colonized experimental landscapes to address four issues: (a)
   how do colonizing aquatic beetles respond to variation in patch number,
   (b) how do they respond to variation in patch quality, (c) does patch
   context affect colonization dynamics, and (d) at what spatial scales do
   beetles respond to habitat variation? Increasing patch number had no
   effect on per patch colonization rates, while patch quality and context
   were critical in determining colonization rates and resulting patterns
   of abundance and species richness at multiple spatial scales. We
   graphically illustrate how variation in immigration rates driven by
   perceived predation risk (habitat quality) can further modify dynamics
   of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography beyond predator-driven
   effects on extinction rates. Our data support the importance of patch
   quality and context as primary determinants of colonization rate,
   occupancy, abundance, and resulting patterns of species richness, and
   reinforce the idea that management of metapopulations for species
   preservation, and metacommunities for local and regional diversity,
   should incorporate habitat quality into the predictive equation.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},

Volume = {{34}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The use of a bird community index that characterizes ecosystem integrity
   is very attractive to conservation planners and habitat managers,
   particularly in the absence of any single focal species. In riparian
   areas of the western USA, several attempts at arriving at a community
   index signifying a functioning riparian bird community have been made
   previously, mostly resorting to expert opinions or national conservation
   rankings for species weights. Because extensive local and regional bird
   monitoring data were available for Nevada, we were able to develop three
   different indices that were derived empirically, rather than from expert
   opinion. We formally examined the use of three species weighting schemes
   in comparison with simple species richness, using different definitions
   of riparian species assemblage size, for the purpose of predicting
   community response to changes in vegetation structure from riparian
   restoration. For the three indices, species were weighted according to
   the following criteria: (1) the degree of riparian habitat
   specialization based on regional data, (2) the relative conservation
   ranking of landbird species, and (3) the degree to which a species is
   under-represented compared to the regional species pool for riparian
   areas. To evaluate the usefulness of these indices for habitat
   restoration planning and monitoring, we modeled them using habitat
   variables that are expected to respond to riparian restoration efforts,
   using data from 64 sampling sites in the Walker River Basin in Nevada
   and California. We found that none of the species-weighting schemes
   performed any better as an index for evaluating overall habitat
   condition than using species richness alone as a community index. Based
   on our findings, the use of a fairly complete list of 30-35 riparian
   specialists appears to be the best indicator group for predicting the
   response of bird communities to the restoration of riparian vegetation.

Title = {{Tree microhabitats as indicators of bird and bat communities in
   Mediterranean forests}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{221-230}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Tree microhabitats (e.g., canopy deadwood, cavities, and loose bark) may
   play an important role in forest biodiversity conservation. Indeed, many
   species depend on tree microhabitats during their life-cycles for food,
   shelter, and breeding habitat. Although recent studies have developed a
   set of definitions and descriptions for tree microhabitats, the
   relationships between tree microhabitat inventory data and biodiversity
   remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified relationships
   among tree microhabitat variables (i.e., the density and diversity of
   microhabitat) and bird and bat metrics using data from 59 plots in 3
   Mediterranean forest ecosystems in France. In each plot, 9 types of tree
   microhabitats were inventoried: canopy deadwood; woodpecker cavities;
   non-woodpecker cavities (divided into lower, medium, and upper
   cavities); Cerambyx cavities; loose bark or cracks; conks of fungi; and
   ivy. We also assessed structural characteristics (e.g., basal area,
   stand height), the time since last cutting (i.e., the number of years
   since the stand was last cut), the number of forest habitats, and the
   distance to the nearest road. We performed bird and bat inventories in
   the same plots and we used abundances and a number of bird and bat
   community indices (e.g., species richness, mean forest specialization).
   We found that variations in tree microhabitat (more specifically,
   variations in microhabitat diversity) were a major factor in explaining
   the abundance and community response of birds and bats. Bird species,
   including cavity-nesting birds, were most strongly affected by tree
   microhabitat diversity, while bat species were positively affected by
   both the diversity of the tree microhabitat and the density of cavities
   created by Cerambyx spp. Tree microhabitats were better predictors of
   bird and bat responses than other stand characteristics. Tree
   microhabitat characteristics provide a reliable measure of ecological
   niches in forest ecosystems and we propose that these microhabitats be
   used as indicators for assessing biodiversity in forests. (C) 2013

   freshwater zone. A polder area of 8.2 ha was equipped with a CRT to test
   the system functionality. Among different ecological compartments that
   are studied for assessing the CRT restoration success, avifauna was
   monitored over three years. The tidal regime generated a habitat
   gradient typical of tidal freshwater wetlands along which the
   distributions of bird and ecological groups were studied. 103 bird
   species were recorded over the three years. In addition to many
   generalist bird species, several specialist species typical of the North
   Sea coast were present. Thirty-nine species of local and/or
   international conservation interest were encountered, emphasising the
   importance of this habitat for certain species. Species communities and
   ecological groups were strongly habitat specific and non-randomly
   organized across habitats. Spatiotemporal analyses highlighted a rapid
   habitat colonization, and a subsequent stable habitat community
   structure across seasons in spite of strong seasonal species turnovers.
   Hence, these findings advocate CRT implementation as a means to
   effectively compensate for wetland habitat loss. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The present study analyses long-term annual fishery landings time series
   (1980-2007) for species derived from six lagoons (covering about 70
   km(2)) around an important European wetland, the fjord-like Amvrakikos
   gulf. Landing trends for most abundant species revealed that typical
   lagoon fish species-groups, such as Mugilidae (Mugil cephalus, Chelon
   labrosus, Liza saliens, Liza aurata and Liza ramada), eels (Anguilla
   anguilla) and Gobies (mainly Zosteriosessor ophiocephalus) had largely
   decreased, while the landings of Sparus aurata increased during the
   entire study period. These trends led to a significant change in species
   composition during recent years that might be attributed to large-scale
   climatic changes as well as serious anthropogenic impacts that degraded
   the water quality and altered the hydrology within the gulf and lagoons,
   the increase of fishing exploitation in Amvrakikos gulf, the expansion
   of aquaculture activities within the gulf, the application of new
   fishing management practices in lagoons, and the increase of fish-eating
   sea-bird populations. The findings are needed for the implementation of

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal patterns of disturbance and the subsequent
   heterogeneity are critical in maintaining biodiversity within grassland
   ecosystems. Grassland birds have evolved within this `shifting mosaic'
   to become reliant on specific habitat characteristics maintained under
   varying levels of both natural and anthropogenic disturbance.
   Unfortunately, grasslands in South Africa have been extensively
   transformed and remain poorly conserved, threatening grassland avifauna.
   Mistbelt grassland is a threatened vegetation type endemic to the
   province of KwaZulu-Natal, of which only 0.3\% is formally protected.
   This study investigated seasonal and patch type heterogeneity in a
   Mistbelt grassland avian community by determining avian community
   structure and composition in four patch types, i.e.i) untransformed open
   grassland, burnt grassland, iii) bramble-invaded and, iv)
   bramble-cleared grassland, during winter and summer. Avian assemblages
   were significantly different between the different patch types for each
   season. The bramble patch type negatively affected grassland bird
   species diversity Bramble-cleared grassland and untransformed grassland
   had similar vegetation structure and avian communities in the summer,
   suggesting that the grassland bird community benefitted soon after the
   clearing of invasive vegetation. This study provides further evidence
   that bird diversity is enhanced in structurally heterogeneous grassland
   landscapes. Furthermore, the protection and appropriate management of
   privately owned Mistbelt grassland, conserved in the form of rangeland,
   is an important refuge for threatened and endemic avifauna, such as the
   globally-threatened blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) and wattled
   crane (Bugeranus carunculatus).}},

Abstract = {{Relating population density to spatially explicit habitat
   characteristics can inform management by directing efforts to areas with
   lower densities or focusing conservation and land protection on
   high-density areas. We conducted point-transect surveys for the
   endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and
   Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla) in the live-fire region of Fort
   Hood, Texas. We used mark recapture distance sampling and combined a
   Horvitz-Thompson estimator with a habitat-based, resource-selection
   gradient to estimate spatially explicit density for both species. We
   detected Golden-cheeked Warblers at 120 locations (202, 197, and 89
   detected by primary, secondary, and both observers, respectively) and
   Black-capped Vireos at 173 locations (241, 255, and 107 detected by
   primary, secondary, and both observers, respectively). For
   Golden-cheeked Warblers, the average ( SE) composite detection
   probability estimate within a 100-m point-sample radius was 0.57 +/-
   0.14, and for vireos it was 0.24 +/- 0.02. Estimated mean density
   (singing males ha(-1)) was 0.14 +/- 0.03 (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 0.08-0.23) and 0.47 +/- 0.05 (95\% CI: 0.38-0.60) for
   Golden-cheeked Warblers and Black-capped Vireos, respectively. Our
   analysis suggested evidence of heterogeneity in the detection process
   for both species, as well as imperfect detection at distance g(0), both
   of which would bias estimated densities if ignored. Additionally, both
   species exhibited spatial variability in estimated densities, with those
   areas that had higher occurrence probabilities typically having higher
   estimated density. In the absence of spatially explicit density
   prediction, managers must treat all losses of potential habitat for
   endangered species uniformly, despite likely differences in conservation
   value. Our approach could be used to ascertain areas of changing density
   in relation to changing habitat conditions over time and space.}},

Title = {{Does Human-Induced Habitat Modification Influence the Impact of
   Introduced Species? A Case Study on Cavity-Nesting by the Introduced
   Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis) and Two Australian Native Parrots}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Introduced species pose a major threat to biodiversity across the globe.
   Understanding the impact of introduced species is critical for effective
   management. Many species around the world are reliant on tree cavities,
   and competition for these resources can be intense: threatening the
   survival of native species. Through the establishment of 225 nest boxes,
   we examined the relationship between tree density and the abundance and
   nesting success of three bird species in Canberra, Australia. The common
   myna (Acridotheres tristis) is an introduced species in Australia, and
   the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) and eastern rosella
   (Platycercus eximius) are native species. We then investigated the
   impact of common myna nest box occupation on crimson rosella and eastern
   rosella abundance. Tree density significantly influenced the abundance
   and cavity-nesting of all three species. Common myna abundance (birds
   per square kilometer) was greatest at low tree density sites (101.9 +/-
   A 22.4) and declined at medium (45.4 +/- A 10.1) and high (9.7 +/- A
   3.6) tree density sites. The opposite pattern was observed for the
   crimson rosella, with greater abundance (birds per square kilometer) at
   high tree density sites (83.9 +/- A 9.3), declining over medium (61.6
   +/- A 6.4) and low (31.4 +/- A 3.9) tree density sites. The eastern
   rosella was more abundant at medium tree density sites (48.6 +/- A 8.0
   birds per square kilometer). Despite the strong influence of tree
   density, we found a significant negative relationship between common
   myna nest box occupancy and the abundance of the crimson rosella (F
   (1,13) = 7.548, P = 0.017) and eastern rosella (F (1,13) = 9.672, P <
   0.001) at some sites. We also observed a slight increase in rosella
   nesting interruptions by the common myna at lower tree densities (high:
   1.3 \% +/- A 1.3, medium: 6.6 \% +/- A 2.2, low: 12.7 \% +/- A 6.2),
   although this increase was not statistically significant (F (2,40) =
   2.435, P = 0.100). Our study provides the strongest evidence to date for
   the negative impact of the common myna on native bird abundance through
   cavity-nesting competition. However, due to the strong influence of
   habitat on species abundance and nesting, it is essential to investigate
   the impacts of introduced species in conjunction with habitat variation.
   We also suggest one component of introduced species management could
   include habitat restoration to reduce habitat suitability for introduced
   species.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Longhorn beetles (Coleoptera : Cerambycidae) have been used to identify
   sites of high biological diversity and conservation value in cultivated
   landscapes, but were rarely studied in changing landscapes of humid
   tropics. This study was conducted in a region of southern Yunnan, China,
   which was dominated by natural rainforest until 30 years ago, but is
   successively transformed into commercial rubber monoculture plantations
   since that time. The objectives were to investigate longhorn beetle
   species diversity and distribution in the major land use types of this
   landscape and to estimate the effects of an expected expansion of rubber
   plantations on the longhorn beetle assemblages. The results showed that
   tree species diversity (181 species in total) and longhorn beetle
   diversity (220 species in total) were closely related with no
   significant differences between the tree and longhorn beetles
   assemblages shown by similarity distance analysis. There was a highly
   positive relationship between the estimated species richness of longhorn
   beetles and the number of tree species. Individual numbers of longhorn
   beetles and trees were also highly positive related at the sampling
   sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed that the degree of
   canopy coverage, succession age and tree diversity explained 78.5\% of
   the total variation in longhorn beetle assemblage composition. Natural
   forest sites had significantly higher numbers of species and individuals
   than any other type of habitat. Although young rubber plantations bear
   the highest longhorn beetle diversity outside forests (half of the total
   number of longhorn beetle species recorded in total), they can not
   provide permanent habitats for most of these species, because they
   develop into closed canopy plantations with less suitable habitat
   conditions. Therefore, along with an expected expansion of rubber
   cultivation which largely proceeds at the expense of forest areas, the
   habitat conditions for longhorn beetles in this region might decrease
   dramatically in future.}},

   In an earlier study, we experimentally assessed how breeding bird
   communities and species responded to fuel reduction treatments by
   mechanical understory reduction, low-severity prescribed fires, or
   mechanical understory reduction followed a year later by high-severity
   prescribed fires in upland hardwood forest. Here, we assess longer-term
   response to the initial mechanical treatment (M), and a second
   low-intensity burn in twice burned (B2) and mechanical + twice burned
   (MB2) treatments and controls (C). Initial (2003) higher dead fuel
   loadings and consequently high-severity fires in MB2 created open-canopy
   structure with abundant snags, resulting in much higher species richness
   and density of breeding birds compared to other treatments. Relative
   bird density and richness remained much higher in MB2 after a second
   burn, but few changes were evident that were not already apparent after
   one burn. The initial (2003) burn in B2 had cooler, low-severity fires
   that killed few trees. Delayed tree mortality occurred in both burn
   treatments after one burn, and continued in both after a second
   low-intensity burn. In B2, this resulted in gradual development of a
   ``perforated,{''} patchy canopy structure with more snags. Abundance of
   total birds and most species in B2 was similar to C, but several
   additional species associated with open-forest conditions occurred at
   low levels, increasing richness in B2. In both burn treatments, burning
   temporarily reduced habitat suitability for ground-nesting birds. Bird
   communities in M were similar to C, as shrubs recovered rapidly. Results
   indicate that one or two relatively low-intensity burns with patches of
   hotter fire may result in gradual, subtle changes to canopy cover and
   structure that may slightly increase bird species richness over time. In
   contrast, a single high-intensity, high severity fire can create young
   forest conditions and a heterogeneous canopy structure that can be
   maintained by repeated burning and increase breeding bird relative
   abundance and richness by attracting disturbance-adapted species while
   retaining most other forest species. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Intensifying forest management practices via use of tree plantations
   represents a common response to rising global demand for wood and paper
   products. However, a large proportion of tree plantations, globally,
   exist in closed-canopy mid-seral stages, which are frequently associated
   with reduced biodiversity. In some regions, silvicultural techniques
   such as thinning have been used to accelerate the development of complex
   vertical structure and composition (e.g., shrubs, understory, midstory,
   large trees) in these plantations; these attributes are expected to
   constitute suitable habitat for species associated with particular
   forest structures. We report on the results of a 15-year
   randomized-block manipulative study based in Oregon, USA, designed to
   test the hypothesis that `if you build it they will come' (i.e., the
   ``Field of Dreams{''} hypothesis; the `creation' of complex vertical
   structure in forests via thinning will result in colonization by bird
   species associated with these structures). We conducted point counts of
   forest birds 7 times each year in stands thinned at two different
   intensities and in unharvested controls. Responses to thinning by some
   bird species {[}e.g., hermit warbler (Setophaga occidentalis),
   Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus) and Wilson's warbler (Cardellina
   pusilla)] changed from being negative in the short term (<6 years), to
   being positive over the longer term. However, some species were
   sensitive to thinning disturbance even after 15 years of recovery
   {[}e.g., Hutton's vireo (Vireo huttoni)]. Disturbance-associated species
   initially increased following thinning; but over the longer-term,
   detections of several of these species {[}American robin (Turdus
   migratorius) and Townsend's solitaire (Myadestes townsendi)] notably
   declined or ceased. Our findings indicate that results from short-term
   studies (<= 6 years) cannot be used to predict the longer-term response
   of birds to forest management treatments, particularly for species of
   birds whose response to thinning over time was non-linear. Further, none
   of the management prescriptions tested were alone sufficient to maintain
   long-term occupancy for all of the species in the study. Implementing
   thinning at intervals across landscape scales to develop different seral
   stages and stand-structures, while also maintaining unthinned areas for
   species negatively impacted by thinning, will likely have the greatest
   positive impact on beta diversity of birds in managed plantation
   landscapes. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Simulating avian species and foraging group responses to fuel reduction

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{304}},
Pages = {{261-274}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Over a century of fire suppression activities have altered the structure
   and composition of mixed conifer forests throughout the western United
   States. In the absence of fire, fuels have accumulated in these forests
   causing concerns over the potential for catastrophic wildfires. Fuel
   reduction treatments are being used on federal and state lands to reduce
   the threat of wildfire by mechanically removing biomass. Although these
   treatments result in a reduction in fire hazard, their impact on
   wildlife is less clear. We use a multi-species occupancy modeling
   approach to build habitat-suitability models for 46 upland forest birds
   found in the Lake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra Nevada based on forest
   structure and abiotic variables. Using a Bayesian hierarchical
   framework, we predict species-specific and community-level responses to
   changes in forest structure and make inferences about responses of
   important avian foraging guilds. Disparities within and among foraging
   group responses to canopy cover, tree size and shrub cover emphasized
   the complexities in managing forests to meet biodiversity goals. Based
   on our species-specific model results, we predicted changes in species
   richness and community similarity under forest prescriptions
   representing three management practices: no active management, a typical
   fuel reduction treatment that emphasizes spacing between trees, and a
   thinning prescription that creates structural heterogeneity. Simulated
   changes to structural components of the forest analogous to management
   practices to reduce fuel loads clearly affected foraging groups
   differentially despite variability in responses within guilds. Although
   species richness was predicted to decrease slightly under both simulated
   fuels reduction treatments, the prescription that incorporated
   structural heterogeneity retained marginally higher species richness.
   The composition of communities supported by different management
   alternatives was influenced by urbanization and management practice,
   emphasizing the importance of creating heterogeneity at the landscape
   scale. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The United States and Mexico share the Southern California Bight (SCB)
   ecosystem in the Northeast Pacific Ocean where marine wildlife and
   habitats historically have been disturbed by human activities. Within
   this ecosystem, forests of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera are
   critical habitats that sustain diverse biological assemblages and
   important fishery species. We studied patterns of temporal and spatial
   variability within the benthic communities of five transboundary kelp
   forests in California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) over a
   four-year period that included a moderate El Nino event. While the
   benthic marine communities shared some species, they varied
   significantly in community structure from each other, and the degree of
   dissimilarity was not related to the geographic distances among the
   studied habitats. Rather, species richness was significantly related to
   local substratum rugosity, suggesting it could be used as a proxy of
   relative benthic biological diversity. Temporal changes in the benthic
   assemblages were not consistent across all forests, and contrary to
   observations made during previous El Nino events in the SCB, the benthic
   communities did not change significantly following the 2009-2010 El
   Nino. Such an unexpected community response may be explained by the fact
   that the 2009-2010 El Nino was linked to the Modoki phenomenon, where
   warm sea surface temperature is focused in the central equatorial
   Pacific and not in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We propose that long-term
   conservation efforts should incorporate this ecological knowledge to
   support science-based decisions, binational coordination of policies,
   and coherent management practices including the design of transboundary
   conservation networks as spatial management tools for the protection,
   conservation, and/or restoration of the SCB ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Hole-nesting birds include species highly dependent on old trees or dead
   wood for nesting, roosting, breeding and feeding. In this study we
   characterize the assemblages of these species occurring in five
   different habitat types located in a heterogeneous Mediterranean
   landscape. We used the point count method. In all habitat types, tits
   (Parus major and Cyanistes caeruleus) were the most abundant species,
   except in beech forests, where Sitta europaea showed the highest mean
   abundance. Hole nesting bird assemblages increase in abundance, richness
   and diversity, with significant changes from termophilic and
   sclcrophyllous forests (Holm-oak and Cork-oak) to temperate and
   mesophilic forests (chestnut, Turkey oak and Beech). This pattern
   reflects the progressive change in vegetation type both due to structure
   and species composition, ultimately due to progressive change in
   altitude and local climate. In particular, data at singles species level
   corroborate that the presence of mature and dead trees (i.e., with high
   mean diameter) may explain the abundance of Sitta europaea, Picus
   viridis and Certhia brachydactyla. Our dataset highlights that, for the
   hole-nesting birds, mesophilous beech and oak Mediterranean forests of
   biogeographic and conservation concern, represent suitable habitat types
   for these specialized species.}},

Title = {{Environmental considerations from legislation and certification in
   managed forest stands: A review of their importance for biodiversity}},

Abstract = {{Negative impacts of forestry on biodiversity have been addressed through
   environmental considerations held within legislation and various forest
   certification protocols. We used Sweden as a case study where a long
   history of forestry aiming at sustained yield of wood fiber has resulted
   in landscapes with low quantities of old growth structures e.g. dead
   wood and old forest, but where environmental considerations have been
   implemented during the last two decades. We reviewed the scientific
   literature for studies evaluating the environmental considerations
   included in the Swedish Forestry Act and FSC, compared individual
   metrics and benchmarks, identified thresholds as well as identified
   specific gaps missing from current regulations (missing factors/areas of
   improvement). All environmental considerations listed in the Swedish
   Forestry Act were found to be relevant for conservation. The strongest
   scientific support for their importance in maintaining biodiversity in
   managed landscapes was found for dead wood, tree retention and habitats
   for sensitive species, including edge zones and woodland key habitats.
   However, suggested levels fall below identified thresholds. Retention of
   small habitat patches can provide a lifeboat function for some
   red-listed species, but the long term survival of these populations is
   uncertain. Tree species composition was also found be important, and in
   the boreal region the proportion of deciduous trees is a key factor. For
   some environmental considerations, there is too limited information from
   the scientific literature to evaluate their importance in relation to
   the current levels, e.g. consequences of clear-cut size and shape, and
   forest roads. Similarly, damage to soil and water affect biodiversity
   through drainage, leakage and sedimentation, but the effects vary
   considerably and are often diffuse. There is a need to better adjust the
   levels of environmental considerations above thresholds from empirical
   studies. However, it will be impossible within current regulatory
   framework to maintain all species in all landscapes. Therefore, the
   allocation of environmental consideration among stands, landscapes and
   regions need to be considered. Evenly dispersed retention might always
   stay below suggested thresholds with limited contribution to
   ecologically sustainable forest ecosystems. More flexibility, where the
   sum of conservation measures in the landscape as opposed to measures in
   individual stands are considered, would result in better conservation
   strategies. This would mean that particular landscapes could be more
   intensively managed and in other more focus on biodiversity conservation
   could be taken. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Testing indicators of biodiversity for plantation forests}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{32}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In many parts of the world, plantations make up a considerable
   proportion of the total forest area. In such regions, the identification
   of high biodiversity value stands and of management practices to enhance
   biodiversity is essential if the goals of Sustainable Forest Management
   are to be achieved. Since complete biodiversity assessments are rarely
   possible, efforts have been increasingly focussed on the use of
   indicators. Of particular interest are indicators applicable to
   individual stands that require no specialist taxonomic or technical
   knowledge to assess. Candidate biodiversity indicators had been
   identified in a previous study using data from Irish Sitka spruce (Picea
   sitchensis) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) plantations but had yet to be
   tested on independent data. In the present study, the provisional
   indicators for vascular plant, bryophyte, spider and bird diversity were
   tested on data from Irish Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), oak (Quercus
   petraea/Quercus robur), Sitka spruce and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta)
   plantations. Conifer canopy cover was confirmed as an important
   biodiversity indicator, due to its influence on below-canopy
   microclimatic and structural conditions. Bryophyte species richness was
   higher in relatively high canopy cover plantations on poorly drained
   soils, while bird species richness was higher in more open plantations
   with high shrub cover. Coarse woody debris was an important substrate
   for forest-associated bryophytes, with higher species richness at higher
   volumes of deadwood. Both proximity to old woodland and stand age were
   confirmed as positive indicators for forest-associated vascular plants.
   This is related to dispersal limitation in these species, with nearby
   woodlands acting as important seed sources and colonisation increasing
   with time. Stand age was also confirmed as a positive indicator for
   forest-associated spiders and is related to the development of suitable
   habitat as the plantation matures. All of the confirmed indicators can
   be assessed without need for specialist knowledge, are ecologically
   meaningful and applicable to a range of forests managed under a
   clearfelling system. They can be used to assess the potential value of
   stands for the taxonomic groups to which they apply, as well as giving
   insights into management practices to enhance diversity in these groups.

Abstract = {{Fire-adapted forests in the western United States have dramatically
   departed from the natural or evolutionary environment over the past
   century because of fire suppression, logging, grazing, and other
   management practices. In particular, most southwestern ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa) forests are characterized by dense stands of
   small-diameter trees that are susceptible to stand-replacing crown fires
   and ensuing damage to watersheds, wildlife habitat, and communities at
   the wildland-urban interface. Restoration treatments using mechanical
   thinning and prescribed fire have become the dominant management
   paradigm in this forest type, with landscape-scale projects being
   implemented over the next 20 years. Although many studies have examined
   wildlife responses to restoration treatments, single-species information
   is difficult for managers to synthesize and incorporate into management
   decisions made at large scales. Our goal was to investigate responses of
   breeding birds in ponderosa pine forests to forest stand characteristics
   modified by restoration treatments. We sampled birds in 23 stands for 3
   years in northern Arizona, and used multi-season and multi-species
   occupancy models to determine relationships between avian occupancy and
   stand attributes affected by treatment. Increasing occupancy rates and
   species richness were associated with decreasing canopy cover,
   increasing density of mature trees, and increasing density of snags.
   Occupancy rates and species richness were negatively associated with
   quadratic mean diameter, medium-sized trees, and downed woody material.
   Associations of the avian community and individual species with
   herbaceous cover and tree clumping were less consistent. Our results
   support the implementation of forest restoration treatments for
   restoring avian community occupancy in ponderosa pine forests, and
   emulating the evolutionary environment is likely the best approach. We
   recommend reducing canopy cover via thinning, and retaining trees
   >45.7cm diameter at breast height and snags. A commonly-proposed
   diameter cap for retaining large trees after thinning (40.6cmdbh) seems
   unlikely to benefit nesting passerines, as resulting tree densities
   would remain too large. We recommend occupancy modeling as an efficient
   method for assessing wildlife-habitat relationships at large scales. (c)

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of periodic disturbance (prescribed burning and
   light disking) and landscape composition on nest density and success for
   grassland birds in agricultural conservation buffers in southeastern
   United States agroecosystems. During the 2007-2009 breeding seasons, we
   located 387 nests in buffers of a northeast Mississippi agroecosystem.
   Dickcissel (Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius
   phoeniceus) were the most common nesting species. Time since disturbance
   influenced nest densities of dickcissels and red-winged blackbirds;
   densities were lesser during the first growing season post-disturbance
   but increased during the second growing season post-burn. Nest densities
   for both species were least in buffers adjacent to woodland. Inclusion
   of disturbance did not improve models of dickcissel and red-winged
   blackbird nest survival, suggesting that disturbance influenced nesting
   density, but not nesting outcomes. Amount of grassland surrounding
   dickcissel nests was positively associated with nest survival, but
   confidence intervals included zero indicating effects were not strong.
   Although distance to nearest crop or developed edge were included in
   competing models of red-winged blackbird nest survival, their effects
   were negligible. Agricultural conservation buffers will best serve
   breeding grassland bird populations if they are established in areas
   with minimal woodland cover, maximize total grassland in the landscape,
   and are maintained with prescribed burning. These results will help
   characterize the contribution of agricultural conservation buffers in
   agroecosystems of the southeastern United States. (c) 2013 The Wildlife

Abstract = {{Salmon farming is a widespread activity around the world, also known to
   promote diverse environmental effects on aquatic ecosystems. However,
   information regarding the impact of salmon farming on bird assemblages
   is notably scarce. We hypothesize that salmon farming, by providing food
   subsidies and physical structures to birds, will change their local
   community structure. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a seasonal
   monitoring of bird richness, abundance, and composition at paired salmon
   pen and control plots in two marine and two lake sites in southern
   Chile, from fall 2002 to summer 2004. Overall, salmon farming had no
   significant effects on species richness, but bird abundance was
   significantly and noticeably higher in salmon pens than in controls.
   Such aggregation was mainly accounted for by the trophic guilds of
   omnivores, diving piscivores, carrion eaters, and perching piscivores,
   but not by invertebrate feeders, herbivores, and surface feeders.
   Species composition was also significantly and persistently different
   between salmon pens and controls within each lake or marine locality.
   The patterns described above remained consistent across environment
   types and seasons indicating that salmon farming is changing the
   community structure of birds in both lake and marine habitats by
   promoting functional and aggregation responses, particularly by favoring
   species with broader niches. Such local patterns may thus anticipate
   potential threats from the ongoing expansion of the salmon industry to
   neighboring areas in Chile, resulting in regional changes of bird
   communities, toward a less diverse one and dominated by opportunistic,
   common, and generalist species such as gulls, vultures, and cormorants.}},

Abstract = {{Meyer's Parrot Poicephalus meyeri has the widest distributional range of
   any African parrot. There are six subspecies distributed throughout the
   African subtropics, all of which manage to breed successfully during the
   winter dry season when few other cavity-nesting birds are actively
   nesting. In 2004, we recorded Meyer's Parrots feeding on four cryptic
   arthropod larvae incubating inside fruits and pods in their seasonal
   diet. All of these were previously unknown in the diet of African
   parrots. Nesting females and chicks were fed regurgitate almost
   exclusively comprising these arthropod larvae for the first 10 weeks
   after nest occupation. In 2007, we demonstrated that Meyer's Parrots
   actively search for these protein-rich arthropod larvae and synchronized
   their breeding effort within our study area to coincide their hatching
   period with the period of highest relative abundance of these larvae,
   resulting in a breeding synchrony index value of 79.3 \% between females
   in the population. In 2009, we recorded the consumption of similar
   arthropod larvae parasitizing similar tree species in northern Zambia
   and two locations in Tanzania, thus confirming this behaviour throughout
   their distributional range. Similar behaviour is expected in their
   closest congeners, the Brown-headed Parrot P. cryptoxanthus and
   Ruppell's Parrot P. rueppellii. Poor land management practices (e.g.
   deforestation and frequent fires) most likely influence the abundance of
   these cryptic arthropod larvae and thus the breeding success of Meyer's
   Parrot at population level.}},

Title = {{Long-term Changes in Bird Communities after Wildfires in the Central
   Brazilian Amazon}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{We examined long-term responses of an Amazonian bird assemblage to
   wildfire disturbance, investigating how understory birds reacted to
   forest regeneration 1, 3, and 10years after a widespread fire event. The
   bird community was sampled along the Arapiuns and Maro river catchments
   in central Brazilian Amazonia. Sampling took place in 1998, 2000, and
   2008 using mist-nets in eight plots (four burned, four unburned sites).
   Species richness did not change significantly in unburned sites. In
   burned sites, however, we found significantly lower richness in 1998,
   higher richness in 2000, and similar richness in 2008. Multi-dimensional
   scaling ordination showed consistent differences in bird communities
   both within burned sites sampled in different sampling years, and
   between burned and unburned sites in all years. Of the 30 most abundant
   species, 12 had not recovered 10years after the fires, including habitat
   specialists such as mixed flocks specialists and ant-followers.
   Fire-disturbance favored three species (two hummingbirds and a manakin)
   in the short term only. All other species were either favored throughout
   the study (seven species of omnivores and small insectivores) or did not
   show a clear response (eight species). In burned sites, we also found
   significantly lower abundance of species sensitive to disturbances and
   habitat specialists over the entire study period. Although the bird
   community seems to be recovering in terms of richness, the overall
   community composition and abundance of some species in post-burned and
   unburned sites remain very different, and have not recovered after
   10years of forest regeneration.}},

Title = {{Patterns of bird functional diversity on land-bridge island fragments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{781-790}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The loss of species diversity due to habitat fragmentation has been
   extensively studied. In contrast, the impacts of habitat fragmentation
   on functional diversity remains relatively poorly understood. We
   conducted bird functional diversity studies on a set of 41 recently
   isolated land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We
   analysed differences in bird species richness and a recently developed
   suite of complementary functional diversity indices (FRic, volume of
   functional space occupied; FEve, evenness of abundance distribution in
   the functional trait space; FDiv, divergence in the distribution of
   abundance in the trait volume) across different gradients (island area
   and isolation). We found no correlations between FRic and FEve or FEve
   and FDiv, but negative correlations between FRic and FDiv. As predicted,
   island area accounted for most of the variation in bird species
   richness, whereas isolation explained most of the variation in species
   evenness (decreasing species evenness with increasing isolation).
   Functional diversity appears to be more strongly influenced by habitat
   filtering as opposed to limiting similarity. More specifically, across
   all islands, both FRic and FEve were significantly lower than expected
   for randomly assembled communities, but FDiv showed no clear patterns.
   FRic increased with island area, FEve decreased with island area and
   FDiv showed no clear patterns. Our finding that FEve decreases with
   island area at TIL may indicate low functional stability on such
   islands, and as such large islands and habitat patches may deserve extra
   attention and/or protection. These results help to demonstrate the
   importance of considering the effects of fragmentation on functional
   diversity in habitat management and reserve design plans.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{616-627}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Questions To what extent do semi-natural grasslands differ in community
   specificity (i.e. the representation of habitat specialists in a
   community)? Does the community specificity coincide with evolutionary
   history and nutrient availability of the habitats? Location West
   Carpathian semi-natural grasslands (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland).
   Methods Habitat specificity of individual plant species was derived from
   species co-occurrence patterns using the Czech and Slovak vegetation
   databases (48240 non-forest vegetation plots). The vegetation data set,
   i.e. semi-natural grasslands in West Carpathians, was classified into
   different plant communities using modified twinspan. The communities
   were split according to geographic position, in either Outer or Inner
   West Carpathians, and analysed separately. Values of community
   specificity for particular plant communities were compared with
   expectations generated by null models. The species habitat specificity
   was correlated to species Ellenberg indicator values for nutrients.
   Results Several plant communities have higher representation of habitat
   specialists than expected by chance, mainly semi-dry grasslands in the
   Outer West Carpathians, and calcareous fens and higher-altitude meadows
   in the Inner West Carpathians. Habitats that have occurred in the region
   since the early postglacial period are rich in habitat-specialized
   grassland species. Habitat specialists tend to occur in nutrient-poor
   habitats and generalists in nutrient-rich habitats. Nevertheless, some
   communities on productive habitats and with a relatively short history
   also show high level of community specificity. Conclusions Community
   specificity can be a useful parameter to describe the origin and
   determinants of semi-natural grassland biodiversity. Although the
   habitat persistence at the Holocene scale and nutrient availability are
   important factors underlying specialist occurrence, their distribution
   is probably also controlled by a complex set of interacting factors
   including, e.g. recent management practices.}},

Abstract = {{The humid tropical insular Southeast Asian region is one of the most
   biologically diverse areas in the world. It contains around 70Gt of
   carbon stored in peat deposits susceptible to burning when drained and
   it has significantly higher population density than any other humid
   tropical region. This region experiences yearly fire activity of
   anthropogenic origin with widely varying extent and severity. At the
   same time, there are several geographic, climatic, and social aspects
   that complicate fire monitoring in the region. In this review article,
   we analyse the current knowledge and limitations of active fire
   detection and burnt area mapping in insular Southeast Asia, highlighting
   the special characteristics of the region that affect all types of
   remote-sensing-based regional-level fire monitoring. We conclude that
   the monitoring methods currently employed have serious limitations that
   directly affect the reliability of results for fire and burnt area
   monitoring in this region. With the materials and methods presently
   available, the regional and global effects of fire activity taking place
   in insular Southeast Asia are in danger of being underestimated. New
   approaches utilizing higher spatial and temporal resolution
   remote-sensing data are needed for more detailed quantification of fire
   activity and subsequently improved estimation of the effects of fires in
   this region.}},

Title = {{The Conservation Value of Traditional Rural Landscapes: The Case of
   Woodpeckers in Transylvania, Romania}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{Land use change is a major threat to global biodiversity. Forest species
   face the dual threats of deforestation and intensification of forest
   management. In regions where forests are under threat, rural landscapes
   that retain structural components of mature forests potentially provide
   valuable additional habitat for some forest species. Here, we illustrate
   the habitat value of traditional wood pastures for a woodpecker
   assemblage of six species in southern Transylvania, Romania. Wood
   pastures are created by long-term stable silvo-pastoral management
   practices, and are composed of open grassland with scattered large, old
   trees. Because of their demanding habitat requirements, woodpeckers
   share habitat with many other bird species, and have been considered as
   possible indicator species for bird species diversity. We first compared
   woodpecker assemblages between forests and wood pastures. Second, we
   grouped features of wood pastures into three spatial contexts and
   addressed how these features related to the occurrence of three
   woodpecker species that are formally protected. Woodpecker species
   composition, but not the number of species, differed between forests and
   wood pastures, with the green woodpecker occurring more commonly in wood
   pastures, and the lesser spotted woodpecker more commonly in forests.
   Within wood pastures, the intermediate context (especially surrounding
   forest cover) best explained the presence of the grey-headed and middle
   spotted woodpecker. By contrast, variables describing local vegetation
   structure and characteristics of the surrounding landscape did not
   affect woodpecker occurrence in wood pastures. In contrast to many other
   parts of Europe, in which several species of woodpeckers have declined,
   the traditional rural landscape of Transylvania continues to provide
   habitat for several woodpecker species, both in forests and wood
   pastures. Given the apparent habitat value of wood pastures for
   woodpeckers we recommend wood pastures be explicitly considered in
   relevant policies of the European Union, namely the Habitats Directive
   and the EU Common Agricultural Policy.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is a frequently applied land-management tool for the
   preservation and maintenance of southern pine woodlands. Many avian
   species benefit from the use of prescribed fire in pine woodlands;
   however, the effect fire has on nesting site characteristics is not well
   understood for many disturbance-dependent species. We located nests of
   Bachman's Sparrows (Peucaea aestivalis) in mature longleaf pine (Pinus
   palustris) forests managed using frequent prescribed fires (return
   intervals <= 2 years). Vegetation characteristics were measured at each
   nest (n = 37), within a 0.04-ha area immediately adjacent to nests, and
   at different time intervals following burns within a larger 20-ha area
   surrounding nests. We examined vegetation characteristics within the
   20-ha area 2, 6, 12, and 18 months after prescribed burns to compare
   post-fire plant succession with site characteristics associated with
   nest sites. Nest sites had lower amounts of grass standing crop, grass
   ground cover, and higher amounts of woody vegetation than found in the
   0.04-ha area immediately surrounding nests. Vegetation structure at
   nests sites was similar to the structure measured across the 20-ha area
   <6 months following burns, but vegetation structure at ground level
   began to deviate >= 6 months after fires such that >= 50\% of the values
   differed from the values recorded at nest sites. Results point to the
   importance of open vegetation structure at ground level and the need for

Abstract = {{The `Natural Disturbance Paradigm' for forest management seeks to meet
   conservation goals by modeling industrial harvest in fire-driven forest
   systems on patterns associated with wildfire. Fire suppression and
   increased forest harvesting may have detrimental effects on
   biodiversity, and therefore prescribed burning is suggested to retain
   legacies of wildfire not emulated under natural disturbance based
   approaches. The merits of this approach are being tested in the EMEND
   experiment in the Canadian boreal mixedwood forest. We compared
   responses of ground-dwelling spiders between sites subjected to
   prescribed post-harvest burning and retention harvest during three
   seasons during the first 7 years after disturbance. Overall, 38,661
   adult spiders representing 190 species were collected. Estimated species
   richness was highest in undisturbed sites in all 3 years. Burning had
   the strongest negative effect on species richness 1-2 years after
   treatment; however, richness was higher in burns than in harvested sites
   5-6 years post-disturbance. Species turnover was highest within controls
   but tended to increase over time between burned and harvested plots.
   Lower turnover in burned and harvested sites may reflect habitat
   homogenization by disturbance, suggesting a management and conservation
   challenge in relation to naturally disturbed and undisturbed areas.
   Species were grouped into disturbance-specialists, disturbance-tolerant,
   disturbance-generalists and generalists; 22 species were significant
   indicators for untreated sites, 18 for the burn and three for the
   harvest treatments. No major differences were observed in the spider
   fauna between harvested and burned areas within the first 6-7 years
   post-disturbance, and little evidence of recovery toward the pre-harvest
   fauna was evidenced. However, long term experiments may improve
   understanding of natural disturbance processes and improve management of
   boreal forests.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1028-1043}},

Abstract = {{Agroecology and industrial ecology can be viewed as complementary means
   for reducing the environmental footprint of animal farming systems:
   agroecology mainly by stimulating natural processes to reduce inputs,
   and industrial ecology by closing system loops, thereby reducing demand
   for raw materials, lowering pollution and saving on waste treatment.
   Surprisingly, animal farming systems have so far been ignored in most
   agroecological thinking. On the basis of a study by Altieri, who
   identified the key ecological processes to be optimized, we propose five
   principles for the design of sustainable animal production systems: (i)
   adopting management practices aiming to improve animal health, (ii)
   decreasing the inputs needed for production, (iii) decreasing pollution
   by optimizing the metabolic functioning of farming systems, (iv)
   enhancing diversity within animal production systems to strengthen their
   resilience and (v) preserving biological diversity in agroecosystems by
   adapting management practices. We then discuss how these different
   principles combine to generate environmental, social and economic
   performance in six animal production systems (ruminants, pigs, rabbits
   and aquaculture) covering a long gradient of intensification. The two
   principles concerning economy of inputs and reduction of pollution
   emerged in nearly all the case studies, a finding that can be explained
   by the economic and regulatory constraints affecting animal production.
   Integrated management of animal health was seldom mobilized, as
   alternatives to chemical drugs have only recently been investigated, and
   the results are not yet transferable to farming practices. A number of
   ecological functions and ecosystem services (recycling of nutrients,
   forage yield, pollination, resistance to weed invasion, etc.) are
   closely linked to biodiversity, and their persistence depends largely on
   maintaining biological diversity in agroecosystems. We conclude that the
   development of such ecology-based alternatives for animal production
   implies changes in the positions adopted by technicians and extension
   services, researchers and policymakers. Animal production systems should
   not only be considered holistically, but also in the diversity of their
   local and regional conditions. The ability of farmers to make their own
   decisions on the basis of the close monitoring of system performance is
   most important to ensure system sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{In 2005, fire ignited by humans swept from Yuma Proving Grounds into
   Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona, burning ca. 9,255 ha of
   Wilderness Area. Fuels were predominantly the native forb Plantago
   ovata. Large fires at low elevations were rare in the 19th and 20th
   centuries, and fires fueled by native vegetation are undocumented in the
   southwestern deserts. We estimated the area damaged by fire using
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index, which are more accurate and reduce subjectivity of
   aerial surveys of perimeters of fires. Assemblages of upland and
   xeroriparian plants lost 91 and 81\% of live cover, respectively, in
   fires. The trees Olneya tesota and Cercidium had high amounts of
   top-kill. King Valley was an important xeroriparian corridor for birds.
   Species richness of birds decreased significantly following the fire.
   Numbers of breeding birds were lower in burned areas of King Valley 3
   years post-fire, compared to numbers in nearby but unburned Alamo Wash.
   Although birds function within a large geographic scale, the extent of
   this burn still influenced the relative abundance of local species of
   breeding birds. This suggests that breeding birds respond to conditions
   of localized burns and slow recovery of vegetation contributes to
   continued lower numbers of birds in the burned sites in King Valley.}},

Abstract = {{The Namib Desert is an ancient desert on the west coast of southern
   Africa. The Namib has unique endemic biodiversity and scenic landscapes,
   with a major part contained in the Namib Naukluft Park and the adjacent
   Dorob National Park, together forming a major tourism attraction in
   Namibia. There are currently large exploration and mining developments
   in the central Namib, fuelled by rising global demand for uranium.
   Mining contributes significantly to the Namibian GDP, but through
   destruction of habitats and ecological processes, may cause
   environmental degradation and loss of ecosystem services. Additionally,
   Namibia stands to lose a significant part of the biological diversity
   that makes it unique. These direct impacts are occurring in the context
   of regional climatic changes that are predicted to have their own severe
   impacts on biodiversity. A number of tools exist to counter these
   impacts, among which ecological restoration is an important one. Yet the
   extent of the damage to ecological processes and functions of Namib, the
   interactions with climate change and the mechanisms through which the
   impacts will occur are still not well known. There is thus a crucial
   need for a better understanding of these arid ecosystems and their
   response to disturbance, to devise better restoration techniques, and to
   inform decision makers about management options. This paper analyses the
   extent of the threats to the central Namib's ecosystems and biodiversity
   due to mining, identifies critical knowledge gaps for restoration,
   defines policy needs, and proposes a broad strategy which is intended to
   be a framework for research, planning and management for sustainable use
   of this unique desert. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of species that are patchily distributed must consider
   processes that influence both the occurrence of individuals within
   patches, and the persistence of populations across multiple habitat
   patches within the landscape. Here we present a rare regional assessment
   of the population size and distribution of a patchily distributed,
   threatened species, the purple-crowned fairy-wren (Malurus coronatus
   coronatus), across a vast landscape. We used data from aerial vegetation
   mapping of waterways, with on-ground bird surveys to predict the
   occurrence of suitable habitat for M. c. coronatus across 14 catchments
   in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Suitable habitat was
   extremely limited (305 km of riparian vegetation) and fragmented (342
   patches) along the 2700 km of waterway surveyed within catchments where
   the species occurs. Populations were predicted to be large on the
   Fitzroy, Durack and Drysdale catchments, and small on the Isdell and
   northern Pentecost catchments, and a total population of 2834 to 4878
   individuals could be supported. The sub-populations spanned numerous
   patches of habitat across multiple properties of varying tenure.
   Therefore, a landscape-scale approach to conservation management, across
   multiple tenures, is critical to safe-guard connectivity within
   populations. The greatest benefit may be achieved by a combination of
   broad-scale actions to reduce the impact of ubiquitous threatening
   processes, and fine-scale targeted effort in areas where populations are
   most vulnerable. Controlling access of stock to waterways and management
   of fire are most important to conserve suitable habitat. Such a
   landscape-scale approach to conservation may be of benefit to other
   patchily distributed species.}},

Abstract = {{Managed forests have the potential to promote tree microhabitats and
   hence to conserve the biodiversity, especially of birds, bats, and
   saproxylic insects, associated with such features. Although the value of
   tree microhabitats for biodiversity has been described, surprisingly,
   the factors that explain the occurrence and density of tree
   microhabitats in managed forests remain poorly known, especially in
   Mediterranean forests. To address this gap, we studied the occurrence
   and density of nine types of tree microhabitats inventoried in 1630
   trees and 59 forest stands: canopy dead wood; woodpecker cavities;
   non-woodpecker cavities (with a distinction between lower, medium, and
   upper cavities); Cerambyx cavities; loose barks or cracks; conks of
   fungi; and ivy. Each tree was described according to the
   presence/absence of microhabitats as well as tree diameter, vitality,
   and species. In each stand, structural variables (basal area, stem
   density, log volume, stand height, diameter class distribution) and the
   time since last cutting (i.e., the number of years since the last
   cutting) were assessed. At the tree level, large-diameter trees, snags,
   and non-coniferous species supported a higher richness of microhabitats
   than trees of small diameter, living trees, and conifers. Holm oak
   (Quercus ilex L.), which is a typical species of Mediterranean forests,
   exhibited a particularly high ability to host microhabitats. Tree
   diameter was the best predictor of the occurrence of most microhabitats
   (7 out of 9). We studied co-occurrences among microhabitats, but our
   results indicated that microhabitat types served poorly as proxies of
   other microhabitats due to frequent but unspecific positive
   relationships. At the stand level, time since last cutting was the best
   predictor of density of microhabitat-bearing trees and the occurrence of
   most tree microhabitats. The density of microhabitat-bearing trees was
   approximately 13 times higher in older stands (>90 years post-cutting)
   than in recently cut stands (<30 years). To maintain biodiversity in
   forests, we suggest that managers conserve large trees and snags and
   preferentially use holm oaks for wood production. Silvicultural
   practices should include a long rotation period and favor harvesting by
   group selection to maintain forest stands with a time since last cutting
   >90 years. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We employed a chronosequence approach to evaluate patterns of bird
   abundance in relation to post-fire vegetation recovery in mountain big
   sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata vaseyana). We estimated population
   density for 12 species of birds within the perimeters of 4 fires that
   had undergone 820 years of vegetation recovery and on adjacent unburned
   areas in the northwestern Great Basin, USA. Six species showed negative
   responses to fire persisting up to 20 years. Two species showed positive
   responses with effects persisting for <20 years. Understory vegetation
   was similar between burned and unburned areas irrespective of recovery
   time, and shrub canopy cover was similar between burned and unburned
   sites after 20 years of recovery. Persistent reductions in bird
   densities lead us to conclude that shrub canopy cover alone is not a
   sufficient metric for predicting recovery of songbird abundances

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of evidence highlights the importance of biodiversity for
   ecosystem stability and the maintenance of optimal ecosystem
   functionality. Conservation measures are thus essential to safeguard the
   ecosystem services that biodiversity provides and human society needs.
   Current anthropogenic threats may lead to detrimental (and perhaps
   irreversible) ecosystem degradation, providing strong motivation to
   evaluate the response of ecological communities to various anthropogenic
   pressures. In particular, ecosystem functions that sustain key ecosystem
   services should be identified and prioritized for conservation action.
   Traditional diversity measures (e.g. species richness') may not
   adequately capture the aspects of biodiversity most relevant to
   ecosystem stability and functionality, but several new concepts may be
   more appropriate. These include response diversity', describing the
   variation of responses to environmental change among species of a
   particular community. Response diversity may also be a key determinant
   of ecosystem resilience in the face of anthropogenic pressures and
   environmental uncertainty. However, current understanding of response
   diversity is poor, and we see an urgent need to disentangle the
   conceptual strands that pervade studies of the relationship between
   biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our review clarifies the links
   between response diversity and the maintenance of ecosystem
   functionality by focusing on the insurance hypothesis of biodiversity
   and the concept of functional redundancy. We provide a conceptual model
   to describe how loss of response diversity may cause ecosystem
   degradation through decreased ecosystem resilience. We explicitly
   explain how response diversity contributes to functional compensation
   and to spatio-temporal complementarity among species, leading to
   long-term maintenance of ecosystem multifunctionality. Recent
   quantitative studies suggest that traditional diversity measures may
   often be uncoupled from measures (such as response diversity) that may
   be more effective proxies for ecosystem stability and resilience.
   Certain conclusions and recommendations of earlier studies using these
   traditional measures as indicators of ecosystem resilience thus may be
   suspect. We believe that functional ecology perspectives incorporating
   the effects and responses of diversity are essential for development of
   management strategies to safeguard (and restore) optimal ecosystem
   functionality (especially multifunctionality). Our review highlights
   these issues and we envision our work generating debate around the
   relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functionality, and
   leading to improved conservation priorities and biodiversity management
   practices that maximize ecosystem resilience in the face of uncertain
   environmental change.}},

Pages = {{98-106}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In early May 2007, northern Utah mountains experienced a period of
   prolonged warmer-than-normal temperatures, followed by a frost that
   killed or damaged much of the first-flush quaking aspen (Populus
   tremuloides) foliage. We assessed the effects of this transitory
   disturbance on the aspen bird species assemblage by comparing breeding
   bird survey data collected in the Bear River Mountain Range, Utah, USA,
   in 2005 and 2006 (predisturbance) to data from 2007 (postdisturbance).
   Whereas bird total abundance, species richness, and species diversity
   did not differ significantly among years, there were significant
   year-by-frost damage severity interactions, with plots with low levels
   of frost damage having significantly higher total abundance, richness,
   and diversity. Based on these results, we concluded that (1) at the
   landscape scale, the postdisturbance avian species assemblage was
   essentially identical to the predisturbance assemblage both in terms of
   number of individuals and species, and (2) there was a pronounced shift
   in the spatial distribution of birds at the stand scale, with most
   individuals favoring stands with low levels of frost damage over those
   with intermediate and high levels of frost damage. Thus, aspen stands
   with little or no frost damage served as refugia for birds displaced
   from highly impacted sites, thereby buffering any adverse effects on the
   avian community as a whole, at least in the short term. However, with
   severe climatic events predicted to become more frequent, cumulative
   effects of successive frost-induced defoliations on long-term avian
   productivity and survival may be more severe.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological restoration is becoming an increasingly important tool in
   humanity's attempt to manage, conserve, and repair the world's
   ecosystems. In the current study, the objective was to compare the
   effects of two restoration methods on arthropod biodiversity and
   community composition in two former pine plantations; these treatments
   included both intensive restoration effort (= cleared) and moderate
   restoration effort (= thinned). For the cleared treatment, vegetation
   was clear-cut to the soil surface, and all vegetation was removed from
   the plots, while the thinned treatment consisted of reducing the Pinus
   elliotii (Slash Pine) density to that of a native ecosystem and removing
   of all exotic plants from the plots as well. Arthropods were sampled by
   employing pitfall traps, sticky traps, and sweep netting and identified
   to family and morphospecies; species richness, diversity, and community
   similarity were compared between treatments and sites. Experimental
   treatments quickly reached or exceeded arthropod diversity and richness
   of an unmanipulated control treatment; however, the two sites produced
   non-overlapping ordination plots, suggesting that the diversity of the
   two sites are either compositionally different (alpha diversity) or
   community assemblage is incomplete and overall regional (beta) diversity
   has not reached an equilibrium across sites. Additional long-term data
   should reveal if these plots are proceeding along different successional
   trajectories in terms of community species composition, or whether
   treatments, while having similar richness, support different communities
   because the three types of plots used in this study (control, thinned,
   and cleared) represent various successional stages which affect
   arthropod species identity, but not overall richness.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean ecosystems are rich in wildlife species and habitats. In
   the last decades human pressure is increasing in lowland and coastal
   areas, while mountainous and island areas are being abandoned. These
   changes have substantial impacts on biodiversity protected by EU
   Directives. Recently agri-environmental schemes and wildlife habitat
   improvement measures have been taken to prevent biodiversity loss,
   although only a small proportion of their total budget is targeted
   directly at biodiversity conservation. Measures for wildlife are
   generally limited to restricted areas for a short-term period and in
   most cases have not been evaluated or properly applied. This review
   examines the influence of farming systems, agri-environmental and
   wildlife management measures on birds and mammals in Mediterranean
   agroecosystems. The conclusions are that in Mediterranean agroecosystems
   the most cost efficient and beneficial conservation measures for bird
   and mammal species are rotation, intercropping, and the selection of
   appropriate crops and farming practices. The increased biodiversity in
   the Mediterranean basin requires special management practices at local
   levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied responses of breeding birds to alternative regimes for
   managing tallgrass prairie at the Smoky Hill Air National Guard Range in
   central Kansas. Species richness, diversity, and evenness did not differ
   among treatments, but overall abundance was highest in unburned idle
   (i.e., not grazed or hayed) transects, and was lowest in idle transects
   burned that spring. However, no treatment was either superior or
   inferior to all others for attracting the highest numbers of every
   species. Dickcissels (Spiza americana) and Henlow's sparrows (Ammodramus
   henslowii) were most numerous in unburned idle units, grasshopper
   sparrows (A. savannarum) were most abundant in grazed units and hayed
   units, upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) were most often found in
   burned units, whereas eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) were less
   abundant in burned units than in all other treatments. We conclude that
   the recent switch to burning idle units every 3-4 years, rather than
   annually, has benefitted most grassland bird species. The variety of
   management regimes implemented at Smoky Hill Air National Guard Range
   fosters heterogeneity of vegetative structure across the landscape, and
   thereby allows the site to provide for differing needs of various
   species, thus enhancing its value for grassland bird conservation.}},

Abstract = {{As human demand for ecosystem products increases, management
   intervention may become more frequent after environmental disturbances.
   Evaluations of ecological responses to cumulative effects of management
   interventions and natural disturbances provide critical decision-support
   tools for managers who strive to balance environmental conservation and
   economic development. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the effects
   of salvage logging on avian community composition in lodgepole pine
   (Pinus contorta) forests affected by beetle outbreaks in Oregon, USA,
   1996-1998. Treatments consisted of the removal of lodgepole pine snags
   only, and live trees were not harvested. We used a Bayesian hierarchical
   model to quantify occupancy dynamics for 27 breeding species, while
   accounting for variation in the detection process. We examined how
   magnitude and precision of treatment effects varied when incorporating
   prior information from a separate intervention study that occurred in a
   similar ecological system. Regardless of which prior we evaluated, we
   found no evidence that the harvest treatment had a negative impact on
   species richness, with an estimated average of 0.2-2.2 more species in
   harvested stands than unharvested stands. Estimated average similarity
   between control and treatment stands ranged from 0.82-0.87 (1 indicating
   complete similarity between a pair of stands) and suggested that
   treatment stands did not contain novel assemblies of species responding
   to the harvesting prescription. Estimated treatment effects were
   positive for twenty-four (90\%) of the species, although the credible
   intervals contained 0 in all cases. These results suggest that, unlike
   most post-fire salvage logging prescriptions, selective harvesting after
   beetle outbreaks may meet multiple management objectives, including the
   maintenance of avian community richness comparable to what is found in
   unharvested stands. Our results provide managers with prescription
   alternatives to respond to severe beetle outbreaks that continue to
   occur across extensive portions of the dry forests of western North
   America.}},

Title = {{Old rural parks support higher biodiversity than forest remnants}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{One of the main challenges in biodiversity conservation is to curb a
   further degradation and loss of high-quality habitats. In agricultural
   matrix landscapes, the detection of alternative habitats for habitat
   specialists may be a solution. Historic old parks or landscape gardens
   around manor houses and castles are cultural heritage of nobles, but
   their value in harbouring biodiversity is poorly acknowledged. Therefore
   we evaluated the potential of old rural parks to serve as a habitat for
   nemoral forest species. We recorded stand structure and the presence of
   forest biodiversity indicators in 74 closed-canopy stands of historic
   parks and compared them with 93 neighbouring mature forest remnants on
   ancient forest land. We estimated the importance of stand structure in
   relation to habitat type on biodiversity indicators. Finally we suggest
   single-value indicator-complexes for the cost-efficient assessment of
   the conservation value of forests and forest-like habitats. Park stands
   outclassed reference forests in several individual structural
   characteristics, and in combined indicators of habitat quality and
   biodiversity. Forests had higher estimates for the combined indicator of
   dead wood, but large-diameter dead wood types were more abundant in
   parks. Woodpeckers, several old-growth indicator epiphytes and forest
   herbs had successfully become established in planted forest-like park
   fragments. Old rural parks resemble high-conservation-value forests more
   than the best preserved contemporary forest remnants. After the century
   needed to overcome immigration delay, old parks do provide a refugium
   for temperate deciduous forest species. Consequently,
   biodiversity-targeted management should retain and enhance old-growth
   attributes in forests and on the peripheries of parks: e.g. preserving
   old trees to provide service for epiphytes, hollow trees and an
   understorey mosaic for birds and bats; dead wood elements for saproxylic
   insects and fungi; limited mowing frequency and increased cutting height
   for forest herbs. Forestry should enhance the recovery of mixed
   deciduous stands and avoid conifer plantations.}},

Abstract = {{To counteract the negative effects of intensive agriculture there is
   increasing interest in approaches that reconcile agricultural production
   with the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and associated
   ecosystem services. Integration of functional agrobiodiversity (FAB) in
   agricultural systems holds promise to meet these challenging objectives,
   but requires the generation, transfer and implementation of tailor-made
   knowledge, and policy development. Currently various initiatives are
   undertaken across Europe to develop and assess the potential of
   biodiversity-based management practices by farmers, industry,
   researchers and governmental and non-governmental organizations. In this
   paper we show that the Convention on Biological Diversity and planned
   reforms in EU policy offer scope to further implement FAB concepts via
   legislation for biodiversity conservation, pesticide use, water quality,
   environmental protection and conservation of genetic resources. At the
   same time we observe that there are still impediments to the adoption of
   FAB approaches, including (i) translation of general knowledge to
   tailored, ready-to-use management practices, (ii) limited information on
   the effectiveness of FAB measures in terms of crop yield and quality,
   profitability, and reduction of agrochemical inputs, (iii) lack of
   appropriate financial accounting systems that allow fair accounting of
   the private investments and public benefits, and (iv) the implementation
   of FAB measures at the right spatial scales, which requires coordination
   among the various actors in a region. Current and new legislation may
   provide incentives to address these limitations and contribute to the
   further development and integration of FAB concepts in agricultural
   systems in Europe. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In Mediterranean areas, river systems are key for maintaining regional
   biodiversity by providing a high diversity of habitats. We studied bird
   community recovery for 9 years (20012009) during landscape restoration
   and Guadiamar Green Corridor establishment in the area affected by the
   Aznalcollar mine spill (SW Spain, 1998). One year following plant
   restoration (3 years after the spill), values for - and -bird species
   diversity were high, sooner than reported for similar restoration
   processes elsewhere. Species richness, ecological diversity, and
   abundance increased only slightly in the following 8 years. Overlap
   between communities in sequential years, measured by similarity indexes,
   increased throughout the study period to about 70\% during final survey
   years, and most breeding bird species present before the accident again
   inhabit the area. Only 5 years after the mine accident, bird communities
   in the restored site were similar in species richness, abundance, and
   diversity to an unaffected reference site; redundancy analysis
   demonstrated that bird communities were also similar between the
   reference river and the Guadiamar. Despite the severity of the mine
   accident, our results suggest a swift recovery of the bird community. We
   attribute this success to the rapid restoration of habitat availability
   and the resilience of the birds. This long-term study contributes to our
   limited knowledge of bird species response to habitat restoration
   following toxic spills in Mediterranean habitats.}},

Journal = {{RESTORATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{267-275}},

Abstract = {{Although examples are rare, conflicts between species of conservation
   concern can result from habitat restoration that modifies habitat to
   benefit a single taxon. A forest restoration program designed to enhance
   habitat for endangered red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) may
   be reducing available habitat for the eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale
   putorius), a forest-adapted sympatric species of conservation concern
   that occurs in the Ouachita National Forest, Arkansas, U.S.A. At small
   scales, eastern spotted skunks select early successional forest with
   structural diversity, whereas red-cockaded woodpeckers prefer mature
   pine (Pinus spp.) habitat. We surveyed for eastern spotted skunks at 50
   managed forest stands, modeled occupancy as a function of
   landscape-level habitat factors to examine how features of restoration
   practices influenced occurrence, and compared known occupied forest
   stands to those where active red-cockaded woodpecker nesting clusters
   were located. The most-supported occupancy models contained forest stand
   age (negatively associated) and size (positively associated); suggesting
   eastern spotted skunks primarily occupy large patches of habitat with
   dense understory and overhead cover. Red-cockaded woodpecker nesting
   clusters were located in smaller and older forest stands. These results
   suggest that increased overhead cover, which can reduce risk of avian
   predation, enhances occupancy by small forest carnivores such as eastern
   spotted skunks. Management activities that increase forest stand
   rotation length reduce the availability of young dense forest. The
   practice may enhance the value of habitat for red-cockaded woodpeckers,
   but may reduce the occurrence of eastern spotted skunks. Implementing
   plans that consider critical habitat and extinction risks for multiple
   species may reduce such conservation conflict.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Management practices in the landscape matrix can have significant
   effects on the spatial distribution of animals within adjacent protected
   areas. This has been well established in agricultural and forested
   areas, but less is known about how management of the suburban matrix
   affects adjacent reserves. We argue that it is critically important to
   understand the impact of suburban management on reserves, as flawed
   planning decisions can have negative conservation outcomes and waste
   limited resources. Location Canberra, Australian Capital Territory,
   Australia. Methods We examined bird distribution patterns in suburbs and
   adjacent reserves to the effects of two suburban management practices:
   (1) street tree planting and (2) boundary design. We focused on three
   groups of birds with known responses to urbanization: native
   urban-intolerant species (native avoiders), native urban-tolerant
   species (native adapters) and exotic urban-tolerant species (exotic
   adapters). Results We found that suburbs with 30\% native (Eucalyptus)
   street trees and reserves adjacent to these suburbs had significantly
   higher bird species richness, native adapter species richness and
   probability of reporting exotic adapters than those with exotic trees.
   The type of street trees, however, did not affect the probability of
   reporting native avoiders. These species were more likely to be reported
   when habitat complexity was high. Only native adapters responded to
   boundary design, with higher species richness when the boundary type was
   a local or unsealed road as opposed to an arterial road. Main
   conclusions Native street trees provide foraging resources for birds
   that would be reduced or absent in exotic streetscapes, enabling native
   streetscapes to support a rich community of birds. Furthermore, native
   streetscapes increase bird richness and diversity in adjacent reserves.
   This result has important conservation implications for suburb and
   reserve management practices. Our study provides evidence that the
   establishment and retention of native suburban streetscapes is an
   important management strategy for improved bird conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Open pine-grasslands are one of the most threatened ecological
   communities in the southeastern United States and provide essential
   habitat for many regionally declining bird species. While open pine
   grassland forests have diminished, acreage of pine plantations has
   increased throughout the Southeast, in part because of the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture Farm Bill conservation programs. To understand
   whether fire and herbicide treatments would be effective in creating
   pine grassland structure in plantations suitable for a suite of
   declining early successional and pine grassland adapted species, we
   evaluated combined effects of selective herbicide and prescribed fire on
   plant and bird communities in thinned, mid-rotation pine stands
   established under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in Mississippi,
   USA. Within each of the 12 replicate sites, we assigned 2 paired 8.1-ha
   plots to either treatment (herbicide + prescribed fire) or control in a
   randomized complete block design. We applied treatments during autumn
   and winter of 2002 2003. During 2003-2006 breeding seasons, we
   characterized the bird community using repeated (4-6 repetitions/yr),
   standardized, 10-minute point counts from which we estimated species
   richness, total relative abundance, total avian conservation value, and
   density of select species. Managed plots exhibited reduced hardwood
   midstory and a greater abundance of grasses and forbs in the ground
   layer. Although avian species richness and total relative abundance were
   similar in treatment and control stands, we observed a shift in the bird
   community from closed-canopy forest species to early successional and
   pine grassland adapted species, many of which are experiencing
   population declines. We recommend thinning, hardwood midstory control,
   and prescribed burning within CRP pine plantations to provide habitat
   for a suite of regionally declining bird species. (C) 2012 The Wildlife

Title = {{A burning issue: Fire overrides grazing as a disturbance driver for
   South African grassland bird and arthropod assemblage structure and
   diversity}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds
   and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and
   grazing in South Africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and
   stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (October-March).
   Bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways,
   driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat
   structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. Similarly,
   arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to
   management practices. Fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure
   and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at
   all taxonomic levels. In particular, fire frequency strongly influenced
   grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the
   territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. Insectivores, and
   nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial
   management. Of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted
   pipit (Anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally Vulnerable
   because of habitat loss. This species is sensitive to any form of
   habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in
   these grasslands. Of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area,
   only Orthoptera responded positively to burning. However, orthopterans
   made up on average 78\% of arthropod biomass in moist highland
   grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt
   farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores.
   This reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure
   of performance, such as reproductive Success, is considered in assessing
   ecosystem condition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{37}},

Pages = {{261-265}},
Abstract = {{Forty years since the cessation of grazing on Tiritiri Matangi, the
   island has been transformed by a restoration programme. However, a big
   question remained: What the island would have looked like if restoration
   had not occurred? This study addresses that question. Some sections of
   the island were deliberately not restored and allowed to regenerate
   naturally to provide a reference point for the changes brought about by
   direct intervention. In one area a transect of plots was available in
   which species composition and frequency information had been measured in
   a pre-restoration state. A comparison, almost 30 years later, showed
   that many previously dominant pasture grasses had been lost, and
   replaced by native grassland dominated by Microlena stipoides. Also,
   native shrubs and small trees absent from the pasture grassland in 1979
   were now present, although in low abundance. Overall this study shows
   that in this environment, even 40 years after the cessation of grazing,
   the succession to woody vegetation is slow. It may be another 40 years
   before woody vegetation dominates the area. This demonstrates that
   active restoration of the island greatly accelerated the development of
   forest over natural regeneration, and this has undoubtedly allowed the
   rapid expansion of many otherwise very restricted bird species.}},

Abstract = {{The White-backed Woodpecker (WbW) and the Three-toed Woodpecker (TtW)
   are rare woodpecker species that inhabit natural old-growth forests with
   abundant dead wood in Eurasia. We studied stand-related environmental
   factors subject to forest management (stand structure, tree-species
   composition, accessibility by humans) in determining the distribution of
   these two species in mountainous forests of the Polish Carpathians. Data
   were collected during 2007-2009 at the Beskid Wyspowy Mountains. WbWs
   preferred multispecies deciduous over pure beech forests, whereas TtWs
   were most frequently found in spruce-dominated forests. The thresholds
   of dead and dying wood for WbW presence in managed forests were
   approximately 50 m(3)ha(-1) and 35 m(3)ha(-1), respectively, and for TtW
   were approximately 30 m(3) ha(-1) and 115 m(3)ha(-1), respectively.
   These were 5-8 times higher than in randomly-selected control plots with
   no woodpeckers. In both cases, lower logging intensity on
   difficult-to-access slopes and higher amount of dead and dying wood
   correlated with increasing occupancy probability of the woodpeckers.
   These results help develop classification criteria for the monitoring of
   woodpecker habitats over the Natura 2000 network and improve the

Abstract = {{Sustainable use and management of natural resources is now a
   well-accepted principle, but its implementation continues to elude us.
   This is partly because of the complex and dynamic nature of ecological
   systems, interdependence among elements, and the impacts that resource
   management actions have on the functioning of an ecosystem.
   Livestock grazing is the most extensive landuse in Australia, occurring
   in over 55\% of the continent. In forested landscapes this landuse has
   been characterised by clearing and/or modification of landscapes through
   overgrazing and changes to fire regimes, followed by re-growth and
   increase in density of woody vegetation and associated loss in grazing
   productivity. Consequently, the Vegetation Management Act 1999, now in
   place in Queensland, requires the coexistence of conservation of
   biological diversity and primary production. However, a challenge exists
   in how to integrate the two outcomes in a sustainable manner.
   This paper describes a case study application of the Ecosystem Dynamics
   Simulator (EDS), a forest growth model, as a decision support tool for
   the integration of sustainable livestock production and conservation of
   biological diversity at Mt Armour Nature Refuge, in western Queensland.
   The study was initiated by a request from the landowner for advice on
   how to manage increasing density of woody vegetation (vegetation
   thickening) without compromising conservation values. The landholder had
   expressed concern that the vegetation thickening was impinging on
   livestock production and was therefore in need of thinning. Thinning of
   vegetation within this bioregion is regulated by the Regional Vegetation
   Management Code for Brigalow Belt and New England Tablelands Bioregions,
   Queensland Government (Code) (DNRM, 2012). Firstly, for thinning to
   occur, the Code requires a verified crown cover increase or presence of
   > 250 immature stems in a 0.25 ha area. Secondly, if thinning occurs,
   all mature stems should be retained, and including 75 or 125 immature
   stems per 0.25 ha area depending on vegetation type.
   Our objective was to establish: 1) whether density of immature stems met
   thinning criteria of the Code and; 2) what thinning intensity and fire
   regimes were necessary to promote a sustainable ecosystem. In examining
   thinning intensity, the potential risk of loss of biodiversity based on
   recommended retention rates was also investigated. Working in
   collaboration with the landholder, data were collected from the property
   and the landowner's tree removal preference was also recorded. The EDS
   was used to project long-term changes in tree species composition and
   diameter size class structure for the uneven-aged mixed species native
   forests and to explore management scenarios that included the use of
   alternative thinning scenarios and fire regimes.
   The results confirmed: 1) the vegetation on the site was dense enough to
   be thinned under the current Code and projection indicated thickening is
   likely to continue if left un-thinned; 2) that the landowner's preferred
   tree removal intensity was not sustainable and; 3) a thinning intensity
   based on long-term simulation that considered species composition and
   stand size structure provided the best compromise outcome. The
   simulation results also confirmed likely inadequacy in the Code's
   recommended retention rates for immature stems in the studied vegetation
   types. Retaining only 75 immature stems (< 20 cm dbh) appeared to be a
   high risk option because large trees were few, growth rates were low and
   sapling recruitment was intermittent and vulnerable to drought related
   mortality. Consequently, retention of at least 140 immature stems would
   provide a more resilient stand structure and species composition under
   the dry growth conditions at the study site. This study demonstrated the
   valuable role that a vegetation growth dynamics simulator can play in
   elucidating long-term changes in tree species composition and diameter
   size structure in support of sustainable environmental management.}},

Abstract = {{Silvicultural practices lead to changes in forest composition and
   structure and may impact species diversity from the overall regional
   species pool to stand-level species occurrence. We explored to what
   extent fine-scale occupancy patterns in differently managed forest
   stands are driven by environment and ecological traits in three regions
   in Germany using a multi-species hierarchical model. We tested for the
   possible impact of environmental variables and ecological traits on
   occupancy dynamics in a joint modelling exercise while taking possible
   variation in coefficient estimates over years and plots into account.
   Bird species richness differed across regions and years, and trends in
   species richness across years were different in the three regions. On
   the species level, forest management affected occupancy of species in
   all regions, but only 35\% of the total assemblage-level variation in
   occurrence probability was explained by either forest type and
   successional stage and <?1\% by forest edge. On the assemblage level,
   bird occurrence decreased with body mass in all regions. Species with
   smaller breeding ranges had lower occurrence probabilities in one
   region, while later spring arrival decreased occurrence probabilities in
   the two other regions. Spatial variation in the effect size of trait
   covariates such as species phylogeny and breeding strata showed that
   variation in patch occupancy due to fine-scale differences in forest
   management is, to some extent, predictable from ecological traits. Our
   results show that environmental factors and ecological traits jointly
   predict variation in bird occupancy patterns and their response to
   forest management. Observations at the fine scale of forest stands, at
   which conservation efforts can be arranged along with forest management
   practices in heterogeneous environments, have been shown to provide
   meaningful insights despite the difficulties involved in monitoring
   mobile organisms such as birds at the plot level.}},

Abstract = {{Smith's Longspurs (Calcarius pictus) are a species of concern in North
   America because of their limited range and apparent low population size.
   To better understand winter habitat needs and guide management of this
   species, we examined habitat associations of Smith's Longspurs in
   eastern Arkansas by comparing grassland patches where Smith's Longspurs
   flushed to randomly located patches in the same area. Smith's Longspurs
   were found in sparse grassland patches of relatively low height adjacent
   to airport runways where the native grass prairie three-awn (Aristida
   oligantha) dominated ground cover and vertical structure. Smith's
   Longspurs were not found in vegetation plots dominated by non-native
   Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon). Prairie three-awn grass may provide
   concealment from predators and their seeds may be an important food
   source. Occurrence of Smith's Longspurs was also correlated with less
   litter, perhaps because deeper litter could make walking and searching
   for seeds more difficult. Availability of suitable habitat for Smith's
   Longspurs along airport runways may be declining due to natural
   succession of grassland habitat in the absence of disturbance and recent
   changes in management that favor Bermuda grass. Conversion and
   degradation of native prairie has resulted in the decline in abundance
   and distribution of Chestnut-collared Longspurs (C. ornatus) and
   McCown's Longspurs (Rhynchophanes mccownii). Our findings suggest that
   conversion of native grasslands to non-native grasslands results in loss
   and degradation of habitat for wintering populations of Smith's
   Longspurs.}},

Abstract = {{Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are well-known to occur at
   higher densities in recently burned forests than they do in nearby green
   forests. In the forests of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, there is
   relatively little information on the types of nest trees that these
   birds use in recently burned forests. From 2009 to 2011, we studied
   nest-tree preference by black-backed woodpeckers in 2 burned forests in
   the northern Sierra Nevada. For each of 31 nest trees and 389 randomly
   selected trees, we recorded decay class, diameter at breast height, top
   condition, and species. We also recorded the number of snags with >23 cm
   diameter at breast height within an 11.3-m radius of each nest tree and
   randomly selected tree. We evaluated nest-tree preference by comparing
   the characteristics of nest trees to randomly selected trees.
   Black-backed woodpeckers preferred dead but not heavily decayed trees
   and moderate (29-61 cm dbh) diameter trees. There was no evidence that
   black-backed woodpeckers had strong preferences for trees with broken
   tops or trees of particular species. Snag density around nest trees was
   higher than around randomly selected trees. Our results suggest that in
   conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada, the distribution of black-backed
   woodpeckers in post-fire environments is influenced more by surrounding
   snag densities than by particular characteristics of potential nest
   trees. (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.}},

Title = {{Conserving avian richness through structure retention in managed forests

Abstract = {{Structure retention is a practice used in managed forests to assist the
   conservation of biological diversity, whereby green trees, dead trees
   (i.e. snags), and downed wood are retained during timber harvest. This
   activity is recognized as beneficial. However, there is little
   scientific support to guide the management prescriptions (e.g. patch
   sizes, distribution pattern). We quantified the short-term response of
   birds to structure retention in timber harvest areas located in the
   Pacific Northwest. We used a hierarchical community model to examine how
   attributes of retention sites (number of trees and snags, distance to
   forest edge) were associated with the species richness of birds using
   the sites. The modeling framework integrated multiple species-specific
   occupancy models that accounted for imperfect detection to produce
   estimates of species richness. We sampled a biogeoclimatic gradient by
   selecting harvest units within four separate regions (two in Washington,
   one each in Oregon and California) that support different forest types.
   Observations were conducted at a random selection of retention sites
   (e.g. patches, individual trees) within harvest units to record bird use
   during the breeding seasons of 2008 and 2009. Estimated occupancy and
   detection probabilities differed by species and region. Retained tree
   count was associated with an increased occupancy probability for all
   observed species. The community response to tree count was consistent
   across all study regions and years - species richness estimates
   increased with tree count and approximated a species-area curve. Snag
   count and edge distance did not significantly affect occupancy
   probability for any observed species, and therefore, had no relationship
   with species richness. These results suggest that the diversity of birds
   using structure retention in harvest units can be maximized at patches
   of >10-15 rotation-age trees. Forest managers are encouraged to group
   green-trees around high-quality snags and other unique wildlife trees
   where possible, and to vary prescriptions across stands to provide
   habitat heterogeneity at the landscape scale. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In tropical and subtropical forests there is limited information about
   how to integrate sustainable timber management with the conservation of
   biodiversity. We examined the effect of selective logging on the bird
   community to help develop management guidelines to assure the
   conservation of biodiversity in forests managed for timber production.
   The study design consisted of control and harvested plots in piedmont
   and cloud forests of the subtropical montane forests of the Andes in
   northwestern Argentina. We conducted bird point-count surveys combined
   with distance estimation. Breeding season bird community composition was
   more similar between control and logged forest in both the cloud forest
   and piedmont, than between the two elevations, probably because
   Neotropical bird communities change dramatically along elevational
   gradients. Within each elevation zone, community composition changed
   significantly between harvested and control forests. Both between and
   within each elevation zone no significant differences in bird density
   were detected. Similarly, when we analyzed bird density according to
   diet guilds no general pattern could be extracted. However, we found a
   significantly greater density of cavity nesters and lower of non-cavity
   nesters in control plots, probably because most trees that can develop
   suitable cavities were extracted in logged plots and these plots had a
   greater structural diversity enabling more nesting resources. Grouping
   species according to their nesting habitat requirements has rarely been
   used in the neotropics and other tropical and subtropical forests, but
   focusing management attention on cavity nesters might address the most
   sensitive portion of the avian community as well as other species
   dependent on trees likely to hold cavities.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification is a leading cause of global biodiversity
   loss, especially for threatened and near-threatened species. One widely
   implemented response is `wildlife-friendly farming', involving the close
   integration of conservation and extensive farming practices within
   agricultural landscapes. However, the putative benefits from this
   controversial policy are currently either unknown or thought unlikely to
   extend to rare and declining species. Here, we show that new,
   evidence-based approaches to habitat creation on intensively managed
   farmland in England can achieve large increases in plant, bee and bird
   species. In particular, we found that habitat enhancement methods
   designed to provide the requirements of sensitive target biota
   consistently increased the richness and abundance of both rare and
   common species, with 10-fold to greater than 100-fold more rare species
   per sample area than generalized conventional conservation measures.
   Furthermore, targeting landscapes of high species richness amplified
   beneficial effects on the least mobile taxa: plants and bees. Our
   results provide the first unequivocal support for a national
   wildlife-friendly farming policy and suggest that this approach should
   be implemented much more extensively to address global biodiversity
   loss. However, to be effective, these conservation measures must be
   evidence-based, and developed using sound knowledge of the ecological
   requirements of key species.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the response of faunal communities to fire presents a
   challenge for land managers worldwide because the post-fire responses of
   species may vary between locations and fire events. Post-fire recovery
   can occur via nucleated recovery from in situ surviving populations or
   by colonization from ex situ populations. Fine-scale spatial patterns in
   the patchiness of fires and the proximity of burnt sites to source
   populations may contribute to both the variability in post-fire
   responses and the processes by which populations recover. We examined
   the avifauna at recently burnt sites within extensive semi-arid
   shrublands of south-eastern Australia, including 72 sites <?5 years
   since fire and 26 sites 10 years since fire. Study sites represented a
   gradient of increasing distance from unburnt vegetation (i.e. >?27 years
   since fire) and varied in the presence or absence of small (25900?m2)
   unburnt patches of vegetation. For sites <?5 years since fire, species
   richness was higher at sites closer to unburnt vegetation and at sites
   containing unburnt patches. These patterns were no longer evident at
   sites of 10 years since fire. The probability of occurrence of three of
   seven bird species modelled decreased with increasing distance to
   unburnt vegetation, but this pattern was evident only at sites burnt
   uniformly. One species was found almost exclusively at patchily burnt
   sites. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that proximity
   to unburnt vegetation enhances post-fire occupancy, and that
   colonization from ex situ populations is an important process for
   post-fire recovery of avifauna. Additionally, small unburnt patches
   enhance the rapid recovery of assemblages post-fire. These patterns are
   important for understanding the dynamics of post-fire population
   recovery. We recommend that management of fire for ecological purposes
   should explicitly consider the role that the spatial attributes of fires
   play in determining the post-fire community.}},

Abstract = {{Little information is available on long-term changes in bird communities
   following fire in the unmanaged forest. We have evaluated and compared
   bird species communities along two long-term chronosequences after fire
   (0 to > 200 years post-fire) in the eastern Quebec boreal forest, which
   is known for its long fire-return intervals. By characterizing forest
   habitat in stands of different ages (time since fire), we were able to
   model species richness and bird community characteristics in three
   habitat types: mature forests, forest-edge, and open-forests. Although
   bird species richness did not vary greatly, our results show changes in
   species composition following successional stages and highlight the need
   to protect the forest at all stages, especially old-growth, which
   provides a heterogeneous environment suitable for several species.
   Keeping a mosaic composed of all-age, fire-disturbed forests should
   facilitate the conservation of bird diversity in the eastern boreal
   forest.}},

Abstract = {{Airborne lidar is a remote-sensing tool of increasing importance in
   ecological and conservation research due to its ability to characterize
   three-dimensional vegetation structure. If different aspects of plant
   species diversity and composition can be related to vegetation
   structure, landscape-level assessments of plant communities may be
   possible. We examined this possibility for Mediterranean oak forests in
   southern Portugal, which are rich in biological diversity but also
   threatened. We compared data from a discrete, first-and-last return
   lidar data set collected for 31 plots of cork oak (Quercus suber) and
   Algerian oak (Quercus canariensis) forest with field data to test
   whether lidar can be used to predict the vertical structure of
   vegetation, diversity of plant species, and community type. Lidar- and
   field-measured structural data were significantly correlated (up to r=
   0.85). Diversity of forest species was significantly associated with
   lidar-measured vegetation height (R2= 0.50, p < 0.001). Clustering and
   ordination of the species data pointed to the presence of 2 main forest
   classes that could be discriminated with an accuracy of 89\% on the
   basis of lidar data. Lidar can be applied widely for mapping of habitat
   and assessments of habitat condition (e.g., in support of the European
   Species and Habitats Directive {[}92/43/EEC]). However, particular
   attention needs to be paid to issues of survey design: density of lidar
   points and geospatial accuracy of ground-truthing and its timing
   relative to acquisition of lidar data.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate measurement of forest canopy structure is critical for
   understanding forest-wildlife habitat relationships. Although most
   theory and application have been based on in situ measurements, imaging
   technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) provide
   measurements that are both vertically accurate and horizontally
   extensive. We use small-footprint, multiple-return lidar from a
   state-wide dataset (1-m footprint, 0.11 point/m(2)) to characterize the
   vertical and horizontal structure of successional loblolly pine (Pinus
   taeda) and mature, fire-maintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)
   forests on the coastal plain of North Carolina, USA. The relationship
   between these characteristics and the federally-endangered red-cockaded
   woodpecker's (Picoides borealis, Vieillot) habitat preferences were
   assessed; as this species has a strong affinity for mature longleaf pine
   forests. Vertical structure was characterized by lidar-derived metrics
   (e.g., average and standard deviation of canopy height) and horizontal
   patterns of vertical structure were quantified by semivariograms and
   lacunarity analysis. Lidar metrics were compared with field measurements
   of stand structure and with woodpecker habitat use. We predicted
   woodpecker distribution using the Maxent species distribution modeling
   algorithm with elevation, landcover, and hydrography geospatial
   variables, with and without lidar-derived structural variables. Lidar
   successfully quantified canopy variation and differentiated between the
   structural characteristics of these two similar coniferous evergreen
   forest types (e.g. significant differences in maximum height, canopy
   cover, and size classes). Loblolly stands were found to have the tallest
   trees on average with a higher canopy cover. Both semivariograms and
   lacunarity analyses clearly differentiated between evergreen forest
   structural types (e.g. semivariogram range was 18.7 m for longleaf, 32.3
   m for loblolly). By examining the immediate area around cavity nesting
   sites we found taller trees than those found across broader foraging
   sites. The species distribution model accurately predicted woodpecker
   distribution (tested with woodpecker presence, AUC >.85). The addition
   of lidar-derived variables improved the model's predictive power by 8\%
   compared to the model based only on elevation, landcover, and
   hydrography environmental variables. We show that relatively low density
   lidar data are valuable for wildlife studies by characterizing and
   separating similar canopy types, describing different use zones
   (foraging vs. nesting), and for use in species distribution models. (C)

Title = {{Fire in a sub-humid woodland: The balance of carbon sequestration and
   habitat conservation}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{280}},
Pages = {{40-51}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Public lands are often tasked with ecosystem restoration that may
   include fire as a management tool in order to foster the return of
   ecosystem composition, structure, or function to a previous state. In
   some ecosystems, such as woodlands, the role of fire is poorly
   understood because mixed-fire regimes complicate assessment of landscape
   level fire return intervals and successional pathways. Management of
   these public woodlands may be difficult due to the need to accomplish
   multiple objectives such as carbon (C) sequestration and wildlife
   conservation on properties with marginal productivity. To assess the
   role of fire in affecting various ecological processes and offer
   information for future wildland management decision-making, we measured
   C storage, vegetation composition, and habitat suitability for an
   endangered bird species (golden-cheeked warbler, Dendroica chrysoparia)
   in juniper-oak woodlands with documented past surface fires within
   Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge. We found significantly
   different total aboveground biomass C with average values of 5.25, 6.86,
   and 9.18 kg m(-2) of C for 60 plots grouped into recent (<40 year), old
   (>= 40 year), and no fire treatments, respectively. Interpretation of
   fire for each plot was based on fire scar data derived from a previous
   tree-ring study for the refuge. We found fire significantly reduced site
   C primarily due to reduced tree density. We also found increased oak
   recruitment associated with fires that occurred in low summer
   precipitation years. Calculated habitat suitability index values for the
   golden-cheeked warbler did not significantly differ between groups.
   However, fire may have a dual effect on habitat suitability. While
   catastrophic wildfire can damage potential habitat and significantly
   reduce regional carbon storage, our study showed that moderate intensity
   fires in dense young juniper stands promotes tree species diversity,
   favorable for future habitat formation. We conclude that fire as a
   management focus, including use of prescribed burning and fuel
   treatments to reduce wildfire risk, may be implemented on a single
   conservation property to achieve multiple expected outcomes. However,
   this requires detailed ecological information regarding woody species
   composition and population structure to help assess legacy conditions
   that influence the interpretation of present woodland conditions and
   future projections given restoration efforts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2030-2036}},

Abstract = {{Human-induced increases in nitrogen (N) deposition are common across
   many terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. Greater N availability not only
   reduces biological diversity, but also affects the biogeochemical
   coupling of carbon (C) and N cycles in soil ecosystems. Soils are the
   largest active terrestrial C pool and N deposition effects on soil C
   sequestration or release could have global importance. Here, we show
   that 27 years of chronic N additions to prairie grasslands increased C
   sequestration in mineral soils and that a potential mechanism
   responsible for this C accrual was an N-induced increase in root mass.
   Greater soil C sequestration followed a dramatic shift in plant
   community composition from native-species-rich C-4 grasslands to
   naturalized-species-rich C-3 grasslands, which, despite lower soil C
   gains per unit of N added, still acted as soil C sinks. Since both high
   plant diversity and elevated N deposition may increase soil C
   sequestration, but N deposition also decreases plant diversity, more
   research is needed to address the long-term implications for soil C
   storage of these two factors. Finally, because exotic C-3 grasses often
   come to dominate N-enriched grasslands, it is important to determine if
   such N-dependent soil C sequestration occurs across C-3 grasslands in
   other regions worldwide.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{593-602}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Ecological restoration is increasingly used to reverse degradation of
   rare ecosystems and maintain biological diversity. Pollinator
   communities are critical to maintenance of plant diversity and, in light
   of recent pollinator loss, we tested whether removal of invasive glossy
   buckthorn (Frangula alnus L.) from portions of a prairie fen wetland
   altered plant and pollinator communities. We compared herbaceous plant,
   bee, and butterfly abundance, diversity, and species composition in
   buckthorn invaded, buckthorn removal, and uninvaded reference plots.
   Following restoration, we found striking differences in plant and
   pollinator abundance and species composition between restored,
   unrestored, and reference plots. Within 2 years of F. alnus removal,
   plant species diversity and composition in restored plots were
   significantly different than invaded plots, but also remained
   significantly lower than reference plots. In contrast, in the first
   growing season following restoration, bee and butterfly abundance,
   diversity, and composition were similar in restored and reference plots
   and distinct from invaded plots. Our findings indicate that a diverse
   community of mobile generalist pollinators rapidly re-colonizes restored
   areas of prairie fen, while the plant community may take longer to fully
   recover. This work implies that, in areas with intact pollinator
   metapopulations, restoration efforts will likely prevent further loss of
   mobile generalist pollinators and maintain pollination services. On the
   other hand, targeted restoration efforts will likely be required to
   restore populations of rare plants and specialist pollinators for which
   local and regional species pools may be lacking.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Cultivation and cropping are major causes of destruction and degradation
   of natural ecosystems throughout the world. We face the challenge of
   maintaining provisioning services while conserving or enhancing other
   ecosystem services and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. There is
   a range of possibilities within two types of intervention, namely ``land
   sharing{''} and ``land separation{''}; the former advocates the
   enhancement of the farmed environment, but the latter a separation
   between land designated for farming versus conservation. Land sharing
   may involve biodiversity-based agricultural practices, learning from
   traditional farming, changing from conventional to organic agriculture
   and from ``simple{''} crops and pastures to agro-forestry systems, and
   restoring or creating specific elements to benefit wildlife and
   particular services without decreasing agricultural production. Land
   separation in the farmland context involves restoring or creating
   non-farmland habitat at the expense of field-level agricultural
   production-for example, woodland on arable land. Restoration by land
   sharing has the potential to enhance agricultural production, other
   ecosystem services and biodiversity at both the field and landscape
   scale; however, restoration by land separation would provide these
   benefits only at the landscape scale. Although recent debate has
   contrasted these approaches, we suggest they should be used in
   combination to maximize benefits. Furthermore, we suggest ``woodland
   islets{''}, an intermediate approach between land abandonment and
   farmland afforestation, for ecological restoration in extensive
   agricultural landscapes. This approach allows reconciliation of farmland
   production, conservation of values linked to cultural landscapes,
   enhancement of biodiversity, and provision of a range of ecosystem
   services. Beyond academic research, restoration projects within
   agricultural landscapes are essential if we want to halt environmental
   degradation and biodiversity loss.}},

Title = {{Avian Species Richness in Relation to Intensive Forest Management
   Practices in Early Seral Tree Plantations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Managers of landscapes dedicated to forest commodity
   production require information about how practices influence biological
   diversity. Individual species and communities may be threatened if
   management practices truncate or simplify forest age classes that are
   essential for reproduction and survival. For instance, the degradation
   and loss of complex diverse forest in young age classes have been
   associated with declines in forest-associated Neotropical migrant bird
   populations in the Pacific Northwest, USA. These declines may be
   exacerbated by intensive forest management practices that reduce
   hardwood and broadleaf shrub cover in order to promote growth of
   economically valuable tree species in plantations.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: We used a Bayesian hierarchical
   model to evaluate relationships between avian species richness and
   vegetation variables that reflect stand management intensity (primarily
   via herbicide application) on 212 tree plantations in the Coast Range,
   Oregon, USA. Specifically, we estimated the influence of broadleaf
   hardwood vegetation cover, which is reduced through herbicide
   applications, on bird species richness and individual species occupancy.
   Our model accounted for imperfect detection. We used average predictive
   comparisons to quantify the degree of association between vegetation
   variables and species richness. Both conifer and hardwood cover were
   positively associated with total species richness, suggesting that these
   components of forest stand composition may be important predictors of
   alpha diversity. Estimates of species richness were 35-80\% lower when
   imperfect detection was ignored (depending on covariate values), a
   result that has critical implications for previous efforts that have
   examined relationships between forest composition and species richness.
   Conclusion and Significance: Our results revealed that individual and
   community responses were positively associated with both conifer and
   hardwood cover. In our system, patterns of bird community assembly
   appear to be associated with stand management strategies that retain or
   increase hardwood vegetation while simultaneously regenerating the
   conifer cover in commercial tree plantations.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{152}},
Pages = {{62-73}},

Abstract = {{Do sites managed under an agri-environment scheme support significantly
   more biodiversity than sites managed in accordance with traditional
   agricultural practices? This is a key question underpinning
   agri-environment schemes worldwide, including one that we report on here
   that has been established in south-eastern Australia. To address this
   question, we established a large-scale, blocked and replicated
   cross-sectional study comprising 104 sites in four key ``management{''}
   classes: (1) Agricultural production sites characterized by traditional
   set-stocking grazing. (2) Short-term conversion sites in which
   investments to improve conservation had recently (<2 years ago) been
   made. (3) Long-term conversion sites where investments to improve
   conservation values were made >7 years ago. And (4) Traveling stock
   reserves (TSRs) which have traditionally been subject to limited
   vegetation clearing and grazing pressure over the past 150 years. Such
   TSRs are often considered `benchmarks' of vegetation condition and
   biodiversity prior to European settlement.
   We identified significant (P < 0.001) differences between management
   classes and bird species richness (including the richness of bird
   species of conservation concern), with a gradient of increasing richness
   from production sites, short-term conversion sites, long-term conversion
   sites to TSRs. We also found significant (P < 0.001) differences in the
   composition of bird assemblages between management classes which
   followed a broadly similar gradient pattern to that identified for bird
   species richness. We also identified functional groups of birds
   associated with different management practices. In particular,
   small-bodied, non-seed eating and open-nesting bird species were
   significantly more likely to occur in TSRs than in production sites. We
   found that differences in bird species richness and assemblage
   composition could be explained by readily quantifiable relationships
   with vegetation structure and condition (i.e. native shrub cover, native
   ground ground cover, native plant species richness, percentage overstory
   regeneration, and the amount of bare ground).
   Our findings suggest that management intervention may shift some key
   characteristics of woodland vegetation typical of agricultural
   production sites toward those of ``benchmark{''} TSRs and that these
   alterations in characteristics are, in turn, important for bird biota.
   Characteristics of particular importance include retention or
   improvement in the native shrub and sub-shrub layer and overstory
   regeneration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Questions Efforts to emulate natural fire effects through harvesting
   have met with limited success due to insufficient consideration of
   variable fire severities and spatial heterogeneity of fire regimes (e.g.
   mean return interval and fire size) in boreal ecosystems. What is the
   relative importance of fire severity and spatial heterogeneity on tree
   species composition, age structure and spatial pattern? Location An
   eastern boreal forest landscape of northeast China, consisting of larch
   and birch forests. Methods We constructed a factorial design of forest
   management alternatives and conducted simulation experiments using a
   landscape disturbance and succession model, LANDIS. We used a management
   area delineation method to simulate spatial heterogeneity of fire regime
   and a silvicultural regeneration method to simulate variable fire
   severity. Results Management area delineation had a greater influence on
   tree species composition, age structure and spatial pattern of the
   boreal forests than the silvicultural regeneration method. The
   silvicultural regeneration method had more influence on the age
   structure of larch than birch, due to the variable severity of fire on
   larch. Conclusions Spatial heterogeneity of fire regime has a more
   important influence on ecosystem characteristics than fire severity in
   this eastern boreal landscape. Efforts to emulate natural fire effects
   through harvesting should first account for the effects of spatial
   heterogeneity of the fire regime. It is necessary to delineate the
   landscape into fire management units and incorporate variable fire
   severities in harvest prescriptions for each unit.}},

Abstract = {{Natural disturbance emulation (NDE) has been proposed as a general
   approach to ecologically sustainable forest management. We reviewed the
   concepts, theories, and strategies related to NDE in boreal forest
   management. We also reviewed publications that discussed NDE in the
   boreal forest in general and those that specifically compared NDE-based
   management with conventional even-aged management. The papers generally
   focused on northern North America and landscape-scale wildfire as the
   main disturbance factor, whereas information from Eurasia was
   exclusively theoretical. Within this limited scope, NDE was generally
   found to have a positive effect on biodiversity in terms of forest
   structure and species diversity when compared with conventional
   even-aged management. Studies on timber supply and social implications
   of NDE were so few that they preclude generalizations. We conclude that
   the ecological and economic performance of NDE as a management approach
   still remains poorly examined. To advance the development of NDE,
   particular attention should be given to (1) augmenting the knowledge
   base on natural range of variability of unmanaged forest ecosystems and
   evaluating the validity of this information in a changing climate, (2)
   fostering multidisciplinary research with better integration of
   ecological theory to both integrative and analytical research on NDE,
   and (3) better integration of socioeconomic concerns, adaptive
   management schemes, and international collaboration into NDE

Abstract = {{Shrubs, such as mesquite (Prosopis spp.) and cholla (Opuntia spp.), now

   Responses of birds to prescribed burning of the shortgrass prairie in
   this region are poorly understood. We examined daily survival rates of
   mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) and lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus)
   nests in an experimental landscape (4,811 ha) of spatially replicated,
   inter-annual fire frequencies (burning every 2 yr, 4 yr, or 10 yr) near
   Amarillo, Texas. Herbaceous habitat structure was most developed in
   infrequently burned plots, but shrub densities were less variable among
   the burn treatments. We modeled daily nest survival (DSR) against burn
   frequency, shrub density at nest sites, and nest stage (incubation or
   nestling). Daily survival of mourning dove nests was not well-related to
   any measured covariate, but lark sparrow DSR was negatively related to
   the duration of inter-annual burn frequency. In semiarid grasslands
   heavily inundated with shrubs, prescribed burning may positively
   influence the nest success of some bird species. (C) 2012 The Wildlife

Title = {{Different bioindicators measured at different spatial scales vary in

Abstract = {{Ecologically, potential bioindicator taxa operate at different scales
   within agricultural ecosystems, and thereby provide a means to
   investigate the influence of changing management practice on biological
   diversity at different scales within the agro-ecosystem. Surveys of
   grassland plant species at field level, parasitoid Hymenoptera at the
   field and farm scale, and bird populations and habitats at farm scale
   were carried out on 119 grass-based farms across three regions in the
   Republic of Ireland. In addition, habitat richness and aquatic
   macroinvertebrates were quantified at landscape scale. Agricultural
   intensity on the surveyed farms was quantified by mean farm stocking
   rate, calculated as livestock units per ha (LU/ha), and generalised
   linear mixed models used to evaluate relationships between stocking rate
   and the incidence of chosen bioindicator groups. Field scale
   bioindicators (plant species richness and parasitoid taxon richness and
   abundance) were negatively associated with mean farm stocking rate. Over
   much of its observed range, mean farm stocking rate was positively
   associated with total bird species richness and abundance, and the
   species richness and abundance of farmland bird indicator species
   recorded in the winter season. However, these relationships were
   quadratic, and above a relatively high upper limit of 2.5-3.5 LU/ha,
   further increase in farm stocking rate had a negative influence. Results
   demonstrate that different bioindicators measured at different spatial
   scales vary in their response to agricultural intensity. The lack of a
   consistent bioindicator response to farm stocking rate suggests that
   within predominantly farmed regions, maximising biodiversity requires a
   careful targeting and monitoring with bioindicator taxa that are
   informative of influences at relevant operational scales. The insights
   provided may then be much more informative for the design and
   implementation of agri-environment measures that maximise biodiversity
   within farmed landscapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Salt marsh management often embraces diverse goals, ranging from the
   restoration of degraded marshes through re-introduction of tidal flow to
   the control of salt marsh mosquito production by altering marsh surface
   topography through Open Water Marsh Management (OMWM). However, rarely
   have these goals been incorporated in one project. Here we present the
   concept of Integrated Marsh Management (IMM), which combines the best
   management practices of salt marsh restoration and OMWM. Although IMM
   offers a comprehensive approach to ecological restoration and mosquito
   control, research evaluating this concept's practical implementations
   has been inadequate. A long-term IMM project at Wertheim National
   Wildlife Refuge located in a highly urbanized watershed on Long Island,
   New York, USA was designed to fill this knowledge gap. A combination of
   restoration and OMWM techniques was employed at two treatment marshes,
   the results monitored before and after alterations, and compared to two
   adjacent control marshes. The treatment marshes experienced decreased
   mosquito production, reduced cover of the invasive common reed
   (Phragmites australis), expansion of native marsh vegetation, increased
   killifish and estuarine nekton species abundance, as well as increased
   avian species diversity and waterbird abundance. This demonstration
   project validated the IMM conceptual approach and may serve as a case
   study for similar IMM projects in the future.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Mechanical management of forest fuels is increasingly used in the
   Euro-Mediterranean region in response to the abandonment of traditional
   agroforestry and the concurrent increase in fire hazard. Although fuel
   management may have positive side effects for biodiversity, its
   long-term impacts remain largely unknown. 2. We used a 70-year
   post-management chronosequence to investigate the influence of time
   since fuel management and management frequency on bird assemblages in
   cork oak Quercus suber forests. 3. Fuel management strongly affected
   bird species richness, abundances and assemblage composition, with rapid
   changes often occurring during the first 1020 years, followed in the
   next decades by a slow convergence to pre-management levels. 4. In
   winter, overall species richness and abundance, and that of frugivores
   and shrub foragers, were negatively affected by recent and recurrent
   management, only recovering in stands unmanaged for >50 years. In
   spring, insectivore abundance and the richness and abundance of shrub
   foragers declined immediately following management, increased to a
   maximum about 20 years later, and declined thereafter. Breeding
   granivores and ground foragers were the only groups that benefitted from
   fuel management. There were no overall effects on species of
   conservation concern, although a few species with unfavourable status
   benefitted from fuel management. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our
   study confirmed that mechanical fuel management has positive effects on
   some early-successional bird species of conservation concern, although
   its effects were limited. These benefits should be compared with the
   strong negative impacts on key bird species such as wintering
   frugivores, which play a pivotal role in ecosystems by promoting seed
   dispersal. To reconcile the positive and negative aspects, fuel
   management should be used to create heterogeneous mosaics of forest
   patches encompassing a range of sizes (10100 ha) and successional stages
   of understorey vegetation, including stands undisturbed for >50 years.
   This management strategy will likely maintain conditions for a wide
   range of species with contrasting ecological requirements while also
   reducing fire hazard.}},

Title = {{The effect of postfire salvage logging on bird communities in
   Mediterranean pine forests: the benefits for declining species}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{644-651}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Postfire salvage logging is the most commonly applied forestry
   practice in burned forests world-wide, mainly for economic reasons.
   However, it strongly affects bird communities and is generally
   considered to be detrimental for bird conservation. In Europe, many
   open-habitat species are currently declining owing to land use changes.
   Wildfires, which are common disturbances in the Mediterranean Basin, can
   create suitable habitat for these species but the effect of postfire
   salvage logging on bird communities is unknown. 2. We surveyed breeding
   birds in two burned secondary pine forests from the western
   Mediterranean Basin and analysed the effect of salvage logging and
   vegetation regeneration as determinants of individual species and
   community parameters. We used a pseudoexperimental
   before-after-control-impact approach to study the changes in the bird
   community during the first three springs after fire. 3. Most bird
   species were affected by salvage logging (measured by snag density), a
   relationship that was positive for forest birds and negative for
   open-habitat species. Species linked to shrub and edge habitats were
   positively affected by vegetation regrowth. Bird communities in logged
   areas held more species of conservation concern than those in unlogged
   areas. Species richness and overall density tended to decrease from the
   first to the second year after fire and to increase from the second to
   the third. 4. Salvage logging benefits a number of open-habitat species,
   although its effect on bird conservation depends strongly on the
   specific threats that birds face in each region or ecosystem. 5.
   Synthesis and applications. In the Mediterranean Basin, some postfire
   salvage logging of pine forests can be compatible with bird
   conservation. We recommend that managers retain some standing dead trees
   during logging operations and that logged forest is interspersed with
   unlogged stands. This will provide suitable habitat for the widest range
   of species.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud forests are unusual and fragile habitats, being one of the least
   studied and least understood ecosystems. The tropical Andean dominion is
   considered one of the most significant places in the world as regards
   biological diversity, with a very high level of endemism. The
   biodiversity was analysed in an isolated remnant area of a tropical
   montane cloud forest known as the ``Bosque de Neblina de Cuyas{''}, in
   the North of the Peruvian Andean range. Composition, structure and dead
   wood were measured or estimated. The values obtained were compared with
   other cloud forests. The study revealed a high level of forest
   biodiversity, although the level of biodiversity differs from one area
   to another: in the inner areas, where human pressure is almost
   inexistent, the biodiversity values increase. The high species richness
   and the low dominance among species bear testimony to this montane cloud
   forest as a real enclave of biodiversity.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{273}},

Abstract = {{Fire hazard mitigation planning requires an accurate accounting of fuel
   complexes to predict potential fire behavior and effects of treatment
   alternatives. In the southeastern United States, rapid vegetation growth
   coupled with complex land use history and forest management options
   requires a dynamic approach to fuel characterization. In this study we
   assessed potential surface fire behavior with the Fuel Characteristic
   Classification System (FCCS), a tool which uses inventoried fuelbed
   inputs to predict fire behavior.
   Using inventory data from 629 plots established in the upper Atlantic
   Coastal Plain, South Carolina, we constructed FCCS fuelbeds representing
   median fuel characteristics by major forest type and age class. With a
   dry fuel moisture scenario and 6.4 km h(-1) midflame wind speed, the
   FCCS predicted moderate to high potential fire hazard for the majority
   of the fuelbeds under study. To explore fire hazard under potential
   future fuel conditions, we developed fuelbeds representing the range of
   quantitative inventory data for fuelbed components that drive surface
   fire behavior algorithms and adjusted shrub species composition to
   represent 30\% and 60\% relative cover of highly flammable shrub
   species. Results indicate that the primary drivers of surface fire
   behavior vary by forest type, age and surface fire behavior rating.
   Litter tends to be a primary or secondary driver in most forest types.
   In comparison to other surface fire contributors, reducing shrub loading
   results in reduced flame lengths most consistently across forest types.
   FCCS fuelbeds and the results from this project can be used for fire
   hazard mitigation planning throughout the southern Atlantic Coastal
   Plain where similar forest types occur. The approach of building
   simulated fuelbeds across the range of available surface fuel data
   produces sets of incrementally different fuel characteristics that can
   be applied to any dynamic forest types in which surface fuel conditions
   change rapidly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We examined foraging-habitat selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers
   (Picoides arcticus) in burned forests of southwestern Idaho during 2000
   and 2002 (6 and 8 years following wildfire). This woodpecker responds
   positively to large-scale fire disturbances and may be at risk from
   logging and post-fire management. With 100 radio-locations of four adult
   males, we used resource-selection probability functions in logistic form
   in an information-theoretic framework to model the Black-backed
   Woodpecker's selection of foraging habitat at fine and coarse spatial
   scales. Fine-scale data included characteristics of the foraging tree
   (tree level) and local habitat surrounding foraging trees (plot level,
   0.04 ha), whereas coarse-scale data (224-778 ha) included patch
   characteristics within home ranges. Model selection by Akaike's
   information criterion identified a multi-scale model containing tree-
   and plot-level covariates, and their interaction, as the best model to
   characterize foraging trees. The positive effect of interaction between
   foraging-tree diameter and plot-level tree density suggested that
   foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers select both patches with dense trees
   and larger-diameter trees. Fire severity was not important, possibly
   because of the time since fire and the birds' habit of foraging on
   recently dead trees in adjacent unburned forests. Salvage logging that
   retains large-diameter trees in clumped distributions is most likely to
   provide long-term foraging habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers in dry
   coniferous forests of the interior western U.S. Following wildfire,
   conservation of forest patches containing weakened trees may extend the
   suitability of habitat for foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers by up to 8
   years.}},

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{An important question for tropical forest restoration is whether
   degraded lands can be actively managed to attract birds. We censused
   birds and measured vegetation structure at 27 stations in young (69-yr
   old) actively and passively restored pasture and old growth forest at
   Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica. During 481 10-min
   point counts, we detected a high diversity186 speciesof birds using the
   restoration area. Surprisingly, species richness and detection frequency
   did not differ among habitats, and proportional similarity of bird
   assemblages to old growth forest did not differ between restoration
   treatments. Bird detection frequency was instead explained by exotic
   grass cover and understory stem densityvegetation structures that were
   not strongly impacted by active restoration. The similarity of bird
   assemblages in actively and passively restored forest may be attributed
   to differential habitat preferences within and among feeding guilds, low
   structural contrast between treatments, or the effect of nucleation from
   actively restored plots into passively restored areas. Rapid recovery of
   vegetation in this recently restored site is likely due to its proximity
   to old growth forest and the lack of barriers to effective seed
   dispersal. Previous restoration studies in highly binary environments
   (i.e., open pasture vs. tree plantation) have found strong differences
   in bird abundance and richness. Our data contradict this trend, and
   suggest that tropical restoration ecologists should carefully consider:
   (1) when the benefits of active restoration outweigh the cost of
   implementation; and (2) which avian guilds should be used to measure
   restoration success given differential responses to habitat structure.

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that population declines of bird species
   associated with early-successional forest conditions may be associated
   with reduced quality of breeding habitat. Increasing intensity of forest
   management on private lands and decreased harvest rates on federal lands
   in the Pacific Northwest, USA, have resulted in a loss of diverse young
   forest stands, typically called early seral forest. Previous studies
   suggest that the amount of early seral broadleaf cover within conifer
   forests is linked to the composition of foliage-gleaning bird
   communities. However, information regarding productivity and juvenile
   use of post-breeding habitat in highly modified plantation habitat is
   lacking. We examined the relationship between vegetation structure
   resulting from intensive forest management practices and the abundance
   of five species of leaf-gleaning, neotropical migrants: orange-crowned
   warbler (Oreothlypis celata (Say, 1823)), Wilson's warbler (Wilsonia
   pusilla (A. Wilson, 1811)), MacGillivray's warbler (Oporornis tolmiei
   (J.K. Townsend, 1839)), Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus (Nuttall,
   1840)), and black-headed grosbeak (Pheucticus melanocephalus (Swainson,
   1827)). All species, except MacGillivray's warbler, showed positive
   associations with the amount of early seral hardwood cover as
   fledglings, breeding adults, or both. However, the relative magnitude of
   these associations varied, suggesting that other factors may also have
   influenced avian responses. Abundances of breeding pairs and young are
   likely to show positive responses to management practices that increase
   early seral hardwood cover in regenerating stands. If adopted at
   landscape and regional scales, such practices may positively influence
   population trends of several declining bird species.}},

Abstract = {{The connectivity of remnant patches of habitat may affect the
   persistence of species in fragmented landscapes. We evaluated the
   effects of the structural connectivity of forest patches (i.e., distance
   between patches) and matrix class (land-cover type) on the functional
   connectivity of 3 bird species (the White-crested Elaenia {[}Elaenia
   albiceps], the Green-backed Firecrown Hummingbird {[}Sephanoides
   sephaniodes], and the Austral Thrush {[}Turdus falklandii]). We measured
   functional connectivity as the rate at which each species crossed from
   one patch to another. We also evaluated whether greater functional
   connectivity translated into greater ecological connectivity (dispersal
   of fruit and pollen) by comparing among forest patches fruit set of a
   plant pollinated by hummingbirds and abundance of seedlings and adults
   of 2 plants with bird- and wind-dispersed seeds. Interpatch distance was
   strongly associated with functional connectivity, but its effect was not
   independent of matrix class. For one of the bird-dispersed plants,
   greater functional connectivity for White-crested Elaenias and Austral
   Thrushes (both frugivores) was associated with higher densities of this
   plant. The lack of a similar association for the wind-dispersed species
   suggests this effect is linked to the dispersal vector. The abundance of
   the hummingbird-pollinated species was not related to the presence of
   hummingbirds. Interpatch distance and matrix class affect animal
   movement in fragmented landscapes and may have a cascading effect on the
   distribution of some animal-dispersed species. On the basis of our
   results, we believe effort should be invested in optimizing patch
   configuration and modifying the matrix so as to mitigate the effects of
   patch isolation in fragmented landscapes.}},

Volume = {{168}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance is a major source of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. In
   fire-maintained systems, disturbance by fire is often used as a
   management tool to increase biological diversity, restore degraded
   habitats, and reduce pest outbreaks. Much attention has been given to
   how plant communities recover from fire, but relatively few studies have
   examined post-fire responses of higher order species, such as insect
   herbivores. Because dynamic feedbacks occur between plants and their
   consumers, which can in turn influence the response of the entire
   ecosystem, incorporating higher trophic level responses into our
   understanding of the effects of fire is essential. In this study, we
   used structural equation modeling (SEM) to tease apart the direct and
   indirect effects of fire on insect herbivore assemblages found on three
   common oak species in the Florida scrub (Quercus inopina, Q. chapmanii,
   and Q. geminata). We investigated how fire affected herbivore abundance,
   richness, and community composition both directly and indirectly through
   environmental heterogeneity at different spatial scales (e.g., leaf
   quality, plant architecture, and habitat structure). We also
   investigated how seasonality and landscape heterogeneity influenced
   post-fire responses of insect herbivores and whether fire effects on
   herbivore assemblages varied among different host plants. Our general
   findings were that fire effects were (1) largely indirect, mediated
   through habitat structure (although direct fire effects were observed on
   Q. inopina herbivores), (2) non-linear through time due to self-thinning
   processes occurring in the scrub habitat, and (3) varied according to
   herbivore assemblage as a result of differences in the composition of
   species in each herbivore community. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first comprehensive study to examine how fire influences the
   assembly of insect herbivore communities through both direct and
   indirect pathways and at multiple spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{Forest encroachment threatens the biological diversity of grasslands
   globally. Positive feedbacks can reinforce the process, affecting soils
   and ground vegetation, ultimately leading to replacement of grassland by
   forest species. We tested whether restoration treatments (tree removal,
   with or without fire) reversed effects of nearly two centuries of
   encroachment by Abies grandis and Pinus contorta into dry, montane
   meadows in the Cascade Range, Oregon, USA. In nine, 1-ha plots
   containing a patchy mosaic of meadow openings and forests of varying age
   (20 to > 140 yr), we compared three. treatments affecting the ground
   vegetation: control (no trees removed), unburned (trees removed, slash
   burned in piles leaving 90\% of the area unburned), and burned (trees
   removed, slash broadcast burned). We quantified changes over 3-4 years
   in soils, abundance and richness of species with differing habitat
   associations (meadow, forest, and ruderal), and recruitment of conifers.
   Except for a transient increase in available N (especially in burn
   scars), effects of burning on soils were minimal due, in part, to mixing
   by gophers. Tree removal greatly benefited meadow species at the expense
   of forest herbs. Cover and richness of meadow species increased by 47\%
   and 38\% of initial values in unburned plots, but changed minimally in
   burned plots. In contrast, cover and richness of forest herbs declined
   by 44\% and 26\% in unburned plots and by 79\% and 58\% in burned plots.
   Ruderal species and conifer seedlings were uncommon in both treatments.
   Although vegetation was consumed beneath burn piles, meadow species
   recovered significantly after three years. Long-term tree presence did
   not preclude recovery of meadow species; in fact, colonization was
   greater in older than in younger forests. In sum, temporal trends were
   positive for most indicators, suggesting strong potential for
   restoration. Contrary to conventional wisdom, tree removal without fire
   may be sufficient to shift the balance from forest to meadow species. In
   meadows characterized by historically infrequent fire, small-scale
   disturbances and competitive interactions may be more critical to
   ecosystem maintenance and restoration. Managers facing the worldwide
   phenomenon of tree invasion should critically evaluate the ecological
   vs. operational need for fire in ecosystem restoration.}},

Title = {{Effects of landscape context on bird species abundance of tree fall gaps
   in a temperate deciduous forest of Northern Iran}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Tree fall gaps caused by natural disturbances are a major source of
   heterogeneity in intact forests. Bird species are known as ecological
   indicators, reflecting landscape level changes. Yet, the role of
   landscape context in bird species abundance within small gaps is not
   fully addressed. We examined the difference between avian richness and
   abundance within tree fall gaps and closed canopy forest areas in
   Kheyrud forest, located on the east of Noshahr Township, Mazandaran
   province in Iran as a representation of Hyrcanian forest. Breeding bird
   census was taken in 20 selected gaps (0.1-0.4 ha) and 250 m from the
   center of each gap known as controls. Birds were surveyed during
   breeding season in spring 2010. We also determined whether landscape
   context affected the abundance, richness and particular species
   abundance within the gaps. For this, we assessed landscape metrics by
   the Landscape Context Tool for every gap. Abundance (P = 0.003) and
   richness (P = 0.014) of birds were significantly higher in the gaps than
   in closed canopy controls. Gaps were higher in herb cover, coarse woody
   debris density and volume as well as pit and mound micro topography than
   controls. Great Tit (Parus major), Coal Tit (Parus ater), Eurasian
   Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), Common Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) and
   European Goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) were more abundant in gaps than
   in controls. Among which, European Goldfinch was the only gap specialist
   species. Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos) was the only species more
   abundant in controls than gaps. Mean tree diameter had a significant
   positive relation with avian richness and abundance in gaps, rather than
   landscape context rate but forest specialist richness was negatively
   related to gap size. Abundance of Great Tit was related to landscape
   context rate. Our study highlights the role of gap quality for breeding
   birds; therefore improving the quality of gap habitats especially
   maintaining dead wood should be considered as an important conservation
   factor. Management practices for providing habitat of gap specialists by
   taking out the remaining trees and making the gaps larger would increase
   bird species richness in a landscape scale but the shape and size of the
   openings should be according to the species requirements. We suggest
   that maintenance of tree fall gaps as a heterogeneous habitat and dead
   wood resource is crucial for promoting species richness. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia), listed by the U.S.
   Fish and Wildlife Service as endangered in 1990 due primarily to habitat
   loss and fragmentation, is a Neotropical migrant songbird that breeds
   exclusively in mature juniper-oak (Juniperus-Quercus) woodlands in
   central Texas, USA. Previous studies suggested suitable breeding habitat
   consists of >35\% canopy closure (with 50-70\% cover optimal), and >=
   10\% oak composition. However, little is known about this species'
   habitat relationships at the southwestern edge of its breeding range.
   Therefore, within this portion of the species' breeding range, we
   investigated influences of canopy closure and tree species composition
   on pairing and reproductive success of golden-cheeked warblers during
   2009 and 2010. We used remote sensing and ground sampling to acquire
   variables to describe habitat characteristics, and we estimated pairing
   for breeding and reproductive success by golden-cheeked warblers. We
   found successfully breeding pairs in areas with >20\% canopy cover, 35\%
   juniper composition, and only 3\% oak composition. A logistic model for
   pairing success retained juniper, oak, and the interaction between these
   2 variables, and the model for reproductive success retained juniper,
   canopy closure, study area, and the interaction between canopy closure
   and study area. Our results expand our knowledge of habitat conditions
   that warblers use for breeding, thus expanding the range of habitat
   management options available for this species during breeding season.

   butterflies}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{146}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In cultural landscapes there are often negative biodiversity
   consequences of agricultural abandonment and subsequent scrub and forest
   encroachment, due to homogenization and the loss of early-successional
   habitats. The common forestry practice of removing understory vegetation
   to prevent fire hazard (fuel management) probably has the side-effect of
   ameliorating these consequences, but it is uncertain whether it
   effectively restores habitats for early-successional species. Here we
   examine the influence of time since fuel management and management
   frequency on butterfly assemblages, using a chronosequence of cork oak
   (Quercus suber) stands spanning about 70 years. Overall species richness
   increased immediately after management and abundances peaked about 2-3
   years later, while both declined thereafter for about 10-20 years to
   pre-disturbance levels. Richness and abundances were also much higher in
   recurrently managed stands. Most life history groups showed successional
   trends similar to the overall species richness and abundances, though
   consistent positive effects of fuel management were only observed for
   species with univoltine life cycle, herbaceous layer feeding, larval
   overwintering, and intermediate body size. Individual species were
   largely associated with recent and recurrent management, though a few
   specialists occurred most often in undisturbed stands. These findings
   suggest that fuel management at <10 years intervals is strongly positive
   for butterfly assemblages in landscapes under land abandonment. However,
   to maintain the overall forest biodiversity it is critical that patches
   of undisturbed habitat are also retained at the landscape scale. (C)

Abstract = {{Fire frequency is a key land management issue, particularly in tropical
   savannas where fire is widely used and fire recurrence times are often
   short. We used an extended Before-After-Control-Impact design to examine
   the impacts of repeated wet-season burning for weed control on bird
   assemblages in a tropical savanna in north Queensland, Australia.
   Experimentally replicated fire treatments (unburnt, singularly bunt,
   twice burnt), in two habitats (riparian and adjacent open woodland),
   were surveyed over 3 years (1 year before the second burn, 1 year post
   the second burn, 2 years post the second burn) to examine responses of
   birds to a rapid recurrence of fire. Following the second burn, species
   richness and overall bird abundance were lower in the twice-burnt sites
   than either the unburnt or singularly burnt sites. Feeding group
   composition varied across year of survey, but within each year, feeding
   guilds grouped according to fire treatment. In particular, abundance of
   frugivores and insectivores was lower in twice-burnt sites, probably
   because of the decline of a native shrub that produces fleshy fruits,
   Carissa ovata. Although broader climatic variability may ultimately
   determine overall bird assemblages, our results show that a short
   fire-return interval will substantially influence bird responses at a
   local scale. Considering that fire is frequently used as a land
   management tool, our results emphasize the importance of determining
   appropriate fire-free intervals.}},

Title = {{Multiple habitat associations: the role of offsite habitat in
   determining onsite avian density and species richness}},
Journal = {{ECOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{134-145}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Many animal populations continue to decline despite occurring in
   protected areas or on sympathetically managed sites. Frequently, this is
   because a specific habitat patch may not fulfil all the niche
   requirements of a threatened species. For instance, species often move
   between, and make use of, multiple habitat types for breeding, roosting
   and feeding within the same landscape. These cross-habitat interactions
   present a challenge for conservation. Here we quantify how the habitat
   associations of individual species and assemblages occurring within two
   distinct but adjacent habitat types (moorland and farmland) determine a
   suite of density and richness indicators, using the bird community of
   the English uplands as a case study. There was a clear association
   between onsite avian density and richness and offsite habitat structure
   (e.g. vegetation height, percent cover of dominant plant species, land
   management practices). Although such effects are not universal across
   all species and assemblages, where present (for five farmland and three
   moorland indicators) the increase in explanatory power offered by
   including offsite habitat structure can be large. By constructing
   scenarios of possible changes to management practice on both moorland
   and farmland, we demonstrate a real conservation benefit can be obtained
   by altering management in offsite habitats. For example, reducing
   burning intensity on moorland can result in a five-fold increase in
   snipe Gallinago gallinago density on farmland, without an alteration in
   farmland habitat. For one species (Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata), we
   demonstrate the frequency with which birds move between and utilise
   farmland and moorland during the breeding season, and therefore the
   importance of both habitat types to maintaining population densities.
   The multiple habitat dependency phenomenon quantified here is common and
   not restricted to birds. The successful conservation of many threatened
   species will thus depend on coordinated cross-habitat management.}},

Abstract = {{Remote-sensing models have become increasingly popular for identifying,
   characterizing, monitoring, and predicting avian habitat but have
   largely focused on single bird species. The Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been shown to positively correlate with
   avian abundance and richness and has been successfully applied to
   southwestern riparian systems which are uniquely composed of narrow
   bands of vegetation in an otherwise dry landscape. Desert riparian
   ecosystems are important breeding and stopover sites for many bird
   species but have been degraded due to altered hydrology and land
   management practices. Here we investigated the use of NDVI, coupled with
   vegetation, to model the avian community structure along the San Pedro
   River, Arizona. We also investigated how vegetation and physical
   features measured locally compared to those data that can be gathered
   through remote-sensing. We found that NDVI has statistically significant
   relationships with both avian abundance and species richness, although
   is better applied at the individual species level. However, the amount
   of variation explained by even our best models was quite low, suggesting
   that NDVI habitat models may not presently be an accurate tool for
   extensive modeling of avian communities. We suggest additional studies
   in other watersheds to increase our understanding of these bird/NDVI
   relationships. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   OVERVIEW}},
Journal = {{ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2-3, SI}},
Pages = {{221-233}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires are among the most important natural disturbances in the
   Mediterranean basin. They impose drastic habitat and landscape
   modifications that affect not only the vegetation but also vertebrate
   dynamics and structure from the population up to the community levels.
   There are a wide range of post-fire succession trajectories for
   vertebrate populations, whereas specific-species responses are dependent
   upon post-fire biotic and abiotic conditions in the burned habitat. The
   main generalization at the population level is that the burned areas
   support populations of open-and edge-habitat species, whereas the
   species most abundant in unburned woody areas are typical forest-dweller
   species that avoid open areas. Wildfires reduce habitat availability for
   forest animals, but the overall impact of fire is not necessarily
   negative from the perspective of biodiversity conservation, since it
   creates heterogeneous landscape with forest patches that support forest
   dwellers and forest-edge specialists along with open habitats that are
   critical to maintain open-habitat species. But the effect of fires in
   the Mediterranean basin on biodiversity is highly variable and dependent
   upon several factors: the extent, severity, and frequency of the fire,
   the initial state of the ecosystem, the spatial arrangement and
   isolation of the post-fire burned and unburned patches, and various
   abiotic conditions. From the management point of view, the maintenance
   of landscape mosaic habitats with different fire history is vital for
   the preservation of high vertebrate biodiversity in the Mediterranean
   region.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of fires on bird diversity
   in Australia's tropical savannas. Bird surveys were conducted at 69
   sites between 2005 and 2007 to estimate bird species richness and
   abundance within the Mornington Sanctuary, the Kimberley, north-west
   Australia. We used MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectro-radiometer) and Landsat satellite imagery to map fire scars and
   to quantify vegetation cover parameters, and QuickBird imagery to map
   the percentage tree cover. Bird species richness and abundance were
   higher in areas exhibiting minimum seasonal and interannual changes, e.
   g. in riparian areas, near water and where tree cover was high. We found
   a significant negative effect of fire on bird diversity following the
   extensive late dry-season fires of 2006. These findings support the view
   that intense and large fires are threatening biodiversity and reinforce
   the importance of reducing the occurrence of late dry-season fires,
   which are the most severe and extensive. MODIS satellite imagery was
   found to provide a cost-effective approach to monitoring savanna
   landscapes, assessing the state of vegetation and monitoring fire
   dynamics.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{The brown creeper (Certhia americana) is one of the forest bird species
   most sensitive to partial harvesting in North America. We examined the
   detailed response of this species and its food (bark-dwelling
   invertebrates) during the 3rd and 4th year after experimental selection
   harvesting (30-40\% basal area removal) in northern hardwood forest.
   Relative to control plots, nest densities in treated plots were ca 50\%
   lower. Because the density of nesting substrates was not significantly
   lower in treated plots than in controls, we investigated whether
   foraging substrates could be the limiting factor. Specifically, we
   tested for a treatment effect on 1) the abundance and species
   composition of bark invertebrate assemblages; 2) the biomass of bark
   invertebrates per unit area; and 3) the frequency of food provisioning.
   As predicted, treatment had a significant negative effect on food
   provisioning rate, though not on invertebrate biomass, when accounting
   for year effects. There was also no evidence for a treatment effect on
   the structure of bark invertebrate assemblages, which was mainly
   influenced by cumulative degree days. Selection harvesting thus appeared
   to reduce the amount of food delivered to brown creeper nestlings,
   unless greater amounts of food were delivered per feeding trip in
   treated plots. The lower density of foraging substrates in treated plots
   (77 versus 112 stems.ha(-1) in controls) may require that adults perform
   longer foraging trips. Future studies should determine whether this
   extra effort has short-or long-term consequences for adults and
   nestlings.}},

Title = {{Monitoring indicates greater resilience for birds than for mammals in
   Kakadu National Park, northern Australia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{397-407}},
Abstract = {{Context. Aprevious study reported major declines for native mammal
   species from Kakadu National Park, over the period 2001-09. The extent
   to which this result may be symptomatic of more pervasive biodiversity
   decline was unknown.
   Aims. Our primary aim was to describe trends in the abundance of birds
   in Kakadu over the period 2001-09. We assessed whether any change in
   bird abundance was related to the arrival of invading cane toads
   (Rhinella marina), and to fire regimes.
   Methods. Birds were monitored at 136 1-ha plots in Kakadu, during the
   period 2001-04 and again in 2007-09. This program complemented sampling
   of the same plots over the same period for native mammals.
   Key results. In contrast to the decline reported for native mammals, the
   richness and total abundance of birds increased over this period, and
   far more individual bird species increased than decreased. Fire history
   in the between-sampling period had little influence on trends for
   individual species. Interpretation of the overall positive trends for
   bird species in Kakadu over this period should be tempered by
   recognition that most of the threatened bird species present in Kakadu
   were unrecorded in this monitoring program, and the two threatened
   species for which there were sufficient records to assess trends -
   partridge pigeon (Geophaps smithii) and white-throated grass-wren
   (Amytornis woodwardi) - both declined significantly.
   Conclusions. The current decline of the mammal fauna in this region is
   not reflected in trends for the region's bird fauna. Some of the
   observed changes (mostly increases) in the abundance of bird species may
   be due to the arrival of cane toads, and some may be due to local or
   regional-scale climatic variation or variation in the amount of
   flowering. The present study provides no assurance about threatened bird
   species, given that most were inadequately recorded in the study
   (perhaps because their decline pre-dated the present study).
   Implications. These contrasting trends between mammals and birds
   demonstrate the need for biodiversity monitoring programs to be broadly
   based. The declines of two threatened bird species over this period
   indicate the need for more management focus for these species.}},

   Implications for species richness and management}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{231-241}},
Abstract = {{The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) predicts a hump-shaped
   pattern between community diversity and disturbance, and is central to
   understanding patterns of species diversity. Here, we examine IDH in the
   context of alien plant: invasions. IDH can offer insight into the role
   of disturbance in facilitating plant invasions and the effect of these
   invasions on floristic diversity.
   Early stages of succession are most susceptible to invasion because
   resources and colonisation opportunities are elevated after disturbance.
   This trend is accentuated by human-mediated dispersal, a bias towards
   early successional species in the alien species pool, the tendency for
   fast-growing species to profit most from enemy release, and increased
   disturbance levels in human-modified habitats. Human disturbance,
   coupled with plant introductions, extends the diversity disturbance
   curve and shifts peak diversity towards higher disturbance levels.
   However, invasive aliens can reduce native diversity at the community
   scale, especially in mid succession where competitive interactions
   structure communities. Certain invasive plants may have higher impacts
   because they overcome some life history tradeoffs as a result of their
   association with humans or novel evolutionary histories, e.g. enemy
   release. This may directly or indirectly (e.g. through plastic
   reallocation of resources from defence into growth) enable invasive
   plants to colonise earlier or persist into later stages of succession.
   By modifying disturbance regimes, invaders that transform the
   environment may also interfere with succession and precipitate low
   diversity communities. Low introduction rates of late successional
   species may currently limit impacts of aliens under infrequent
   disturbance.
   IDH is a useful framework for understanding ecological communities.
   However, because of the novel evolutionary histories of alien species
   and the anthropogenic context in which they invade, disturbance levels
   that maximise total diversity in invaded communities can differ from
   those that maximise native diversity. Joint consideration of IDH and
   alien invasion patterns suggests a range of strategies can be used to
   manage diversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Changes in bird assemblages during succession following disturbance in
   secondary wet forests in south-eastern Australia}},
Journal = {{EMU}},

Volume = {{112}},

Pages = {{117-128}},
Abstract = {{After a successional forest is severely disturbed by wildfire and
   subsequent salvage logging or by clearfell timber harvesting and slash
   burning, if conditions are suitable, the forest will regenerate. It then
   passes through a series of stages of varying floristic composition and
   structure until further severe disturbance occurs. The characteristics
   of a forest-bird assemblage vary with both the successional stage of the
   forest (time period since the most recent severe disturbance event) and
   the long-term disturbance history of the forest. To determine how the
   bird assemblage changes during succession in a south-eastern Australian
   forest type that is fire-sensitive and also subject to regular timber
   harvesting, we surveyed birds in five age-classes of wet forest (from 2
   to >100 years post-disturbance). Bird-assemblage composition altered
   sequentially; the pattern and rate of change reflected those of the
   vegetation. Bird abundance and species richness varied little during
   succession. No species of bird was abundant only in early successional
   forest. Some species, such as Brown Thornbill (Acanthiza pusilla),
   Golden Whistler (Pachycephala pectoralis) and Grey Fantail (Rhipidura
   albiscapa), were common in all successional stages. Other species, such
   as White-throated Treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaea) and Striated
   Pardalote (Pardalotus striatus), were consistently abundant in mid-to
   late successional stages only; this highlighted the importance of older
   forests for avian biodiversity. Any increase in the frequency of severe
   disturbance in these forests would tend to favour only those bird
   species that are already common. This has implications for management
   programs in forests that are habitat for wildlife, but are also used by
   humans for timber harvesting and other commercial or recreational
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Water level and water surface area fluctuations are important factors
   determining abundance of bird populations and bird assemblages structure
   in a wetland habitat. The water level and water surface area of the
   Marsh Tomord (West Hungary) changed drastically between 1998 and 2008,
   and the marsh dried out because of scarce rainfall in 2000 and 2001. A
   habitat restoration in winter 2001 repaired the waterholding capacity of
   the marsh. We analyzed changes in parameters of bird assemblages in
   investigated wetland area in relation of environmental factors. We used
   full redundancy analysis (RDA) on number of caugth migratory birds per
   year, species richness, diversity and evenness of bird assemblages to
   examine correlations among water level, water surface area and
   vegetation core. Species like water rail, common snipe, river warbler,
   Savi's warbler, great reed warbler, reed warbler, marsh warbler, sedge
   warbler, reed bunting showed high and positive linear correlations with
   the water level and water surface area in the postbreeding period. Some
   wetland species, sedge warbler, Savi's warbler and reed bunting as well
   as total number of caugth birds per year and total numbers of caugth
   species per year were clearly associated with thick marsh vegetation.
   According to our results the bird species composition of the wetland
   might have returned to the prerestoration levels and surface areas.}},

Abstract = {{Cereal pseudo-steppes hold the largest proportion of declining bird
   species in Europe. Understanding how this process of decline is driven
   is essential for designing adequate management practices. The little
   bustard (Tetrax tetrax) is one of such threatened steppe-land bird
   species, which has suffered recent dramatic range constrictions and
   population declines. Although low breeding success has been claimed to
   be the main threat for the viability of future little bustard
   populations, the surprising lack of studies dealing with ecological
   requirements of broods hinders the implementation of efficient
   conservation practices. We studied the ranging behaviour and the
   reproductive success of a little bustard population by means of female
   radio-tracking conducted during 2006-2008 breeding seasons in the Ebro
   basin (NE Spain). We recorded an average breeding success of 0.27
   chicks/hen, which is not enough to sustain a viable population according
   to the demographic models for the species. Early-laid clutches showed
   more probabilities to hatch and to fledge. This was associated to two
   different ranging patterns (i.e. sedentary versus wandering
   respectively) which depended on the ability of the hen and its chicks to
   settle in suitable areas harbouring enough arthropods and shelter for
   chicks. Such resources decrease drastically as the breeding season
   progresses. Overall, data suggest that agricultural practices associated
   to agricultural intensification, particularly early harvest, reduce
   breeding success both directly by nest destruction and indirectly
   through a decrease on resource availability for broods. Based on our
   findings on the characteristics and structure of the home range of
   little bustard broods, we propose the creation of a network of permanent
   vegetation plots interconnected by high-quality field margins as a
   management practice to raise the breeding success of little bustards and
   other ground-nesting birds on cereal farmland. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{144}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2958-2967}},

Abstract = {{There is a paucity of research on the wider landscape-level effects of
   ski-piste construction on alpine fauna. In this study, the response of
   alpine bird communities to the landscape changes induced by the
   construction of ski-pistes was investigated in the western Italian Alps.
   The aims were: (i) to test the hypothesis that ski-pistes have a
   detrimental effect on alpine grassland bird communities at a
   landscape-scale; and, (ii) to model local probability distributions of
   bird species according to different scenarios of ski-piste restoration
   and ski-piste proliferation above the treeline. Species richness and
   presence/absence data from point counts were analyzed in relation to
   GIS-derived landscape variables based on a 16 ha hexagon grid.
   Predictive variables were selected through the LASSO model selection
   procedure, and logistic regression was used to estimate the probability
   of occurrence of each species in each hexagon. Grassland species
   richness, and probability of occurrence of water pipit, wheatear and
   black redstart, significantly decreased with increasing extent of
   ski-piste edge. Length of ski-piste edge was in the set of best models
   considering a large range of habitat and landscape predictors, and are
   therefore clearly features that exert a strong negative effect on high
   alpine grassland bird communities. Predictions of species occurrence
   were made by applying the models to different scenarios of habitat
   change. These showed predicted detrimental impacts of a relatively small
   10\% increase in ski-piste extent, but also that grassland restoration
   on existing ski-pistes could result in significantly increased
   occurrence rates of alpine grassland species. This study suggests that
   ski-pistes are perceived by birds as detrimental features of the alpine
   landscape. To minimize their impact, new, environmentally-friendly ways
   of constructing pistes should be developed, which could include habitat
   restoration and management to obtain a level of grass cover such that
   edges of ski-pistes are no longer perceived by birds. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{328-335}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the five-year period from 2001 to 2006, 48 monitoring grids
   comprising the FORESTCHECK initiative were established in open eucalypt
   (jarrah, Eucalyptus marginata) forest in south-west Western Australia.
   Since 1985, revised silvicultural objectives have necessitated detailed
   monitoring of responses by bird species and assemblages to silvicultural
   treatments (timber harvesting and associated burning). Few marked
   changes in the avifauna were detected. Species accumulated (in terms of
   numbers of grids) at similar rates in gap release, shelterwood
   /selective cut, and reference (either never harvested or harvested more
   than 40 years previously) forests. In terms of individuals, species
   accumulated faster in the gap release forests. The number of species
   represented as singletons was greatest on the never harvested (8), coupe
   buffer (7) and gap release (6) grids. Dominance-diversity curves also
   showed only minor differences between silvicultural treatments. Neither
   nMDS nor CAP ordinations showed any clear separation between the
   treatments. There was little evidence of any substantial effect of
   silvicultural treatments on avian community structure or on individual
   bird species. Community structure was, however, significantly associated
   with forest ecosystem/year of sampling. The basal area of live trees was
   not correlated with bird species richness or abundance on each grid.
   These results are consistent with previous studies, which indicate that
   most bird species in jarrah forest have a high threshold level of
   tolerance to disturbance. It is likely that the rapid regeneration of
   dominant tree species after harvesting and associated fire, the
   patchiness of treatments at the landscape scale, the high degree of
   connectivity of harvested and burnt forests with forests not recently
   harvested or burnt, and the retention of habitat trees in the most
   heavily-harvested (gap release) forests all conduce to dampen
   local-scale impacts and conserve the avifauna in relation to the home
   range and normal movements of its constituent bird species.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological survey was executed to assess woody species encroachment into

   mellifera (Vahl) Benth., Acacia nilotica (L) Willd., Acacia senegal (L.)
   Willd., Acacia seyal Del. and Acacia tortilis (Forssk.) Hayne were among
   the major encroaching woody species. The majority of the woody species
   were found to be highly aggregated in their pattern of distribution,
   while only few species showed some degree of randomness. The mean woody
   species density was ca. 1995 woody plants ha-1. Mean cover of woody,
   grass, unpalatable forbs and total herbaceous species were 31\%, 58\%,
   68\% and 121\%, respectively. The woody species density and cover,
   unpalatable forbs and bare land cover were significantly higher in the
   highly grazed and fire-suppressed part of the grassland plain. Pearson
   correlation coefficient matrix indicated that woody species cover and
   density were negatively correlated with total herbaceous and grass
   cover. The high woody, unpalatable forbs and bare land cover indicated
   the progressively increasing perennial grass species diversity
   deterioration in the grass plain of the Park. Decline in the grassland

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is an important, ecology-driven tool for restoration of
   grassland systems. However, prescribed fire remains controversial for
   some grassland managers because of reported reductions in bird use of
   recently burned grasslands. Few studies have evaluated effects of fire
   on grassland bird populations in the northern mixed-grass prairie
   region. Fewer studies yet have examined the influence of fire on nest
   density or survival. In our review, we found no studies that
   simultaneously examined effects of fire on duck and passerine nesting.
   During 1998-2003, we examined effects of prescribed fire on the density
   of upland-nesting ducks and passerines nesting in north-central North
   Dakota, USA. Apparent nest densities of gadwall (Anas strepera), mallard
   (A. platyrhynchos), and all duck species combined, were influenced by
   fire history of study units, although the degree of influence was not
   compelling. Fire history was not related to nest densities of
   blue-winged teal (A. discors), northern shoveler (A. clypeata), or
   northern pintail (A. acuta); however, apparent nest densities in
   relation to the number of postfire growing seasons exhibited a
   strikingly similar pattern among all duck species. When compared to
   ducks, fire history strongly influenced apparent nest densities of
   clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus
   sandwichensis), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). For most species
   examined, apparent nest densities were lowest in recently burned units,
   increased during the second postfire growing season, and stabilized or,
   in some cases, decreased thereafter. Prescribed fire is critical for
   restoring the ecology of northernmixed-grass prairies and our findings
   indicate that reductions in nest densities are limited mostly to the
   first growing season after fire. Our results support the premise that
   upland-nesting ducks and several grassland passerine species are adapted
   to periodic fires occurring at a frequency similar to that of
   pre-Euro-American settlement of the region. (C) 2011 The Wildlife

Abstract = {{Habitat loss and degradation on oceanic islands are key processes
   leading to population decline of endemic birds and facilitating the
   establishment of invasive bird species. In this study, carried out in
   the Robinson Crusoe Island, we assessed density and habitat selection of
   terrestrial bird species, including juan fernandez firecrown and juan
   fernandez tit-tyrant, two endemics, as well as green-backed firecrown
   and austral thrush, which apparently originate from the mainland.
   Results show that perturbed habitats contained a low density of the
   endemic species whereas the mainland species were significantly more
   abundant in perturbed scrub habitats. Bird species show different
   habitat selection patterns, with endemics selecting for native forest
   and mainland species selecting for perturbed habitats, or using them at
   random. Bird species experienced temporal trends in their overall
   population sizes, with the endemic tit-tyrant suffering a significant
   decline in its population size of about 63\% between 1994 and 2009. Only
   mainland species exhibited temporal changes in habitat use,
   significantly reducing their densities in the preferred scrub habitats,
   possibly as a response to decreased habitat quality. Thrushes apparently
   were able to compensate the population decrease in one non native
   habitat type by using native forests, a habitat giving them the
   opportunity of preying on nests of endemic species. We conclude that
   endemic bird species behave as specialists whereas the mainland species
   must be treated as invasive generalists on Robinson Crusoe Island.}},

Abstract = {{1 Wood-boring larvae in the families Cerambycidae and Buprestidae are
   often found in high densities in burned trees after wildland fires. They
   play an important role in tree decomposition, often reducing the value
   of salvageable timber, and represent an important avian food source.
   2 Three forest areas that experienced wildfires 1-3 years previously
   were surveyed during the summer of 2004. Ponderosa pine trees with
   green, scorched and consumed needles were examined for wood borer
   occurrence. Within each of the three needle damage categories, the mean
   wood borer incidence was similar between different age fires. Trees with
   scorched or consumed needles had significantly more wood borers than
   trees with green needles.
   3 Larvae collected from under tree bark were identified to family; when
   possible, cerambycids were identified further to Acanthocinus spp.,
   Monochamus sp., Rhagium inquisitor (L.) and Stictoleptura canadensis
   (LeConte), and buprestids were identified to Chalcophora spp. and
   Chrysobothris sp.
   4 Classification tree models showed that the estimated probability of
   tree infestation by wood borers varied among needle damage categories.
   For trees with green needles, tree injury variables of high bole char
   height and phloem discolouration were important predictive variables. In
   trees where needles were consumed, tree size variables of diameter at
   breast height and tree height were important predictive variables.
   5 More than half the dead trees examined were infested with wood borers,
   indicating that infestation of fire-killed ponderosa pine may represent
   an important food source for species such as woodpeckers and a potential
   problem for the utilization of infested trees.}},

Abstract = {{Although intensively managed pine forests are common in the southeastern
   US, few studies describe how combinations of mechanical (MSP) and
   chemical site preparation (CSP) and herbaceous weed control (HWC)
   techniques affect bird communities that use early successional habitats
   within young pine forests. Therefore, we examined effects of six
   treatments of increasing management intensity via combinations of MSP
   (strip-shear and wide spacing or roller chop and narrow spacing) and CSP
   (application or no application) treatments with banded or broadcast HWC
   on bird communities in six loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in
   the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, for 8 years following site
   preparation. Wide pine spacing and strip-shear MSP increased bird
   abundance and species richness over narrow spacing and chopped MSP for 6
   years after planting. Chemical SP reduced bird abundance in year 2,
   increased bird abundance in year 6, had no effect on abundance after
   year 7, and did not affect species richness in any year. Total bird
   abundance and species richness were similar between banded and broadcast
   HWC. Site preparation and HWC had no effect on bird diversity and bird
   communities were most similar in treatments of similar intensity. Site
   preparation and HWC had few or no effects on birds based upon migratory
   status, habitat association, or conservation value. The addition of
   chemical site preparation or HWC had little effect on birds beyond pine
   spacing, and bird abundance was not proportional to management
   intensity. Although we observed treatment effects, all treatments
   provided habitat used by a variety of bird species, and pine plantations
   may play an increasingly important role in bird conservation as forests
   become fragmented and converted to other land uses and as natural
   processes that create early successional habitat, such as fire, are
   suppressed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Peat swamp forest is a unique wetland ecosystem covering extensive areas
   in Southeast Asia that has received relatively little scientific
   attention and is now being lost at a rapid pace. This study examines the
   effects of anthropogenic degradation on bird communities in disturbed
   peat swamp forest Habitats - namely, intact logged forest, a degraded
   forest fragment, and non-forest regrowth - in Central Kalimantan,
   Indonesia. Results show that species richness was significantly higher
   and species composition significantly different in intact logged forest
   in comparison to the degraded forest fragment and non-forested area.
   Nectarivore and tree foliage-gleaning insectivore abundance declined
   outside the intact forest, while the regrowth was dominated by the
   yellow vented bulbul, an open country insectivore-frugivore. Surveys
   reveal that large intact tracts of logged peat swamp forest can harbour
   threatened and near threatened bird species (36\% of records) and thus
   play a role in their conservation, especially for a few habitat
   specialists. Given the extent of unmanaged degraded peatlands and
   continuing pressure to develop them, urgent conservation actions are
   needed to rehabilitate and protect this ecosystem. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Use of different habitat by Raptors in southern Brazil. Habitat loss
   affects bird diversity. Some species are sensitive for habitat loss, as
   Cathartiformes and Falconiformes species. At Rio Grande do Sul plateau
   14 species from those two orders are registered inhabiting grasslands.
   This study objective is to identify Cathartidae, Accipitridae and
   Falconidae species along RS 020 road between Sao Franscisco de Paula and
   Cambara do Sul and relate richness, abundance and frequency with habitat
   and carcasses occurrence. 36 censuses were realized, one per month, in a
   56 km stretch. Each visualized bird had its behavior, pearching place
   and localization registered. Four environments were classified as been
   used by birds: tall grassland, short grassland, Pinus sp. and crops.
   Repeated Measures ANOVA was applied for compare seasons and environments
   and Factor ANOVA for relate carcasses and bird abundances. Canonical
   Discriminant Analysis evaluated species composition differences between
   environments. 13 species were found. Coragyps atratus was the more
   abundant specie (n = 83). Most species were rare in frequency. Specie
   richness did not response significant for seasons and environment
   interaction (F = 0,749; gl = 3; P = 0,553) and for seasons (F = 2,15; gl
   = 3; P = 0,180). There was significant richness differences among
   habitats (F = 8,83; gl = 3; P < 0,01). Abundance was significantly
   related with carcasses size (F = 5,62, gl = 6; P = 0,001). Grasslands
   suffer at least 500 years with the strong matrix fragmentation and
   transformation, but the conservation of these natural environments is
   important for survive of grassland dependent birds that are in food-web

Abstract = {{We present an approach to modeling potential climate-driven changes in
   habitat for tree and bird species in the eastern United States. First,
   we took an empirical-statistical modeling approach, using randomForest,
   with species abundance data from national inventories combined with
   soil, climate, and landscape variables, to build abundance-based habitat
   models for 134 tree and 147 bird species. We produced lists of species
   for which suitable habitat tends to increase, decrease, or stay the same
   for any region. Independent assessments of trends of large trees versus
   seedlings across the eastern U.S. show that 37 of 40 species in common
   under both studies are currently trending as modeled. We developed a
   framework, ModFacs, in which we used the literature to assign default
   modification factor scores for species characteristics that cannot be
   readily assessed in such models, including 12 disturbance factors (for
   example, drought, fire, insect pests), nine biological factors (for
   example, dispersal, shade tolerance), and assessment scores of novel
   climates, long-distance extrapolations, and output variability by
   climate model and emission scenario. We also used a spatially explicit
   cellular model, SHIFT, to calculate colonization potentials for some
   species, based on their abundance, historic dispersal distances, and the
   fragmented nature of the landscape. By combining results from the three
   efforts, we can create projections of potential climate change impacts
   over the next 100 years or so. Here we emphasize some of the lessons we
   have learned over 16 years in hopes that they may help guide future
   experiments, modeling efforts, and management.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the effects of environmental constraints on community
   structure often relies on methods that consider changes in species
   functional traits in response to environmental processes. Various
   indices have been proposed to measure relevant aspects of community
   trait composition from different viewpoints and perspectives. Among
   these, the `community-weighted mean trait value' (CWM) and the Rao
   coefficient have been widely used in ecological research for summarizing
   different facets of functional composition and diversity. Analyzing
   changes in functional diversity of bee communities along a post-fire
   successional gradient in southern Switzerland we show that these two
   measures may be used to describe two complementary aspects of community
   structure, such as the mean and the dispersion of functional traits
   within a given species assemblage. While CWM can be adequately used to
   summarize shifts in mean trait values within communities due to
   environmental selection for certain functional traits, the Rao
   coefficient can be effectively applied to analyze patterns of trait
   convergence or divergence compared to a random expectation.}},

Abstract = {{Although snags are often considered to be a limiting factor for
   cavity-nesting birds within intensively managed pine (Pinus spp.)
   stands, there is little information regarding occurrences of snags and
   cavity-nesting birds for such stands in the southeastern United States.
   Therefore, during 2002-2003, we measured characteristics of individual
   snags (n = 1,218) and quantified the relative abundance of
   cavity-nesting birds (n = 204 observations; nine species) in 35 forest
   stands representing seven thinning classes (prior to thinning, three age
   classes following a first commercial thinning, and three age classes
   following a second commercial thinning entry) in intensively managed
   pine stands in eastern North Carolina. Snag populations were dynamic,
   with 649 snags falling and 75 new snags recruited between years. Stands
   in later thinning classes tended to have snags with larger diameters,
   less bark, and fewer limbs, and they were taller and more decayed (P <
   0.05). Our data suggest that neither density of snags (P < 0.31) nor
   relative abundance of cavity-nesting birds (P = 0.25) differed strongly
   among thinning classes. Without active management, low recruitment
   coupled with the high loss rates that we observed could lead to low snag
   densities in older managed stands. Therefore, we suggest that forest
   managers consider retaining large-diameter dead or live trees as reserve
   trees through multiple rotations to increase or maintain snags in
   managed stands.}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of carbon stock enhancements under the Reducing Emissions
   from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) framework will likely
   drive a rapid increase in biosequestration projects that remove carbon
   from the atmosphere through rehabilitation of degraded primary rain
   forests. Such projects could also present an important opportunity to
   reverse losses of biodiversity from degraded rain forests, but concern
   has recently been expressed that management interventions to increase
   carbon stocks may conflict with biodiversity conservation. Focusing on a
   large-scale rain forest rehabilitation project in northern Borneo, we
   examine: (i) how intensive rehabilitation of selectively logged forests
   affected patterns of bird community composition and (ii) whether changes
   in vegetation structure explain observed shifts in avian guild structure
   and species composition. Bird composition differed between unlogged,
   naturally regenerating logged, and rehabilitated logged habitats, with
   the avifauna of rehabilitated forest more similar to that of naturally
   regenerating forest. Crucially, rehabilitation did not adversely affect
   either those species that declined after logging or those species that
   are IUCN Red Listed. Rehabilitation reduced the prevalence of vines and
   shrubs within regenerating forest, and across all habitats, the
   abundance and species richness of all birds and of obligate frugivores
   were positively related to vine prevalence. In contrast, the abundance
   and richness of frugivore-insectivore generalists and of salliers were
   negatively related to vines, suggesting that avifaunal responses to
   forest rehabilitation were attributable to liberation cutting of vines.
   Management intervention to increase carbon stocks had little adverse
   effect on avian biodiversity and we therefore argue that rain forest
   rehabilitation should play a strong role in future REDD+ agreements.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated habitat suitability and nest survival of breeding
   white-headed woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) in unburned forests of
   central Oregon, USA. Daily nest-survival rate was positively related to
   maximum daily temperature during the nest interval and to density of
   large-diameter trees surrounding the nest tree. We developed a
   niche-based habitat suitability model (partitioned Mahalanobis distance)
   for nesting white-headed woodpeckers using remotely sensed data. Along
   with low elevation, high density of large trees, and low slope, our
   habitat suitability model suggested that interspersion-juxtaposition of
   low-and high-canopy cover ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) patches was
   important for nest-site suitability. Cross-validation suggested the
   model performed adequately for management planning at a scale >1 ha.
   Evaluation of mapped habitat suitability index (HSI) suggested that the
   maximum predictive gain (HSI = 0.36), where the number of nest locations
   are maximized in the smallest proportion of the modeled landscape,
   provided an objective initial threshold for identification of suitable
   habitat. However, managers can choose the threshold HSI most appropriate
   for their purposes (e. g., locating regions of low-moderate suitability
   that have potential for habitat restoration). Consequently, our habitat
   suitability model may be useful for managing dry coniferous forests for
   white-headed woodpeckers in central Oregon; however, model validation is
   necessary before our model could be applied to other locations. (C) 2011

Title = {{Response of Red-Cockaded Woodpeckers to Military Training Operations}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Number = {{177}},
Pages = {{1-38}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Military lands are a valuable resource in recovery of threatened,
   endangered, and at-risk species worldwide and have the highest density
   of threatened and endangered species of all major land management
   agencies in the United States. Many red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides
   borealis) that reside on federal lands occur on 15 military
   installations in the southeastern United States. This close association
   has increased concern over potential conflicts between conservation
   requirements of endangered species and the military's mission of combat
   readiness. Our objectives were to 1) determine if military training
   operations affect behavior, reproductive success, and productivity of
   red-cockaded woodpeckers; 2) develop a frequency-weighting function to
   assess woodpecker hearing sensitivity; 3) identify factors that affect
   woodpecker responses to military training operations; 4) develop
   distance and dose-response thresholds for quantifying woodpecker
   responses to noise levels and stimulus distances; 5) characterize
   military training operations through quantification of sound levels,
   source identification, distance from active woodpecker nests, frequency
   spectra, duration, and frequency of occurrence; and 6) document baseline
   woodpecker nesting behavior. We conducted our study on the Fort Stewart
   Military Installation located in southeast Georgia, USA. Downy
   woodpeckers, as surrogates for red-cockaded woodpeckers, had their best
   hearing sensitivity within the peak range of the power spectrum of both
   downy and red-cockaded woodpecker vocalizations, which is at a higher
   frequency than that of a typical passerine. Overall, woodpeckers had a
   reduced auditory sensitivity relative to human hearing sensitivity and
   other species of small birds, especially in the frequency range >4 kHz.
   Woodpeckers were most sensitive in the 1.5- to 4.0-kHz range.
   Sensitivity appeared to drop off quickly at frequencies <1.0 kHz and
   >4.0 kHz. Overall, we did not find that the
   woodpecker-frequency-weighting function we developed provided a better
   predictor of woodpecker flush response compared with A-weighting. More
   research is needed to better understand the relationship between
   frequency-weighting functions and woodpecker response behavior.
   Potential breeding groups of woodpeckers across the population increased
   from 158 in 1997 to 181 in 2000, wheras nesting groups increased from
   141 in 1998 to 170 in 2000, for overall increases of 14.6\% and 20.6\%,
   respectively, over the 3 years of this project. Fledging success rates
   for individual nests within the overall population remained consistent
   from 1998 to 2000, averaging 84.4\%. Mean clutch sizes for woodpecker
   groups for 1998 to 2000 ranged from 2.75 to 3.01 eggs/nest, brood size
   ranged from 2.01 to 2.22 nestlings/nest, whereas the average number of
   young fledged ranged from 1.57 to 1.76 young/occupied nest. We observed
   no difference in reproductive success or productivity between
   experimental and control-tested red-cockaded woodpecker groups. Overall,
   experimental test groups produced an average of 2.98 eggs/nest, 1.89
   nestlings/nest, and 1.54 young/occupied nest from 1999 to 2000, compared
   with 2.73 eggs/nest, 1.91 nestlings/nest, and 1.57 young/occupied nest
   at control groups. We measured behavioral responses (nest attendance and
   arrivals and departures from the nest) of red-cockaded woodpeckers to
   military training events through direct and indirect (i.e., video
   surveillance) observation of 464.
   5 hours of woodpecker nesting behavior before and after controlled
   experimental events while recording and characterizing militry-generated
   sound events using sound-recording equipment. We presented woodpeckers
   with actual 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators
   from controlled distances to develop distance and sound thresholds. We
   used video surveillance to document potential behavioral responses of
   woodpeckers primarily during nonexperimental military training
   operations in areas that could not be safely monitored and to determine
   baseline woodpecker nesting behaviors. We recorded 2,846 nonexperimental
   military noise events in 157 data sessions at 50 red-cockaded woodpecker
   groups from 1998 to 2000. We also recorded 206 experimental tests at 58
   woodpecker groups during 1999 and 2000. Life-table analyses of flush
   response time showed that at short ranges (15-30 m) the flush response
   was stronger for artillery simulator blasts than for blank fire in both
   the incubation and the nestling phases. In contrast, at medium distances
   (45-60 m) blank fire tended to produce more flush responses than
   artillery fire in both incubation and nestling phases. At longer
   distances (>60 m), blank fire and artillery produced similar flush
   responses in the incubation phase, whereas flush response was stronger
   for blank fire than for artillery in the nestling phase. In general,
   most animals that responded to military activity flushed within 5
   seconds of the stimulus event. Woodpeckers returned to nests within an
   average of 4.4 minutes after being flushed by artillery simulators and
   6.3 minutes after 0.50-caliber blank-fire tests. Woodpecker flush
   response rates increased as stimulus distance decreased and sound levels
   increased, regardless of stimulus type or year. Woodpeckers did not
   flush from nests when 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery
   simulators were >152 m away and sound-exposure levels (decibels {[}dB])
   were <68 dBW (woodpecker-based frequency-weighting curve) and <65 dBW,
   respectively. We found that blast treatments reduced arrival rates of
   adults at the nest, with the amount of reduction dependent on the type
   of blast stimulus and number of helpers at the nest. On the other hand,
   blast treatments had no detectable effects on nest attendance. The
   effect of blank fire on incubation-phase arrivals over a 30-minute
   interval (about 40\% reduction) was nearly twice that of artillery
   simulator fire (about a 20\% reduction). There was no evidence
   supporting any effect of stimulus type on arrivals during the nestling
   phase. Blast stimuli during incubation reduced arrivals by 40\% when no
   helpers were present, but the strength of this effect decreased to 28\%
   when one helper was present, and was only 6\% for nests with >= 2
   helpers. Distance of the blast from the nest did not affect the response
   of arrival rates to blast treatments. Infrequent, short-duration
   military training exercises, as measured, did not appear to
   substantially impact red-cockaded woodpecker reproductive success and
   productivity on the Fort Stewart Military Installation. Our results may
   be applicable to other military installations where similar training
   activities and intensity levels occur. Additional research is needed to
   address possible habituation or sensitization of red-cockaded
   woodpeckers to human activities in proximity to active nest sites.
   Although we attempted to monitor woodpecker response to a number of
   military training activities, other types of military training
   operations or human-based activities with louder noise, longer duration,
   incrased human presence, and greater frequency of occurrence could more
   negatively influence woodpecker nesting behavior and need to be
   investigated. Our results do not support the hypothesis that military
   maneuver training operations are limiting factors in the recovery of
   red-cockaded woodpeckers on military installations, based on our level
   and type of testing. Natural resource management policies on military
   installations have had a positive influence on the recovery of
   red-cockaded woodpeckers and probably outweigh the negative effects of
   typical military training. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{With limited financial resources available for habitat restoration,
   information that ensures and/or accelerates success is needed to
   economize effort and maximize benefit. In the Central Valley of
   California USA, riparian habitat has been lost or degraded, contributing
   to the decline of riparian-associated birds and other wildlife. Active
   restoration of riparian plant communities in this region has been
   demonstrated to increase local population sizes and species diversity of
   landbirds. To evaluate factors related to variation in the rate at which
   bird abundance increased after restoration, we examined bird abundance
   as a function of local (restoration design elements) and landscape
   (proportion of riparian vegetation in the landscape and riparian patch
   density) metrics at 17 restoration projects within five project areas
   along the Sacramento River. We developed a priori model sets for seven
   species of birds and used an information theoretic approach to identify
   factors associated with the rate at which bird abundance increased after
   restoration. For six of seven species investigated, the model with the
   most support contained a variable for the amount of riparian forest in
   the surrounding landscape. Three of seven bird species were positively
   correlated with the number of tree species planted and three of seven
   were positively correlated with the planting densities of particular
   tree species. Our results indicate that restoration success can be
   enhanced by selecting sites near existing riparian habitat and planting
   multiple tree species. Hence, given limited resources, efforts to
   restore riparian habitat for birds should focus on landscape-scale site
   selection in areas with high proportions of existing riparian
   vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the effects of crop management
   practices on the diversity, structure, and composition of weed
   communities. A total of 30 fields (15 fields each) in low-input and
   conventional farming systems were surveyed in north-eastern Iran. In the
   conventional cropping system, both mineral fertilizers and herbicides
   were applied, while in the low-input cropping system, the fertilizer was
   mainly manure and herbicides were avoided. The results showed that the
   pool of species, species richness, number of unique species, and
   Shannon's diversity index were greater in the low-input system than in
   the conventional system. Both cropping systems had more broad-leaved
   species than grasses and more annual species than perennial species. All
   the multivariate methods of analysis that were applied revealed that the
   weed community composition was significantly different between the two
   management types. The low-input cropping favored herbicide-susceptible
   broad-leaved weeds, legumes, and weeds with biodiversity value, whereas
   a high proportion of herbicide-tolerant grasses was found in the
   conventional fields. The results suggest that low-input cropping can
   sustain high weed diversity and abundance.}},

Abstract = {{A stand-replacing fire in 404 ha of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and
   mixed pine forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in 2007 resulted in
   Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) nesting at high density in
   2008, the second possible nesting season post-fire. Nests were found
   within a 93-ha study area and a 19-ha stand (a subset of the 93-ha study
   area) in 199.5 survey hours concentrated in March July. The 19-ha stand
   had six nests, a density of 0.31 nests/ha or 0.63 individuals/ha, while
   the 93-ha study area had 20 nests yielding 0.21 nests/ha or 0.42
   individuals/ha. These nest densities are higher than previously reported
   in the literature for comparable stands, indicating a large influx of
   nesting woodpeckers post-fire. High nesting densities in this study may
   have resulted from: (1) optimal timing of the fire for wood-boring
   beetle exploitation of burned trees, (2) the discrete nature of burned
   habitat in the study due to impacts of salvage logging, or (3) our focus
   on regions of the burn where high nesting densities occurred, as the
   entire burned area (404 ha) was not included in nest density
   calculations. Received 23 April 2010. Accepted 28 December 2010.}},

Title = {{Disturbance, species loss and compensation: Wildfire and grazing effects

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{An important question in biodiversity studies is whether disturbances in
   ecosystems will cause a net loss of species or whether such losses can
   be compensated by replacement of other species. We use two natural
   disturbances, fire and grazing, to examine the response of bird and
   arthropod communities in grasslands of Serengeti, Tanzania. Both burning
   and grazing by migrant ungulates take place at the end of the rains in
   June-July. We documented the communities before disturbance, then 1, 4
   and 20 weeks after disturbance on three replicate plots and compared
   them with three undisturbed plots. Birds were recorded by observation,
   arthropods from pitfall, tray trap and sweepnet samples. We expected
   that as the grass biomass was reduced by either disturbance, bird
   communities would change with concomitant change in arthropod food
   abundance. Alternatively, bird communities would change not with the
   absolute amount of food but with the greater accessibility of food as
   the grass structure changed from long to short grass. Results showed
   first that both bird species richness and abundance increased after both
   types of disturbance, but burnt sites showed a greater increase than
   that for grazed sites. Second, there was a change in bird species
   composition with disturbance. The functionally equivalent athi
   short-toed lark (Calandrella athensis) was replaced by the red-capped
   lark (Calandrella cinerea). Third, the abundance of most groups of
   arthropods was lower on disturbed sites than those on undisturbed sites,
   and the reduction of arthropod numbers was greatest on burnt sites.
   These results imply that bird abundance did not occur through an
   increase in arthropod abundance but rather through a change in the grass
   structure making food more accessible; and the higher predation could
   have caused the lower arthropod abundance. In addition, some bird
   species replaced others thus functionally compensating for their loss.}},

Pages = {{1738-1749}},

Abstract = {{To examine the relationship between forest succession after severe
   logging forestry practices and the composition of avian communities, we
   investigated how forest bird composition and guild structure change as a
   function of structural properties along a successional gradient,
   including a climax mature forest (>400 years), a rehabilitated mixed
   forest (50-70 years), and a disturbed Masson pine forest (70 years) of
   the Dinghushan Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, China. Of a total of
   51 resident species recorded, mixed forests hosted the highest numbers
   of individuals and species, reflecting the high species richness of both
   forest and non-forest species. For forest-dependent species, however,
   mature stands had the highest observed and estimated species richness.
   Of 6 habitat-use guilds identified, vertical-profile generalists and
   understory-birds formed the two dominant guilds, accounting for 54.0\%
   and 38.7\% of all individuals respectively. The results of canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) clearly showed that most forest-dependent
   species were associated with high proportions of native canopy cover and
   the mean density of dead trees and large trees, which are characteristic
   of old-growth mature forests ( horizontal heterogeneity) at stand level.
   Accordingly, conservation efforts should focus on the specialized
   requirements of the most habitat-restricted species in the future,
   especially for understory insectivores (Babblers) and large-tree users
   in mature subtropical monsoon forests of southern China. Moreover, since
   regenerating mixed forests are very similar to mature forests in both
   vegetation structure and bird community composition, we recommend that
   logging cycles (>50 years) be increased to a minimum of 50 years in
   southern China, so that a balance between economic and ecological
   interest can be reestablished. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1928-1935}},

Abstract = {{Across the southeastern United States, changing disturbance regimes
   threaten the integrity of pine flatwoods, reducing their suitability as
   habitat for a variety of avian species, many of which are considered of
   conservation priority. Prescribed burning and roller chopping are
   management practices widely used in pine flatwoods to control shrubs and
   increase the growth of herbaceous vegetation. However, the impacts these
   treatments have on this system and its associated avian communities are
   largely unknown. We examined the effects of prescribed burning and
   roller chopping on pine flatwoods avian communities using a paired
   sample approach. Avian communities were compared between treated (e.g.,
   burned) and untreated areas. We considered abundance and richness of all
   birds, but also groups of conservation concern, and those likely
   impacted by seasonal management practices (e.g., breeding and
   non-breeding categories, and woodland, successional-scrub, and grassland
   guilds). Dormant season burning resulted in decreases in avian species
   richness and abundance within the non-breeding, overwintering community.
   In situations where the maintenance or enhancement of this avian group
   is desired, growing season burning appears beneficial and should be used
   in preference to dormant season burning. Growing season burning
   benefited breeding avian communities, resulting in increases in species
   richness and abundance within this group. Dormant season roller chopping
   had no effect on species richness or abundance of any avian category or
   guild. Increases in abundance within breeding avian communities were
   observed following growing season roller chopping and a roller
   chopping/burning combination. Grazing, did not mediate the effects of
   prescribed burning or roller chopping on avian species richness or
   abundance. The use of dormant season burning is likely inappropriate in
   situations where conservation and management of non-breeding,
   overwintering species is a priority. The use of growing season roller
   chopping appears to provide a potential treatment alternative in
   situations where positive effects on breeding species are desired.
   Overall, maintenance of avian abundance and richness may be best
   achieved through the diverse application of prescribed burning and
   roller chopping based on season, frequency, and space. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   Crossbills L. curvirostra and Parrot Crossbills L. pytyopsittacus within
   this range. Crossbills were lured to systematically selected survey
   points for counting, sexing and recording their calls for later
   call-type (species) identification from sonograms. Crossbills were
   located at 451 of the 852 survey points, and adequate tape-recordings
   made at 387 of these. The Scottish Crossbill had a disjunct
   distribution, occurring largely within the eastern part of the study
   area, but also in the northwest. Common Crossbills had a mainly westerly
   distribution. The population size of post-juvenile Scottish Crossbills
   was estimated as 13,600 (95\% C.I. 8,130-22,700), which will approximate
   to 6,800 (4,065-11,350) pairs. Common Crossbills were more abundant
   within this range (27,100, 95\% C.I. 14,700-38,400) and Parrot
   Crossbills rare (about 100). The sex ratio was not significantly
   different from parity for Scottish Crossbills. The modal number at
   survey points was two but numbers were larger in January than later in
   the survey. The numbers and distribution of all crossbill species are
   likely to vary between years, depending upon the size of the cone crops
   of the different conifers: all were coning in 2008. Common Crossbill and
   Parrot Crossbill numbers will also be affected by irruptions from
   continental Europe. A monitoring scheme is required to detect any
   population trend, and further work on their habitat requirement (e. g.
   conifer selection at different seasons) is needed to inform habitat
   management of native and planted conifer forests to ensure a secure
   future for this endemic bird.}},

Abstract = {{Although a large proportion of tropical rain-forest in South-east Asia
   has been replaced by rubber plantations, there is very little
   information about the impact of such forest conversion on bat diversity.
   To address this deficiency, trapping and acoustic monitoring programmes
   were carried out in Ton Nga Chang and Khao Ban That wildlife sanctuaries
   in southern Thailand with the purpose of comparing species diversity and
   activity of understorey insectivorous bats at sites in forest and in
   nearby monoculture rubber plantations. Insect biomass in both habitats
   was assessed. Bat species diversity and activity were found to be much
   lower in rubber plantations than in forested areas and mean insect
   biomass was determined to be more than twice as high in the latter
   habitat than in the former. Bats utilising forest were shown to have
   significantly higher call frequencies but marginally lower wing loadings
   and aspect ratios than bats found in both habitats. Management
   strategies to increase biodiversity in rubber plantations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Food resources can limit populations of insectivorous birds. Previous
   studies have shown strong correlations between bird population densities
   and their invertebrate food, with declining populations being attributed
   to loss of prey. This might also be the case for the threatened Knysna
   warbler (Bradypterus sylvaticus), which in the last 20 years has
   declined precipitously on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. The bird is
   abandoning natural, protected forests, retreating to narrow belts of
   suburban, riverine woodland with dense, tangled understoreys. The
   potential invertebrate food availability in natural forests and suburban
   woodland was assessed against what is known of the bird's preferred
   prey. The invertebrate food resource spectrum and abundance were
   determined using three sampling techniques in both natural forest and
   suburban woodland. Despite greater overall abundance of invertebrates in
   suburban woodland, the warbler's preferred prey items were equally
   abundant in both habitats. This suggests that reduced food supply does
   not explain abandonment of natural forests by the warbler. Rather, it is
   concluded that the availability of suitable nesting substrata, which are
   more abundant in suburban woodland, has driven the biotope shift. This
   is an unusual case of a localized and threatened bird species faring
   better under transformed conditions than in natural habitats.Resume
   Les ressources alimentaires peuvent limiter les populations d'oiseaux
   insectivores. Des etudes anterieures ont montre de fortes correlations
   entre la densite de populationsd'oiseaux et les invertebres qui leur
   servent de nourriture, le declin des populations etant attribuea la
   perte de la nourriture. Ceci pourrait aussi etre le cas de la fauvette
   de Knysna (Bradypterus sylvaticus) qui a decline tres rapidement sur la
   Peninsule de Cap, en Afrique du Sud, au cours des 20 dernieres annees.
   L'oiseau abandonne des forets naturelles protegees et se retire vers des
   ceintures de forets riveraines suburbaines, dont les etages inferieurs
   sont denses et touffus. La disponibilite potentielle des invertebres
   dont ces oiseaux se nourrissent fut evaluee dans des forets naturelles
   et dans des forets suburbaines en fonction de ce que l'on connait des
   preferences des oiseaux. On a determine le spectre et l'abondance des
   ressources en invertebres consommes en recourant a trois techniques
   d'echantillonnage dans les deux types de foret. Malgre une plus grande
   abondance generale d'invertebres dans la foret suburbaine, les proies
   preferees de la fauvette etaient aussi abondantes dans les deux
   habitats. Ceci laisse supposer que ce n'est pas un apport de nourriture
   reduit qui explique l'abandon de la foret naturelle par la fauvette. On
   en conclut plutot que c'est la disponibilite en substrats propices pour
   la nidification, qui sont plus abondants dans la foret suburbaine, qui a
   entraine le changement vers l'autre biotope. Ceci est un exemple
   inhabituel d'espece d'oiseau locale et menacee qui prospere mieux dans
   des conditions modifiees que dans des habitats naturels.}},

Abstract = {{Burned forests represent high-quality habitats for many
   deadwood-dependent species. Yet, post-fire conditions may vary greatly
   within and among burns and thereby may affect habitat suitability for
   these species. We studied habitat selection of nesting black-backed
   woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus Swainson) in recently burned
   spruce-dominated boreal forests. Our objectives were to (i) identify
   factors involved in snag selection for both nesting and foraging and
   (ii) examine selection of nest sites within the burned landscape. A
   total of 92 nests and 1612 foraging observations were used to
   investigate snag selection. Our results show that both pre-fire forest
   conditions and fire severity are important in determining the quality of
   burned forests for black-backed woodpeckers. This species selected large
   snags for both nesting (>20 cm DBH) and foraging (>15 cm DBH).
   Woodpeckers selected deciduous and degraded ``pre-fire{''} snags for
   nesting whereas black spruce snags that had been created by fire and
   that were moderately burned were preferred for foraging. Nest sites were
   concentrated in burned mature stands and supported higher densities of
   large snags (e. g., >15 cm DBH). Our results suggest that burned forest
   patches of at least 20 ha and composed mainly of burned mature and
   old-growth forests should be maintained during post-fire harvesting. The
   decrease in the amount of late seral stands in managed forest landscapes
   raises concerns about the future availability of high-quality burned
   forests for this species.}},

Abstract = {{In this study I examined the composition of managed ponderosa pine
   (Pinta ponderosa) forests used by nesting White-headed Woodpeckers
   (Picoides albolarvatus) along the eastern slope of the Cascade Range in
   Washington. I sampled trees and snags using the point-centered quarter
   method to assess species composition, tree and snag density, and stand
   basal area in 16 forest stands containing White-headed Woodpecker nests.
   All stands had a history of timber management and 2 had been burned and
   salvage-logged. Mean live-tree density (>= 10.16 cm dbh) was 182.3 trees
   . ha(-1) (SE = 13.52), mean snag density (>= 10.16 cm (lbh) was 11.5
   snags . ha(-1) (SE = 1.92), and mean stand basal area was 17.2 m(2) .
   ha(-1) (SE = 1..58). Ponderosa pine had the highest importance value
   ((x) over bar = 220.9, SE = 17.25) of any tree species in all but 2
   stands. Mean dbh of ponderosa pines was 33.0 cm (SE = 0.26) and ranged
   from 26.1 to 50.2 cm within stands. Mean density of ponderosa pine was
   greatest in the 20.3-30.5 cm dbh size class and lowest in the 50.8-61.0
   cm and >61.0 CM dbh)11 size classes. Tree density was up to 5.3 times
   greater than densities believed to be typical of ponderosa pine forests
   prior to fire suppression. Snag densities were within the range
   estimated for historical dry forests of the eastern Cascades, yet only
   50\% of all snags sampled had a dbh >25.4 cm. Although White-headed
   Woodpeckers are considered strongly associated with old-growth ponderosa
   pine, my results suggest that they may be more adaptable to using
   forests dominated by smaller diameter trees.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive conversion of Midwestern riparian areas for agricultural
   production has had many consequences including reduced habitat for
   nesting birds. However, more than 120,000 ha of riparian habitat have
   been restored in this region through USDA conservation programs. In 2001
   and 2002, we assessed songbird responses to burning and disking for
   management of conservation easements in east-central Iowa. We randomly
   assigned herbaceous riparian fields to burning and disking treatments
   and collected data on density and species richness of songbirds in these
   habitats. Total density of grassland and wetland species and red-winged
   blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were reduced by burning in the first
   and second breeding seasons after burning; common yellowthroat
   (Geothlypis trichas) density decreased with burning only in the first
   season. Disking led to increased density of grassland and wetland birds
   and greater overall avian conservation value on treated relative to
   untreated fields in the year after treatment. Changes associated with
   burning and disking treatments were likely related to changes in both
   vegetation structure and abundance of arthropod food resources. Despite
   decreased bird densities with burning, fire is a necessary management
   tool to control woody vegetation. Overall, both burning and disking
   appear to be effective management practices for maintaining herbaceous
   riparian habitats for grassland birds.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration and management activities targeted at recovering
   biodiversity can lead to unexpected results. In part, this is due to a
   lack of understanding of how site-level characteristics, landscape
   factors, and land-use history interact with restoration and management
   practices to determine patterns of diversity. For plants, such factors
   may be particularly important since plant populations often exhibit
   lagged responses to habitat loss and degradation. Here, we assess the
   importance of site-level, landscape, and historical effects for
   understory plant species richness and composition across a set of 40
   longleaf pine Pinus palustris woodlands undergoing restoration for the
   federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker in the southeastern United
   States. Land-use history had an overarching effect on richness and
   composition. Relative to historically forested sites, sites with
   agricultural histories (i.e. former pastures or cultivated fields)
   supported lower species richness and an altered species composition due
   to fewer upland longleaf pine woodland community members. Landscape
   effects did not influence the total number of species in either
   historically forested or post-agricultural sites; however, understory
   species composition was affected by historical connectivity, but only
   for post-agricultural sites. The influences of management and
   restoration activities were only apparent once land-use history was
   accounted for. Prescribed burning and mechanical overstory thinning were
   key drivers of understory composition and promoted understory richness
   in post-agricultural sites. In historically forested sites these
   activities had no impact on richness and only prescribed fire influenced
   composition. Our findings reveal complex interplays between site-level,
   landscape, and historical effects, suggest fundamentally different
   controls over plant communities in longleaf pine woodlands with varying
   land-use history, and underscore the importance of considering land-use
   history and landscape effects during restoration.}},

Title = {{Basic ecological theory can inform habitat restoration for woodland

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{293-300}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Extensive clearing of native vegetation for agriculture has
   severely impacted upon Australia's biodiversity. Environmental tree
   planting, forestry and restoration of existing remnant patches provide
   ways for improving the matrix habitat value between larger conservation
   areas. However, improved guidelines are required to inform land managers
   on appropriate ways to design these areas when resources for habitat
   improvement are limited.
   2. We developed a simple habitat suitability model for woodland birds
   from two basic observations of ecology: (i) the species-area
   relationship and (ii) the relationship between bird species richness and
   vegetation structural diversity. The model provides a suite of
   species-area relationships for habitats of different structural
   diversity. Data from across Australia were used in developing the model
   to ensure its generality.
   3. A single species-area relationship for patches from 2 ha to 16
   million ha was estimated for high-quality habitat patches using data
   from across mainland Australia. When this was combined with information
   on habitat complexity, the resultant species richness model was able to
   adequately describe the variation in woodland bird species richness
   within patches of various sizes (1-500 ha) in an independent data set
   from the Australian Capital Territory.
   4. The results from the model suggest that for small patches of high
   quality, increases in patch size or quality reap benefits whereas the
   marginal return in species richness for increasing patch size is almost
   negligible for low quality patches above 10 ha or high quality patches
   of 20 ha. For small patches of low quality, there is little benefit in
   increasing patch area and so quality should be improved. These results
   agree with recommendations obtained using various other techniques.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Investigation of the relationships
   embedded in the model provided similar recommendations for habitat
   restoration as determined by more detailed methods. The success of a
   simple combination of ecological principles linking area, structure and
   species richness supports the notion that existing basic theory can
   provide a sufficient basis for informing habitat restoration.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present examples of stand-level consequences of using
   forest vegetation management treatments in boreal and temperate forest
   ecosystems in Canada. Specifically, we address several selected
   indicators: air and water quality, soils and nutrients, plant diversity,

   effects of five broad categories of treatments: (1) silviculture and
   harvesting systems and (2) physical, (3) thermal, (4) cultural, and (5)
   chemical/biological treatments. Our emphasis is on forest vegetation
   management treatments that are currently used in Canada to manage
   conifers. By applying regulations and best management practices,
   conducting landscape-level analyses and developing longer-term
   monitoring programs resource managers can minimize the effects of FVM
   treatments on the environmental indicators presented in this paper.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Coastal development and engineering projects preclude ecosystem
   processes that provide habitat for beach nesting birds. Management for
   coastal species may depend on actions that attempt to restore important
   habitat features and mitigate disturbance effects. However, species
   response to restoration or other management actions may be difficult to
   predict or measure. At Jones Beach State Park, on Long Island, New York,
   a 0.49 ha restoration project provided moist substrate foraging habitat
   for breeding Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) from 2002 to 2005. We
   examined whether foraging habitat restoration affected Piping Plover
   breeding population size, productivity, and fledgling production within
   300 m of the restoration site. We found a positive relationship between
   habitat restoration and the number of fledglings produced per year.
   However, foraging habitat restoration did not significantly increase the
   number of Plover pairs breeding at Jones Beach. Our ability to evaluate
   restoration effects on Plovers depended on: 1) use of multiple
   performance criteria; 2) a design that allowed comparison of pre- and
   post-restoration data; and 3) a spatial control that allowed comparison
   of similar areas that were near and far from the restoration site.
   Despite the small size of the restoration project, there were measurable
   benefits to Plovers, indicating that foraging habitat restoration may be
   an effective tool for species recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Thinning is a silvicultural technique used extensively throughout
   Australia's production forests. The longer-term effects of thinning on
   forest biota are not well understood. This study provides an insight
   into the effects of thinning on avifauna and vegetation, 5-10 y after a
   thinning operation. A paired-site experimental design was used to
   compare bird density and species richness at thinned and unthinned sites
   in a mixed eucalypt production forest in Gippsland, Victoria. The
   2006-2007 fires across Gippsland directly affected eight of twelve sites
   in this study, providing an opportunity to investigate the immediate
   effects of wildfire on birds.
   Significantly greater numbers of birds and bird species were found at
   thinned sites, compared with unthinned sites. Differences in vegetation
   structure and habitat quality were also apparent between thinned and
   unthinned sites. A reduction in both bird abundance and species richness
   occurred immediately after the wildfire.
   Research into the impact of silvicultural techniques, such as thinning,
   on forest biota is an important step towards achieving ecologically
   sustainable forestry. Improved understanding of the effect of forestry
   operations is imperative in order to maximise conservation in production
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape heterogeneity can play an important role in providing refugia
   and sustaining biodiversity in disturbed landscapes. Large Macrotermes
   (Isoptera) termite mounds in miombo woodlands form nutrient rich islands
   that sustain a different suite of woody plant species relative to the
   woodland matrix. We investigated the role of termitaria in providing
   habitat for cavity-using birds in miombo woodlands that had been greatly
   impacted by elephants and fire, by comparing the availability of habitat
   favored by cavity-using birds (tall trees, trees with deadwood, and
   cavities) on and off mounds, and then testing its effect on species
   richness and abundance of cavity-using birds. We surveyed 48 termitaria
   paired with 48 woodland matrix sites in the breeding season; and 54
   matrix-termitarium pairs in the non-breeding season in Chizarira
   National Park, Zimbabwe. Generalized linear mixed-effects models showed
   that termitaria harboured significantly higher densities (ha(-1)) of
   habitat components considered important for cavity nesting birds.
   Density of trees >6 m in height and incidence of trees with deadwood was
   nearly 10 times greater on mounds than in the matrix, and the density of
   cavities was nine times higher on mounds compared to the matrix. A model
   selection procedure showed that termitaria provided refugia for
   cavity-using birds and contributed to the resilience of bird communities
   through high on-mound densities of trees with deadwood. Large termitaria
   thus appear to play an important role in maintaining functionally
   important components of the avifauna in heavily impacted Miombo
   woodlands.}},

Abstract = {{We studied wintering grassland bird communities in De Soto National
   Forest in southern Mississippi, USA to assess differences in bird
   communities and vegetation structure among different stand types. We
   also examined which vegetation structure and plant species predicted
   occurrence of Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis), Hens low's Sparrow
   (Ammodramus henslowii), and Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis).
   Bachman's Sparrows occurred only in uplands ((x) over bar = 0.5
   birds/ha) and stands managed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides
   borealis; (x) over bar = 0.9 birds/ha), Hens low's Sparrows occurred
   only in bogs ((x) over bar = 3.8 birds/ha) and stands managed for
   Red-cockaded Woodpeckers ((x) over bar = 2.1 birds/ha), while Sedge
   Wrens occurred in all stand types ((x) over bar = 0.1-0.3 birds/ha).
   There were no significant differences among stand types in total bird
   densities for all three species combined. Dense, spatially uniform
   herbaceous cover and cover of Scleria muhlenbergii, a preferred food
   item in bogs, best predicted Hens low's Sparrow occurrence (39\% s(2)
   explained). Increased woody understory vegetation and decreased tree
   density best predicted Sedge Wren occurrence (17\% s(2) explained).
   Management for Hens low's Sparrows should focus on small-scale
   herbaceous ground-layer restoration in bogs. Bachman's Sparrows will
   respond more to thinning dense upland stands. Sedge Wrens and Bachman's
   Sparrows benefit from Red-cockaded Woodpecker management, whereas Hens
   low's Sparrow use of woodpecker stands is ephemeral. Received 6 March

Abstract = {{The practice of ecological restoration is a primary option for
   increasing levels of biodiversity by modifying human-altered ecosystems.
   The scientific discipline of restoration ecology provides conceptual
   guidance and tests of restoration strategies, with the ultimate goal of
   predictive landscape restoration. I construct a conceptual model for
   restoration of biodiversity, based on site-level (e. g., biotic and
   abiotic) conditions, landscape (e. g, interpatch connectivity and patch
   geometry), and historical factors (e. g., species arrival order and
   land-use legacies). I then ask how well restoration ecology has
   addressed the various components of this model. During the past decade,
   restoration research has focused largely on how the restoration of
   site-level factors promotes species diversity-primarily of plants.
   Relatively little attention has been paid to how landscape or historical
   factors interplay with restoration, how restoration influences
   functional and genetic components of biodiversity, or how a suite of
   less-studied taxa might be restored. I suggest that the high level of
   variation seen in restoration outcomes might be explained, at least in
   part, by the contingencies placed on site-level restoration by landscape
   and historical factors and then present a number of avenues for future
   research to address these often ignored linkages in the biodiversity
   restoration model. Such work will require carefully conducted
   restoration experiments set across multiple sites and many years. It is
   my hope that by considering how space and time influence restoration, we
   might move restoration ecology in a direction of stronger prediction,
   conducted across landscapes, thus providing feasible restoration
   strategies that work at scales over which biodiversity conservation
   occurs.}},

Title = {{Bird community responses to vegetation heterogeneity following
   non-direct regeneration of Mediterranean forests after fire}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean forests are highly resilient to fires, showing a rapid
   recovery after disturbance. However, in some cases direct tree
   regeneration fails leading to radical changes in landscape composition.
   In this study, we evaluated the impact of landscape changes on the
   conservation value of bird species using the new landscape mosaic
   arising from non-direct regeneration after a fire. We used data from a
   large fire that occurred in central Catalonia (NE Spain) in 1998. The
   fire affected about 26,000 ha of a land mosaic mainly covered by Black
   Pine Pinus nigra forests and farmland dominated by cereal crops. We used
   line transects to estimate bird abundance and gathered information on
   dominant vegetation covers and landscape variables. Redundancy analysis
   (RDA) and generalized linear models were used to explore how the
   measured environmental variables explain bird species abundance and to
   analyze how post-fire heterogeneity in vegetation affected the
   conservation value of the bird community. Factors describing the main
   patterns in the post-fire landscape explained up to 31.2\% of the total
   variability in bird community composition and described three main
   groups of bird species sharing similar ecological requirements.
   Additionally, 71\% of the studied species significantly responded to one
   of the first three vegetation gradients distinguished in the study area.
   Finally, the conservation value of the bird community significantly
   decreased in areas dominated by Q. humilis resprouters and significantly
   increased in shrubland areas. Overall, our results suggest that large
   fires affecting non-direct regenerating forest types lead to a new and
   radically different mosaic landscape offering new opportunities to
   species with unfavourable European conservation status.}},

Title = {{Another tool in the toolbox? Using fire and grazing to promote bird
   diversity in highly fragmented landscapes}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The grasslands of central North America have experienced drastic
   reductions in extent, removal of historic disturbance patterns, and
   homogenization of remaining fragments. This has resulted in steep
   declines for a broad swath of grassland biodiversity. Recent work in
   relatively extensive grasslands has demonstrated that mimicking historic
   disturbance patterns using a fire-grazing interaction can increase the
   abundance and diversity of grassland birds through increased habitat
   heterogeneity. We examined the efficacy of this management strategy for
   promoting avian diversity in highly fragmented landscapes, which
   represent the bulk of remaining grassland bird habitats in the tallgrass
   prairie region. We quantified the population density of obligate and
   facultative grassland bird species along transects in 13 experimental
   research pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of Iowa and Missouri
   (USA), divided among three treatments: 1) spatially discrete fires and
   free access by cattle ({''}patch-burn grazed''), 2) free access by
   cattle and a single complete burn ({''}grazed-and-burned''), and 3) a
   single complete burn with no cattle ({''}burned-only''). We expected
   that patch-burn grazing would produce a bird community that overlapped
   that of the grazed-and-burned and burned-only treatments, because it
   would provide habitat for species associated with both. However, an
   analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that community structure on
   pastures managed using patch-burn grazing instead diverged significantly
   from both of the other treatments. Differences in community structure
   were most highly correlated with visual obstruction and wooded edge
   density in the landscape, suggesting bird communities are differentiated
   not only by their structural habitat requirements, but also by the
   varying degrees of sensitivity to landscape fragmentation of their
   component species. The future success of this management scheme for
   fragmented grasslands hinges on if, after an optimal stocking rate is
   identified, adequate habitat can be maintained for a diverse bird
   community, or whether fragmentation will perpetually limit the efficacy
   of this method in these landscapes.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{94-104}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In Canada and the United States pressure to recoup financial costs of
   wildfire by harvesting burned timber is increasing, despite insufficient
   understanding of the ecological consequences of postfire salvage
   logging. We compared the species richness and composition of
   deadwood-associated beetle assemblages among undisturbed, recently
   burned, logged, and salvage-logged, boreal, mixed-wood stands. Species
   richness was lowest in salvage-logged stands, largely due to a negative
   effect of harvesting on the occurrence of wood- and bark-boring species.
   In comparison with undisturbed stands, the combination of wildfire and
   logging in salvage-logged stands had a greater effect on species
   composition than either disturbance alone. Strong differences in species
   composition among stand treatments were linked to differences in
   quantity and quality (e.g., decay stage) of coarse woody debris. We
   found that the effects of wildfire and logging on deadwood-associated
   beetles were synergistic, such that the effects of postfire salvage
   logging could not be predicted reliably on the basis of data on either
   disturbance alone. Thus, increases in salvage logging of burned forests
   may have serious negative consequences for deadwood-associated beetles
   and their ecological functions in early postfire successional forests.}},

Title = {{Modelling community dynamics based on species-level abundance models
   from detection/nondetection data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{67-75}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{P>1. In large-scale field surveys, a binary recording of each species'
   detection or nondetection has been increasingly adopted for its
   simplicity and low cost. Because of the importance of abundance in many
   studies, it is desirable to obtain inferences about abundance at
   species-, functional group-, and community-levels from such binary data.
   2. We developed a novel hierarchical multi-species abundance model based
   on species-level detection/nondetection data. The model accounts for the
   existence of undetected species, and variability in abundance and
   detectability among species. Species-level detection/nondetection is
   linked to species-level abundance via a detection model that
   accommodates the expectation that probability of detection (at least one
   individuals is detected) increases with local abundance of the species.
   We applied this model to a 9-year dataset composed of the
   detection/nondetection of forest birds, at a single post-fire site (from
   7 to 15 years after fire) in a montane area of central Japan. The model
   allocated undetected species into one of the predefined functional
   groups by assuming a prior distribution on individual group membership.
   3. The results suggest that 15-20 species were missed in each year, and
   that species richness of communities and functional groups did not
   change with post-fire forest succession. Overall abundance of birds and
   abundance of functional groups tended to increase over time, although
   only in the winter, while decreases in detectabilities were observed in
   several species.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Understanding and prediction of
   large-scale biodiversity dynamics partly hinge on how we can use data
   effectively. Our hierarchical model for detection/nondetection data
   estimates abundance in space/time at species-, functional group-, and
   community-levels while accounting for undetected individuals and
   species. It also permits comparison of multiple communities by many
   types of abundance-based diversity and similarity measures under
   imperfect detection.}},

Abstract = {{Saving the remaining natural forests in northern Europe has been one of
   the main goals to halt the ongoing decline of forest biodiversity. To
   facilitate the recognition, mapping and efficient conservation of
   natural forests, there is an urgent need for a general formulation,
   based on ecological patterns and processes, of the concept of ``forest
   naturalness{''}. However, complexity, structural idiosyncracy and
   dynamical features of unmanaged forest ecosystems at various
   spatio-temporal scales pose major challenges for such a formulation. The
   definitions hitherto used for the concept of forest naturalness can be
   fruitfully grouped into three dimensions: 1) structure-based concepts of
   natural forest, 2) species-based concepts of natural forest and 3)
   process-based concepts of natural forest. We propose that explicit and
   simultaneous consideration of all these three dimensions of naturalness
   can better cope with the natural variability of forest states and also
   aid in developing strategies for forest conservation and management in
   different situations. To become operational, criteria and indicators of
   forest naturalness need to integrate the three dimensions by combining
   species (e.g. red-listed-, indicator- and umbrella species) with stand
   and landscape level structural features that are indicative of
   disturbance and succession processes.}},

Abstract = {{During the last 100 years, forest management in Latvia has gradually
   become more and more focused on industrial logging, which can be
   expected to have affected the tree species composition and age
   distribution across the landscape. These changes need to be considered
   in forest management and conservation of biological diversity. The aim
   of the study was to use forest records to reconstruct the tree species
   composition and age distribution in the North Vidzeme Biosphere Reserve
   in northern Latvia for the period, 1929-1941. These data were compared
   to a data-set from 2008, to determine the changes that transpired during
   a period of intensification of forest management. The silvicultural
   methods in the 1920-1941 period were based mostly on natural
   regeneration of logged stands. This led to succession to birch on
   harvested spruce stands and can explain the relatively large cover of
   mature birch stands today. After 1960, forest management was directed on
   conifer monocultures, and thus spruce stands today predominantly have
   age <50 years. An age class >150 years is almost absent for all species,
   and conservation should be directed to adding a portion of old forests
   to the protection network, and in maintaining the spatial continuity of
   overmature deciduous stands.}},

Abstract = {{Determining forest bird responses to environmental factors may represent
   a keystone to disentangle how forest management could mitigate the
   current and expected impacts of global change in Mediterranean
   biodiversity. We analyzed the spatial variation of the relationships
   between bird species richness (specialist and generalist birds) and
   forest landscape features, fires and climate in order to provide
   specific forest management guidelines in the Mediterranean region of
   Catalonia (NE Spain). We performed Geographically Weighted Regression
   (GWR) models, an extension of the standard regression approach that
   accounts for non-stationary processes in the analyzed relationships.
   Climate warming would negatively affect forest bird diversity,
   particularly in the southern part of Catalonia where the higher
   temperatures and lower precipitations occur. However, the key role of
   forest landscape characteristics to explain the distribution of bird
   species richness suggests that forest management could buffer the
   negative impacts of climate change. Management should also avoid
   landscape homogenization and an excessive fuel accumulation that can
   boost the increasing wildfire occurrence, which has been here shown to
   negatively impact forest bird species richness in the region.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{605-611}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires negatively affect the overall reproductive success of several
   woodland avian species, but there is scarce information about which
   stages of the nesting cycle are specifically affected. We conducted a
   3-year study to identify the effects of fire on the reproductive
   parameters of the great tit (Parus major) and the survival of its nests
   at different stages of the nesting cycle. We recorded the occupancy
   rate, clutch and brood size, hatching, fledging and nesting success in
   nest boxes placed on study plots with different post-fire age. By
   examining the post-fire succession, we analysed the survival of eggs and
   nestlings under predation risks. As the forest matured after a wildfire,
   tits occupied more nest boxes and laid more eggs that suffered less
   predation than in earlier successional stages. Although the incubation
   fate improved at each step of succession, the conditions to fully raise
   nestlings seemed to be suitable only in the oldest woods. Our findings
   indicate that the population dynamics of a reputed generalist avian
   species may be affected by fire. Furthermore, the effects of wildfires
   on stage-specific reproductive parameters show that an avian species
   that inhabits woodlands regains its full productivity only when its
   habitat has completely recovered from fire.}},

Abstract = {{An essential component of conservation science is repeated surveys over
   time to monitor species that might be responding to local factors, such
   as land management, or more broadly to global change. A systematic
   survey of the avifauna of Cape York Peninsula was conducted in the late
   1990s and early 2000s providing an ideal basal dataset for measuring
   change in the avifauna. A subset (n>600) of these sites, primarily
   within savanna landscapes, was selected for re-survey in 2008 to
   investigate changes in bird communities on Cape York Peninsula. Changes
   in mean species richness varied across the study area (decreases in 59
   grid cells and increases in 43) with no apparent pattern. Significant
   change in reporting rates was recorded in 30 species. Four sedentary and
   highly detectable species declined (Bar-shouldered Dove, Brown
   Treecreeper, Sulphur-crested Cockatoo and Pale-headed Rosella) and five
   increased (Peaceful Dove, Pheasant Coucal, Weebill, White-throated
   Honeyeater and Yellow Oriole). Habitat preference for the species that
   showed change remained relatively stable between the two survey periods.
   Some species that were recorded in very low numbers in the original
   survey and are considered to be threatened (Brown Treecreeper,
   Black-faced Woodswallow) remained in very low numbers or decreased in
   our survey suggesting that there has been no regional recovery of these
   species. Long-term monitoring can describe important patterns of species
   change over time, though in the case of large, highly seasonal
   environments like the tropical savannas, signals of change may manifest
   over decades rather than annually.}},

Title = {{Bird Community Response to Filter Strips in Maryland}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{116-125}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Filter strips are strips of herbaceous vegetation planted along
   agricultural field margins adjacent to streams or wetlands and are
   designed to intercept sediment, nutrients, and agrichemicals. Roughly
   16,000 ha of filter strips have been established in Maryland through the
   United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve
   Enhancement Program. Filter strips often represent the only uncultivated
   herbaceous areas on farmland in Maryland and therefore may be important
   habitat for early-successional bird species. Most filter strips in
   Maryland are planted to either native warm-season grasses or cool-season
   grasses and range in width from 10.7 m to 91.4 m. From 2004 to 2007 we
   studied the breeding and wintering bird communities in filter strips
   adjacent to wooded edges and non-buffered field edges and the effect
   that grass type and width of filter strips had on bird community
   composition. We used 5 bird community metrics (total bird density,
   species richness, scrub-shrub bird density, grassland bird density, and
   total avian conservation value), species-specific densities, nest
   densities, and nest survival estimates to assess the habitat value of
   filter strips for birds. Breeding and wintering bird community metrics
   were greater in filter strips than in non-buffered field edges but did
   not differ between cool-season and warm-season grass filter strips. Most
   breeding bird community metrics were negatively related to the percent
   cover of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) in >= 1 yr. Breeding bird
   density was greater in narrow (<30 m) compared to wide (>60 m) filter
   strips. Our results suggest that narrow filter strips adjacent to wooded
   edges can provide habitat for many bird species but that wide filter
   strips provide better habitat for grassland birds, particularly obligate
   grassland species. If bird conservation is an objective, avoid planting
   orchardgrass in filter strips and reduce or eliminate orchardgrass from
   filter strips through management practices. (C) 2011 The Wildlife

Abstract = {{Due to fire suppression and land use changes, Missouri glade habitats
   have undergone long-term declines in area and function leading to
   consequent declines in many bird species that rely on these habitats. We
   examined breeding bird species composition and vegetation community
   composition on three glade sites undergoing restoration with prescribed
   tire and compared them to three unburned glade sites and three unburned
   forest sites. Although we documented subtle changes in vegetation
   characteristics in response to prescribed fire, important structural
   characteristics, such as canopy cover (>55\% at all study sites) and
   grass cover (<10\% at all study sites) remain outside ranges used to
   characterize glades. Despite this, bird community structure shifted
   towards grass-shrubland (glade) birds (e.g., prairie warbler (Dendroica
   discolor), blue-winged warbler (Vermivora pinus), yellow-breasted chat
   (Icteria virens)) in glades that had been managed with prescribed tire.
   Using canonical correspondence analyses and stepwise forward logistic
   regression, we found that grass-shrubland (glade) birds were associated
   with habitat characteristics such as high stem density of small (0-6.3
   cm diameter at breast height) trees, greater herbaceous cover, greater
   rock cover and a more open canopy. However, we did not detect any bird
   species historically associated with glades, such as Bachman's sparrow
   (Aimophila aestivalis) or field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) on any study
   sites but did frequently detect red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceous) on
   all sites. Short term application of prescribed fire has not yet
   produced functionally restored glades. Long term applications of
   prescribed fire, used in conjunction with mechanical and/or chemical
   removal of woody overstory, are necessary to achieve restoration at
   these sites.}},

Abstract = {{In the eastern boreal forest of Canada long fire cycles allow for a
   significant portion of stands to become old growth. These old-growth
   boreal forest stands are subjected to secondary disturbances that create
   uneven structure, which supports a variety of types of organisms. In
   order to maintain the proportion of stands with uneven structure on the
   landscape, partial cuts have been suggested as a management technique
   that could create or maintain these uneven structures. This study
   compares the effects of partial and low-retention harvests and
   un-harvested control on understory plants in four sites five years after
   harvest. The relative abundance of species was examined by a habitat
   group. While richness did not vary among treatments, increasing severity
   of harvest favoured pioneer species that prefer disturbed mineral soil
   and high light levels. Sites with thicker organic layers that were
   harvested in the winter were significantly less impacted by both partial
   and lowr-etention harvest. Canopy opening alone had little impact in the
   three most northern sites. As old-growth black spruce forests are open
   by nature, this suggests that soil perturbation is a bigger driver of
   community change after harvest than proportion of canopy removed for
   this forest type.}},

Abstract = {{We examined differences in bird communities in relation to
   characteristics of habitat structure in a pine forest, Samcheok, South
   Korea. An unburned stand, a stand burned 7 years earlier and then
   naturally restored, and a stand where Japanese red pine Pinus densiflora
   seedlings were planted after the fire were used for the survey. Habitat
   structure was dramatically changed by postfire silvicultural practices.
   Number of stand trees, shrubs, seedlings, snags, and vegetation coverage
   were significantly different among study stands. We made 1,421
   detections of 46 bird species during 23 separate line transect surveys
   per stand between February 2007 and December 2008. The mean number of
   observed bird species and individuals, bird species diversity index
   (H'), and Simpson's diversity index (D (s)) were highest in the unburned
   stand and lowest in the pine seedling stand. There were more species and
   individuals of forest-dwelling birds in the unburned stand than both
   burned stands. Canopy and cavity nesters, foliage searchers, bark
   gleaners, and timber drillers were significantly higher in the unburned
   stand. In the pine seedling stand, densities of birds that prefer open
   field and shrub cover were higher. Stand structure was simplified in the
   pine seedling stand by postfire practices. Because of differences in
   habitat structure and bird communities, postfire practices in the burned
   stand should be re-evaluated. Also, management strategies for pine
   forest after forest fires are needed based on results of long-term
   experiments.}},

Title = {{Local and landscape-scale forest attributes differ in their impact on
   bird assemblages across years in forest production landscapes}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{97-106}},
Abstract = {{Forest management practices and forest fragmentation are commonly
   recognised as factors influencing species distribution and diversity,
   but it remains largely unknown how species turnover and fluctuations
   across years might affect generalisations from short-term predictions.
   There is also much uncertainty about how compositional heterogeneity
   within forests, through their partitioning into differently managed
   stands, influences species occurrence and diversity. We aimed to
   investigate bird species richness in different forest stands in a
   heterogeneous landscape and asked whether short-term studies commonly
   used are sufficient to describe diversity habitat relationships.
   Breeding birds were monitored in 50 stands of differing forest types and
   management regimes in 2008 and 2009 in the heterogeneous forest
   production landscape of the Schwabische Alb in SW Germany. Based on a
   database of 25 and 21 species observed in 2008 and 2009, respectively,
   we estimated local species richness and species turnover with Bayesian
   hierarchical multi-species occupancy models to account for imperfect
   detection. A suite of forest attributes at stand level (from local field
   inventories) and landscape level, between 100 and 2000 in in extent,
   which were derived from forest management maps, were screened for their
   explanatory power regarding bird species richness. The most meaningful
   variables were included in a final set of models to account for effects
   of forest attributes on species occurrence and resulting gradients in
   species richness and turnover.
   Bird species richness in 2008 was mostly explained by stand composition
   heterogeneity over a distance of 800 m around sample locations, whereas
   in 2009 local stand features like stand succession type and stand age
   mostly explained species richness. Species turnover was significantly
   higher in young forest stands of thicket and pole-wood stages compared
   with old forest stands of timber stages.
   Variable multi-scale impacts of forest attributes on local species
   richness and turnover, together with year-to-year fluctuations in the
   regional species pool, emphasise that the relative importance of local
   versus landscape-scale factors in determining bird species richness may
   vary across years. Long-term and multiple-scale investigations that take
   structural and compositional forest heterogeneity into account are
   necessary for improved prediction of species habitat relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Work in many parts of the world has discussed the decline of
   biodiversity in regions dominated by agriculture. We report the results
   of a major study documenting the longitudinal profiles of birds between
   1998 and 2009 within 66 patches of temperate woodland in a heavily
   cleared and grazed agricultural region of south-eastern Australia. Many
   researchers have forecast the loss of bird biota from this region and
   others that also were formerly dominated by temperate woodland.
   We had sufficient high quality data to analyse the longitudinal profiles
   of reporting rates for 76 of the 116 individual bird species recorded in
   our 12-year study. Unexpectedly, only four of the 76 species analysed
   (5.6\%) exhibited a significant negative linear decrease in reporting
   rate. More surprisingly, 32 (42.1\%) exhibited a significant positive
   linear increase in reporting rate, including several taxa of
   conservation concern. These increases occurred despite a series of
   below-average rainfall years. Reporting rates were too low to formally
   model long-term trends in some other bird species widely considered to
   be of conservation concern such as the Diamond Firetail (Stagonopleura
   guttata) and Speckled Warbler (Chthonicola sagittata).
   Many authors have used functional (and other) groups to forecast bird
   species likely to be lost from Australia's temperate woodlands. However,
   we found no clear links between life history attributes and long-term
   trend patterns of species.
   Our findings contrast with recent findings from other temperate
   woodland-dominated regions in eastern Australia where losses in bird
   populations have been documented. However, they parallel other
   investigations such as in central New South Wales. These similarities
   among, and differences between, studies suggest regional differences in
   temporal patterns in bird population dynamics. Many of the observed
   changes in reporting rates were positive and they provide hope that
   forecast future losses of a large proportion of existing temperate
   woodland bird assemblages in south-eastern Australia may not be realised
   uniformly in all regions. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to analyze the floristic composition and the structure
   of a savanna on rocky soil ({''}cerrado rupestre{''}) woody vegetation
   (including monocots and lianas) in the Cerrado-Amazon Forest transition
   zone located at Parque Municipal do Bacaba, Nova Xavantina, State of
   Mato Grosso (14 degrees 41' S and 52 degrees 20' W), and compare it with
   other cerrado stricto sensu studies. Ten 20 x 50 m plots were randomly
   established, within which all live and dead woody plants with at least 3
   cm of trunk diameter at 30 cm above ground level (DSH(30) >= 3 cm) were
   measured. The cerrado rupestre showed high density (3,766 live
   individuals), richness (85 species, 67 genera and 34 families) and basal
   area (15.72 m(2)ha(-1)), as well as high levels of Shannon-Wiener
   species diversity (H' = 3.47) and evenness (J = 0.78) indices. The most
   important species were Erythroxylum suberosum, Qualea parviflora,
   Anacardium occidentale, Kielmeyera rubriflora and Vatairea macrocarpa.
   The greatest floristic similarity found between typical cerrado and
   ``cerrado rupestre{''} communities from lower altitude areas of
   Northeastern Mato Grosso suggest that, in this region, altitude and
   geographical distance influence the species composition, regardless of
   the substrate. The community presented unimodality in the heights
   distribution and is mostly compounded by shrubby individuals with height
   < 3 m and DSH < 5 cm. We suggest that floristic and phytosociological
   studies conducted in ``cerrado rupestre{''} should adopt DSH 3 cm and
   include monocot and liana species, so as to more realistically represent
   the vegetation richness, species composition and structure. The high
   species richness and diversity registered in this study might be related
   to this ``cerrado rupestre{''} pre-Amazonian location, which emphasizes
   the importance of ``Parque do Bacaba{''} maintenance as a guarantee of
   its biological diversity protection.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{274-280}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Humans are rapidly altering natural systems, leading to changes in the
   distribution and abundance of species. However, so many changes are
   occurring simultaneously (e. g., climate change, habitat fragmentation)
   that it is difficult to determine the cause of population fluctuations
   from correlational studies. We used a manipulative field experiment to
   determine whether forest canopy cover directly influences reptile
   assemblages on rock outcrops in southeastern Australia. Our experimental
   design consisted of three types of rock outcrops: (1) shady sites in
   which overgrown vegetation was manually removed (n = 25); (2) overgrown
   controls (n = 30); and (3) sun-exposed controls (n = 20). Following
   canopy removal, we monitored reptile responses over 30 months. Canopy
   removal increased reptile species richness, the proportion of shelter
   sites used by reptiles, and relative abundances of five species that
   prefer sun-exposed habitats. Our manipulation also decreased the
   abundances of two shade-tolerant species. Canopy cover thus directly
   influences this reptile assemblage, with the effects of canopy removal
   being dependent on each species' habitat preferences (i.e., selection or
   avoidance of sun-exposed habitat). Our study suggests that increases in
   canopy cover can cause declines of open-habitat specialists, as
   previously suggested by correlative studies from a wide range of taxa.
   Given that reptile colonization of manipulated outcrops occurred
   rapidly, artificially opening the canopy in ecologically informed ways
   could help to conserve imperiled species with patchy distributions and
   low vagility that are threatened by vegetation overgrowth. One such
   species is Australia's most endangered snake, the broad-headed snake
   (Hoplocephalus bungaroides).}},

Journal = {{EMU}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{304-311}},
Abstract = {{The Gouldian Finch (Erythrura gouldiae) has experienced significant
   decline in population and the extent of its range over the past 40
   years, which has generally been attributed to the availability of
   suitable foraging habitat. Less research, however, has investigated the
   suitability or availability of breeding habitat of the species. Gouldian
   Finches are obligate cavity nesters, and a recent study has shown that
   they select nest-sites non-randomly based on structural characteristics
   of the cavity. Here we investigated the relative effects of different
   environmental factors on the spatial distribution of Gouldian Finch
   nests at two different scales. At the broader, landscape scale (over
   similar to 60 km(2)), the strongest predictor of nesting density at a
   site was the abundance of suitable nest-sites. At the finer scale
   (similar to 1 km(2)), no single factor explained the variation in
   location of nest-sites. Gouldian Finches require areas of habitat
   characterised by high densities of suitable nest-sites (tree-cavities).
   Within these patches, individuals are potentially selecting nest-sites
   based on the morphometry of cavities rather than landscape features such
   as topography, vegetation or proximity to water. Our findings should be
   integrated with studies of feeding and habitat requirements in the
   non-breeding season, with the aim of constructing holistic and
   predictive habitat-suitability models for this endangered species.}},

Title = {{Bird community specialization, bird conservation and disturbance: the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{128-136}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Although niche theory predicts that disturbance should favour
   generalist species, the community-level implications of this pattern
   have been sparsely analysed. Here, we test the hypothesis that
   disturbance favours generalist species within communities, analysing
   effects of wildfires in bird communities in a Mediterranean climate area
   as a case study.
   2. We use bird occurrence data in more than 500 1 x 1 km squares forming
   a gradient running from forest to completely burnt areas. The level of
   specialization of bird communities was estimated by means of three
   complementary species specialization indices, calculated for different
   landscape gradients and averaged at the community level (i.e. 1 x 1 km
   squares), and mean species rarity.
   3. We also calculated mean habitat preferences along landscape
   gradients, as well as an index of conservation value and total species
   richness.
   4. Different estimators of bird community specialization varied in
   contrasting fashion along the wildfire disturbance gradient, and thus we
   conclude that it is not justified to expect unique community responses
   to the sharp variations in habitat characteristics brought by wildfire
   disturbances.
   5. Burnt areas tended to have rarer and urban-avoider bird species,
   whereas unburnt forests tended to have larger proportions of forest
   specialist species.
   6. The mean conservation value of communities clearly increased towards
   the burnt extreme of the wildfire disturbance gradient, while this had a
   negligible effect on species richness.
   7. Wildfires seem to play an important role for the maintenance of
   open-habitat, urban-avoider bird populations in Mediterranean landscapes
   and also to benefit a set of bird species of unfavourable European
   conservation status.
   8. In this context, it cannot be unambiguously concluded that fire
   disturbance, even in a context in which fires are greatly favoured by
   human-related activities, leads to more functionally simplified
   communities dominated by generalist species.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient conservation planning in managed forest landscapes requires
   knowledge about the location of functional habitat for specialised
   species. We explored the importance of different variables to predict
   habitat suitability for the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos
   leucotos Bechstein), a proposed umbrella species in deciduous forest.
   Specifically, we tested whether biophysical proxy variables indicating
   management intensity and the occurrence of natural processes constituted
   a useful complement to traditional remotely sensed data on tree species
   composition and forest stand age for modelling the woodpecker's habitat.
   Presence-absence of the woodpecker during the study period (1986-2006)
   in southwestern Sweden was explained by the area of edge habitats
   (forest bordering water or farmland) and wetland forest, and location
   relative to the historical marine limit. The number of years with
   occurrence of the woodpecker in a territory was explained by the area of
   forest bordering water and wetland forest. Among traditional forest
   variables, the area of deciduous forest had a strong positive effect on
   both woodpecker presence-absence and the number of years with
   occurrence. The results support the hypothesis that edge habitats and
   forest types subject to natural processes favouring deciduous trees and
   dead wood creation are valuable to the woodpecker and should be
   prioritised in conservation planning.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{281-293}},
Abstract = {{There is currently increasing pressure on urban woodland in
   industrialised countries. Management of such areas is shifting towards
   multiple-use with focus on both recreation and biodiversity
   conservation. We examined the concept of ``openness{''} as part of a
   possible tool for planners and decision makers. Our field studies were
   conducted in oak-dominated urban woodlands in southern Sweden with the
   focus on understory density. In a field experiment we found that
   understory density was greatly influenced by management, but effects
   appeared to be site-dependent. Photographs from the field sites were
   shown to panels of students to analyse recreational preferences in
   relation to openness. The photographs showed similar woodland types but
   with different understory density, although the quantification of this
   variation was not revealed to the participants. In general, open forests
   were considered most attractive for recreation but 74\% of the
   respondents claimed that they preferred a mix of open and closed forest.
   Frequent forest visitors preferred relatively closed forests but
   infrequent visitors liked more open forests. As an example of management
   effects on biodiversity, we examined the density and diversity of
   woodland birds in relation to the management. We found that bird
   densities decreased in the plots with extensive removal of understory.
   We suggest that variables related to openness can be used in the
   planning process, especially at fine-grained scales, to analyse
   different management options and make trade-offs between interests in
   multiple-use woodland sites. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Title = {{Does post-mining rehabilitation restore habitat equivalent to that
   removed by mining? A case study from the monsoonal tropics of northern
   Australia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{482-490}},
Abstract = {{Context. Rehabilitation is increasingly being promoted as a strategy for
   minimising and even reversing biodiversity loss. Many rehabilitation
   strategies that aim to provide habitat focus entirely on establishing
   vegetation. Successful vegetation establishment, however, does not
   necessarily provide habitat that is ecologically equivalent to that
   removed by vegetation clearing. Quantitative understanding of faunal
   responses to rehabilitation is required if rehabilitation techniques are
   to be refined and deliver desired biodiversity outcomes.
   Aims. I aimed to assess the extent to which post-mining rehabilitation
   restores bird habitat equivalent to that removed in the mining process
   on the Weipa bauxite plateau.
   Methods. The composition, abundance and richness of bird assemblages
   were compared between native forest sites and a 23-year chronosequence
   of post-mining rehabilitation sites. Native forest sites were made up of
   three Weipa bauxite plateau land units, including the land unit that
   represents pre-mining native forest, and two land units that are
   considered to be potential analogues for the post-mining landscape.
   Key results. Bird abundance and bird species richness increased with
   rehabilitation age. Bird species richness in the two oldest age classes
   of mine rehabilitation was similar to values obtained from pre-mining
   native forest and post-mining landscape analogue sites. The composition
   of bird assemblages, however, was significantly different. Of all the
   bird species observed, 25\% occurred exclusively in native forest sites,
   19\% occurred exclusively in mine-rehabilitation sites, and the
   remaining 56\% were recorded in both native forest and
   mine-rehabilitation sites. Site bird-detection rates were significantly
   related to site vegetation structure, with inter-specific differences in
   bird response.
   Conclusions. Post-mining rehabilitation at Weipa has partially made up
   for the loss of habitat caused by clearing for mining. Twenty-three
   years after rehabilitation commenced, however, a clear residual impact
   on biodiversity remains, with a third of native forest birds absent from
   mine rehabilitation, including several native forest specialists.
   Implications. Rehabilitation can partially make up for biodiversity
   losses caused by the initial loss of habitat. There is no evidence,
   however, that rehabilitation can achieve `no net loss'. Reliance on
   rehabilitation to achieve conservation outcomes does not address the
   fact that many fauna species require resources that are found only in
   mature forest.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-scale habitat selection by two specialist woodpeckers occurring in
   beech and oak-dominated forest in Southern Belgium.
   We studied the identification of key habitat parameters for two
   specialist woodpecker species (middle spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos
   medius and lesser spotted woodpecker D. minor) associated with mature
   broadleaved forests ecosystems in Europe, and the modelling of their
   specific requirements with a view to assist forest managers. The study
   was conducted in four beech and oak-dominated forests (Haut-Fays, Halma,
   Gembes and Croix-Scaille) located in the Ardennes Region of Southern
   Belgium. The study sites covered a total area of ca. 20 km(2). A census
   of woodpecker occurrence (presence-absence) was implemented from 2000 to
   2003 within 255 I-ha plots. Habitat variables describing stand age, tree
   density, snag density, stand composition and vertical vegetation
   structure were also sampled at the same plots to develop both logistic
   and autologistic regression models describing habitat use. Middle
   spotted woodpecker (MSW) uses the oak-rich locations (mean basal area of
   15.6 m(2)/ha), with selection of areas with the largest, oldest oak
   trees (mean circumference > 150 cm), and with a high diversity of tree
   species in the overstory. Similarly, the lesser spotted woodpecker (LSW)
   was detected in areas presenting the highest percentage cover of oak
   trees but with a selection of younger stands, with a high density of
   snags and dead wood (mean of 9 m(3)/ha). The integration of an
   autocorrelation term improved model performance for the LSW but not for
   MSW. Our results highlight the importance of a high disponibility of oak
   trees for these two sympatric species. The climax forest in northwest
   Europe is beech so that public and private owners must develop
   appropriate forest management plans to prevent the conversion of oak to
   beech forests. In particular, forest managers can promote an active oak}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the processes of biological diversification is a central
   topic in evolutionary biology. The South African Cape fynbos, one of the
   major plant biodiversity hotspots out of the tropics, has prompted
   several hypotheses about the causes of generation and maintenance of
   biodiversity. Fire has been traditionally invoked as a key element to
   explain high levels of biodiversity in highly speciose fynbos taxa, such
   as the genus Erica. In this study, we have implemented a
   microevolutionary approach to elucidate how plant-response to fire may
   contribute to explain high levels of diversification in Erica. By using
   microsatellite markers, we investigated the genetic background of seeder
   (fire-sensitive) and resprouter (fire-resistant) populations of the
   fynbos species Erica coccinea. We found higher within-population genetic
   diversity and higher among-population differentiation in seeder
   populations and interpreted these higher levels of genetic
   diversification as a consequence of the comparatively shorter generation
   times and faster population turnover in the seeder form of this species.
   Considering that genetic divergence among populations may be seen as the
   initial step to speciation, the parallelism between these results and
   the pattern of biodiversity at the genus level offers stimulating
   insights into understanding causes of speciation of the genus Erica in
   the Cape fynbos.}},

Abstract = {{For preserving biodiversity of European-Mediterranean forest ecosystems
   in current and future scenarios of global change by means of sustainable
   forest management it is necessary to determine how environment and
   forest characteristics correlate with biodiversity. For this purpose,
   neural networks were used to model forest bird species richness as a
   function of environment and forest structure and composition at the 1 x
   1 km scale in Catalonia (NE Spain). Univariate and multivariate models
   respectively allowed exploring individual variable response and
   obtaining a parsimonious (ecologically meaningful) and accurate neural
   network. Forest area (with a canopy cover above 5\%), mean forest canopy
   cover, mean annual temperature and summer precipitation were the best
   predictors of forest bird species richness. The resultant multivariate
   network had a good generalization capacity that failed however in the
   locations with highest species richness. Additionally, those forests
   with different degrees of canopy closure that were more mature and
   presented a more diverse tree species composition were also associated
   with higher bird species richness. This allowed us to provide management
   guidelines for forest planning in order to promote avian diversity in
   this European-Mediterranean region.}},

Abstract = {{The use of aural surveys to estimate population parameters is widespread
   in avian studies. Despite efforts to increase the efficacy of this
   method, the potential for ecological context to bias population
   estimates remains largely unexplored. For example, food availability and
   nest predation risk can influence singing activity independent of
   density and, therefore, may bias aural estimates where these ecological
   factors vary systematically among habitats or other categories of
   ecological interest. We used a natural fire event in a mixed-conifer
   forest that experienced variation in fire severity (low, intermediate,
   and high) to determine if aural surveys produce accurate density
   estimates of Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) independent of ecological
   context. During the first 2-yr postfire, we censused junco populations
   in each burn type with intensive spot-mapping and nest searching,
   locating 168 nests. Simultaneously, we conducted fixed-radius
   point-count surveys and estimated food availability and nest predation
   risk in each burn type to test whether ecological context may influence
   aural detection probability independent of actual density. We found no
   difference in nesting densities among patches burned at different
   severity. Arthropod food availability was inversely related to fire
   severity during the first postfire breeding season, but increased to
   higher levels across all severities during the second. In both years,
   aural detections were significantly greater in intermediate severity
   patches that consistently represented the habitat with the lowest nest
   predation risk. These results suggest that nest predation risk may
   significantly bias aural estimates of avian populations. Although
   traditional aural survey methods such as the Breeding Bird Survey
   measure habitat attributes, our findings highlight the difficulty in
   assessing relevant covariates in estimates of avian population. Future
   research must consider the potential for nest predation and other
   ecological factors to drive interannual or interhabitat variation in
   avian population estimates independent of true changes in population
   size.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is used widely to manage grasslands on National Wildlife
   Refuges and other public lands in the northern Great Plains, but its
   effects on habitat use or production of wildlife in the region are
   poorly understood. During 1998-2003, we used point counts to examine
   effects of prescribed fire on vegetation and passerines in a mixed-grass
   prairie complex in north-central North Dakota, USA (n 5 7 units, each
   40-70 ha). Vegetation structure and, to a lesser extent, plant community
   composition varied with year of study (likely related to changes in
   annual precipitation) and with number of growing seasons since fire.
   Fire altered plant structure, especially the amount of residual
   vegetation, which in turn influenced bird species richness and
   abundance. The number of indicated pairs for sedge wren (Cistothorus
   platensis), clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), Le Conte's sparrow
   (Ammodramus leconteii), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis),
   and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) were lowest during the first
   postfire growing season but generally increased and stabilized within
   2-3 postfire growing seasons. Our results support the premise that
   grassland passerines are well-adapted to frequent, periodic fires,
   generally corresponding to those occurring prior to Euro-American
   settlement of the region. Prescribed fire is important for reducing tree
   and shrub invasion, restoring biological integrity of plant communities,
   and maintaining or enhancing populations of grassland-dependent bird
   species. Managers in the northern mixed-grass prairie region should not
   be overly concerned about reductions in bird abundances that are limited
   mostly to the first growing season after fire.}},

Abstract = {{Tree cavities are proposed to limit populations and structure
   communities of cavity-nesting birds. Although the greatest diversity of
   cavity-nesting birds is found in tropical and subtropical moist forests,
   little is known about how tropical logging affects the abundance of
   cavities or cavity-nesting birds. We compared the abundance of cavities
   and cavity nests between primary and selectively-logged subtropical
   moist Atlantic forest in Argentina, and conducted the first before-after
   controlled nest-box addition experiment to determine whether nest sites
   limit the breeding density of cavity-nesting birds in tropical or
   subtropical moist forest. Visual inspection of 86 cavities identified
   through ground-surveys revealed that only 19\% were suitable for nesting
   birds, suggesting that cavity abundance may be overestimated in the
   literature on tropical forests. Suitable cavities were found in fewer
   than 1\% of 1156 trees <60 cm dbh but 20\% of 20 trees >100 cm dbh.
   Logged forest had half the basal area of primary forest, one third the
   density of large trees, nine times fewer cavities suitable for nesting
   birds, and 17 times fewer active nests. When we added nest boxes,
   nesting density increased on treatment plots but not on control plots in
   both logged and primary forest, suggesting that cavity supply can limit
   nest density even in relatively undisturbed forest. This is the first
   experiment to show how reduced cavity supply in logged tropical forest
   can limit breeding density of cavity-nesting birds. International
   initiatives such as forest certification should promote tropical timber
   management strategies that conserve large live cavity-bearing trees. (C)

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Nearly a century of fire suppression has changed fundamental aspects of
   the structure and functioning of fire-adapted forests throughout the
   western U. S. Prescribed fire is increasingly used to restore forest
   structure and reduce surface fuels with limited consideration of its
   consequences for biological diversity. In this study, we used more than
   two decades of data from permanent plots in mixed-conifer forests of
   Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, California, to explore changes
   in plant diversity and abundance following reintroduction and repeated
   use of fire. Data on stand structure, fuel loading, fire severity and
   heterogeneity, and the richness and abundance of major growth forms were
   collected on 51 plots representing one of three treatments: control,
   first-entry burn, and second-entry burn. Understories showed distinct
   compositional changes over time in first-and second-entry burns. Burned
   plots supported more than twice as many species as controls 10 yr after
   treatment; first-entry plots showed a nearly threefold increase in
   richness by year 20. Burned plots supported four to five times as many
   shrub species as controls 5-10 yr after burning. Total plant cover
   (dominated by perennial forbs and shrubs) increased in first-entry
   plots, but did not differ from controls until 20 yr after treatment.
   Following second-entry, cover did not change through final sampling
   (year 10). Nonnative species were rare, occurring in only three plots at
   low abundance. Higher severity fires led to greater numbers of species
   and to greater plant cover. Species richness was not correlated with
   burn heterogeneity. Long-term observations suggest that reintroduction
   of fire in previously unmanaged forests can gradually enhance the
   diversity and abundance of understory species. Repeated
   burning-necessary to achieve structural and fuel-reduction
   objectives-does not appear to have a detrimental effect on plant
   diversity and may enhance the distributions of species that are
   adversely affected by fire exclusion. If fire is to play an important
   role in restoration, however, it will need to be maintained as a
   frequent and spatially dynamic process on the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the bird and woody plant communities of 2 to 24-year-old
   rehabilitation areas at Gove bauxite mine (20 km2) in the seasonal
   tropics of northern Australia, where Alcan has maintained a consistent
   rehabilitation program since it began operation in 1974. Birds were
   censused every second month over 2 years in 30 widely separated 0.25-ha
   plots, representing five chronosequence stages. These were also compared
   with six ({''}off-mine{''}) plots adjacent to the mine, which
   represented the annually burnt open forest typical of the region.
   Short-lived Acacias dominated the early chronosequence stages, whereas
   eucalypts dominated in later stages. Mean avian species richness and
   abundance increased significantly along the chronosequence, with values
   for the oldest rehabilitation plots being very similar to those for the
   off-mine plots. However, analyses of similarity revealed that the bird
   communities of the oldest rehabilitation plots were distinct from those
   of the off-mine plots, indicating that succession in rehabilitation
   areas is not following a direct trajectory toward the native open forest
   surrounding the mine. Several hollow-nesting bird species were scarce or
   absent in the rehabilitation areas, probably reflecting the absence of
   older hollow-bearing trees. Many differences between the rehabilitation
   and the off-mine areas in vegetation structure, woody flora, and
   avifauna appear to be related to the exclusion of fire from the
   minesite. We recommend the initiation of experiments designed to assess
   the effects of fire on the biota but caution against the use of fires
   for the majority of rehabilitation areas.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the Midwestern U.S., grassland birds have been declining
   faster than any other group of birds, with the main cause for these
   declines being the extensive loss of native prairies. During the last 25
   y, surrogate grasslands, such as Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)
   lands, have become increasingly important as an alternative habitat for
   grassland birds. However, many CRP grasslands that once provided
   excellent habitat are now dominated by monculture stands of grass,
   resulting in a less diverse habitat that has reduced wildlife benefits.
   In summer 2002, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and Pheasants
   Forever partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture's
   Farm Service Agency and Natural Resource Conservation Service to
   initiate a program that promotes disking and interseeding legumes as a
   mid-contract management practice in CRP fields. The objectives of this
   study were to determine grassland bird abundance and nest-productivity
   in disked and interseeded CRP fields and evaluate vegetative responses
   to disking and interseeding. We conducted our study on 16 CRP fields in
   Stanton County, Nebraska where we used fixed transects to determine
   avian species richness and abundance and nest-searched twelve 4-ha plots
   to determine nest productivity in treatment (managed by disking and
   interseeding) and reference (unmanaged) CRP fields. We also recorded
   vegetation characteristics along each transect and at each nest. Overall
   abundance in treatment fields was 4.49 +/- 0.25 (SE) birds/transect
   compared to 2.93 +/- 0.21 birds/transect in reference fields. Species
   richness and diversity were also higher in treatment fields. There was
   no difference in nest density or nest success between treatment and
   reference fields. Treatment field vegetation had higher percentages of
   forbs and bare ground than reference sites. Maximum vegetation height
   and horizontal visual obstruction were also higher in treatment sites.
   To accommodate the most grassland bird species in CRP fields, management
   of CRP fields should include establishing an annual rotation of
   disking/interseeding, while leaving portions of fields in mature grass
   stands. Future research should focus On methods that will increase the
   longevity of the vegetation effects of disking/interseeding legumes.}},

Abstract = {{Although increased attention is being paid to animals when studying
   restoration processes, little is known on the effects that different
   restoration efforts have on birds In this study we evaluated the
   variation of bird communities in a managed landscape that includes
   cropfields and two different restoration strategies To evaluate possible
   differential effects of both restoration strategies (plus former-state
   and natural-state comparisons as controls), we compared their bird
   communities After five growing seasons, bird species richness was
   highest in native forest remnants and lowest in cropfields Although
   species richness values from the restoration treatment did not show
   differences in relation to those from the forest treatment, values for
   the reforestation treatment did. Bird densities were highest in the
   forests and alike in cropfield, reforestation, and restoration
   treatments However, bird communities recorded in the restoration
   treatment were fairly even when compared to the reforestation treatment,
   and highest bird species composition similarity was recorded between the
   restoration and forest treatments These results suggest that the studied
   restoration treatment attracts a higher number of bird species in
   relation to former states and thus enhance bird richness. Also, we
   demonstrate that restoration efforts that include more actions can
   affect more ecosystem components In this study, nurse plants not only
   offered a quick growing structural vegetation component that enhanced
   habitat structure, but also provided abundant food resources for birds.
   Given the scarcity of comparable habitat matrices to replicate our
   study, our results should be taken with caution as they are not
   generalizable to all Mexican temperate forest conditions Although
   further studies need to address whether restoration practices using
   Lupinus elegans positively affect bird primary population parameters (e
   g survival, reproduction), our results show that restoration practices
   that include nurse plants can promote rich bird communities after only 5
   years from the implementation of restoration measures. (C) 2010 Elsevier
