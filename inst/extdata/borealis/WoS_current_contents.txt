Information is needed on the effects of pine savanna-woodland restoration on bird abundance to inform management decisions. We conducted point-count surveys for 19 bird species across the gradient of savanna, woodland, and forest in restored and non-restored areas throughout the Ozark-Ouachita Highlands in parts of Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma during the 2013-2015 breeding seasons. We estimated densities of 16 species using distance sampling to account for detection probability, and we determined relationships of bird abundance with management and vegetation variables by evaluating support for a priori models. Densities of early-successional and generalist species were positively related, and interior-forest species negatively related, to restoration. Densities of Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla), Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens), Pine Warbler (Setophaga pinus), Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor), Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus), and Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) were positively related to prescribed fire activity. Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera), Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa), and Yellow-breasted Chat densities were positively related to tree thinning. Many species had higher densities in areas with less canopy cover, tree density, and forest cover. Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), Black-and white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and Worm eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum) were negatively related to one or more aspects of restoration treatment and generally preferred areas with greater tree density and canopy cover. Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra) were abundant but density was not strongly related to management or vegetation variables. Restoration provided breeding habitat for disturbance-dependent species and woodland generalists, many of which are species of conservation concern, but canopy cover generally remained too great for species that require more open savanna.

Wildlife responses to severe fire disturbance in eastern ponderosa pine forests are not well understood. Our study investigates how cavity-nesting bird species in an eastern ponderosa pine forest are impacted by burn severity. The objectives of our study were to: (1) identify the community composition of cavity-nesting birds in a 27 y old burn of mixed severity, (2) assess how habitat variables important to cavity-nesting birds differ in the mixed-severity fire, and (3) determine what habitat variables best predict bird occurrence 27 y after mixed-severity fire. We surveyed 56 sites across four burn severity classes, ranging from unburned to severely burned forest, in the Pine Ridge region of Nebraska. We measured multiple habitat characteristics (tree and snag diameter at breast height (DBH), coarse woody debris (CIND), tree and snag density, shrub height, and shrub cover) in May-August 2016 and conducted bird count surveys between 25 May and 8 June 2016. Cavity-nesting bird species' occurrence varied among the burn severity variables. Burn severity class (unburned, low severity, moderate severity, high severity) was a significant predictor of habitat characteristics for cavity-nesting birds, including tree density, snag density, mean snag DBH, variance in DBH, and CWD, which also was the best indicator of cavity-nesting bird community composition. We report evidence that mixed-severity wildfires in eastern ponderosa pine forests create variation in habitat characteristics and cavity-nesting bird occurrence.

Cross-scale occupancy dynamics of a postfire specialist in response to variation across a fire regime	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	black-backed woodpecker, colonization, dynamic occupancy model, multiscale analysis, persistence, Picoides arcticus, wildfire	BLACK-BACKED WOODPECKER, CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS, BURNED FORESTS, METAPOPULATION PERSISTENCE, LANDSCAPE CONTEXT, BOREAL FOREST, SIERRA-NEVADA, WILDFIRE, SEVERITY, HABITAT	Fire creates challenges and opportunities for wildlife through rapid destruction, modification and creation of habitat. Fire has spatially variable effects on landscapes; however, for species that benefit from the ephemeral resource patches created by fire, it is critical to understand characteristics of fires that promote postfire colonization and persistence and the spatial scales on which they operate. Using a model postfire specialist, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), we examined how colonization and persistence varied across two spatial scales as a function of four characteristics of fire regimesfire severity, fire size, fire ignition date and number of years since fire. We modelled black-backed woodpecker colonization and persistence using data from 108 recently burned forests in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades ecoregions of California, USA, that we monitored for up to 10years following fire. We employed a novel, spatially hierarchical, dynamic occupancy framework which differentiates colonization and persistence at two spatial scales: across fires and within fires. We found strong effects of fire characteristics on dynamic rates, with colonization and persistence declining across both spatial scales with increasing years since fire. Additionally, at sites within fires, colonization decreased with fire size and increased with fire severity and for fires with later ignition dates. Our results support the notion that different aspects of a species' environment are important for population processes at different spatial scales. As habitat quality is ephemeral for any given postfire area, our results illustrate the importance of time since fire in structuring occupancy at the fire level, with other characteristics of fires playing larger roles in determining abundance within individual fires. Our results contribute to the broader understanding of how variation in fire characteristics influences the colonization and persistence of species using ephemeral habitats, which is necessary for conserving and promoting postfire biodiversity in the context of rapidly shifting fire regimes.

Our objective was to map abundance and provide a population estimate of black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains of South Dakota and Wyoming, USA. We conducted 3,666 and 3,384 5-minute point count surveys from late-March to late-June in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We characterized vegetation around each point using geographic information system-derived landscape variables and fit 3-level hierarchical time-removal models in R package unmarked using gmultmix. The global abundance model received the most support and included year, latitude, and percent area of green trees, beetle-killed trees, dead trees, 1- to 2-year-old wildfire, 3-year-old wildfire, and 4- to 5-year-old wildfire. Points with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees had the greatest density of black-backed woodpeckers, followed by 1- to 2-year-old wildfires. After 4 years, areas burned by wildfire supported lower densities of black-backed woodpeckers than undisturbed forests. Mean density was 0.528birds/km(2) in 2015 and 0.626birds/km(2) in 2016. There were an estimated 2,920 and 3,439 black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We suggest areas with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees may support high densities of black-backed woodpeckers and are important to sustaining populations when the availability of recent (<4 years old) wildfire is declining or scarce.

Interacting and non-linear avian responses to mixed-severity wildfire and time since fire	ECOSPHERE			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	distance sampling, disturbance, pyrodiversity, Sierra Nevada, succession	BREEDING BIRD POPULATIONS, BLACK-BACKED WOODPECKER, WESTERN UNITED-STATES, SIERRA-NEVADA, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, MODERATE-SEVERITY, CONIFER FORESTS, BURNED FORESTS, CLIMATE-CHANGE, PRONE FORESTS	Non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire may help explain how pyrodiversity promotes biodiversity in fire-adapted systems. We built on previous research on avian responses to fire by investigating how complex effects of bum severity and time since fire influenced avian community composition across the northern Sierra Nevada, California. We conducted avian point counts from 2009 to 2015 in 10 fires that burned between 2000 and 2014, resulting in a chronosequence of 1-15 yr post-fire. We estimated the effects of burn severity, time since fire, non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire, pre-fire forest conditions, and several physiographic parameters on the density of 44 breeding bird species using hierarchical distance sampling models. In addition, we fit separate models to observations of each species in unburned forest to compare species' densities between burned and unburned forests. At least one of the non-linear or interaction fire effects was significant for 27 (61%) of the 44 bird species. The quadratic effect of time since fire was an important predictor of post-fire densities of 20 species, illustrating the dynamic nature of this post-wildfire avian community. Greater maximum densities were estimated at some combination of burn severity and time since fire than in unburned forest for 13 of the 44 (30%) species, only one of which reached maximum density following low-severity fire. In contrast, all of the 12 species that were more abundant in unburned forest reached maximum post-fire densities in fires that burned at low severity. Results from the study suggest that consideration of the non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire is important to fully understanding post-wildfire responses for a majority of birds. Moreover, the study supports a growing body of literature that indicates mixed-severity fire is essential for conserving avian diversity in many fire-maintained systems.

Previous research has indicated that salvage logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species. In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following logging operations that covered 45% of the burned area. We systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year, which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed Woodpeckers postlogging.

We incidentally captured Eastern Spotted Skunks in snake traps during a study examining effects of woodland restoration on herpetofauna in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas. We used extensive habitat data collected at each trap site to determine potential characteristics of sites where Eastern Spotted Skunks were more likely to occur during summer. We recorded 18 Eastern Spotted Skunk captures in 10 of our 36 drift-fence traps. Capture rates of Eastern Spotted Skunks were 6 times greater and occupancy rates were 9 times greater in unmanaged, mature forests with a well-developed midstory than in frequently burned woodlands that lacked a midstory. Higher-occupancy rates were associated with greater total cover, greater cover of woody-understory vegetation, and sparse forb cover. Our data support those of previous studies that suggest Eastern Spotted Skunks occur in areas with dense cover, which may include mature forests with well-developed midstories.

This study examines the perception of forest management treatments of recreation users participating in various activities (hunting, hiking/backpacking, camping, off-highway vehicle riding, and canoeing/kayaking) in terms of scenic beauty and recreation satisfaction. We used photographic images to capture various forest management treatments of different intensity levels and times after treatments, and assessed users' perception of scenic beauty and recreation satisfaction. Results indicated variation among users participating in different recreation activities, but that good quality RCW habitats offered both higher scenic beauty and higher recreation satisfaction than poor quality habitats for most activity user groups. Finally, recreation satisfaction was statistically equal to perceived scenic beauty from both good and poor-quality RCW habitats for most of the activity user groups, thus suggesting the importance of scenic beauty of forest sites in determining recreation users' attainment of visit satisfaction. Findings conclude that forest sites developed as good quality RCW habitats in the present state also offer quality experience to recreation users, thus supporting multi-objective forestry practices in public forests.

The abundance, volume, size, and distribution of snags can affect wildlife communities and stand-level biological diversity. Characteristics such as the wood properties of different tree species, environmental conditions, and cause of tree death (e.g., insects, disease, senescence, wind, fire) can influence decomposition and subsequent use of snags by wildlife. The objectives of this study were to characterize decay patterns in jack pine (Pinus banksiana) snags that had been killed by prescribed fire, topping, and girdling and determine the effects of these treatments on subsequent snag use by subcortical insects and primary cavity-nesting birds. The prescribed fire, topping, and girdling treatments were implemented in 2003, 2004, and 2007, respectively; bird excavations were quantified in 2014 and insect activity was measured in 2016. One-way analysis of variance tests were used to examine any differences among treatments in snag characteristics, decay characteristics, past insect activity, and past use by birds. An information theoretic approach to model selection was then used to rank potential predictors of bird foraging activity and cavities. The topping treatment had unique decay characteristics relative to the other two treatments; topped snags had the highest levels of past insect colonization, were softer, and had higher proportions of loose bark remaining on the boles. Trees killed by prescribed fire had the greatest number of foraging excavations and cavities. Girdled snags had the lowest evidence of past insect colonization and showed different levels of decay and insect use at different vertical positions on the snag bole. Comparison of candidate models showed that a model containing treatment type alone was the highest ranked when predicting foraging by birds, while snag diameter was the highest ranked when predicting the presence of cavities. A model containing treatment and snag density was also a highly ranked for predicting cavity presence. Our findings suggest that different jack pine snag treatments result in unique decay trajectories that may influence snag use by an array of wildlife taxa. Our characterization of three snag creation treatments can also inform options for generating snags, depending on the desired outcome, when management for biological legacies and wildlife habitat is of interest within mixed pine forests of the Great Lakes region.

In this study, we addressed changes in local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers (Campephilus magellanicus) occupying three national parks of central-southern Chile. We compared the breeding and postbreeding abundance of woodpeckers during the 1990s with the present (2016) abundance (n = 4 years), and assessed the extent to which abundance was explained by forest type and quality of foraging habitat (as quantified through the plant senescence reflectance index; PSRI). Results show a distinctive temporal variation in woodpecker abundance at each park, with local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers declining by 42.2% in Conguillio National Park, but increasing by 34.3% in Nahuelbuta National Park. Woodpeckers responded to forest conditions within each park such that their abundance increased with high quality of foraging habitat, i. e., large PSRI values, and the presence of old-growth Monkey puzzle (Araucaria araucana) -Nothofagus pumilio mixed forest. Anecdotal evidence suggests that populations of woodpeckers in Conguillio National Park might have responded negatively to large-scale disturbances from recent forest fires affecting part of the forest area within park. Because stochastic events seemed to strongly mediate population changes, our findings suggest that regional conservation of Magellanic Woodpeckers requires expanding the current conservation area network in central-southern Chile.

Most restoration methods in this environment aim to emulate natural disturbances, and thereby promote the development of key ecological structures. However, research about forest ecosystem restoration is still in its infancy and the responses of many boreal species groups remain to be described. We established a large-scale field experiment to evaluate the short-term effects of two restoration treatments - prescribed burning and gap cutting involving the creation of dead wood - on breeding bird assemblages in boreal Sweden. We censused breeding birds using territory mapping during two years in forest stands subjected to the two restoration treatments, in untreated controls and in old-growth references (nature reserves) (n = 10 per treatment). Averaged over the two census years, we found 1145 territories of 36 bird species. Total bird species richness and abundance did not differ among treatments. However, prescribed burning led to clear changes in the structure of the bird assemblages. When dividing species according to four functional categorizations (migration, foraging, nesting and successional stage), we found that the abundance of long-distance migrants, ground breeders, strong cavity excavators and species preferring early-successional habitat was higher in burned stands than in untreated controls and gap-cut stands, as was the species richness of bark feeders and strong cavity excavators. In contrast, abundance of off-ground breeders and species richness of crown feeders were lower following prescribed burning than in the controls. The gap cutting treatment did not have any significant effects on the bird assemblages. Ecological restoration through prescribed burning can be a useful tool for the conservation of boreal forest birds, including the ecologically important strong cavity excavators (i.e. woodpeckers (Picidae)). Forest managers should therefore be encouraged to use prescribed burning as a restoration tool to quickly provide habitat for bird species adapted to natural disturbances in boreal forest.

To understand ongoing declines and plan for conservation, researchers need reliable estimates of adult survival and site fidelity. However, variation in adult survival and site fidelity within and among species is substantial and could have consequences for management. Estimates of adult survival are lacking for many bird species and ecoregions, including the Great Plains. In this field study, we used Cormack-Jolly-Sober mark-recapture models to analyze encounter histories of 17 species of birds captured with a 13-year systematic mist-netting effort in northeast Kansas. We estimated annual rates of apparent adult survival (01 and corrected for the probability of capture (p), and tested for effects of sex and breeding habitat guild. We present the first estimates of apparent survival for six species of songbirds, and the first estimates from the Great Plains for 13 species. Apparent survival tended to be higher for males than for females, and we found a sex effect on the probability of capture for one species. Unexpectedly, grassland- and shrubland-breeding species had higher estimates of apparent survival than forest-breeding species. Our results did not support the prevailing viewpoint that birds breeding in dynamic landscapes, such as frequently burned grasslands, should show lower apparent survival than species that breed in woody habitats. We demonstrate that habitat plays an important role in the survival and site fidelity of songbirds, and that regional differences in habitat structure could drive variation in demography. Understanding the drivers of true survival and site fidelity of songbirds will allow region-specific management for species of conservation concern.

Small mammals are an important ecosystem component in many terrestrial communities and depend on ground-level vegetation most commonly affected by prescribed fire. In this complex system of food and cover availability where easier access to food might compromise cover, and vice versa, it is imperative to study postfire habitat use by mice and other ground-dwelling wildlife. We evaluated effects of time since burn and vegetation type on Peromyscus spp. abundance in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem in Fort Bragg Military Installation, North Carolina, USA, during 2011 and 2012. We trapped in 5 vegetation types and captured 208 individual Peromyscus. Peromyscus abundance did not differ among 1, 2, and 3 years postburn upland pine vegetation types, although we noted a trend of decreasing abundance as time since burn increased; however, abundance was greater in the lowland hardwood vegetation type than in open areas (i.e., military drop zones). The lack of an effect of time since burn could be due to the short fire-return interval at the study site, which limited the time for postburn shifts in the composition of the understory from herbaceous to woody plant species. Therefore, we suggest future research in the longleaf pine ecosystem incorporate a wider time frame to assess short- and long-term effects of fire on small mammal populations.

Northern flickers only work when they have to: how individual traits, population size and landscape disturbances affect excavation rates of an ecosystem engineer	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology		CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS, BRITISH-COLUMBIA, CLUTCH SIZE, WOODPECKERS, COMMUNITIES, SELECTION, OUTBREAK, SURVIVAL, SITES, AVAILABILITY	Woodpeckers are considered ecosystem engineers because they excavate tree cavities which are used subsequently by many species of secondary cavity nesters for breeding. Woodpeckers have the choice of excavating a new hole or reusing an existing one, and this propensity to excavate (e) may affect community dynamics but has rarely been investigated. Using 18 years of data on a population of northern flickers Colaptes auratus, I tested six hypotheses to explain the propensity to excavate (e) in a landscape which experienced two types of disturbance: pine beetles and wildfires. Woodpecker age, breeding experience and mate retention had little influence on e which varied between 13-39% annually and averaged 23% for 1843 first nests over the 18 yr. Body size and body condition of males and females were not associated with e but rates of excavation declined seasonally, suggesting time rather than energy costs limited excavation effort. Reduced cavity availability mediated through high conspecific density coupled with wildfires triggered relatively high excavation rates, up to 39% but e decreased to baseline levels three years after the landscape disturbances. Nearly 2/3 of males did not excavate in their lifetime but apparently, e is great enough to balance the average rate of cavity tree loss in this forest which is 11% annually. Excavation propensity in flickers is flexible, but the birds reduce their work levels if there is a surplus of holes available.

However, the quantity and quality of these structural attributes in old forest stands are likely to be influenced by important latitudinal changes in tree species composition and productivity from the southern boreal mixed to the northern coniferous forests. We measured habitat occupancy of cavity and bark nesting birds in old forests when the boreal forest landscape shifts from a mixed to a dominant coniferous matrix in the Clay Belt of Quebec and Ontario, a region where paludification dominates. Using playback calls, songs, and recent woodpeckers' foraging signs on trees, we measured the occurrence and foraging habitat use of 11 bird species associated with deadwood in 86 unmanaged forest stands along a forest age gradient in both mixed and coniferous stands. In coniferous stands dominated by black spruce, deadwood birds showed a modal distribution in response to the aging of black spruce forests that reached a peak in stands of 160 years and then declined. Unproductive paludified stands, which made up more than 40% of our study area, were associated with a significantly lower species richness of deadwood birds. At the opposite, although they represented less than 4% of the forest cover in our study area, old boreal mixedwood forests (>90 years) were highly utilized habitats by deadwood birds. Structural diversity of trees (diversity of degradation stages and diameter of trees) was the variable that best explained species richness of this functional group of birds whereas at the individual species level, the quantity and quality of dead trees (degradation and size) in stands best explained species occurrence and abundance of foraging signs. Conservation efforts for deadwood birds should focus on old productive stands of both mixed and coniferous composition. However, our study pinpoints old mixed wood stand as habitats of special concern given their disproportionate importance for deadwood birds in northern boreal forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ACCOMMODATING MIXED-SEVERITY FIRE TO RESTORE AND MAINTAIN ECOSYSTEM INTEGRITY WITH A FOCUS ON THE SIERRA NEVADA OF CALIFORNIA, USA	FIRE ECOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	coarse filter, ecosystem integrity, fine filter, focal species, mixed-severity fire, pyrodiversity, Sierra Nevada, species of conservation concern	BLACK-BACKED WOODPECKERS, WILDLAND-URBAN INTERFACE, CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS, OWL SITE OCCUPANCY, HOME-RANGE SIZE, SPOTTED OWL, HABITAT SELECTION, BURNED FORESTS, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, EVERGREEN FOREST	Existing fire policy encourages the maintenance of ecosystem integrity in fire management, yet this is difficult to implement on lands managed for competing economic, human safety, and air quality concerns. We discuss a fire management approach in the mid-elevations of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, that may exemplify similar challenges in other fire-adapted regions of the western USA. We also discuss how managing for pyrodiversity through mixed-severity fires can promote ecosystem integrity in Sierran mixed conifer and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws) forests. To illustrate, we show how coarse-filter (landscape-level) and complementary fine-filter (species-level) approaches can enhance forest management and conservation biology objectives as related to wildfire management. At the coarse-filter level, pyrodiverse mixed-severity fires provide landscape heterogeneity. Species and ecosystem characteristics associated with pyrodiversity can be maintained or enhanced by accommodating moderately severe fires, which hasten restoration by recreating a complex vegetation mosaic otherwise at risk from suppression. At the fine-filter level, managers can select focal species and species of conservation concern based on the degree to which those species depend on fire and accommodate their specific conservation needs. The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus [Swainson, 1832]) is an ideal focal species for monitoring the ecological integrity of forests restored through mixed-severity fire, and the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis [Xantus de Vesey, 1860]) is a species of conservation concern that uses post-fire habitat mosaics and is particularly vulnerable to logging. We suggest a comprehensive approach that integrates wildland fire for ecosystem integrity and species viability with strategic deployment of fire suppression and ecologically based restoration of pyrodiverse landscapes. Our approach would accomplish fire management goals while simultaneously maintaining biodiversity.

We used a coupled human and natural systems framework and an agent-based landscape model to examine how alternative management scenarios affect fire and ecosystem services metrics in a fire-prone multiownership landscape in the eastern Cascades of Oregon. Our model incorporated existing models of vegetation succession and fire spread and information from original empirical studies of landowner decision making. Our findings indicate that alternative management strategies can have variable effects on landscape outcomes over 50 years for fire, socioeconomic, and ecosystem services metrics. For example, scenarios with federal restoration treatments had slightly less high-severity fire than a scenario without treatment; exposure of homes in the wildland-urban interface to fire was also slightly less with restoration treatments compared to no management. Treatments appeared to be more effective at reducing high-severity fire in years with more fire than in years with less fire. Under the current management scenario, timber production could be maintained for at least 50 years on federal lands. Under an accelerated restoration scenario, timber production fell because of a shortage of areas meeting current stand structure treatment targets. Trade-offs between restoration outcomes (e.g., open forests with large fire-resistant trees) and habitat for species that require dense older forests were evident. For example, the proportional area of nesting habitat for northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) was somewhat less after 50 years under the restoration scenarios than under no management. However, the amount of resilient older forest structure and habitat for white-headed woodpecker (Leuconotopicus albolarvatus) was higher after 50 years under active management. More carbon was stored on this landscape without management than with management, despite the occurrence of high-severity wildfire. Our results and further applications of the model could be used in collaborative settings to facilitate discussion and development of policies and practices for fire-prone landscapes.

Habitat suitability models for nesting woodpeckers can be informative, but tests of model transferability are needed to understand how broadly models developed at one location can be applied to inform post-fire forest management at other locations. We developed habitat suitability models and tested their transferability for 2 disturbance-associated woodpecker species, Black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and Lewis's (Melanerpes lewis) woodpecker. Habitat suitability models consisted of weighted logistic regression models comparing environmental conditions at nest versus non-nest sites. We developed models at each of 3 wildfire locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, and then examined predictive performance for each model at alternate ("application") locations. Models generally discriminated nest from non-nest sites well at locations where they were developed but performance was variable at application locations, indicating limited transferability. Models for Black-backed Woodpecker and those that included field-collected environmental covariates exhibited greater transferability than models for Lewis's Woodpecker and those that only included remotely sensed covariates. Transferability was also generally poor between Oregon and the other 2 locations. Limitations to model transferability observed in this study suggest models developed at any one wildfire location are unlikely to be generally applicable across the entire range of Black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers. Generally applicable models to inform post-fire forest management will therefore likely require integration of data from multiple wildfire locations.

Such analysis is particularly powerful when applied to multiple pairs of hybridizing species, as patterns of genomic differentiation can then be related to age of the hybridizing species, providing a view into the build-up of differentiation over time. We examined 33 809 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three hybridizing woodpecker species: Red-breasted, Red-naped and Yellow-bellied sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus ruber, Sphyrapicus nuchalis and Sphyrapicus varius), two of which (ruber and nuchalis) are much more closely related than each is to the third (varius). To identify positions of SNPs on chromosomes, we developed a localization method based on comparative genomics. We found narrow clines, bimodal distributions of hybrid indices and genomic regions with decreased rates of introgression. These results suggest moderately strong reproductive isolation among species and selection against specific hybrid genotypes. We found 19 small regions of strong differentiation between species, partly shared among species pairs, but no large regions of differentiation. An association analysis revealed a single strong-effect candidate locus associated with plumage, possibly explaining mismatch among the three species in genomic relatedness and plumage similarity. Our comparative analysis of species pairs of different age and their hybrid zones showed that moderately strong reproductive isolation can occur with little genomic differentiation, but that reproductive isolation is incomplete even with much greater genomic differentiation, implying there are long periods of time when hybridization is possible if diverging populations are in geographic contact.

Nest sites selection by sympatric cavity-nesting birds in miombo woodlands	KOEDOE			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology		ADAPTIVE CAPACITY, MONTANE FORESTS, MANAGEMENT, CONSERVATION, COMMUNITY, ABUNDANCE, SUSTAINABILITY, WOODPECKERS, COMPETITORS, DIVERSITY	Deforestation and habitat fragmentation have long been known as drivers of wildlife depletion but information on their specific impacts on cavity-nesting birds in the miombo woodlands has been lacking. A comparative study of disturbed and undisturbed sites was conducted in miombo woodlands of Zambia to assess impacts of environmental stressors on birds. Foot patrols were employed to locate, identify and count host trees and cavities for cavity-nesting birds on twenty 200 m x 200 m sample plots. Undisturbed forests had three times more cavities (the nesting sites for birds), while there were 24.6% fewer abandoned cavities in undisturbed forests than in disturbed forests. The rate of cavity abandonment was about twice as high in human-dominated forests compared to undisturbed forests (61.3% c.f. 31.9%). Cavity-nesting birds preferred larger (> 36.1) cm diameter at breast height) and taller (> 5.0 m) trees for nest placement, especially in human-dominated forests. A number of cavity-nesting birds preferred Prochystegia spicifin-mis (zebrawood), trilbernattia paniculata (munsa), Parinari caratelltiMia (mobola-plum) and Uaraca kirkiana (mahobohobo) as host trees to 14 other miombo tree species. Arnot's Chat (Myrmecocichla arnoti) had a wider selection of host trees for cavity-nesting than the other 40 cavity-nesting birds in the study areas. Anthropogenic activities such as uncontrolled firewood collection, wild fires, logging, and land clearing for agriculture negatively influenced wood abundance and diversity, with potential implications for persistence of cavity-nesting birds. The negative impacts of anthropogenic activities could be counteracted by conservation strategies such as implementation of sound forest policies, integrative land use practices, sustainable livelihood security and stakeholders' awareness of the need to safeguard forest-dependent avifauna.

An integrated occupancy and space-usemodel to predict abundance of imperfectly detected, territorial vertebrates	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	Bayesian, Black-backed Woodpecker, density, home range, Picoides arcticus, population size, wildlife habitat model	BLACK-BACKED WOODPECKERS, HOME-RANGE SIZE, HABITAT, MODELS, DENSITY, POPULATIONS, HUMMINGBIRDS, COMPETITION, TELEMETRY, DYNAMICS	1. It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes.2. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory.3. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires.4. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal.

These metrics represent critical habitat components for various wildlife species of conservation concern, including the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), which is strongly associated with recently burned conifer forest. We assessed the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) to detect and characterize conifer snags and identify Black-backed Woodpecker habitat using previously derived empirical thresholds of conifer snag basal area. Over the footprint of the Rim Fire, a megafire that extended (similar to 104,000 ha) through a heterogeneous mosaic of conifer forests, oak woodlands, and meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, we identified conifer snags and estimated their basal area from single-tree ALS-derived metrics using Gaussian processes in four major steps. First, individual trees were mapped using the Watershed Segmentation algorithm, resulting in 87% detection of trees with stem diameter larger than 30 cm. Second, the snag/live classification model identified snags with an overall accuracy of 91.8%, using the coefficient of variation of height and intensity together with maximum intensity and fractional cover as the most relevant metrics. Third, the conifer/hardwood snag classification model utilizing the maximum height, median height, minimum intensity, and area metrics separated snag forest types with an overall accuracy of 84.8%. Finally, a Gaussian process regression model reliably estimated conifer snag stem diameter (R-2 = 0.81) using height and crown area, thus significantly outperforming regionally calibrated conifer-specific allometric equations. As a result,-80% of the snag basal area have been mapped. Optimal and potential habitat for Black-backed Woodpecker comprise 53.7 km(2) and 58.4 km(2), respectively, representing 5.1 and 5.6% of the footprint of the Rim Fire. Our study illustrates the utility of high-density ALS data for characterizing recently burned forests, which, in conjunction with information about the habitat needs of particular snag-dependent wildlife species, can be used to assess habitat characteristics, and thus contribute greatly to forest management and biodiversity conservation.

Foraging plasticity by a keystone excavator, the white-headed woodpecker, in managed forests: Are there consequences for productivity?	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences	Forage site selection, Nest productivity, Picoides albolarvatus, Pinus ponderosa, Ponderosa pine	OPPORTUNISTIC BREEDER, LOXIA-CURVIROSTRA, EASTERN CASCADES, RED CROSSBILL, NEST SURVIVAL, DRY FORESTS, RESTORATION, PHYLOGENY, SELECTION, BEHAVIOR	Information on the foraging ecology of animals is important for conservation and management, particularly for keystone species whose presence affects ecosystem health. We examined foraging by an at-risk cavity excavator, the white-headed woodpecker (Picoides albolarvatus). The foraging needs of this species are used to inform management of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in some areas of western North America. Past observational studies indicated that white-headed woodpeckers forage predominately on cones and trunks of large-diameter (>68 cm) pines in old-growth stands, although habitat selection while foraging has not been formally examined. We used radio telemetry to track forage substrate use among 37 adult, breeding woodpeckers for 176 h (10,576 min) in forest stands that had been recently thinned and/or burned with prescribed fire. We used discrete choice models to examine forage site selection and multinomial regression to examine consequences of foraging on nest productivity. Woodpeckers foraged on more than ten individual substrates and switched substrates seasonally, presumably to take advantage of prey availability. Dead wood and fir foliage were used commonly in the nesting period (86% and 68% of foraging, respectively), whereas pine foliage and trunk foraging dominated in the fledgling (66% of foraging) and post-fledgling periods (73% of foraging). Average size of used trees was 49 cm (+/- 20 cm) and pine cones were rarely used (4% of foraging). During the nesting period, substrate use (chi(2) = 1.49, df = 4, P = 0.83) and distances traveled from nests for foraging did not affect productivity (F-(3,F-16) = 0.61, P = 0.62), which was high even for birds with the longest (2.1 km) and shortest (0.39 km) maximum forage distances. Habitats selected for foraging matched substrate use, and woodpeckers selected areas with low basal areas of live trees in the nesting period, but high basal areas in the post-nesting period. The variable foraging that we observed suggests that white-headed woodpeckers are plastic in their foraging in managed forests, and this plasticity has no negative consequences for productivity.

First, many plant and animal species use, and have sometimes evolved to depend on, severely burned forest conditions for their persistence. Second, evidence from fire history studies also suggests that a complex mosaic of severely burned conifer patches was common historically in the West. Third, to maintain ecological integrity in forests born of mixed-severity fire, land managers will have to accept some severe fire and maintain the integrity of its aftermath. Lastly, public education messages surrounding fire could be modified so that people better understand and support management designed to maintain ecologically appropriate sizes and distributions of severe fire and the complex early-seral forest conditions it creates.

Past studies have focused on nest site selection and survival but information is needed on factors influencing their space use when away from the nest. We examined space use by white-headed woodpeckers during the nesting (May-Jul) and post-nesting (Jul-Oct) periods and compared the role of environmental factors (e.g., landcover) and socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, breeding success) in home range size and selection of location. Average size of 99% kernel home ranges was 125ha (SD +/- 59ha; n=19) in the nesting period and 137ha (SD +/- 70ha; n=30) in the post-nesting period. Minimum convex polygons were generally comparable to or smaller than ranges reported from previous radio-telemetry studies with this species. Although bird weight and age best explained variation in home range size compared to other factors, neither parameter estimate was significant in our models. Thus, even though weight and age were the most-supported factors in our analysis, home range size was largely influenced by factors that we did not measure. We found that most woodpeckers selected home ranges within forest patches that had undergone a recent disturbance; these areas included forests that had recently been burned with prescribed fire by the United States Forest Service (82%) or subject to disease (16%). Most burned patches in our study were small (approx. 4.8ha) and occurred within otherwise live forest but had nearly complete mortality of adult trees. We suggest that recent forest disturbances, especially mixed-severity prescribed burns, may have been selected by white-headed woodpeckers because they created snags for nesting and future studies should explore this hypothesis. Because home range size was variable and not linked with productivity, it should not be used as an indication of habitat quality without more detailed studies on causal factors that affect space use in this species.

We used repeated call-response surveys to study brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla) patch occupancy at the current limits of its apparently expanding range in an area with active habitat restoration. We fit a probit occupancy model that accounted for spatial autocorrelation using restricted spatial regression. Nuthatch occupancy was related to patch-level vegetation structure and range-extension context, i.e., latitude, but not prescribed fire history. Latitude and percent tree stocking had a negative relationship with occupancy (coefficients and 95% credible intervals: -1.07 [CI: -1.63, -0.67] and -0.63 [CI: -0.97, -0.350]). The density of recently killed and well-decayed snags had positive associations with occupancy (coefficients and 95% credible intervals: 0.57 [CI: 0.17, 1.16] and 0.37 [CI: 0.05, 0.72]). Neither grassy herbaceous cover nor percent of stocking in pine were associated with occupancy. We found that restoration efforts created suitable stand structure for brown-headed nuthatches, but many restored sites in the range-extension zone appeared to be vacant. Occupied habitats in the range-extension zone had fewer snags, less frequent fire, and more shrub cover than occupied sites where the species was established. Release from conspecific competition may have permitted nuthatches in the range-extension zone to exploit habitats that would otherwise have been marginal. Alternatively, nuthatches may be restricted to such sites although there are more suitable sites tens of kilometers away. Experimental translocations and reintroductions could determine how habitat structure and nuthatch density affect the quality of restored sites in the range-extension zone and enable those sites to achieve their biodiversity potential.

However, data from remote sensing sources are often used alone as predictors in modelling distributions. Such data will only produce accurate models if features that are distinguishable by remote sensing are a good match to the environmental traits that delineate habitat requirements. Both the Goldcrest Regulus regulus and the Firecrest Regulus ignicapilla respond to complex features of habitats that are not described by simple remote sensing data. We tested the usefulness of remote sensing data as a predictor for two Regulus species according to data from 970 study plots sized 1 x 1 km. Predictors were aggregated using the PCAs and related to the Hayne estimator of species density using GAMs. The models based on both remote sensing data and detailed environmental data proved to be better than the model based only on remote sensing data and/or detailed forest structure data. The Goldcrest reached the highest density in areas with a high share of old spruce-dominated forests with a substantial share of the fir, avoiding the pine, and it preferred forests with a low number of tree species. In turn, the Firecrest favoured old forests, dominated by the spruce and the beech, with an admixture of single old fir and larch trees, avoiding the pine, and preferring forests with a high number of tree species. We suggest using not only free data sources, but also more detailed data containing thorough information on forest inventory derived from ground measurements.

Whereas recent nest web studies greatly increased our understanding of nest tree use by woodpeckers, knowledge on woodpeckers foraging requirements is much less developed. We quantified and compared tree selection patterns and foraging behavior of six bark-foraging woodpeckers downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), American three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyropicus varius) and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) that co-occur in eastern boreal forests of North America. A total of 271 observation bouts and more than 600 foraging trees were recorded at three study sites characterized as mixedwood, conifer, and burn. Our results show that dead wood represents an important foraging substrate for most bark-foraging woodpeckers in Canadian eastern boreal forests. However, significant differences in individual species were found with regard to substrate use patterns, foraging behavior and associated prey. Woodpeckers were categorized according to their selection for specific stages of tree degradation, with the yellow-bellied sapsucker and the pileated woodpecker representing opposite ends of this gradient. The black-backed woodpecker showed the highest use of dead wood and was very specific in its tree selection by using mostly recently dead trees. We emphasize that providing foraging substrates for most woodpecker species not only requires maintaining dead wood but also paying heed to the underlying dynamics of dead wood (e.g. recruitment and degradation) in managed boreal forest landscapes.

The relative importance of multiscale factors in the distribution of Bachman's Sparrow and the implications for ecosystem conservation	CONDOR			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	Bachman's Sparrow, dispersal, fire, fragmentation, herbaceous cover, landscape, patch	RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER, AKAIKES INFORMATION CRITERION, LONGLEAF PINE ECOSYSTEM, PRESCRIBED FIRE, FOREST FRAGMENTATION, BREEDING BIRDS, HOME-RANGE, HABITAT, RESTORATION, MANAGEMENT	Recent research has shown that landscape-level changes, namely habitat loss and fragmentation, can play an important role in determining the distribution of species across a variety of ecological systems. However, the influence of these large-scale factors in relation to small-scale factors, such as local vegetation structure or composition, is poorly understood. We used Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) as a surrogate species to measure the relative importance of local vegetation and large-scale habitat distribution in the Onslow Bight region of North Carolina, USA. We conducted repeated point counts at 232 points within 111 habitat patches between April 10 and July 20, 2011. We then fit a series of single-season occupancy models, including both local and landscape-level predictors, to identify those that best explained the distribution of Bachman's Sparrows. We documented a strong response to vegetation characteristics best maintained via prescribed fire, but the most influential predictor of Bachman's Sparrow occupancy was the amount of habitat within 3 km. Specifically, the probability of Bachman's Sparrow occurrence was close to zero in landscapes comprised of <10% habitat, regardless of local vegetation conditions. Our results illustrate the strong influence of habitat loss on Bachman's Sparrow and likely on other members of this community, many of which are of high conservation concern.

Apparent foraging success reflects habitat quality in an irruptive species, the Black-backed Woodpecker	CONDOR			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	bark beetles, disturbance, ephemeral habitat, foraging, wood-boring beetles	MOUNTAIN PINE-BEETLE, SOUTH-DAKOTA, PICOIDES-ARCTICUS, BIRD COMMUNITIES, PONDEROSA PINE, NORTH-AMERICA, BOREAL FOREST, FIRE, HILLS, PATTERNS	Dramatic fluctuations in food resources are a key feature of many habitats, and many species have evolved a movement strategy to exploit food resources that are unpredictable in space and time. The availability of food resources may be a particularly strong determinant of habitat quality for irruptive bird species. We studied the apparent foraging success of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), an irruptive species that responds opportunistically to pulsed food resources in burned forests and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations. Prior investigations revealed that the highest population growth rates of Black-backed Woodpeckers occurred in habitat created by summer wildfire, with intermediate population growth rates in MPB infestations, and the lowest population growth rates in habitats created by prescribed fire in fall. We tested whether apparent foraging success was associated with known habitat quality in order to assess the potential for food availability to regulate population growth. We counted the number of successfully captured wood-boring beetle larvae and "small'' prey on each tree that a Black-backed Woodpecker used for foraging and modeled these counts as a function of habitat, tree diameter, number of years postfire, and tree disturbance category. Total apparent foraging success (the sum of observed captures of wood-boring beetle larvae and small prey per tree) did not vary across habitats, but woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by summer wildfire were expected to capture 2.2 and 2.0 times more wood-boring beetles than woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations, respectively. These results suggest that the availability of food resources may contribute to population regulation in this irruptive species. Furthermore, population growth in irruptive species may be highly sensitive to the availability of preferred food resources. Forests recently burned by summer wildfires provide relatively abundant food resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers and represent high-quality habitat for this species of conservation concern.

Consequences of habitat change and resource selection specialization for population limitation in cavity-nesting birds	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	cavity-nesting, climate change, habitat change, habitat selection, nest-site limitation, Paridae, population limitation, Troglodytes, ungulate browsing, woodpeckers	BRITISH-COLUMBIA, CLIMATE, ASPEN, EXTINCTION, IMPACTS, FRAGMENTATION, SUCCESS, FORESTS, FIRE, ELK	1. Resource selection specialization may increase vulnerability of populations to environmental change. One environmental change that may negatively impact some populations is the broad decline of quaking aspen Populus tremuloides, a preferred nest tree of cavity-nesting organisms who are commonly limited by nest-site availability. However, the long-term consequences of this habitat change for cavity-nesting bird populations are poorly studied.2. I counted densities of woody plants and eight cavity-nesting bird species over 29 years in 15 high-elevation riparian drainages in Arizona, USA. I also studied nest-tree use and specialization over time based on 4946 nests across species.3. Aspen suffered a severe decline in availability over time, while understorey woody plants and canopy deciduous trees also declined. The decline of plants resulted from increased elk Cervus canadensis browsing linked to declining snowfall.4. Woodpeckers exhibited very high specialization (>95% of nests) on aspen for nesting, and densities of all six species declined with aspen over time. Mountain chickadees Poecile gambeli and house wrens Troglodytes aedon exhibited increasingly less specialization on aspen. Chickadees strongly increased in density over time, despite a relatively high specialization on aspen. House wren densities declined moderately over time, but nest-box addition experiments demonstrated that nest-site availability was not limiting their population. House wren densities increased with understorey vegetation recovery in elk exclosures via increased generality of nest-site use, demonstrating that the decline in understorey vegetation on the broader landscape was the cause of their population decline.5. Synthesis and applications. Management should target species that specialize in resource selection on a declining resource. Species with greater resource selection generalization can reduce population impacts of environmental change. Resource generalization can allow a species like the wren to take advantage of habitat refuges, such as those provided by the elk exclosures. Yet, resource generalization cannot offset the negative impacts of broad-scale declines in habitat quality on the landscape, as demonstrated by the general decline of wrens. Ultimately, aspen is an important habitat for biodiversity, and land management programmes that protect and aid recovery of aspen habitats may be critical.

Avian Occupancy Varies With Habitat Structure in Oak Savanna of the South-Central United States	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	birds, canopy cover, Cross Timbers, oak savanna, occupancy, tree density	AKAIKES-INFORMATION-CRITERION, EASTERN NORTH-AMERICA, TALLGRASS PRAIRIE, BIRD COMMUNITIES, FIRE FREQUENCY, CROSS TIMBERS, POPULATIONS, DISTURBANCE, GRADIENT, CONSERVATION	Oak savanna, once widespread across central North America, has functionally vanished from most of its range because of land conversion or fire suppression, but much oak savanna remains in the Cross Timbers ecoregion of the south-central United States. We quantified avian habitat associations across a gradient from open oak savanna to woodland, to closed canopy forest in the Cross Timbers of southeastern Kansas. We surveyed breeding bird species in 2012 and 2013 and modeled species-specific occupancy in relation to habitat variables. Several species, including the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus), downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), Bewick's wren (Thryomanes bewickii), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), dickcissel (Spiza americana), and orchard oriole (Icterus spurius) were associated with lower levels of tree density or canopy cover (i.e., savanna-woodland). Species associated with greater levels of tree density or canopy cover at some spatial scale included eastern wood-pewee (Contopus virens), white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), and indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea). Occupancy of eastern wood-pewee and blue grosbeak (Passerina caerulea) were highest at intermediate levels of canopy cover (50-m radius) and tree density, respectively. Occupancies of eastern wood-pewee, northern mockingbird, lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus), indigo bunting, and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were variously related to shrub density, which was unrelated to tree cover or density across the savanna-forest gradient. We expect the savanna-associated species would benefit from reduction in tree density to savanna-like habitat (tree canopy cover 25%) within forests that were formerly savanna.

The present study was conducted in central Quebec within coniferous forests shaped largely by timber harvest and wildfire. The objectives were to compare the age composition of breeding black-backed woodpeckers, nest survival rate and productivity in both disturbed and undisturbed habitats (respectively recently burned and unburned habitats). In addition, we evaluated the general productivity of both habitat types in a simulated boreal landscape. There was a positive relationship between nest age and daily survival rates. Older woodpeckers were the most abundant breeders in unburned habitats and younger birds in one-year-old burns. Although nests in recently burned forests produced more nestlings per successful nest, our simulation of a boreal forest landscape showed that unburned habitat produced about two-thirds more fledglings per year than burned habitat. Globally, unburned habitat may provide woodpeckers more temporally stable resources. Population dynamics of the black-backed woodpecker, at least in our study area, may be explained by resource pulse interactions where populations benefit opportunistically from short-term high-quality habitat, and rely on unburned habitats for long-term persistence.

It also inhabits green forest but little is known about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas, especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011 -2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since 1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects, number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest, and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05 and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in efforts to conserve this rare species.

I developed a conceptual model explaining the persistence of cavity-nesting birds on the landscape after fires depending on carrying capacity (food supply) of the habitat and the philopatry and territoriality of the species. The breeding density, nest site characteristics, and reproductive success of Northern Flickers Colaptes auratus was studied before and after low-to moderate-severity fires on replicated plots. The density and spatial distribution of nests did not change in a consistent way after fires, but the rates of cavity excavation increased and characteristics of nest sites changed as such decay class of the tree. Laying dates were delayed and clutches were smaller in freshly excavated vs. reused cavities on the burned sites. Breeding philopatry caused a shift to older age classes in the population. Depredation of nests by small mammals increased during the first three years after fires, reducing the number of young produced per nest attempt on burned plots. The study shows that, even when fire does not reduce the density of breeding pairs, there may be detrimental effects detected only by monitoring the behavior and reproduction of individuals.

Thus, the spatial configuration of resources within home ranges should influence bird movements, and resource values should be relative to their locations. We radio-tracked 22 Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) and related their space use and home range sizes to available resources while taking nest site locations into account. We developed utilization distributions (UDs) from nuthatch locations, and treated the area of each 95% isopleth as home range size and the height of the UD as relative probability of use. We fit models relating home range size to mean resource measures within home ranges, and used lognormal regression to relate intensity of use to resource metrics at random points by ranking linear mixed models. Nuthatch home ranges typically had two centers of activity. Areas of high use were associated with the density of recently killed snags (likely a foraging resource), recent prescribed fire, pine dominance, low tree stocking rates, and grassy herbaceous cover. Home ranges were generally large (median: 7.1 ha; range: 0.3-47.6 ha), and smaller home range sizes were associated with pine dominance and higher nest snag density. Predicted home range sizes decreased by 77% and 69%, respectively, when percent pine and nest snag density were maximized. Our results illustrate that movement decisions within home ranges are driven by both the availability and spatial distribution of resources, while ongoing savannah-woodland management is providing resources that are used by Brown-headed Nuthatches.

We reviewed studies examining wildlife responses to MPB outbreaks and postoutbreak salvage logging to inform forest management and guide future research. Our review included 16 studies describing MPB outbreak relationships with 89 bird species and 6 studies describing relationships with 11 mammalian species, but no studies of reptiles or amphibians. We included studies that compared wildlife response metrics temporally (before versus after the outbreak) and spatially (across sites that varied in severity of outbreak) in relation to beetle outbreaks. Outbreaks ranged in size from 20,600 to >= 10(7) ha and studies occurred 1-30 years after the peak MPB outbreak, but most studies were conducted over the short-term (i.e., <= 6 years after the peak of MPB-induced tree mortality). Birds were the only taxa studied frequently; however, high variability existed among those studies to allow many inferences, although some patterns were evident. Avian studies concluded that cavity-nesting species responded more favorably to beetle-killed forests than species with open-cup nests, and species nesting in the shrub layer favored outbreak forests compared with ground and open-cup canopy nesters that generally showed mixed relationships. Bark-drilling species as a group clearly demonstrated a positive short-term association with MPB epidemics compared with that of other foraging assemblages. Cavity-nesting birds that do not consume bark beetles (i.e., secondary cavity-nesting species and nonbark-drilling woodpeckers) also exhibited some positive responses to MPB outbreaks, although not as pronounced or consistent as those of bark-drilling woodpeckers. Mammalian responses to MPB outbreaks were mixed. Studies consistently reported negative effects of MPB outbreaks on red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). However, there is evidence that red squirrels can persist after an outbreak under some conditions, e.g., when nonhost tree species are present. For small mammal species associated with forest understories, responses may be most pronounced during the postepidemic period (>6 years after the peak of beetle-induced tree mortality) when snags fall to produce coarse woody debris. Postoutbreak salvage logging studies (n = 6) reported results that lacked consensus. Postoutbreak salvage logging may have an impact on fewer wildlife species than postfire salvage logging, probably because only host-specific tree species are removed after beetle outbreaks.

Such species are frequently targeted for reduction or eradication to further conservation or restoration of biological diversity because the dominant paradigm in restoration of fire-dependent communities is to reduce the dominance or eliminate fire-intolerant invaders. To explore this paradigm, we examined the role of oaks (Quercus spp.) within fired-dependent upland and sandhill longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems of the southeastern United States. These pine-oak ecosystems have among the highest levels of biodiversity in the temperate zone. This diversity is inextricably linked to a frequent fire regime and includes many species readily top-killed by fire, particularly oaks, which were common in the early settlement landscape. In examining the diversity of oak species found within longleaf pine ecosystems, we identify a group of pyrophytic oaks and show that these oaks are critical components of sandhill and other longleaf pine ecosystems, and their occurrence should be considered as part of conservation and restoration goals.

Space-use and habitat associations of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) occupying recently disturbed forests in the Black Hills, South Dakota	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences	Bark beetles, Mountain pine beetle, Prescribed fire, Resource selection, Wildfire	MOUNTAIN PINE-BEETLE, HOME-RANGE SIZE, PONDEROSA PINE, RESOURCE SELECTION, BOREAL FOREST, BIRD COMMUNITIES, CONIFER FORESTS, BURNED FORESTS, FIRE SEVERITY, SIERRA-NEVADA	Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a disturbance-dependent species that occupy recently burned forest and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of disturbed forest may lead to habitat loss for Black-backed Woodpeckers, which have recently been petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act. We studied home range size and resource selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers occupying habitat created by summer wildfire, fall prescribed fire, and MPB infestations in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We studied home range size and resource selection by attaching radio-transmitters to adult Black-backed Woodpeckers. We estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n = 28 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 19 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian framework (n = 5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 16 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 8 in habitat created by MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat (mean home range size = 79 ha) and 2-year post fall prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size = 143 ha). Home range size was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size = 307 ha) and was greatest in 3-4 year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home range size = 430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size = 460 ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200 ha by exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in summer wildfires <200 ha and retaining at least 50% of summer wildfires >400 ha. Ideally, recently burned forest patches should be composed of >= 27 m(2) basal area/ha of trees that burned at moderate or high severity, with at least 40% of the basal area composed of trees >= 27 cm DBH.

Fire suppression, in particular, has facilitated encroachment by non-fire-tolerant trees and heavy litter buildup, leading to shifts in the native plant and animal community. In 2001, efforts were initiated to re-establish parts of Berry College's (Floyd County, GA) fire-suppressed mountain longleaf pine forest using combinations of prescribed fire, clear-cutting, planting, and herbicide application. We designed this study to determine the effects of management practices thus far on vegetation structure and the bird community. In 2009, vegetation structure data were collected in longleaf pine stands comprising three management classes ranging from low-to high-intensity management. Bird surveys were conducted from summer 2009 to spring 2010, and avifaunal community structure was related to vegetative characteristics within each stand. Unmanaged stands were strongly associated with common omnivorous, ground-foraging, and canopy-nesting birds of mixed woodlands. Intermediately managed stands contained mostly birds of mixed diet and aerial-and bark-feeding cavity nesters. Heavily managed stands were strongly associated with insect-, vertebrate-, seed-, and fruit-eating ground and shrub nesters, with several sightings of the near-threatened Bachman's sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis Lichtenstein). Intensity of management was positively correlated with canopy openness, understory development, and low litter levels. These vegetative differences helped explain the bird community makeup. We provide baseline data for assessing the impacts of management of mountain longleaf pine and similarly fire-suppressed forests on avian abundance and species richness.

Ensemble modeling to predict habitat suitability for a large-scale disturbance specialist	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	Black-backed Woodpeckers, forested habitat management, habitat suitability models, Mahalanobis D-2 models, Maxent models, model prediction in no-analogue environments, Picoides arcticus, resource selection models, species distribution models, wildfire	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS, CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS, CLIMATE-CHANGE, BOREAL FOREST, DISTRIBUTIONS, WOODPECKERS, FIRE, CONSERVATION, SELECTION, FUTURE	To conserve habitat for disturbance specialist species, ecologists must identify where individuals will likely settle in newly disturbed areas. Habitat suitability models can predict which sites at new disturbances will most likely attract specialists. Without validation data from newly disturbed areas, however, the best approach for maximizing predictive accuracy can be unclear (Northwestern U.S.A.). We predicted habitat suitability for nesting Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus; a burned-forest specialist) at 20 recently (6years postwildfire) burned locations in Montana using models calibrated with data from three locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. We developed 8 models using three techniques (weighted logistic regression, Maxent, and Mahalanobis D-2 models) and various combinations of four environmental variables describing burn severity, the north-south orientation of topographic slope, and prefire canopy cover. After translating model predictions into binary classifications (0=low suitability to unsuitable, 1=high to moderate suitability), we compiled ensemble predictions, consisting of the number of models (0-8) predicting any given site as highly suitable. The suitability status for 40% of the area burned by eastside Montana wildfires was consistent across models and therefore robust to uncertainty in the relative accuracy of particular models and in alternative ecological hypotheses they described. Ensemble predictions exhibited two desirable properties: (1) a positive relationship with apparent rates of nest occurrence at calibration locations and (2) declining model agreement outside surveyed environments consistent with our reduced confidence in novel (i.e., no-analogue) environments. Areas of disagreement among models suggested where future surveys could help validate and refine models for an improved understanding of Black-backed Woodpecker nesting habitat relationships. Ensemble predictions presented here can help guide managers attempting to balance salvage logging with habitat conservation in burned-forest landscapes where black-backed woodpecker nest location data are not immediately available. Ensemble modeling represents a promising tool for guiding conservation of large-scale disturbance specialists.

No data is available comparing wood borer and bark beetle densities or species guilds associated with MPB-killed or fire-killed trees from the Black Hills of South Dakota, USA. We compared species assemblages of wood borers (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) and bark beetles (Dendroctonus spp. and Ips spp. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)) emerging from bolts collected from trees that had been killed by MPB or fire one or two years prior to harvesting. Significantly more wood borers emerged from bolts of fire-killed trees than from bolts of MPB-killed trees. Wood borer density in fire-killed trees was 13.8 per m(2), compared to 4.4 per m(2) in MPB-killed trees. Six wood borer species, Acanthocinus obliquus (LeConte), Buprestis consularis Gory, Chrysobothris sp., Melanophila acuminata (De Geer), Monochamus clamator LeConte, and Phaenops gentilis (LeConte), emerged from fire-killed tree bolts. Four species of wood borers, A. obliquus, Rhagium inquisitor (L.), Tetropium cinnamopterum Kirby, and Xylotrechus longitarsis Casey, emerged from MPB-killed tree bolts. Acanthocinus obliquus was the only species that emerged from both MPB-killed and fire-killed tree bolts. The bark beetles D. ponderosae, Dendroctonus valens LeConte, Ips knausi Swaine, and Ips pini (Say) emerged from one-year-old, MPB-killed trees, while I. pini was the only species that emerged from a fire-killed tree.

We documented the habitat use and foraging strategies of Celeus obrieni, Kaempfer's Woodpecker, in forested cerrado (savanna) with patches of the bamboo Guadua paniculata near Pium, Tocantins, Brazil. We surveyed for C. obrieni, measured vegetation structure at 30 sites where it was detected and 23 where it was not detected, then compared vegetation characteristics through nonmetric multidimentional scaling and one-way analysis of similarity to determine whether C. obrieni was specializing on particular habitat characteristics. We studied the species' foraging and compared the abundance of prey in drilled and nondrilled stems to evaluate its dietary specialization. All sites with C. obrieni had large, tall stands of G. paniculata, indicating habitat specialization. Drilling most frequently on large, dry stems from 2 to 4 m off the ground, the woodpeckers consumed ants, mainly Camponotus depressus and Azteca fasciata, which colonize the internodes of bamboo stems. Habitat specialists are more vulnerable to habitat loss or alteration but can serve as indicator species for the reaching of conservation goals. Large stands of forested cerrado with patches of bamboo should be conserved for C. obrieni to be maintained. The patchiness of bamboo forest may impede dispersal of C. obrieni.

Removal of hardwood trees together with reintroduction of fire has been suggested as a method of restoring fire-suppressed longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests; however, this strategy, although widespread, has not been evaluated on large spatial and temporal scales. We used a landscape-scale experimental design to examine how bird assemblages in fire-suppressed longleaf pine sandhills responded to fire alone or fire following mechanical removal or herbicide application to reduce hardwood levels. Individual treatments were compared to fire-suppressed controls and reference sites. After initial treatment, all sites were managed with prescribed fire, on an approximately two-to three-year interval, for over a decade. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations suggested that avian assemblages on sites that experienced any form of hardwood removal differed from assemblages on both fire-suppressed sites and reference sites 3-4 years after treatment (i.e., early posttreatment). After >10 years of prescribed burning on all sites (i.e., late posttreatment), only assemblages at sites treated with herbicide were indistinguishable from assemblages at reference sites. By the end of the study, individual species that were once indicators of reference sites no longer contributed to making reference sites unique. Occupancy modeling of these indicator species also demonstrated increasing similarity across treatments over time. Overall, although we documented long-term and variable assemblage-level change, our results indicate occupancy for birds considered longleaf pine specialists was similar at treatment and reference sites after over a decade of prescribed burning, regardless of initial method of hardwood removal. In other words, based on the response of species highly associated with the habitat, we found no justification for the added cost and effort of fire surrogates; fire alone was sufficient to restore these species.

Although most theory and application have been based on in situ measurements, imaging technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) provide measurements that are both vertically accurate and horizontally extensive. We use small-footprint, multiple-return lidar from a state-wide dataset (1-m footprint, 0.11 point/m(2)) to characterize the vertical and horizontal structure of successional loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and mature, fire-maintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests on the coastal plain of North Carolina, USA. The relationship between these characteristics and the federally-endangered red-cockaded woodpecker's (Picoides borealis, Vieillot) habitat preferences were assessed; as this species has a strong affinity for mature longleaf pine forests. Vertical structure was characterized by lidar-derived metrics (e.g., average and standard deviation of canopy height) and horizontal patterns of vertical structure were quantified by semivariograms and lacunarity analysis. Lidar metrics were compared with field measurements of stand structure and with woodpecker habitat use. We predicted woodpecker distribution using the Maxent species distribution modeling algorithm with elevation, landcover, and hydrography geospatial variables, with and without lidar-derived structural variables. Lidar successfully quantified canopy variation and differentiated between the structural characteristics of these two similar coniferous evergreen forest types (e.g. significant differences in maximum height, canopy cover, and size classes). Loblolly stands were found to have the tallest trees on average with a higher canopy cover. Both semivariograms and lacunarity analyses clearly differentiated between evergreen forest structural types (e.g. semivariogram range was 18.7 m for longleaf, 32.3 m for loblolly). By examining the immediate area around cavity nesting sites we found taller trees than those found across broader foraging sites. The species distribution model accurately predicted woodpecker distribution (tested with woodpecker presence, AUC >.85). The addition of lidar-derived variables improved the model's predictive power by 8% compared to the model based only on elevation, landcover, and hydrography environmental variables. We show that relatively low density lidar data are valuable for wildlife studies by characterizing and separating similar canopy types, describing different use zones (foraging vs. nesting), and for use in species distribution models.

We conducted an experiment to evaluate the effects of salvage logging on the abundance of 22 avian species and 6 foraging guilds in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests affected by beetle outbreaks, south-central Oregon, USA, 19961998. Treatments consisted of the removal of lodgepole pine snags only; live trees and ponderosa pine snags were not harvested. Our hierarchical model requires replicated count data from multiple sample units across several time periods, during which the population is closed, to estimate abundance as a function of logging treatment and management district while accounting for imperfect and variable detection probability. We fit the model to point counts from 12 control and 12 treatment plots with 3 surveys during each breeding season, 19961998. We found evidence for a large, but imprecise, effect of salvage logging in all 3 years for only 1 species, the gray flycatcher (Empidonax wrightii). The abundance of the remaining species either did not change or displayed weak positive responses to the treatment. Although 3 foraging guilds increased in total abundance, 2 guilds did not change and the response of 1 guild changed direction in different years. Our results suggest that, unlike most postfire salvage logging prescriptions, selective harvesting after beetle outbreaks may meet multiple management objectives, including the maintenance of avian population sizes comparable to those found in unharvested stands. Future research should consider different sampling programs for those species with large home ranges (e.g., woodpeckers) that may not be sampled adequately using commonly employed programs (e.g., point count stations).(c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.

Growth projection and valuation of restoration of the shortleaf pine-bluestem grass ecosystem	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences	Ecosystem restoration, Growth projection, Shortleaf pine, Pine-bluestem	FORESTS, MODEL	The fire-dependent shortleaf pine-bluestem grass ecosystem that existed prior to European settlement is being restored on approximately 62,700 ha in the Ouachita National Forest. The restoration effort's economic effects are not completely understood. This study will provide the Forest Service with a framework for better communicating the biological and economic impacts of future forest plans and amendments. It also seeks to provide information on how shortleaf pine responds to different management regimes and the implicit cost to maintain the endangered red cockaded woodpecker habitat, and the economic consequences of transitioning from the traditional management regime to a regime which restores the shortleaf pine-bluestem grass ecosystem. The paper suggests by adopting the new pine-bluestem management regime, timber harvests in the pine-bluestem area decline by 25% during the 100-year simulation period, which will incur an additional implicit cost of $72/ha/year to maintain the red cockaded woodpecker habitat. An implied value for each pair of woodpeckers amounts to either $10,550 per year (for the desired 400 total pairs) or $16,880 per year (for the 250 reproducing pairs). Timber sale marking costs decline, while prescribed burning costs increase. The success of the pine-bluestem restoration requires the maintenance of a burning regime that prevents competing vegetation from occupying the middle canopy layer.

Evaluating fuel complexes for fire hazard mitigation planning in the southeastern United States	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences	Fuel characteristics, Surface fire behavior, Fuel reduction, Fuel load, Fuel Characteristic Classification System, Southeastern United States	CHARACTERISTIC CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM, RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER, LONGLEAF PINE FORESTS, CONSERVATION, MANAGEMENT, ECOSYSTEM, BEHAVIOR, HABITAT	Fire hazard mitigation planning requires an accurate accounting of fuel complexes to predict potential fire behavior and effects of treatment alternatives. In the southeastern United States, rapid vegetation growth coupled with complex land use history and forest management options requires a dynamic approach to fuel characterization. In this study we assessed potential surface fire behavior with the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS), a tool which uses inventoried fuelbed inputs to predict fire behavior.Using inventory data from 629 plots established in the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain, South Carolina, we constructed FCCS fuelbeds representing median fuel characteristics by major forest type and age class. With a dry fuel moisture scenario and 6.4 km h(-1) midflame wind speed, the FCCS predicted moderate to high potential fire hazard for the majority of the fuelbeds under study. To explore fire hazard under potential future fuel conditions, we developed fuelbeds representing the range of quantitative inventory data for fuelbed components that drive surface fire behavior algorithms and adjusted shrub species composition to represent 30% and 60% relative cover of highly flammable shrub species. Results indicate that the primary drivers of surface fire behavior vary by forest type, age and surface fire behavior rating. Litter tends to be a primary or secondary driver in most forest types. In comparison to other surface fire contributors, reducing shrub loading results in reduced flame lengths most consistently across forest types. FCCS fuelbeds and the results from this project can be used for fire hazard mitigation planning throughout the southern Atlantic Coastal Plain where similar forest types occur. The approach of building simulated fuelbeds across the range of available surface fuel data produces sets of incrementally different fuel characteristics that can be applied to any dynamic forest types in which surface fuel conditions change rapidly.

Concordance of genetic and phenotypic characters across a sapsucker hybrid zone	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology		FIRE-BELLIED TOADS, MIGRATORY DIRECTION, BOMBINA-BOMBINA, DNA-SEQUENCE, SPECIATION, HYBRIDIZATION, BIRDS, WARBLERS, DIFFERENTIATION, WOODPECKERS	Hybridization has presented a challenge for taxonomists and conservation biologists, since hybridizing forms could be stable evolutionary entities or ephemeral forms that are blending together. However, hybrid zones also provide a unique opportunity for evolutionary biologists who study the interaction between gene flow and reproductive isolation in speciation. Three forms of woodpeckers (sapsuckers; genus Sphyrapicus) in North America that are mostly geographically separated but hybridize with each other where they come into contact present a remarkable system for the study of hybridization. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of phenotypic and genetic variation across a hybrid zone between two of these forms, the red-breasted Sphyrapicus ruber and yellow-bellied S. varius sapsuckers. The objective was to infer whether selection maintains the differences between forms. Our analysis of eight morphometric and 20 plumage traits, and two molecular markers showed clear differences between the forms and roughly concordant clinal variation across a narrow hybrid zone. Thirty percent of sampled birds in the hybrid zone had mixed west/east genotypes at the genetic markers examined. The center of the genetic cline was located 20 km west of the crest of the Rocky Mountains. The width of the zone was 122 km, narrower than would be expected under neutral blending given reasonable estimates of the age of the zone and individual dispersal distances. Heterozygote deficit and cytonuclear disequilibrium at the centre of the hybrid zone suggested nonrandom mating or limited hybridization. Given these patterns and lack of evidence for habitat segregation we conclude that this hybrid zone is maintained by selection, most likely in the form of hybrid inferiority. This study provides an illustrative example of extensive hybridization between stable entities, providing additional evidence against the historical practice of treating hybridizing forms as members of the same species.

They play an important role in tree decomposition, often reducing the value of salvageable timber, and represent an important avian food source.2 Three forest areas that experienced wildfires 1-3 years previously were surveyed during the summer of 2004. Ponderosa pine trees with green, scorched and consumed needles were examined for wood borer occurrence. Within each of the three needle damage categories, the mean wood borer incidence was similar between different age fires. Trees with scorched or consumed needles had significantly more wood borers than trees with green needles.3 Larvae collected from under tree bark were identified to family; when possible, cerambycids were identified further to Acanthocinus spp., Monochamus sp., Rhagium inquisitor (L.) and Stictoleptura canadensis (LeConte), and buprestids were identified to Chalcophora spp. and Chrysobothris sp.4 Classification tree models showed that the estimated probability of tree infestation by wood borers varied among needle damage categories. For trees with green needles, tree injury variables of high bole char height and phloem discolouration were important predictive variables. In trees where needles were consumed, tree size variables of diameter at breast height and tree height were important predictive variables.5 More than half the dead trees examined were infested with wood borers, indicating that infestation of fire-killed ponderosa pine may represent an important food source for species such as woodpeckers and a potential problem for the utilization of infested trees.

Effects of post-fire salvage logging on cavity-nesting birds and small mammals in southeastern Montana. Canadian Field-Naturalist 125(4): 316-326. We investigated how post-fire salvage logging of Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) affected populations of cavity-nesting birds and small mammals in southeastern Montana in 2004 and 2005. We examined two salvage and two control plots with three point-count stations and one small mammal trap site randomly distributed across each plot. We used point counts and distance sampling methods to estimate density of cavity-nesting birds on each treatment. We also searched each plot for nests and used program MARK to construct a set of candidate models to investigate variations in nest survival related to treatment, year. and time. We used live traps arranged in webs centered on trapping sites and distance sampling methods to estimate small mammal density. Habitat characteristics were also quantified on each plot. Density of all cavity-nesting birds combined and of Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in particular were higher on the control than the salvage treatment. Density of large trees and abundance of active cavities were higher on the control treatment. Nest cavities on the salvage treatment were most often located in non-logged watersheds. Nest survival estimates were uniformly high, with only marginal variations attributed to treatment and year. Density of Deer Mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) was higher on the salvage than the control treatment, reflecting the amount of downed woody debris created during harvest.

A model of gas mixing into single-entrance tree cavities during wildland fires	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences		RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER, NEST BOXES, WESTERN-AUSTRALIA, BREEDING BIOLOGY, VENTILATION, FOREST	The level of protection to fauna provided by tree cavities during wildland fires is not well understood. Here we present a model for estimating the transport of combustion gases into cylindrical, single-entrance cavities during exposures caused by different wildland fire scenarios. In these shelters, the entrance occurs near the top of the cavity. This empirical model was developed from a suite of numerical experiments using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Fire Dynamics Simulator, which spanned a range of entrance diameters, wind speeds, gas temperatures, and vertical angles of incidence. To evaluate the model's predictions, it was used to replicate, with great accuracy, a time series of carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in a controlled experiment where a fabricated cylindrical cavity was exposed to combustion products. The time constant for cavity filling is proportional to the ratio of cavity volume to entrance area. Hot gases lead to significant stratification within the cavity during exposures. To demonstrate the model's potential use in predicting faunal exposures in the context of land management, we show that the model can be used to estimate dosage within red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis Vieillot, 1809) cavities without requiring temporally detailed, local measurements of wind speed and combustion product concentrations.

Habitat Suitability and Nest Survival of White-Headed Woodpeckers in Unburned Forests of Oregon	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	nest survival, niche model, partitioned Mahalanobis distance, Picoides albolarvatus, ponderosa pine forests, remote sensing, white-headed woodpecker	SITE SELECTION, REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, LEWISS WOODPECKER, BURNED FORESTS, BIRDS, LANDSCAPE, MODELS, POPULATION, OCCUPANCY, PREDATION	We evaluated habitat suitability and nest survival of breeding white-headed woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) in unburned forests of central Oregon, USA. Daily nest-survival rate was positively related to maximum daily temperature during the nest interval and to density of large-diameter trees surrounding the nest tree. We developed a niche-based habitat suitability model (partitioned Mahalanobis distance) for nesting white-headed woodpeckers using remotely sensed data. Along with low elevation, high density of large trees, and low slope, our habitat suitability model suggested that interspersion-juxtaposition of low-and high-canopy cover ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) patches was important for nest-site suitability. Cross-validation suggested the model performed adequately for management planning at a scale >1 ha. Evaluation of mapped habitat suitability index (HSI) suggested that the maximum predictive gain (HSI = 0.36), where the number of nest locations are maximized in the smallest proportion of the modeled landscape, provided an objective initial threshold for identification of suitable habitat. However, managers can choose the threshold HSI most appropriate for their purposes (e. g., locating regions of low-moderate suitability that have potential for habitat restoration). Consequently, our habitat suitability model may be useful for managing dry coniferous forests for white-headed woodpeckers in central Oregon; however, model validation is necessary before our model could be applied to other locations.

Many red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) that reside on federal lands occur on 15 military installations in the southeastern United States. This close association has increased concern over potential conflicts between conservation requirements of endangered species and the military's mission of combat readiness. Our objectives were to 1) determine if military training operations affect behavior, reproductive success, and productivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers; 2) develop a frequency-weighting function to assess woodpecker hearing sensitivity; 3) identify factors that affect woodpecker responses to military training operations; 4) develop distance and dose-response thresholds for quantifying woodpecker responses to noise levels and stimulus distances; 5) characterize military training operations through quantification of sound levels, source identification, distance from active woodpecker nests, frequency spectra, duration, and frequency of occurrence; and 6) document baseline woodpecker nesting behavior. We conducted our study on the Fort Stewart Military Installation located in southeast Georgia, USA. Downy woodpeckers, as surrogates for red-cockaded woodpeckers, had their best hearing sensitivity within the peak range of the power spectrum of both downy and red-cockaded woodpecker vocalizations, which is at a higher frequency than that of a typical passerine. Overall, woodpeckers had a reduced auditory sensitivity relative to human hearing sensitivity and other species of small birds, especially in the frequency range >4 kHz. Woodpeckers were most sensitive in the 1.5- to 4.0-kHz range. Sensitivity appeared to drop off quickly at frequencies <1.0 kHz and >4.0 kHz. Overall, we did not find that the woodpecker-frequency-weighting function we developed provided a better predictor of woodpecker flush response compared with A-weighting. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between frequency-weighting functions and woodpecker response behavior. Potential breeding groups of woodpeckers across the population increased from 158 in 1997 to 181 in 2000, wheras nesting groups increased from 141 in 1998 to 170 in 2000, for overall increases of 14.6% and 20.6%, respectively, over the 3 years of this project. Fledging success rates for individual nests within the overall population remained consistent from 1998 to 2000, averaging 84.4%. Mean clutch sizes for woodpecker groups for 1998 to 2000 ranged from 2.75 to 3.01 eggs/nest, brood size ranged from 2.01 to 2.22 nestlings/nest, whereas the average number of young fledged ranged from 1.57 to 1.76 young/occupied nest. We observed no difference in reproductive success or productivity between experimental and control-tested red-cockaded woodpecker groups. Overall, experimental test groups produced an average of 2.98 eggs/nest, 1.89 nestlings/nest, and 1.54 young/occupied nest from 1999 to 2000, compared with 2.73 eggs/nest, 1.91 nestlings/nest, and 1.57 young/occupied nest at control groups. We measured behavioral responses (nest attendance and arrivals and departures from the nest) of red-cockaded woodpeckers to military training events through direct and indirect (i.e., video surveillance) observation of 464.5 hours of woodpecker nesting behavior before and after controlled experimental events while recording and characterizing militry-generated sound events using sound-recording equipment. We presented woodpeckers with actual 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators from controlled distances to develop distance and sound thresholds. We used video surveillance to document potential behavioral responses of woodpeckers primarily during nonexperimental military training operations in areas that could not be safely monitored and to determine baseline woodpecker nesting behaviors. We recorded 2,846 nonexperimental military noise events in 157 data sessions at 50 red-cockaded woodpecker groups from 1998 to 2000. We also recorded 206 experimental tests at 58 woodpecker groups during 1999 and 2000. Life-table analyses of flush response time showed that at short ranges (15-30 m) the flush response was stronger for artillery simulator blasts than for blank fire in both the incubation and the nestling phases. In contrast, at medium distances (45-60 m) blank fire tended to produce more flush responses than artillery fire in both incubation and nestling phases. At longer distances (>60 m), blank fire and artillery produced similar flush responses in the incubation phase, whereas flush response was stronger for blank fire than for artillery in the nestling phase. In general, most animals that responded to military activity flushed within 5 seconds of the stimulus event. Woodpeckers returned to nests within an average of 4.4 minutes after being flushed by artillery simulators and 6.3 minutes after 0.50-caliber blank-fire tests. Woodpecker flush response rates increased as stimulus distance decreased and sound levels increased, regardless of stimulus type or year. Woodpeckers did not flush from nests when 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators were >152 m away and sound-exposure levels (decibels [dB]) were <68 dBW (woodpecker-based frequency-weighting curve) and <65 dBW, respectively. We found that blast treatments reduced arrival rates of adults at the nest, with the amount of reduction dependent on the type of blast stimulus and number of helpers at the nest. On the other hand, blast treatments had no detectable effects on nest attendance. The effect of blank fire on incubation-phase arrivals over a 30-minute interval (about 40% reduction) was nearly twice that of artillery simulator fire (about a 20% reduction). There was no evidence supporting any effect of stimulus type on arrivals during the nestling phase. Blast stimuli during incubation reduced arrivals by 40% when no helpers were present, but the strength of this effect decreased to 28% when one helper was present, and was only 6% for nests with >= 2 helpers. Distance of the blast from the nest did not affect the response of arrival rates to blast treatments. Infrequent, short-duration military training exercises, as measured, did not appear to substantially impact red-cockaded woodpecker reproductive success and productivity on the Fort Stewart Military Installation. Our results may be applicable to other military installations where similar training activities and intensity levels occur. Additional research is needed to address possible habituation or sensitization of red-cockaded woodpeckers to human activities in proximity to active nest sites.Although we attempted to monitor woodpecker response to a number of military training activities, other types of military training operations or human-based activities with louder noise, longer duration, incrased human presence, and greater frequency of occurrence could more negatively influence woodpecker nesting behavior and need to be investigated. Our results do not support the hypothesis that military maneuver training operations are limiting factors in the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers on military installations, based on our level and type of testing. Natural resource management policies on military installations have had a positive influence on the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers and probably outweigh the negative effects of typical military training.

High Density Nesting of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in a Post-fire Great Lakes Jack Pine Forest	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology			A stand-replacing fire in 404 ha of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and mixed pine forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in 2007 resulted in Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) nesting at high density in 2008, the second possible nesting season post-fire. Nests were found within a 93-ha study area and a 19-ha stand (a subset of the 93-ha study area) in 199.5 survey hours concentrated in March July. The 19-ha stand had six nests, a density of 0.31 nests/ha or 0.63 individuals/ha, while the 93-ha study area had 20 nests yielding 0.21 nests/ha or 0.42 individuals/ha. These nest densities are higher than previously reported in the literature for comparable stands, indicating a large influx of nesting woodpeckers post-fire. High nesting densities in this study may have resulted from: (1) optimal timing of the fire for wood-boring beetle exploitation of burned trees, (2) the discrete nature of burned habitat in the study due to impacts of salvage logging, or (3) our focus on regions of the burn where high nesting densities occurred, as the entire burned area (404 ha) was not included in nest density calculations.

Differential response of bird functional traits to post-fire salvage logging in a boreal forest ecosystem	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	Bird communities, Boreal forest, Disturbance, Fourth-corner analysis, Post-fire salvaging, RLQ, Trait-habitat links	CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS, SPECIES TRAITS, 4TH-CORNER PROBLEM, BURN SEVERITY, FIRE, LANDSCAPES, COLONIZATION, WOODPECKERS, COMMUNITIES, ASSEMBLAGES	The concept of functional trait-environment relationship posits that species in a local community should possess similar traits that match the selective environment. The present study examines species trait-habitat (using Fourth-corner and RLQ analyses) and habitat occupancy patterns (logistic regression models) of bird assemblages in boreal forest stands following disturbances by forest fire and salvage logging. The stands differed in the amount and composition of residual tree retention, salvage- and aquatic-edges, degree of burn severity (all measured at 100 and 500 m buffers), as well as landscape-level variables such as distance to previously burned forests. Tests of trait-habitat relationships showed that canopy-nesters and bark- and foliage- insectivores required high levels of residual trees of low burn severity, with the feeding guilds showing affinity for different stand composition. In contrast, ground-nesters and omnivores thrived in salvaged areas and associated edges. In addition, cavity-nesting and ground-foragers were associated with severely burned stands. The species' habitat occupancy patterns were commensurate with trait requirements, which also appeared to be scale-dependent. For example, some fire-associated species had high occupancy probability in severely burned stands at small-scale (100 m buffer), which was consistent with their cavity-nesting trait. This pattern, however, was not evident at large-scale, where their feeding requirement (bark-insectivores) for low-severity burns dominated.

INTERSPECIFIC VARIATION IN HABITAT PREFERENCES OF GRASSLAND BIRDS WINTERING IN SOUTHERN PINE SAVANNAS	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology		RED-COCKADED WOODPECKERS, AVIAN COMMUNITY RESPONSE, BACHMANS SPARROW HABITAT, PITCHER PLANT BOGS, HOME-RANGE SIZE, HENSLOWS SPARROWS, FIRE, RESTORATION, ABUNDANCE, ECOSYSTEM	We studied wintering grassland bird communities in De Soto National Forest in southern Mississippi, USA to assess differences in bird communities and vegetation structure among different stand types. We also examined which vegetation structure and plant species predicted occurrence of Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis), Hens low's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii), and Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis). Bachman's Sparrows occurred only in uplands ((x) over bar = 0.5 birds/ha) and stands managed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis; (x) over bar = 0.9 birds/ha), Hens low's Sparrows occurred only in bogs ((x) over bar = 3.8 birds/ha) and stands managed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers ((x) over bar = 2.1 birds/ha), while Sedge Wrens occurred in all stand types ((x) over bar = 0.1-0.3 birds/ha). There were no significant differences among stand types in total bird densities for all three species combined. Dense, spatially uniform herbaceous cover and cover of Scleria muhlenbergii, a preferred food item in bogs, best predicted Hens low's Sparrow occurrence (39% s(2) explained). Increased woody understory vegetation and decreased tree density best predicted Sedge Wren occurrence (17% s(2) explained). Management for Hens low's Sparrows should focus on small-scale herbaceous ground-layer restoration in bogs. Bachman's Sparrows will respond more to thinning dense upland stands. Sedge Wrens and Bachman's Sparrows benefit from Red-cockaded Woodpecker management, whereas Hens low's Sparrow use of woodpecker stands is ephemeral. Received 6 March 2010. Accepted 9 September 2010.

Bird community assembly in Bornean industrial tree plantations: Effects of forest age and structure	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences	Acacia mangium, Chronosequence, Logged forest, Mangium, Sabah, Sarawak, Succession	TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST, OIL PALM PLANTATIONS, PENINSULAR MALAYSIA, WOODPECKER ABUNDANCE, AVIAN COMMUNITIES, SPECIES-DIVERSITY, BURN AGRICULTURE, GMELINA-ARBOREA, SMALL MAMMALS, LOWLAND	Plantations of exotic trees for industrial and agricultural purposes are burgeoning in the tropics, and some of them offer the opportunity to study community ecology of animals in a simplified forest setting. We examined bird community assembly in different aged groves of the industrial tree mangium (Acacia mangium) at two plantations in Malaysian Borneo: Sabah Softwoods near Tawau, Sabah, and the Planted Forest Project, near Bintulu, Sarawak. Bird communities were compared among three age-groups of mangium (2-, 5-, and 7-years old) and logged native forest. Mangium rapidly developed into a secondary forest consisting of a wide diversity of understory trees and shrubs. The bird community correspondingly increased in species richness and diversity, and we were able to relate these increases specifically to canopy height, secondary canopy development, and shrub cover. Species of common, small bodied frugivores, nectarivores, and insectivores were diverse in older plantation groves, as were common mid-sized insectivores. However, large, specialized, and normally uncommon taxa (e.g., galliforms, pigeons, hornbills, barbets, midsized woodpeckers, muscicapine flycatchers, and wren babblers) were rare or nonexistent in the plantations. Because we lacked species-specific data on foraging, nesting, and other behaviors of most groups of birds, it was difficult to explain the precise causes of seral diversification in any group except woodpeckers, which have been well studied in Southeast Asia. Thus, in future, particular emphasis needs to be placed on obtaining such data. Industrial plantations, by virtue of their simple structure, variably aged groves, and bird community richness, are good places to gather such data. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

Do aggregated harvests with structural retention conserve the cavity web of old upland forest in the boreal plains?	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences	Cavity web, Woodpecker, Aggregated harvest, Structural retention, Old boreal forest	INTERIOR BRITISH-COLUMBIA, NORTHERN FLYING SQUIRRELS, MANAGED FORESTS, NESTING BIRDS, HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS, WOODPECKER CAVITIES, COMMUNITY, LANDSCAPE, FIRE, BIODIVERSITY	Boreal species that are dependent on old forests, such as many cavity-using birds and mammals, are at high risk from conventional harvest practices. These species may benefit from ecologically sustainable forest management practices that increase heterogeneity within stands and across landscapes. Structural retention within cutblocks and spatial aggregation of cutblocks into large (1000s ha) harvest units are two such management practices being implemented by forestry companies in the boreal plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan. However, little is known about the implications of these practices for old forest species. The goal of our study was to determine if the cavity-using assemblage associated with old upland forest in this region is retained within aggregated harvests with structural retention. We used a cavity web approach to describe and contrast interactions among cavity excavators (woodpeckers, chickadees, and nuthatches) and the secondary (i.e. non-excavating) species reusing their cavities. We described the cavity web for two intact landscapes of old upland forest and for two aggregated harvest landscapes. We identified four key excavators of intact forest: yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus). These woodpeckers should be considered key excavators primarily of mature and old aspen forest, which dominated the study landscapes. Each woodpecker filled a unique role in the cavity web and all are important for conservation of two mammal and three bird species that used their cavities. In the short term (i.e. within four years post-harvest), the key cavity excavators and many secondary cavityusing species associated with intact forest were retained in the harvested landscapes. One secondary species (American kestrel (Falco sparverius)) was unique in the harvest cavity web. Compared to the intact cavity web, the harvest web had lower abundance of sapsuckers, greater abundance of flickers, and high reuse of flicker cavities by kestrels. These differences were associated with the shift from intact forest to a landscape characterized by patches of old forest surrounded by early-successional habitat. Abundances of hairy and pileated woodpeckers were too low to detect differences between intact and harvested landscapes. The key excavators primarily used trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) for cavity trees and thus aspen should be targeted for retention in harvested landscapes. A more detailed examination of the habitat requirements of the key excavators is needed to develop best practices for tree and patch retention and ensure conservation of the cavity-using assemblage in aggregated harvests.

We tested if male and female woodpeckers exhibited the same movement patterns using both spatially implicit and explicit genetic analyses to define population structure and movement patterns of both sexes among populations. Three genetic groups were identified, a large, genetically continuous population that spans from the Rocky Mountains to Quebec, a small isolated population in South Dakota and a separate population in the western portion of their distribution (Oregon). Patterns of genetic diversity suggest extensive gene flow mediated by both males and females within the continuous boreal forest. However, male-mediated gene flow is the main form of connectivity between the continuously distributed group and the smaller populations of South Dakota and Oregon that are separated by large areas of unforested habitat, which apparently serves as a barrier to movement of female woodpeckers.

Overall avian community composition did not change among the treatments. However, individual species responses varied with the chipping sparrow showing lower density in treatments, whereas hermit thrush, mountain chickadee, white-headed woodpecker, western bluebird, American crow, and common raven increased in treatment units. Daily survival rates of nesting guilds were similar in treated versus control stands; however, burn-only showed lower daily survival rates compared with other treatments. Additional research is needed to validate this result. Cavity-nesters (mountain chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, and house wren) and foliage-nesters (chipping sparrow) used trees that were larger in diameter than available regardless of the treatment. Our results, in combination with other results from this study area, provide important implications for managers: (1) thin-burn treatments were effective at restoring habitat for several avian focal species; (2) spring burn treatments should be carefully designed to achieve desired restoration objectives; (3) large trees provide important habitat functions and are a key component for maintaining or restoring the viability of focal avian species; and (4) additional research is needed to better understand the effects of spring burning and the long-term effects of dry forest restoration treatments.

We modeled the effects of study site, treatment, treatment category, and time since treatment on the foraging encounter rate of four individual species (red-breasted nuthatch [Sitta canadensis], mountain chickadee [Poecile gambeli], hairy woodpecker [Picoides villosus], and brown creeper [Certhia americana]) and assessed the relative importance of several tree and snag characteristics in the selection of foraging trees by these same species. The foraging encounter rate of all four species responded inconsistently across both treatment categories and study sites. Substrate diameter was the strongest and most consistent characteristic positively influencing the selection of foraging habitat structures for all species across all treatment categories. Other influential variables included the presence of bark beetles for red-breasted nuthatches, hairy woodpeckers, and brown creepers in control and burn-only treatment areas and tree species for brown creepers in bum-only and thin-only treatment areas. Although this study did not detect any major negative treatment response by any species, our results suggest that there is substantial variability in the reaction of this particular bird community to fuel reduction treatments and that managers may need to evaluate the effects of these treatments on a site-by-site and species-by-species basis.

Fuel reduction treatments included prescribed burning (B), a mechanical treatment (M), mechanical treatment followed by prescribed burning (MB), and an untreated control (C). Treatment effects on herpetofauna response variables were predicted by the direct and indirect effects of stand basal area, coarse woody debris volume, native herb cover, and forest floor depth. Path models were solved for lizard, snake, and reptile response to fuel reduction treatments. Lizard and reptile abundance were higher in B and MB plots than in C and M plots. Increasing native herb cover best predicted lizard and reptile abundance within B and MB plots.

Using line transects we surveyed the bird community of a natural Pinus canariensis forest burned in the summer of 2007 on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Our goal was to identify important environmental variables and the thresholds that influenced the pattern of bird abundance at the community, foraging guild, and species-specific level. Models were constructed by means of regression trees and cross validation applying the 1-SE rule. Mixed results were observed and only 2 species were clearly affected by fire severity. Overall, total bird abundance, total species richness, and total bird diversity were positively influenced by low, very low, and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively, and the presence of either Erica or Myrica shrubs. Consequently, high canopy fire severity had an overall negative effect on bird community characteristics. Abundance of Myrica shrubs affected positively general ground foragers such as common blackbird (Turdus merula cabrerae) and Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis), a canopy forager. The number of thin trees was important for canopy foragers such as goldcrest (Regulus regulus teneriffae) and African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae teneriffae), but also for a bark forager, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major canariensis). European robin (Erithacus rubecula superbus) and the ubiquitous endemic blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea teydea) were influenced by low and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively. We recommend that land managers incorporate these results into future post-fire management plans. Priority post-fire actions should be directed toward the protection and conservation of the endemic blue chaffinch, a species of conservation concern on the nearby island of Gran Canaria.

We investigated the effects of fire severity on the long-term occupancy of burns by (i) saproxylic insects and (ii) three wood-foraging birds. Based on observations made 6 to 11 years after fire in burned conifer forests that varied in fire severity in Quebec, Canada, our results indicate that low-severity portions of the burns likely provided snag conditions suitable for the long-term presence of deadwood-associated insects and birds. The black-backed woodpecker, a post-fire forest specialist, was still abundant 6 and 8 years after fire. This pattern was likely explained by the persistence of several saproxylic insect species that are associated with recently dead trees and by the positive effect of lower fire severity on the abundance of Arhopalus foveicollis, a cerambycid with a long life cycle in dead wood. The American three-toed woodpecker and the brown creeper, and their associated prey (Scolytinae beetles), were more abundant in burned stands of lower v. higher severity. We conclude that less severely burned snags and stands within high-severity burns may favour the long-term presence of trophic webs that involve saproxylic insects and wood-foraging birds in burned boreal forests.

These outbreaks are managed through removal of trees infested with mountain pine beetles to control mountain pine beetle populations and salvage timber resources. To minimize impacts to black-backed woodpeckers while meeting management objectives, there is a need to identify characteristics of these areas that support black-backed woodpeckers. We examined the habitat associations of this species nesting in areas of beetle outbreaks in the Black Hills, South Dakota in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic approach and discrete choice models to evaluate nest-site selection of 42 woodpecker nests at 3 spatial scales-territory, nest area, and nest tree. At the territory scale (250 m around nest), availability and distribution of food best explained black-backed woodpecker selection of beetle outbreaks versus the surrounding forest. Selection at the territory scale was positively associated with densities of trees currently infested by mountain pine beetles and indices of wood borer (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) abundance, and was greatest at distances of 50-100 m from the nearest patch of infestation. At the nest-area scale (12.5 m radius around the nest), densities of snags positively influenced nest-area selection. Finally, at the nest-tree scale, aspen (Populus tremuloides) and 3-5-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags were important resources. The association between abundant wood-boring insects and black-backed woodpeckers creates a difficult challenge for forest managers. In the absence of fire, areas of beetle outbreak might serve as the only substantial source of habitat in the Black Hills. Regulating insect populations via salvage logging will reduce key food resources to black-backed woodpeckers during nesting. Therefore, given the relatively infrequent occurrence of large-scale fire in the Black Hills, management should recognize the importance of beetle-killed forests to the long-term viability of the black-backed woodpecker population in the Black Hills.

Given its high abundance in recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time. Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success declined from 84% the first year after fire to 73% and 25%, respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests. Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests. Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature and overmature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated species.

Identifying the impacts of prescribed fire on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive, threatened, and migratory bird species Recent developments in occupancy modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for detection probability, and we demonstrate the model's usefulness for identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities. Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the flexibility of the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our modeling of the impacts of prescribed fire on avian communities in a ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed fire treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several bark-insectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed fire, whereas three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined following treatments. Land management agencies interested in determining the effects of habitat manipulations on wildlife communities can use these methods to provide guidance for future management activities.

We used a Before-After/Control-Impact experimental design to quantify the multi-scale response of avifauna to large (similar to 250-400 ha) prescribed. re treatments on four sites in Arizona and New Mexico dominated by ponderosa pine. Using distance sampling and an information-theoretic approach, we estimated changes in density for 14 bird species detected before (May-June 2002-2003) and after (May-June 2004-2005) prescribed. re treatments. We observed few site-level differences in pre- and posttreatment density, and no species responded strongly to treatment on all four sites. Point-level spatial models of individual species response to treatment, habitat variables, and. re severity revealed ecological relationships that were more easily interpreted. At this scale, pretreatment forest structure and patch characteristics were important predictors of posttreatment differences in bird species density. Five species ( Pygmy Nuthatch [Sitta pygmaea], Western Bluebird [Sialia mexicana], Steller's Jay [Cyanocitta stelleri], American Robin [Turdus migratorius], and Hairy Woodpecker [Picoides villosus]) exhibited a strong treatment response, and two of these species ( American Robin and Hairy Woodpecker) could be associated with meaningful. re severity response functions. The avifaunal response patterns that we observed were not always consistent with those reported by more common studies of wildland. re events. Our results suggest that, in the short term, the distribution and abundance of common members of the breeding bird community in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests appear to be tolerant of low- to moderate-intensity prescribed. re treatments at multiple spatial scales and across multiple geographic locations.

Pattern and process in forest bird communities on boreal landscapes originating from wildfire and timber harvest	FORESTRY CHRONICLE			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences	boreal forest, songbirds, woodpeckers, community assembly, null models, natural disturbance emulation, forestry, Ontario	INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION, SPECIES SATURATION, FIELD EXPERIMENTS, FRAGMENTATION, CONSEQUENCES, DIVERSITY, RICHNESS, CANADA, PERSPECTIVES, ABUNDANCE	Policy direction to emulate natural disturbance in managed boreal forests has spurred a need to contrast the dynamics of biota on landscapes originating from timber harvest and from wildfire (hereafter, "managed" and "natural"). Typically, emphasis is on pattern emulation, and less on processes, such as competition, predation or habitat selection. Knowing how communities in the boreal forest assemble can provide further insight to the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the processes responsible, permitting assessments about whether forestry practices emulate processes as well as patterns. We contrasted variation in species richness among forest types, with stand area, and between local (forest stand) and regional (landscape) scales on managed and natural boreal landscapes in NW Ontario. Species richness varied more among forest stand types than between landscapes, or with stand area, on either landscape. On both landscapes, mean local species richness was 1/3 of regional richness, consistent with the hypothesis that competition structured stand-level assemblages regardless of stand origin. We further compared the structure of stand-level assemblages from randomized null models using presence/absence and abundance data with observed assemblages on each landscape, while controlling for variation in habitat structure among stands. Local bird assemblages were over-dispersed in niche space relative to random assemblages, also consistent with the competition hypothesis, regardless of stand origin. We found no evidence that patterns of variation in diversity of songbirds and woodpeckers, nor the processes that govern them, differed between managed and natural boreal forest landscapes. Our results suggest that past forest practices in this region, if by default, nevertheless emulated natural patterns of variation in diversity and species assembly of bird communities.

Our objectives were to examine factors that allowed for co-existence in two burned pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We monitored 53 Lewis's and 38 Red-headed Woodpecker nests between 2002 and 2005, and compared clutch initiation dates and nest-site selection. Clutch initiation dates did not differ between species for 3 of 4 years. We compared multiple habitat factors surrounding nests of the two species, and only tree and snag densities differed between Red-headed Woodpecker nest sites (65.1 +/- 5.78 stems/ha) and those of Lewis's Woodpeckers (48.5 +/- 6.06 stems/ha). These results are consistent with the foraging techniques used by the two species. We suggest that habitat partitioning is an important mechanism of coexistence for these two species, but also recommend further research on their foraging strategies. Received 3 December 2007.

Influences of postfire salvage logging on forest birds in the Eastern Cascades, Oregon, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences	Birds, Fire, Salvage logging, Ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir forest	DOUGLAS-FIR FORESTS, STAND-REPLACEMENT FIRE, CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS, WESTERN OREGON, BOREAL FOREST, SIERRA-NEVADA, BURN SEVERITY, COMMUNITIES, WILDFIRE, POPULATIONS	In coniferous forests of western North American, fire is an important disturbance that influences the structure and composition of floral and faunal communities. The impacts of postfire management, including salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5-6 snags retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon. We used analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three hypotheses concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage on densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds, and two hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage logging on relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined the relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species. We did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities or relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P. villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment. We detected significant differences between years for four species of birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting robust patterns that transcend particular locations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Specifically, such forests are said to carry higher fuel loads and experience. res that are more severe than those that occurred historically. It remains unclear, however, how far these generalizations can be extrapolated in time and space, and how well they apply to the more mesic ponderosa pine systems and to other forest systems within the western United States. I use data on the pattern of distribution of one bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) as derived from 16 465 sample locations to show that, in western Montana, this bird species is extremely specialized on severely burned forests. Such specialization has profound implications because it suggests that the severe. res we see burning in many forests in the Intermountain West are not entirely "unnatural'' or "unhealthy.'' Instead, severely burned forest conditions have probably occurred naturally across a broad range of forest types for millennia. These findings highlight the fact that severe. re provides an important ecological backdrop for. re specialists like the Black-backed Woodpecker, and that the presence and importance of severe. re may be much broader than commonly appreciated.

Although there have been several studies of postfire salvage-logging effects on bird species, there have been few studies of effects on bird species associated with high-severity patches in forests that have otherwise burned at lower severities. From 2004 to 2006, we investigated the foraging presence or absence of three woodpecker species, the Black-backed (Picoides arctictis), Hairy (P. villosus), and White-headed (P. albolarvatus) Woodpeckers, within four different forest habitat conditions in Sierra Nevada conifer forests: unburned; moderate-severity and unlogged; high-severity and unlogged; and high-severity and logged. We found Black-backed Woodpecker foraging was restricted to unlogged high-severity patches. Hairy Woodpeckers foraged most in unlogged high-severity patches, and White-headed Woodpeckers showed no significant difference in presence among conditions. These results suggest that unlogged, high-severity forest is important habitat for the Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers.

However, most research has focused on avian use of cavities in the breeding season, with little attention given to other cavity using guilds or cavity use during the non-breeding season. Furthermore, most breeding season studies were in unburned forests containing a mix of conifer and deciduous trees with Much less attention given to cavity rich post-burn habitats. The objective of this study was to examine cavity use during the breeding and non-breeding seasons in old-burned ponderosa pine forests in the Black Hills, South Dakota. One hundred seventy nine active cavity nests of nine cavity nesting species were monitored between 2002-2005. We examined the contents of each cavity during the breeding season and twice during each non-breeding season (fall, winter, spring) each year. Additionally, we conducted vegetative surveys to determine the microhabitat variables that might influence the occupancy of cavities in the breeding season. Binomial logistic regression with AIC model selection criteria were used to model breeding season cavity reuse for the three most common cavity excavator species, Lewis's Woodpeckers (Melanerpes lewis), Red-headed Woodpeckers (M. erythrocephalus) and Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus). All three species reused old cavities most recently used by conspecifics for breeding; snag density (dbh > 23 cm) and cavity height consistently influenced reuse of cavities for all three species. In the non-breeding season the cavities of these same three species were all commonly used, but Northern Flicker cavities contained the greatest diversity of secondary cavity users.

In the Black Hills, South Dakota, standing dead forests resulting from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks offer food resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers, in addition to providing habitat similar to burned forest. However, data on reproductive rates in these habitats are lacking. We estimated nest success and evaluated factors affecting nest survival of Black-backed Woodpeckers in beetle-killed forests in the Black Hills in 2004 and 2005. Nest success was 78% (n = 12) in 2004 and 44% (n = 31) in 2005. Fledging rates per pair were 2.0 +/- 0.3 SE (n = 12) and 1.4 +/- 0.3 SE (n = 28) in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Our results showed that temporal effects (e.g., age, date, and year) had the greatest influence on nest survival. Nest age was the most important predictor of daily nest survival; survival was higher in older nests. Nest survival was also lower later in the breeding season. The difference in nest success between the two years requires further study; however, nest success of Black-backed Woodpeckers in beetle-killed forests in the Black Hills was within the range of nest success within postfire habitats in this area. In the Black Hills, forests experiencing beetle outbreaks offer available habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers.

Effects of understory vegetation management on brood habitat for northern bobwhites	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	arthropods, brood habitat, Colinus virginianus, imazapyr, imprinting, Louisiana, northern bobwhite, prescribed fire, red-cockaded woodpecker	CHICKS, FIRE	Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations have experienced severe declines for several decades, and declines have been particularly precipitous in the southern United States. These declines are partially attributable to large-scale conversions of potential habitat to short-rotation pine (Pinus spp.) forests managed for wood fiber production and fire exclusion in pine-dominated landscapes. We used standard arthropod sampling techniques, human-imprinted bobwhite chicks, and vegetation response to evaluate effects of different understory vegetation management practices on brood habitat quality within a commercially managed pine forest in Louisiana, USA, during 2002-2005. Specifically, we evaluated effects of mowing, prescribed fire during the growing season, prescribed fire in combination with imazapyr application, and no vegetation management on arthropod abundance and diversity, vegetation response, and the probability of bobwhite chicks successfully capturing an arthropod. Bobwhite chicks were more successful at capturing arthropods, and arthropod abundance and diversity were greatest, in plant communities managed using prescribed fire and imazapyr. Forest stands managed using a combination of fire and imazapyr were managed primarily to benefit the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis; RCW). Our findings suggest that management directed toward improving forest condition for RCWs improves habitat quality for. brooding bobwhites. However, bobwhite chicks in our study area were less successful at capturing arthropods than were chicks in other studies in the southeastern United States. Brood-earing habitat in pine forests similar to those we studied may be of generally poor quality, and could be related to precipitous declines of bobwhites in the West Gulf Coastal Plain. Managers should recognize that creating high-quality brood habitat in forests similar to those we studied will require more intensive management of understory vegetation than we studied.

Each silvicultural treatment was applied to two approximately 100aha units within each of three blocks. Prescribed burning was applied to one-half of each silvicultural treatment in a split-plot design. Occupancy was estimated at eight points in each plot for 11 bird species and three foraging guilds (bark gleaners, woodpeckers, and foliage gleaners). The frequencies of species detections on the point counts were used to estimate species richness on each plot. Occupancy did not differ among treatments for any of the guilds. Four of the 11 bird species, the American robin (Turdus migratorius L., 1766), the chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina (Bechstein, 1798)), the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis Latham, 1790), and the western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana (A. Wilson, 1811)), showed responses to the treatments. Species richness did not differ between the silvicultural or the burn treatments. The general lack of response of the bird community to the silvicultural and burn treatments is likely a result of the relatively large size of the trees and snags retained on both silvicultural treatments, the low intensity of the prescribed burns, and the lack of a strong contrast in tree density between the silvicultural treatments.

We documented snag attributes in a mixed-conifer forest dominated by ponderosa pine in the Sierra Nevada, California where fire is being applied during spring. A total of 328 snags were monitored before and after fire on plots burned once, burned twice, or left unburned to assess the effects of prescribed fire on snag populations. The greatest loss of snags (7.1 snags ha(-1) or 43%) followed the first introduction of fire after a long fire-free period. On plots burned a second time 21 % of snags (3.6 snags ha(-1)) were lost, whereas 8% (1.4 snags ha(-1)) were lost on unburned control plots in the same time period. New snags replaced many of those lost reducing the net snag losses to 12% (2.0 ha(-1)) for plots burned once, and 3% (0.5 ha(-1)) for plots burned twice and unburned plots. We also examined snags used by cavity-nesting birds. Snags preferred for nesting were generally ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), larger diameter, and moderately decayed as compared to available snags. For monitored snags that met the preferred criteria, there was a net loss (1.7 snag ha(-1) or 34%) after the first burn, while the loss of useable snags was less than 1 snag ha(-1) following the second burn (15%) or on unburned controls (8%). We recommend protection of preferred snags, in particular large ponderosa pines, especially during primary fire applications on fire-suppressed landscapes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

I compared incidence of nest usurpation in logged and non-logged treatments in a burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in 2004 and 2005. 1 predicted that usurpation would occur more often on logged than non-logged sites because Red-headed Woodpeckers tend to nest in more open habitats. Red-headed Woodpeckers nested more often and usurped a greater proportion of host species in logged (n = 6) than non-logged (n = 3) areas, despite host cavities being more abundant on the non-logged treatment. Usurping Red-headed Woodpecker pairs initiated nesting earlier ((x) over bar = 12 May +/- 2 days) than pairs that excavated cavities (18 May 1 2 days) which implies an existing benefit to offset the cost of interspecific conflict.

Distinctiveness, use, and value of midwestern oak savannas and woodlands as avian habitats	AUK			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	ecotones, fire frequency, indicator species, oak savanna, oak woodland, seasonal effects, stopover habitat	EASTERN NORTH-AMERICA, BIRD COMMUNITIES, STAND STRUCTURE, FIRE, DISTURBANCE, FORESTS, CONSERVATION, REMNANT, HISTORY, INDIANA	Oak savannas and woodlands historically covered millions of hectares in the midwestern United States but are rare today. We evaluated the ecological distinctiveness and conservation value of savannas and woodlands by examining bird distributions across a fire-maintained woody-vegetation gradient in northwest Indiana encompassing five habitats-open habitats with low canopy cover, savannas, woodlands, scrublands, and forests-during migration, breeding, and overwintering. Savannas and woodlands were significantly different in overall bird species composition from open and forest habitats but were often intermediate between open and forest in guild densities. Few bird species were consistently and highly concentrated in savannas or woodlands, and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) was the only species significantly more abundant in savannas and woodlands than in open, scrub, and forest habitats. Fire frequency over a 15-year interval was a significant predictor of bird community composition and was positively related to species diversity, spring transient migrant density, and density of the most threatened species. Each habitat type had characteristics potentially important for avian conservation. Scrub had the highest density of transient migrants, which suggests it plays an important role as migration stopover habitat. More species were significantly concentrated in open or forest habitats than in the other habitats. Lack of species concentration and intermediate community composition suggested that birds experienced savannas and woodlands more as ecotones than as habitats distinct from forests or grasslands. However, this intermediate character can benefit conservation, as evidenced by savannas and woodlands having the highest density of the most threatened species along this woody-vegetation gradient.

In Spain, Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests are mainly subjected to three sylvopastoral management systems which determine variations in the forest structure: (i) "young forests" subjected to frequent disturbance by fires and clear-cuttings; (ii) "Pyrenean oak dehesas", subjected to a traditional sylvopastoral system exclusive to Spain which favours the development of both old oaks and pasture; (iii) largely undisturbed "mature forests". We examined the effects of these sylvopastoral management systems on habitat use and reproduction of the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius), a forest specialist bird, at the south-western edge of its distribution range. Habitat use was examined at multiple spatial scales. Within the territories, woodpeckers preferred large diameter oaks for foraging and decay oaks with holes for nesting. Within the forest tracts, no significant relationships between territory density and habitat structure in the forest tracts were found. At the landscape scale, dehesas and mature forests, both with high densities of important foraging and nesting trees, were occupied by woodpeckers. Young forests, with low densities of those trees, were avoided. No significant differences in territory density or reproductive success were found between dehesas and mature forests. The maintenance of viable woodpecker populations requires conservation actions at several spatial scales. Within the forest tracts, suitable densities of important foraging and nesting trees must be maintained. At the landscape scale, management decisions must consider the maintenance of traditional sylvopastoral systems in dehesas and mature forests. At the regional scale, taking into account a habitat cover in the landscape of the 7% for the Cantabrian Mountains, we estimated an area of 285,000 ha to be included in the conservation planning unit for the middle spotted woodpecker.

Boreal woodpecker assemblages in recently burned forested landscapes in Alberta, Canada: Effects of post-fire harvesting and burn severity	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences	burn severity, dead wood, landscape, mixed-wood forest, Picoides, salvage logging, transect count method, wildfire, woodpeckers	STAND-REPLACEMENT FIRE, CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS, 3-TOED WOODPECKERS, FORAGING ECOLOGY, HABITAT USE, HOME-RANGE, COMMUNITIES, AVAILABILITY, MANAGEMENT, CARABIDAE	Canadian boreal forests are increasingly modified by post-fire removal of trees (salvage logging), yet the ecological consequences of this practice are little studied. As mixed-wood forests have recently become accessible for salvage operations, we studied woodpeckers in mixed-wood (trembling aspen Populus tremuloides and white spruce Picea glauca) and adjacent coniferous (black spruce Picea mariana and jack pine Pinus banksiana) areas to examine the effects of salvage logging and burn severity on these species. During 2003-2004 we carried out transect counts in 24 landscape units (625 ha each) that varied in pre-fire amount of merchantable mixed-wood (low=7-15% and high=25-35% of the unit area), salvage logging intensity (from control=no salvaging to high=60-70% of merchantable mixed-wood harvested) and burn severity (estimates based on tree survival after fire). Six main findings are presented: (1) in mixed-wood areas subjected to salvage, total woodpecker abundance and woodpeckers of the genus Picoides (most notably black-backed woodpecker Picoides arcticus) responded negatively to increasing salvage logging intensity; (2) northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) showed a marginally significant positive response to salvage in the mixed-wood areas; (3) the salvage response of the black-backed woodpecker was season dependent (first post-fire summer, winter and second post-fire summer compared); (4) in coniferous but not in mixed-wood areas, black-backed woodpecker responded positively to increasing burn severity. Moreover, the response in coniferous habitat was stronger in the first post-fire summer, compared to the subsequent winter and the second post-fire summer. In the retained mixed-wood areas, northern flicker responded positively to increasing burn severity; (5) the majority of the detected 73 woodpecker nests with chicks were in trembling aspen trees or in mixed-wood stands; (6) among coniferous tree species, dead standing jack pine and white spruce trees had much greater evidence of woodpecker foraging than had black spruce (ca. 65-75% versus 15% of trees). These results indicate the crucial influence of salvage logging, the amount of retained mixed-wood forests and burn severity on woodpecker abundance. Hence we recommend retention of large, burned mixed-wood areas during salvage harvesting to support these dead-wood dependent birds. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The key factor for sustaining their high levels of diversity is the frequent application of prescribed fire uninterrupted in time and space. Pine fuels, critical to application of fire and regulated by canopy distribution, provide the nexus between silviculture and fire management in this system. Typical silvicultural approaches for this type were, in large part, developed to maximize the establishment and growth of regeneration as well as growth and yield of timber, with much less regard to how those practices might influence the ability to sustain prescribed burning regimes or the associated biodiversity. However, many landholdings in the region now include conservation of biodiversity as a primary objective with sustained timber yield as an important but secondary goal. This review synthesizes the literature related to controls of biodiversity for longleaf pine ecosystems, and silvicultural approaches are compared in their ability to Sustain natural disturbance such as fire and how closely they mimic the variation, patterns, and processes of natural disturbance regimes while allowing for regeneration.

We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots, but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots. Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in the salvage-logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent species in the northern Rocky Mountains-American Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters, which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots, nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially populations of primary cavity-nesting species.

We measured reproductive parameters and nest-site characteristics at 17 Red-headed Woodpecker nests and 17 random sites between 2001 and 2004 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. The average date the first egg was laid was 17 June, and the average clutch size was 5.4 +/- 0.4. The daily nest survival rate averaged 0.98 (overall nest success = 47%), and predation was the major cause of nest failure. Red-headed Woodpecker nests occurred farther from grassland edges in large diameter snags within severely burned quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands. High-severity fire within these aspen stands resulted in a combination of snag and understory characteristics that differed from the surrounding pine forest matrix. Interactions between cover type and burn severity may have important ecological consequences for Red-headed Woodpeckers in a mixed conifer forest.

Using point-counts, radiotelemetry, and focal bird observation, we assessed the relative abundance, home range size and composition, and habitat use by foraging hairy woodpeckers in 3 stands that had experienced wildfire in 1996, 2000, or 2002. Because we conducted the study over 2 years, we used the 1996 fire to represent 6 and 7 years after fire, while we used the 2000 fire to represent 2 and 3 years after fire in a space-for-time substitution chronosequence analysis. We also assessed bark beetle and woodborer density by x-raying bark samples collected from a subset of trees within burned areas. We detected significantly greater hairy woodpecker relative abundance in burned forests representing 1 and 2 years after fire, and bark beetle and woodborer density was highest in these stands as well. Woodpecker home range size increased across stands representing increasing time since fire. Within a burn, hairy woodpeckers used high-severity burned areas more than moderate-severity burned areas representing 2 and 3 years after fire, but not in areas representing 6 and 7 years after fire. Bark beetle and woodborer densities were also higher in high-severity burned stands representing 2 and 3 years after fire. Hairy woodpeckers used edges of high-severity burned areas more than the interior. We hypothesize that an initial increase in bark beetle and woodborer density following fire allowed for higher woodpecker abundance and smaller home ranges, but as burned forests aged, bark beetle and woodborer density within trees decreased, killed trees fell, and, in response, hairy woodpecker relative abundance decreased and home range size increased. These patterns suggest that high-severity burned areas provide important but ephemeral resources to this dominant primary cavity-nester. The higher bark beetle and woodborer densities and greater use of edges of high-severity burned areas by woodpeckers suggests that salvage logging of these areas could remove potential prey and preferred foraging areas for hairy woodpeckers, especially when trees are removed along severely burned edges.

Associations of breeding birds with fire-influenced and riparian-upland gradients in a longleaf pine ecosystem	AUK			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ANIMAL SCIENCES	Zoology	breeding birds, fire, longleaf pine, Pinus palustris, riparian habitat	PRESCRIBED FIRE, COMMUNITIES, FORESTS, FLORIDA, STANDS, RESTORATION, POPULATIONS	We determined the effects of fire history and a riparian-upland gradient on the breeding bird community at Fort Bragg Military Installation in North Carolina, one of the largest remnant areas of the endangered longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. Study sites were classified into two treatments: fire-intense (areas experiencing growing-season burns) and fire-suppressed (areas lacking fires). Within each treatment, bird and vegetation data were recorded at point-count stations positioned at three distances from streamhead pocosins to characterize the riparian-upland habitat gradient: 0, 75, and >= 150 m. Total bird abundance and species richness varied significantly along the riparian-upland gradient, with pocosins contributing greatly to avian biodiversity. Our data revealed strong effects of fire history and riparian-upland gradient on bird species, which we described in terms of breeding-bird assemblages. Members of the open longleaf assemblage (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker [Picoides borealis], Bachman's Sparrow [Aimophila aestivalis]) were most common in fire-intense areas and at upland locations. Members of the fire-suppressed assemblage (e.g., Wood Thrush [Hylocichla mustelina], Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapilla]) were confined to pocosins in fire-intense areas, but became more abundant in fire-suppressed areas. Members of the pocosin assemblage (e.g., Eastern Towhee [Pipilo erythropthalamus], Common Yellowthroat [Geothlypis trichas]) were largely confined to pocosins and, in some cases, were most abundant in fire-intense pocosins. Fire suppression increased structural diversity of vegetation and promoted one breeding-bird assemblage (fire-suppressed), but at the expense of two others (open longleaf, pocosin). Continued management of Fort Bragg to promote longleaf pine restoration is essential for supporting conservation of the open-longleaf bird assemblage; in addition, it will benefit the pocosin assemblage.

Abundance and attributes of wildlife trees and coarse woody debris at three silvicultural systems study areas in the Interior Cedar-Hemlock Zone, British Columbia	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	PLANT SCIENCES	Plant Sciences	wildlife trees, coarse woody debris, wildlife habitat, silvicultural systems, Interior Cedar-Hemlock Zone, inland rainforest	FORESTS, OREGON, REGENERATION, WOODPECKERS, HABITAT, FIRES, BIRDS, LOGS	Unmanaged cedar (Thuja plicata)-hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) forests of the northern Interior Wetbelt of British Columbia support standing and dead trees with a variety of structural features that provide habitat for wildlife. We describe the pre-harvest abundance and characteristics of wildlife trees (standing trees with special characteristics that provide habitat for wildlife) and coarse woody debris (CWD) at three silvicultural systems trials in cedar-dominated stands, and the short-term effects of forest harvesting on the abundance and attributes of CWD. The treatments were clearcut, group retention (70% volume removal), group selection (30% volume removal), and unlogged control. We measured standing trees in 75 0.125-ha plots and CWD along 225 24-m transects, using a functional classification system to characterize habitat attributes of trees and logs. CWD assessments were repeated on the same transects after the harvest. The relationship between tree size and occurrence of habitat features was strong for both standing trees and logs. Each of the four major tree species in the study area was associated with specific habitat features that occurred more often in that species than in any other. Large concealed spaces at the bases of trees, providing den sites and escape cover, were associated with hybrid white spruce (Picea engelmannii x glauca). We suggest that these trees had originated on nurse logs that subsequently rotted away; if that supposition is correct, there may be shortages of these structures in future stands that originate from plantations. Forest harvesting had little effect on the volume of CWD, but did affect the decay class distribution, reduce the proportion of pieces having structural habitat attributes, and reduce piece lengths; these effects were generally proportional to the level of harvest removal. Partial-cut silvicultural systems have the potential to mitigate anticipated deficits in large wildlife trees and logs in managed stands, if components of the stand are managed on longer rotations than those planned for timber production alone.

Effects of prescribed burns on wintering cavity-nesting birds	NORTHWEST SCIENCE			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology		DOUGLAS-FIR FORESTS, CONIFEROUS FORESTS, WESTERN OREGON, SIERRA-NEVADA, COMMUNITIES, WOODPECKERS, SNAGS, ADVANTAGES, SELECTION, FLOCKING	Primary cavity-nesting birds play a critical role in forest ecosystems by excavating cavities later used by other birds and mammals as nesting or roosting sites. Several species of cavity-nesting birds are non-migratory residents and consequently subject to winter conditions. We conducted winter bird counts from 1998 to 2000 to examine the abundance and habitat association of cavity-nesting birds in prescribed burned and unburned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands. Even though bird diversity indices did not differ between burned and unburned stands, species-specific bird abundance was associated with habitat variables in three burned and four unburned stands. Total cavity-nesting bird abundance was greater in burned stands. Most cavity-nesting birds were observed in mixed-species flocks. Individual species of these flocks were associated with different habitat variables within stands. Numbers of woodpeckers were significantly greater in burned stands and numbers of chickadees were significantly greater in unburned stands. Bark foragers such as woodpeckers (Picoides spp.) and pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea) were associated with fewer small trees and recently decayed snags and logs. Foliage gleaners such as the chickadees (Poecile spp.) were associated with small diameter snags. The juxtaposition of burned and unburned stands is important for individual birds reliant upon other members of a mixed-species flock and habitat heterogeneity within stands is important for maintaining a diverse cavity-nesting bird assemblage.

A natural disturbance model has therefore been promoted as an ecologically based approach to forest harvesting in these systems. Given accelerating resource demands, fire competes with harvest for timber, and there is increasing pressure to salvage naturally burned areas. This creates a management paradox: simultaneous promotion of natural disturbance as a guide to sustainability while salvaging forests that have been naturally disturbed. The major drivers of posffire salvage in Canadian boreal forests are societal perceptions, overallocation of forest resources, and economic and policy incentives, and post fire salvage compromises forest sustainability by diminishing the role of fire as a critical, natural process. These factors might be reconciled through consideration of fire in resource allocations and application of active adaptive management We provide novel treatment of the role of burn severity in mediating biotic response by examining its influence on the amount, type, and distribution of live, postfire residual material, and we highlight the role of fire in shaping spatial and temporal patterns in forest biodiversity. Maintenance of natural posffire forests is a critical component of an ecosystem-based approach to forest management in boreal systems. Nevertheless, present practices focus heavily on expediting removal of timber from burned forests, despite increasing evidence that postfire communities differ markedly from postharvest systems, and there is a mismatch between emerging management models and past management practices. Policies that recognize the critical role of fire in these systems and facilitate enhanced understanding of natural system dynamics in support of development of sustainable management practices are urgently needed.

Toward meaningful snag-management guidelines for postfire salvage logging in North American conifer forests	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	black-backed woodpecker, cavity-nesting birds, crown fire, mixed-severity fire, Picoides arcticus, salvage logging, stand-replacement fire	PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS, STAND-REPLACEMENT FIRE, WESTERN UNITED-STATES, COARSE WOODY DEBRIS, BOREAL FOREST, DOUGLAS-FIR, LANDSCAPE PATTERNS, BIRD COMMUNITIES, NESTING BIRDS, NATIONAL-PARK	The bird species in western North America that are most restricted to, and therefore most dependent on, severely burned conifer forests during the first years following afire event depend heavily on the abundant standing snags for perch sites, nest sites, and food resources. Thus, it is critical to develop and apply appropriate snag-management guidelines to implement postfire timber harvest operations in the same locations. Unfortunately, existing guidelines designed for green-tree forests cannot be applied to postfire salvage sales because the snag needs of snag-dependent species in burned forests are not at all similar to the snag needs of snag-dependent species in green-tree forests. Birds in burned forests have very different snag-retention needs from those cavity nesting bird species that have served as the focus for the development of existing snag-management guidelines. Specifically, many postfire specialists use standing dead trees not only for nesting purposes but for feeding purposes as well. Woodpeckers, in particular, specialize on wood-boring beetle larvae that are superabundant in fire-killed trees for several years following severe fire. Species such as the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) are nearly restricted in their habitat distribution to severely burned forests. Moreover, existing postfire salvage-logging studies reveal that most postfire specialist species are completely absent from burned forests that have been (even partially) salvage logged. I call for the long-overdue development and use of more meaningful snag-retention guidelines for postfire specialists, and I note that the biology of the most fire-dependent bird species suggests that even a cursory attempt to meet their snag needs would preclude postfire salvage logging in those severely burned conifer forests wherein the maintenance of biological diversity is deemed important.

Primary conservation management goals for the Pinus palustris ecosystem include the perpetual regeneration of the fire-maintained forest and conservation of the characteristically high biological diversity and rare species. Several attributes, such as a sustained population of Picoides borealis (red-cockaded woodpecker), Aristida stricta (wiregrass)-dominated ground cover, and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones, can predict a diverse and ecologically functional ecosystem. Such indicators are linked to critical structural and functional features of the system and reflect previous land management histories that suggest sustainable approaches.Conclusions: A traditional definition of 'old-growth' relying on overstorey may be limited in describing important features of healthy, diverse Pinus palustris ecosystems. Some characteristics are significantly more important for maintenance of diversity than age of the trees and these features may be present in old- or second-growth forests. We advocate that the management history, structural characteristics and landscape context of stands that harbour desirable conservation attributes (red-cockaded woodpeckers, wiregrass, gopher tortoises and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones) can be used as indicators to identify important conservation and forest management principles.

Thus, harvesting that is as similar as possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities. We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds) from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies. Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a single forest type.

We wanted to determine how these habitats are colonized by this species and by which age classes. Data collected at the Observatoire d'oiseaux de Tadoussac (situated on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada)) suggest that an important movement of juveniles occurs during the autumn. It was therefore hypothesized that in the year following fire, burned forest sites would be colonized by a higher percentage of juvenile birds than intact mature stands. In accordance to this hypothesis, there was a difference in woodpecker age structure between the two habitat types (chi(2) = 9.43, df = 2, P = 0.0088, n = 186). However, differences are mainly explained by the higher number of third calendar year birds at burned forest sites, suggesting that a part of the colonization occurs in the same year as the fire by second year birds, rather than by juveniles during the autumn.

However, with presence-absence datasets there is a problem associated with the comparison between habitats when there is an inter-habitat variation in the proportion of false zeros. Using conspecific playbacks and time of reaction of black-backed woodpeckers in burned and unburned forests, the present study determined whether detection probabilities were similar. The period of time required to detect this species was shorter in recently burned sites than in mature forest stands (F(2.235) = 22.1, df = 2, P < 0.0001). To accurately compare these habitats it is important to assure the same proportion of presence and false zeros in each habitat during the census. To achieve this, we propose a time corrected method. Because inter-habitat differences in detectability exist for black-backed woodpeckers, and probably many other organisms, caution is needed when interpreting presence-absence data in the context of habitat comparisons or when monitoring biodiversity in different habitats.

Little is known, however, about how restoration affects animal populations, especially those of birds. I compared the breeding densities, community structure, and reproductive success of birds in oak savannas maintained by prescribed fire (12 sites) with those in closed-canopy forests (13 sites). All sampling was conducted in Illinois (U.S.A.). Of the 31 bird species analyzed, 12 were more common in savannas, 14 were not affected by habitat structure, and 5 were more common in forest habitat. The species favored by disturbance and restoration included Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), Mourning Doves ( Zenaida macroura), Red-headed Woodpeckers ( Melanerpes erythrocephalus), Indigo Buntings ( Passerina cyanea), and Baltimore Orioles (Icterus galbula). Those more common in closed-canopy forest included Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Wood Thrushes ( Hylocichla mustelina). Few species were unique to one type of habitat, but overall avian community structure in oak savannas and closed-canopy forests was generally distinctive. Estimates of nesting success (derived from 785 nests) revealed that 6 of the 13 species considered experienced greater productivity in the savanna habitat. Rates of brood parasitism were unaffected by restoration and habitat structure. Within savannas, tract size had little effect on breeding abundances and reproductive success. My results illustrate that restoration techniques can significantly affect the ecology of constituent animal populations and communities and have key implications regarding avian conservation and the management of forest habitat in fragmented landscapes. Small patches of forest habitat that regularly function as population sinks may offer far better prospects for birds if they are subjected to disturbance and ecosystem restoration.

As a consequence, there have been predictions of a substantial decline in Leadbeater's possum populations over the next 40 years. If this is to be averted, or reduced in extent, then an immediate means of increasing den site availability for the species is required. The results of a recent investigation into nest-box use by the species in lowland swamp forest demonstrate that high rates of occupancy can be achieved by targeting established colonies at sites where the vegetation structure is suitable for box installation. This suggests that nest boxes can be an effective means of increasing den-site availability for the possum, and therefore have considerable potential to contribute to the species' conservation in the short term. Such measures should be applied in conjunction with altered forestry practises that better provide for the retention and future provision of mature hollow-bearing trees.

We took advantage of a unique opportunity to use a before-after/control-impact (BACI) approach to analyze changes in bird assemblages after the severe fires of 2000 in the Bitterroot Valley, Montana. Observers surveyed birds using 10-minute point counts and collected vegetation data from 13 burned and 13 unburned transects for five years before fire and three years after fire. We compared changes in vegetation variables and relative bird abundance from before to after fire between the set of points that burned and the set of points that did not burn. The magnitude of change in vegetation variables from before to after fire increased with fire severity. The relative abundances of nine bird species showed significantly greater changes from before to after fire at burned points compared with unburned points. Moreover, when burned points were separated by whether they burned at low, moderate, or high severity, an additional 10 species showed significant changes in relative abundance from before to after fire at one or more severities. Overall, almost twice as many bird species increased as decreased significantly in response to fire. We also found changes in abundance between one year after and two years after fire for most species that responded to fire. Thus, species that have been termed "mixed responders" in the literature appear to be responding differently to different fire severities or different time periods since fire, rather than responding variably to the same fire conditions. These findings underscore the importance of fire severity and time since fire and imply that both factors must be considered to understand the complexities of fire effects on biological communities. Because different bird species responded positively to different fire severities, our results suggest a need to manage public lands for the maintenance of all kinds of fires, not just the low-severity, understory burns that dominate most discussions revolving around the use of fire in forest restoration.

To facilitate development of conservation strategies, we used DNA sequences and RAPDs (random amplified polymorphic DNA) to examine differences among populations of this species. Phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome b revealed a clade of haplotypes from populations north of the Columbia River derived from a clade containing haplotypes from the river's southwestern region. Haplotypes from southeastern populations formed a separate clade. Nucleotide diversity was reduced in northern populations relative to southern populations. These results were corroborated by analyses of RAPD loci, which revealed similar patterns of clustering and diversity. Network analyses suggested that northern populations were colonized following a range expansion mediated by individuals from populations located southwest of the river. Changes in the Columbia River's location during the Pliocene and Pleistocene likely released distributional constraints on this species, permitting their northern range expansion. Based on the barrier presented by the Columbia River's present location and differences in haplotype diversity and population structure observed between northern and southern populations, we suggest that designation of separate management units encompassing each region may assist with mitigating different threats to this species.

Bird surveys were started in 1996 on two burned and two unburned sections of the park to determine what effects the burning and subsequent changes in vegetation were having on bird populations. Birds were sampled at 17 60-m radius point counts on each study area; each point was sampled twice per year during the main breeding period from 1996 through 2002. Total abundance and species richness differed among the four areas but no differences could be attributed to burning. Some individual species, however, differed in abundance and frequency of occurrence between burned and unburned areas. For example, Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), and several species of woodpeckers were more abundant on burned areas; Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vemivorous), Wood Thrush (Hylocicla mustelina) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) were among the species more abundant on unburned areas. As a consequence, overall community composition differed significantly between burned and unburned areas of the park, but did not differ between burned areas or between unburned areas. Prescribed burning was instituted to restore vegetation to presettlement conditions and has started to achieve that objective. Restoration also has affected and likely will continue to affect bird populations. Future maintenance of a full complement of bird species, including a number of neotropical migrants, will be dependent on presence of both burned and unburned forest habitat. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of season (growing vs. dormant) and frequency (1 to greater than or equal to4 yr since burning) of fire on density of Bachman's sparrows, however, is poorly understood. We examined effects of fire on density of Bachman's sparrows in longleaf pine forests at the Conecuh National Forest, Alabama, and Blackwater River State Forest, Florida, USA. Density of Bachman's sparrows was greater the first 3 years after burning than greater than or equal to4 years after burning, and season of burning had little effect on the density of Bachman's sparrows. Percent coverage by grass had a greater influence on density of Bachman's sparrows than either season or frequency of burning. Percent canopy cover had a strong negative effect on coverage of grass but had a weaker effect on grass at stands burned frequently during the growing season. Growing-season fires (Apr-Sep) did not adversely affect density of Bachman's sparrows. Results from our study suggest that management and restoration of longleaf pine communities probably can be accomplished best by burning on a 2-3-year rotation during the growing season, when most fires historically occurred. Suppression of fire, or burning at intervals >4-5 years, will greatly reduce or eliminate habitat required by Bachman's sparrows.

Large amounts of necromass, including snags, were present in 5-y-old logged and unlogged forest, but dead wood was in low abundance in 10-y-old logged forest. The absence or scarcity of large, snag-foraging woodpeckers from older logged stands suggests that this resource may remain in low abundance for a considerable time.

We examined avian community response to pine-grassland restoration for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and traditional United States Forest Service pine sawtimber management at Homochitto National Forest, Mississippi from 1994-1996. Thirteen species were more abundant in pine-grassland restoration stands, whereas 5 species were more abundant in traditionally managed pine sawtimber stands. Mature restored pine-grassland stands had greater avian species richness, total bird abundance, and avian conservation value than traditionally managed pine sawtimber stands. We used logistic regression models in an exploratory analysis to predict occurrence of selected species using stand- and landscape-scale habitat characteristics. Probability of red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus) occurrence increased with increasing hardwood canopy cover, and probability of yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) occurrence increased with increasing grass ground cover. Species richness, total avian abundance, and occurrence of red-eyed vireos and Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) increased with increasing values of Shannon's Habitat Diversity Index. Pine-grassland restoration for red-cockaded woodpeckers created vegetation composition and structure at the stand and landscape scales that may benefit numerous avian species of regional conservation concern.

However, little is understood about the time frame and the variables affecting occupancy of postfire habitats by these birds. We studied factors influencing the occupancy and reuse of nest cavities from 1-7 years after fire in two burned sites of western Idaho during 1994-1999. Tree cavities were used for nesting by 12 species of cavity nesters that were classified by the original occupant (strong excavator, weak excavator, or nonexcavator) of 385 nest cavities. We used logistic regression to model cavity occupancy by strong excavators (n = 575 trials) and weak excavators (n = 206 trials). Year after fire had the greatest influence on occupancy of nest cavities for both groups, while site of the burn was secondarily important in predicting occupancy by strong excavators and less important for weak excavators. Predicted probability of cavity occupancy was highest during the early years (1-4) after fire, declined over time (5-7 years after fire), and varied by site, with a faster decline in the smaller burned site with a greater mosaic of unburned forest. Closer proximity and greater interspersion of unburned forest (15% unburned) may have allowed a quicker recolonization by nest predators into the smaller burn compared to the larger burn with few patches of unburned forest (4% unburned). In combination with time and space effects, the predicted probability of cavity occupancy was positively affected by tree and nest heights for strong and weak excavators, respectively.

The relationship assumed is usually one of woodpecker dependence or preference for partially decayed wood in which to excavate cavities, but the woodpecker is also sometimes suggested as a vector for the fungus. In this paper we review such associations and describe patterns evident among woodpecker nest sites that suggest microclimatic and microhabitat characteristics favoring fungal colonization of trees, wood-pecker-favorable responses of trees to fungi, and ultimate use of the trees for woodpecker cavity excavation. Factors that favor fungal invasion and tree use by woodpeckers include tree species, growth history, site characteristics such as proximity to water and exposure to sun or shade, nature and position of tree injury, local climate, forest age and species composition, fire frequency, and human management activities. Woodpecker cavity height and entrance orientation may be related to the dispersal dynamics of fungi, which in turn may be related to forest vegetation, thermal, and hydric characteristics.

We studied the nesting biology of Southeastern American Kestrels in 1999 and 2000 at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, in old-growth longleaf pine savanna, a habitat type historically widely occupied by the kestrels. Most of the nest cavities we observed were in old-growth trees, both living and dead, and were originally excavated by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and then enlarged by other woodpecker species. Nesting success was 70% in 1999 and 56% in 2000. In 1999, 67% of eggs survived to become fledglings in successful nests, as did 58% in 2000. Nests in live pines and snags were equally successful, and nest success was positively related to cavity height in 1999. Reduced nesting success in 2000 may have been related to severe drought conditions. High nesting concentrations of up to 4 pairs per km(2) were observed. We suggest that stands of old-growth longleaf pine, with little or no hardwood midstory and a relatively high number of snags, inhabited by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, may constitute high quality habitat for Southeastern American Kestrels. Therefore, loss of longleaf pine habitat, degradation of remaining longleaf habitat due to fire suppression and removal of old-growth and snags, and the decline of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker, a species on which kestrels may have depended as a source of nest cavities historically, may have contributed to the decline of the Southeastern American Kestrel.

A single-grip harvester was coupled with either a forwarder or a skyline yarding system, and operational economics, fuel reduction, stand damage, soil disturbance, effects on soil biota and down-woody material were measured in three replicates of paired stands. After logging with the harvester, the two log-extraction systems achieved nearly equivalent fuel reduction with 45.7 and 46.8% mass reduction by the forwarder and skyline system, respectively. Fine-woody fuel increased slightly in all units, but mass of heavy fuels decreased. Most mass reduction in the forest floor occurred in the duff layer with 56 and 49% reduction in forwarder and skyline units, respectively. Reduction in stem density and basal area were similar for the two extraction systems; in forwarder units stem density was reduced by 61.6% and basal area by 55.4%, while in skyline units stem density was reduced by 66.5% and basal area by 51.1%. Of seedlings and trees examined, 32% had noticeable damage after harvest. Damage included bole wounding (38.9% of damaged stems), bark scraping (35.0%), wrenched stems (28.9%), broken branches (26.5%), broken terminal leaders (15.4%), and crushed foliage (4.1%). More damage occurred to residual large trees than to seedlings. Both log-extraction systems met the silvicultural prescription of reducing fuel and protecting residual large-diameter western larch, Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir, and lodgepole pine. While fuel, stem, and basal area reduction lowered fire risk from a model 10 to a model 8 in all stands, large-woody material for wildlife also changed. Mean log length was lower in harvested units relative to unharvested controls, but this did not decrease occupation of logs by ants or the activities of woodpeckers feeding on them. Of 37 logged hectares, 1.4% (0.5 ha) of the soil area was compacted, mostly in forwarder units, within landings, and within trails close to landings. The percent area with displaced soil varied from 5 to 43% among units and was located within trails or in intertrail areas between the trails. Light displacement of soil resulted in a short-term increase in the abundance of soil microarthropods. The effects of compaction on litter microarthropods was more persistent, with lower numbers in compacted litter a year after harvest. While revenue was similar for forwarder and skyline units ($68 vs. $70/metric ton, respectively), total operational costs were $81/metric ton in the skyline units, compared to $46/metric ton in the forwarder units. These results are discussed in the context of options available to managers for balancing fuel reduction needs with both environmental and economic constraints.

During both spring and fall, species richness and relative abundance of neotropical migrants were greatest in oak hammocks and riparian habitats. During spring, the abundance of resident species was greatest in barrier island scrub and flatwoods, but species richness of residents also was high in oak hammocks. During fall, both species richness and abundance of residents were greatest in oak hammocks and flatwoods. Analyses of abundance for individual species (both neotropical migrants and residents) suggested that each habitat examined was important for greater than or equal to1 species. An analysis examining the importance of habitats for conservation found that oak hammocks and riparian habitats were important for species of high management concern, but burned sandhills along with oak hammocks and riparian habitats were very important for species of the greatest management concern. Our results suggest that habitat modifications resulting from restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem will benefit many species of management concern. Bird species negatively affected by habitat modifications for longleaf pine restoration were abundant in other habitats.

We searched for signs of foraging (bark flaking and excavation holes) by Black-backed Woodpeckers on 6,536 snags sampled in 56 plots located in portions of the burned forest that had not been salvage logged. A logistic regression model was developed based on the presence or absence of foraging signs. Results showed that Black-backed Woodpeckers used larger snags that were less deteriorated by fire (qualified as high-quality snags). Direct field observations of individuals foraging on 119 snags also indicated that used snags corresponded to those of high predicted quality. Finally, we assessed the relationship between food availability and snag characteristics by measuring the density of wood-boring beetle larvae holes on 30 snags of different size and deterioration classes. High-quality snags contained higher prey densities (Vood-boring beetle holes) than smaller and more deteriorated snags. We recommend that forest blocks characterized by large and less deteriorated trees be preserved from salvage logging in recently burned boreal forests in northeastern North America.

In a burnt area of eastern Finland, where the woodpecker breeding population has been continuously diminishing, following a major increase the first year after fire, only the abundance of spruce bark beetles (Col., Scolytidae) (the woodpecker autumn-spring main insect prey) decreased through the years. Conversely, the abundance of longhorn beetles (Col., Cerambycidae) (the nestling main food supply) increased dramatically. On the other hand, in neighbouring old-growth patches where one pair was breeding annually, abundance of spruce bark and longhorn beetles did not change significantly between years, although the abundance level of the bark beetles differed among patches. Hence, my results suggest the woodpecker breeding population to be limited by food supply available outside the breeding season, as shown for other forest bird species. The finding, however, that woodpeckers breeding 6-7 years after the fire reared larger broods than earlier pairs, while brood size did not change annually under old-growth conditions, suggests longhorn beetle availability to be critical to reproductive success.

The difficulty surrounding the notion of landscape connectivity is that it must be assessed at the scale of the interaction between an organism and the landscape. We present a unique method for measuring connectivity between patches as a function of organism vagility. We used this approach to assess connectivity between harvest, old-growth, and recent wildfire patches in a real forested landscape in southeast British Columbia. By varying a distance criterion, habitat patches were considered connected and formed habitat clusters if they fell within this critical distance. The amount of area and distance to edge within clusters at each critical distance formed the basis of connectivity between patches. We then assessed landscape connectivity relative to old-growth associates within our study area based on species' dispersal abilities. Connectivity was greatest between harvest patches, followed by old-growth, and then wildfire patches. In old-growth patches, we found significant trends between increased connectivity and increased total habitat amount, and between decreased connectivity and increased old-growth harvesting. Highly vagile old-growth associates, such as carnivorous birds, perceive this landscape as connected and are able to access all patches. Smaller, less vagile species, such as woodpeckers, chickadees, and nuthatches, may be affected by a lack of landscape connectivity at the scale of their interaction with old-growth patches. Of particular concern is the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus), which we predict is limited in this landscape due to relatively weak dispersal abilities.

We examined black-backed and three-toed woodpecker occupancy of stands in a 2-year post-fire forest, mature and old-growth spruce and pine forests, and six post-fire coniferous forests of different ages. Three-toeds were detected in old stands and in the 2-year-old burn, and their probability of occupancy of burned forests decreased between 3 and 8 years post-fire. Within 50 km of the 2-year-old burn, black-backs were only detected in the burn and not in old-growth or mature conifer stands. However, they did occupy old coniferous stands located 75 and 150 km from the recent burn. They had a similar probability of occupying stands in the 3-, 4-, and 8-year-old burns but were not detected in the 16-year-old burn. The persistence of three-toed woodpeckers in boreal Alberta will likely depend on the presence of both old-growth and recently burned coniferous forests or forests with old-growth structural characteristics. Black-backed woodpeckers appear to be more burn dependent than three-toeds, and their long-term persistence may depend on the frequency of recently burned forests within their dispersal range.

To determine northern bobwhite (hereafter, bobwhite) population response in untreated control, thinned, and thinned and burned stands either 1, 2, or 3 growing seasons (Mar to mid-Oct) post-burn, we used whistling-male counts and covey-call counts as indices of population abundance. We estimated woody stem density, understory and overstory canopy cover, conifer and hardwood basal area, and the disc of vulnerability to characterize habitat response. Relative abundance of whistling males in the spring was greatest in thinned stands 3 growing seasons post-burn and in thinned but unburned stands. These stands had the smallest disc of vulnerability and the greatest understory shrub cover <2 in in height compared with other treatments. A threshold-like increase in bobwhite abundance was observed as a function of woody structure <2 in. Pine-grassland restoration provided suitable structure for bobwhites in spring, summer, and fall, but may not be adequate in winter. Further, data suggested that bobwhite density within a stand also was related to the amount of suitable habitat Surrounding the stand. Bobwhite management efforts in similar shortleaf pine forests should include thinning to reduce midstory and overstory cover and frequent fire to maintain open woodland conditions-i.e., low basal area stands with limited midstory.

We examined breeding bird response to habitat restoration in longleaf pine sandhill forests of northwest Florida, USA. We compared habitat variables and abundance of breeding birds among 3 hardwood reduction techniques (prescribed spring burning, herbicide application, mechanical felling-girdling) and maintenance of fire exclusion (control). We also examined abundance of breeding birds in fire-maintained, non-experimental reference sites as a means to gauge management success based on similarity analysis. All 3 hardwood reduction methods decreased midstory hard-woods and canopy cover, and increased herbaceous cover compared with fire-suppressed control plots, but had little effect on longleaf pine basal area. Midstory hardwood reduction methods increased the similarity of the breeding bird species assemblages to those found in the reference plots, compared with the fire-excluded control plots. Species that most strongly contributed to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were, in decreasing order of importance: red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), and brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla). Depending on the similarity index used, additional but weaker contributors to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), and Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). Species associated with hardwoods (e.g., tufted titruouse, northern cardinal, Carolina chickadee) contributed to greater similarity ol'the reference condition by decreasing in abundance after hardwood reduction, whereas open-habitat species increased in numbers, compared with birds on the fire-excluded control plots. Only the detection rates of cardinals and Carolina chickadees were not different among hardwood reduction methods. Two notable species of concern that increased in all hardwood reduction plots compared with the control, but were not strong contributors of the similarity to the reference condition, were northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and southeastern American kestrel (Falco sparverius paulus). Our results suggest that these management methods were beneficial to landbirds characteristic of fire-maintained longleaf pine sandhills in northwest Florida. However, northern bobwhites and Bachman's sparrows may require more intensive management than red-cockaded woodpeckers, such as shorter burn intervals, as these species depend directly on ground cover vegetation. We recommend prescribed spring burning as the most economical and ecologically desirable method for managing breeding bird habitat in longleaf pine sandhill forests.

We surveyed birds and sampled vegetation along 1-km line transects bisecting 14 (7 control, 7 burn) 25-ha Plots located randomly within a burn and adjacent, control unit. Following a spring burn that was moderate in intensity and patchy ill areal extent, we observed that ground Cover was affected more strongly by burning than mesquite (Prosopis) cover, smaller mesquite were affected more strongly by burning than larger mesquite, and mortality of mesquite was low. No change in total abundance of birds was detected oil the burn unit following fire for either wintering or breeding birds; however, species richness of breeding birds decreased in the first war post-burn. During the breeding season, mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) increased, whereas Botteri's sparrows (Aimophila botterii), Cassin's sparrows (Aimophila and cassinii), and (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus) decreased in relative abundance following fire. During the wintering season, ladder-backed woodpeckers (Picoides scalaris) and vesper sparrows (Pooeceles gramineus) increased and cactus wrens decreased in relative abundance following fire. Beyond species-level trends, we found stronger evidence of trends and greater magnitudes of relative change for breeding species associated with open grasslands compared to those associated with shrubs. The use of spring burns on the Refuge will likely improve conditions for open-grassland species that were historically more abundant by killing smaller mesquite and reducing mesquite recruitment. However, more intense and extensive fires will be required to reduce the presence of larger mesquite. Such fires would likely have a greater impact oil birds associated with shrubs, and consequently, a greater impact oil the avian community as a whole.

Recent incentives have led to increased interest in longleaf pine restoration. These restoration efforts often emphasize reestablishing native groundcovers, yet there have been no studies that address the role of native groundcover on breeding bird communities within longleaf pine forests. Therefore, we studied breeding bird communities in mature longleaf pine stands with either native or disturbed groundcovers to determine the likely effects of groundcover reestablishment associated with longleaf pine reforestation. Avian species richness and diversity did not differ (P=0.823, P=0.571, respectively), and avian community similarity was high (Morisita's index=0.98) between native and disturbed groundcover. However, pine warblers (Dendroica pinus), gray cat-birds (Dumetella carolinensis), eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) were more abundant (Pless than or equal to0.10) in areas with native groundcover, whereas indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) were more abundant (P=0.058) in areas with disturbed groundcover. Although groundcover restoration may benefit some avian populations, overall avian species richness, diversity, and community composition may be unaffected. Restoration of native groundcover may be best justified for aesthetic values and as a tool to facilitate long-term stand management using prescribed fire.

In an effort to understand how avian communities may be affected by a regional change in forest composition from oak to maple dominance, we compared bird communities in both Oak- and maple-dominated forest stands in three seasons (winter, spring, and fall). In 1998 and 1999, birds were surveyed and habitat characteristics were measured in six mature forest woodlots in central Pennsylvania. Total abundance of birds was greater within Oak- than maple-dominated stands in all seasons, whereas species richness was greater in oak stands only in the spring. Resident species, long-distance migrants, woodpeckers, bark-gleaners, and 11 individual species were more abundant within oak than maple stands in at least one season. Differences in avian community structure between oak and maple stands were greatest in the fall when oaks produced hard mast and in the spring when insectivorous birds gleaned arthropods from tree substrates. This pattern was consistent with our expectations based on mast characteristics and tree physiognomy of maples and oaks as well as the diet and foraging behavior of birds. Our results suggest that a regional change from Oak- to maple-dominated forests may strongly affect avian community structure and populations of some common bird species associated with eastern deciduous forests.

We describe an efficient method for sampling wood-boring beetle larvae, an important food of many woodpeckers, beneath the bark of fire-killed trees. The method involves taking two 225-cm(2) bark samples from each tree, and provides enough information to rank most trees by relative wood-borer abundance. At two sites in the northern Rocky Mountains, we tested the reliability of this method by comparing its results to those of a more intensive sampling scheme. For 65 trees of four species, we collected eight bark samples at two different heights, 1.7 m and 6 m, and compared correlations between the smaller, ground-based sampling scheme (two bark samples) and the larger, eight-sample effort. With one exception, correlations for individual tree species ranged from 0.79 to 0.95, indicating that the smaller sample gave rankings of insect abundance comparable to those of the larger sample. Correlation strengths differed between sites, suggesting that the larger sample Could be employed at future sites to fine-rune the smaller sampling scheme. Correlations for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) at one site were very low, suggesting that wood-borers may colonize ponderosa pine in a manner different from the other tree species studied. The strong correlations produced by this test indicate that, with limited effort and training, even small field crews (e.g., two workers) can use this method to rank the foraging resources contained in dead trees.

The effects of Red-cockaded Woodpecker management on winter birds in longleaf pine sandhill forests are largely unknown. Examining habitat use of winter migrants, some of which are declining, may influence the selection of habitat management techniques used for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers to benefit overwintering migrants. During the winters (December-February) of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999, we tested experimentally the effects of hardwood reduction treatments applied in 1995 on winter birds at Eglin Air Force Base in fire-excluded northwest Florida longleaf pine sandhills. Treatments were (1) prescribed spring burning, (2) herbicide application, (3) mechanical felling and girdling, and (4) a control where decades of fire exclusion was maintained. We also sampled winter bird flocks in frequently burned, nonexperimental reference plots to measure management success. Hardwood reduction techniques had no effect on flock species richness, which averaged 7.9 and 7.2, respectively, during 1997-1993 and 1998-1999. Larger flocks in felling and girdling and in herbicide plots were primarily due to significantly higher numbers of overwintering Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina), as well as resident Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and an influx of temperate migrant Pine Warblers (Dendroica pinus). In contrast, flocks in control plots were smaller (flock size and species composition in spring burn plots were intermediate) and composed of hardwood-associated species, such as Tufted Titmouse (Bacolophus bicolor) and Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). The relative uses of longleaf pines and hardwoods by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, Pine Warblers, and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) during both winters best explained that winter birds present in herbicide, felling and girdling, and reference plots were more likely to forage on the same tree species and substrates than birds in spring-burned plots, and least likely to forage on the same species and substrates as birds in the control plots. Those differences corresponded to the following increasing order of hardwood stem mortality among treatments: control, spring burn (41%), felling and girdling (62%), and herbicide (92%). Repeated burning is recommended to restore the reference foraging condition because it was eight times less expensive than other techniques, which favored mostly Chipping Sparrows.

WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN			English	Article	Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences (ABES)	ENVIRONMENT/ECOLOGY	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	fire-maintained ecosystems, Picoides borealis, red-cockaded woodpecker, wilderness	EASTERN TEXAS, FOREST, POPULATION, REINTRODUCTION, FRAGMENTATION, DYNAMICS	The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) is well adapted to fire-maintained pine ecosystems of the southeastern United States. Management practices vary greatly among land ownerships. In some wilderness areas and state parks, a "no management" policy has eliminated use of prescribed fire, artificial cavities, and woodpecker translocation, tools that have proved effective elsewhere in recovering woodpecker populations. We compared forests with essentially "no management'' to actively managed forests of similar tree ages and similar red-cockaded woodpecker population demographics. We also compared sites that had received no management in the past to the same sites after management. In every case, populations in forests that did riot use state-of-the-art management for woodpeckers declined severely compared to those in managed forests. Because managed forests typically used all available management techniques concurrently, it was not possible to separate and rank effectiveness of specific management activities. One exception was the Wade Tract in Georgia, where prescribed fire was the primary activity for herbaceous layer and hardwood management in a high-density, stable woodpecker population. Wilderness areas, which are intended to be pristine places that preserve biodiversity, are losing red-cockaded woodpeckers, a keystone species in the ecosystem, at an alarming rate. Collectively, 9 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers were present in 4 wilderness areas in Texas national forests in 1983. At the close of the millennium, only one woodpecker group remained and its continued existence is unlikely without management. The very fragmented features of present-day landscapes and intervention by humans impair the effectiveness of natural disturbance processes, primarily growing-season fire, that historically produced and maintained open pine savannas with grass-forb herbaceous layers in the pre-Columbian forests of the southeastern U.S. therefore, active management must be used if the red-cockaded woodpecker is to persist.

No prior study, however, has demonstrated the relative importance of crown-burned forests to this woodpecker species by examining its reproductive success in different forest types. We studied breeding Lewis's Woodpeckers in cottonwood (Populus fremontii) riparian forest patches of Colorado and crown-burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of Idaho to compare their reproductive success, productivity, and potential source-sink status in the two forest types. Daily nest survival rates were significantly lower in cottonwood compared to burned pine forests. Nesting success was 46% (n=65) in cottonwood forests and 78% (n=283) in burned pine forests. Proportion of nests destroyed by predators was significantly higher in cottonwood forests (34%) compared to burned pine forests (16%). We consistently found crown-burned forests to be potential source habitat, whereas cottonwood riparian sites were more often concluded to be potential sink habitat. Cottonwood riparian forests were Surrounded primarily by an agricultural landscape where the composition and abundance of nest predators was likely very different than the predator assemblage occupying a large-scale burn in a relatively natural landscape. Conversion of riparian and adjacent grassland landscapes to agriculture and prevention of wildfire in ponderosa pine forests have likely reduced nesting habitat for this species. Prescribed understory fire is the prevailing management tool for restoring ponderosa pine ecosystems. Conditions created by crown fire may be equally important in maintaining ponderosa pine systems and conserving nesting habitat for the Lewis's Woodpecker.

In North America, these habitats or ecosystems include grasslands or prairies, shrublands, savannas, early successional forests, and floodplains. Whereas the extent of all natural habitats has diminished significantly owing to outright loss from agriculture and development, the suppression of disturbance by agents such as fire and flooding has led to further losses. Accordingly, the abundances of many bird species adapted to disturbance-mediated habitats have declined as well. In North America, these declines have been more severe and common than those of species associated with less frequently disturbed habitats such as mature or closed-canopy forests. Field studies consistently reveal the direct role of disturbance and successional processes in structuring avian habitats and communities. Conservation strategies involving the management of disturbance through some combination of flooding, application of fire, or the expression of wildfire, and use of certain types of silviculture have the potential to diversify avian habitats at the local, landscape, and regional scale. Many aspects of the disturbance ecology of birds require further research. Important questions involve associations between the intensity and frequency of disturbance and the viability of bird populations, the scale of disturbance with respect to the spatial structure of populations, and the role of natural vs. anthropogenic disturbance. The effects of disturbance and ensuing successional processes on birds are potentially long-term, and comprehensive monitoring is essential.

Those bird species of concern that occur in forested habitats in eastern Oregon and Washington include the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), harlequin duck (Histrionicus histrionicus), upland sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda), northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis), and black rosy finch (Leucosticte arctoa). In addition, seven species of woodpeckers and nuthatches were considered because of their rare status. Forest disturbances that create dead trees and logs are critical to cavity-nesting birds because the dead trees with their subsequent decay provide nesting and roosting habitat. The insects associated with outbreaks or dead trees provide prey for the woodpeckers and nuthatches. The loss of nest or roost trees as a result of disturbance could be detrimental to bald eagles, goshawks, or ferruginous hawks, while the loss of canopy cover could be detrimental to harlequin ducks and goshawks or to prey of some of the raptors. The more open canopies created by thinning may be beneficial to a species like the black rosy finch, yet detrimental to some woodpeckers due to a decrease in cover. Prescribed burning may be beneficial to those woodpeckers primarily associated with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands and detrimental to other woodpeckers because of the loss of coarse woody debris. Removal of roads is likely to benefit most of these species because of the subsequent decrease in human activity. Recovery plans for bald eagles and peregrine falcons are available for managers to use in managing habitat for these species.

A high proportion of these species is forest living, and large numbers are dependent on decaying wood. Biodiversity can be assessed at various scales using two different principles. One is to use features. such as ancient and dead trees, known to be important for a large number of species. The other method is to choose species or groups of species known to indicate high biodiversity or presence of many red-listed species. We argue that any serious biodiversity assessment method should include the most species rich organism groups, for example insects. In the present paper we point out the most important features for high biodiversity (old trees and large dead trees), and review the quantities of these features in near-virgin forests. The natural disturbance regime of a region should be the basis for defining a suitable scale and the appropriate features for biodiversity assessment. Possible indicator species for high biodiversity in northern Europe are suggested. based on previous investigations. Among epiphytic lichens and wood-living beetles there are many potentially useful species in addition to vascular plants in the nemoral forest. Among vertebrates, woodpeckers and grouses seem to be the most useful. Validation tests for indicator structures and species are largely lacking but urgently needed. The implications of possible delayed local extinctions tire important to bear in mind when managing for sustainable forestry. The knowledge of forest history is useful when developing cost-efficient measures.

One proposed solution is large-scale conversion of these forests to seral conditions that emulate those assumed to exist before European settlement: open-spaced stands (ca, 50 trees per ha), consisting primarily of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt,), We question how well presettlement forest conditions are understood and the feasibility and desirability of conversion to a seral state that represents those conditions. Current and future expectations of forest outputs and values are far different from those at presettlement times. Emphasis on prescribed fire for achieving and maintaining this conversion raises questions about how well we understand fire effects on forest resources and values. We consider here potential effects of prescribed fire on two key aspects of forest management-productivity and wildlife. Use of large-scale prescribed fire presents complex problems with potential long-term effects on forest resources, Before implementing prescribed fire widely, we need to understand the range of its effects on all resources and values. Rather than attempting to convert forests to poorly described and understood presettlement seral conditions, it would seem prudent to examine present forest conditions and assess their potential to provide desired resource outputs and values, Once this is achieved, the full complement of forest management tools and strategies, including prescribed fire, should be used to accomplish the desired objectives. We suggest a more conservative approach until prescribed fire effects are better understood. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In October 1992, September 1993 and May-August 1994, we systematically assessed the avifauna of fifteen South Coast forest fragments land the threats facing them) using mist-netting, timed species counts and direct observations. Sixty forest-dependent bird species were recorded, amongst them three that are globally threatened (Sokoke Pipit Anthus sokokensis, Spotted Ground Thrush Turdus fischeri, East Coast Akalat Sheppardia gunningi) three that are near-threatened (Southern Banded Snake Eagle Circaetus fasciolatus, Fischer's Turaco Tauraco fischeri, Plain-backed Sunbird Anthreptes reichenowi) and four that are 'restricted-range' (Fischer's Turaco, Sokoke Pipit, Mombasa Woodpecker Campethera mombassica, Uluguru Violet-backed Sunbird Anthreptes neglectus). Globally or regionally threatened and near-threatened species were relatively rare and were patchily distributed across forests. In contrast, most other forest species were widely distributed being present in most or all fragments. The breakdown of traditional conservation systems, selective logging, encroachment by cultivation and fire-maintained grassland, fragmentation, allocation of land for urban development, pole cutting, charcoal burning, hunting and trapping, prospective mining, bark stripping and elephant damage are the major threats to the continued survival of these forests. Shimba Hills (Mkongani & Longomagandi), Gandini, Mrima, Marenji, Dzombo, Waa, Buda and Gongoni forests met the criteria for Globally Important Bird Areas set by Birdlife International.

However, there have been few studies of the effects of fire on the avifauna during the restoration process. To study the effects of oak savanna restoration on avian communities, breeding birds were censused and the vegetation structure documented in seven experimental burn units (8-18 ha) that had experienced different frequencies of controlled burns during the past 31 years (0-26 burns). Data were analyzed with both direct and indirect gradient analyses using multivariate techniques. The results showed that, as savanna restoration proceeded, there was a general decline in predominantly insectivorous species, particularly those that feed in the upper canopy region (leaves and air space), and a general increase in omnivorous species, particularly those that feed on the ground and in the lower canopy. Insectivorous bark gleaners (woodpeckers) also increased during restoration and were correlated with the increase in standing dead trees resulting from the fires. Overall, savanna restoration resulted in increases in the abundance of many open country bird species, including many species that have been declining in central and eastern North America, including red-headed woodpecker, Baltimore oriole, eastern kingbird, vesper sparrow, field sparrow, lark sparrow, brown thrasher, American goldfinch, and brown-headed cowbird. The shifts in species and guilds were correlated with changes in burn frequency and the macro vegetation structure-tree and shrub density, leaf area index, and relative proportion of standing dead trees. The findings show that savanna restoration can increase bird diversity and provide important habitat for uncommon or declining bird species. These birds are most likely attracted to one or more of the distinctive habitat features of the restored savanna environments, including scattered mature trees, standing dead trees and snags, and presence of both shrubby and grassland vegetation. The findings also suggest that restoration ecologists and wildlife biologists will need to work together to achieve desired goals, since different types of savanna restoration efforts may produce different effects on the breeding bird community.

We conducted a 4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning and forest thinning on breeding wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR) in Georgia. We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates, and apparent annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry: and mist netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities (P = 0.25); wood thrush density ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/10 ha. No radiomarked male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4 years, but female weekly survival was 0.981 +/- 0.014 (SE) for females (n = 63) and 0.976 +/- 0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual adult survival was 0.579 (SE = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed burning did not reduce adult or juvenile survival during the breeding season or apparent annual adult survival. Annual population growth (lambda) at PNWR was 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32-1.63), and the considerable uncertainty in this prediction underscores the need for long-term monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants. Population growth increased on experimental compartments after the burn and thin (95% CI before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05), while control compartment lambda declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after = 0.87-0.92).

In Quebec, where the boreal forest is largely dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands, we surveyed 140 point-count stations in 3 postlogging and 4 postfire development stages determined according to the height of the regenerating spruce trees. Species richness did not vary among forest development stages, but bird abundance was higher in recent clearcuts. Recently disturbed areas were characterized by open-land bird assemblages dominated by Neotropical migrants, which reached their highest abundance in clearcuts. Moreover, logged stands were distinguished from burned sites by the absence of cavity-nesting birds. Forest-bird assemblages reestablished themselves as soon as young spruces reached the sapling stage. However, the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), and Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) were restricted to mature stands or recent burns and are thus likely to be negatively affected by modern forestry, which involves fire suppression and short logging rotations. We suggest that retention of larger areas of continuous mature forest might be essential to maintain these species in managed regions.

We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having greater than or equal to 95% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with I-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfire than on postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Redstart (Setophaga rutticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of standing dead trees on the landscape.

Compared to breeding bird censuses conducted in secondary stands of the same forest type, total breeding-season density of birds was 63% higher in the Savage Gulf old growth. Large, widely distributed softwood snags enhanced the abundances of both primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds. Like other eastern old-growth forests with complex canopies, the Savage Gulf oak-pine forest contained high densities of arboreal Parulinae: yellow-throated warbler (Dendroica dominica [L.]) and pine warbler (D. pinus [Wilson]). Two raptors more commonly associated with riparian and mesic forests, the red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus [Gmelin]) and barred owl (Strix varia Barton), were unexpected breeding residents in this well-drained, upland forest site. Two species of pines-shortleaf (Pinus echinata Miller) and Virginia (P. virginiana Miller)-comprised 29% of the total basal area and 40% of stem density of trees greater than or equal to 7.6 cm dbh. Pines formed a dispersed emergent canopy (to 39 m) over a lower canopy dominated by white oak (Quercus alba L.) and northern red oak (Q. rubra L.). Individual shortleaf pines exceeded 84 cm dbh and were 230-270 years of age. Measurements of eight attributes of vegetation structure generally met or exceeded values proposed independently for old-growth condition in this forest type.

We estimated species abundance, richness, and evenness using data from 312 point counts in 18 burned sites and sis unburned sites. We measured gross habitat features in 0.04-ha circles centered on each point count station. We calculated productivity estimates at nests of seven of the most common nesting species. Habitat components we measured in 1-, 2-, and 3-yr post-burn sites were similar, but most components differed between burned and unburned sites. Although 98 species were detected during point counts, we report only on the 46 species that nested in the area and were detected greater than or equal to 10% of the counts in either habitat class. Twenty-one species preferred burned sites and six preferred unburned sites. Avian species richness and evenness were similar for burned and unburned sites. Burned sites were preferred for nesting over unburned sites. Only nine nests of six species were found in unburned sites. Productivity; estimates were low in burned sites. One or more eggs hatched in only 59 of 187 nests monitored, and an avenge of only 0.82 chicks per nest were estimated to have fledged. Predation was the most common probable cause for nest failure, ranging from 45% in the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) to 64% in the Summer Tanager (Piranga rubra). Because the sources of predation at the refuge are unknown, future research should address this issue.

We compared bird composition and foraging behavior during the winter in burned and unburned forests. We conducted point counts during four consecutive winters immediately following a stand replacement fire. Burned and unburned forests had similar numbers of bird species, yet species composition was distinctly different. Trunk and branch foraging species were 2.5 times more abundant in burned forest than in unburned forest. Within burned forests, trunk and branch foraging species significantly decreased from the first winter post-fire to the fourth winter post-fire. We conducted foraging observations of four woodpecker species within burned forests only. Woodpeckers used western larch (Larix occidentalis), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) snags that were greater than 23 cm in diameter. Stand replacement fires may play an important role in maintaining populations of trunk and branch foraging species in mixed coniferous forests in northeastern Washington.

Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) killed as part of a forest management project to reduce dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium sp.) in the Gila National Forest, New Mexico, were evaluated for wildlife value. One hundred and two dwarf mistletoe-infected trees were killed by basal burning, basal girdling or by a combination of both burning and girdling. Trees began to fall within 2 years. Most killed trees (96 percent) served as forage substrate for woodpeckers. Twenty percent of the trees contained woodpecker nest cavities 7 or 9 years after treatment. Larger diameter trees of all treatments contained more cavities and stood longer than smaller diameter trees. The probability of cavity presence was best predicted by regression that included diameter and decay class. Standing life of the snag was not a significant predictor of cavity presence. The use of predictive models for analyzing the utility of snag-creation treatments is discussed.						0	4	USDA FOR SERV PNW RES STN	PORTLAND	333 SW FIRST AVE, PO BOX 3890, PUBLICATIONS DEPT, PORTLAND, OR 97208 USA	WWW.FS.FED.US/PNW	0882-5165		US FOR SERV R P PNW	USDA For.

A 1295-ha burn in 1974 and a 1590-ha burn in 1986 occurred prior to the study. Our results showed nest sites occurred in burned areas, which had more ground cover and downed logs. Birds were found in sites where visual obstruction of the sky including vegetation and burned branches was higher than non-use areas. Ninety-eight percent of nests were surrounded by burned ponderosa pine. We found 74% of the nest trees on north- to east-facing slopes. Nests occurred in clumps rather than randomly throughout the habitat. Human disturbance did not appear to be a factor in nest placement and nest trees typically did not differ in height from surrounding trees. Our results also showed that Lewis' Woodpecker nests were more common in the later burn (1986) than in the earlier burn (1974).

The purposes of our study were to test for differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek fire near Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2 years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ ha. Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts, woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986. Our results suggest the black-backed woodpecker is extremely specialized in its foraging niche, exploiting outbreaks of wood-boring beetles in dying conifers for only 2-3 years after fires. Consequently, this species may be particularly vulnerable to local and regional extinction as fire suppression intensifies and programs of intensive salvage logging are pursued following fires.

The first phase of the project is to evaluate effects of high-intensity wildfire on cavity-nesting bi rds and their associated habitats. During spring/summer 1994-1996 we monitored 695 nests of nine cavity-nesting bird species (including three Forest Service Sensitive Species: Black-backed, White-headed, and Lewis' woodpeckers) and measured vegetation at nest sites and at 90 randomly located sites. The burned forests used for study areas were created in 1992 and 1994 by primarily high-intensity wildfire, thus most standing trees were snags. Nests and vegetation were monitored in three treatments: standard-cut salvage logged, wildlife-prescription salvage logged, and unlogged controls. Tree densities for small diameter trees (>23 cm to less than or equal to 53 cm [>9" to less than or equal to 20"] diameter breast height [dbh]) in the unlogged units averaged 81 snags per ha (33 per acre) and for larger trees (>53 cm dbh [>20"]) averaged 17 snags per ha (7 per acre). In salvage-logged units about 50% of the trees were harvested, tree densities for small trees averaged 43 snags per ha (17 per acre) and for large trees ave raged 5 snags per ha (2 per acre). Lewis' Woodpecker was the most abundant (208 nests) and successful cavity nester on the 2-4 year-old burns, while Black-backed and White-headed woodpeckers were rare (23 nests). Lewis' Woodpecker and American Kestrel experienced the highest nesting success in the salvage-logged units, whereas Northern Flicker and Hairy Woodpecker were most successful in the unlogged units. All bird species selected nest sites with higher tree densities than that measured at random sites, and cavity nesters as a group selected clumps of snags rather than snags that were retained in uniform, evenly-spaced distributions. Among bird species, Black-backed Woodpeckers used nest sites with the highest tree densities, while Lewis' Woodpeckers selected relatively open nest sites. Cavity-nesters as a group selected larger diameter and more heavily decayed snags than that expected based on availability of such snags. Snags with the highest probability (>85%) of being classified as nest trees were characterized by heavy decay and broken tops that pre-dated the wildfire. We discuss management implications of stand-replacement fire and post-fire salvage logging for cavity-nesting birds. Future plans are outlined, including bird and plant responses to different fire conditions (stand-replacement fire, fire suppression, and prescribed fire). The intent of this work is to provide information on the action and no action alternatives to the Forest Health Initiative.

We studied the effect of firewood harvesting on population trends of birds during the breeding season in an oak-pine woodland in the foothills of the northern Sierra Nevada, California. During fall-winter of 1993-94, total tree basal area on 30 3.1-ha study plots was reduced by approximately 23% aa removal of commercial-grade oaks, but all old-growth trees and trees with obvious nest cavities or woodpecker granaries were preserved. An additional 30 plots represented controls. We used point counts to derive a population index of birds 1 breeding season before and 2 breeding seasons after harvesting. We detected population shifts in 14 species (7 year-round residents, 4 breeding migrants, 1 migrant, 2 winter residents), of which 10 showed consistent population increases, 2 show ed consistent population decreases, and 2 showed varying population changes in the 2 seasons after harvesting. Sh of the species that increased on harvested plots appeared to respond to the presence of brush piles. Responses of other species were less clearly linked to a particular aspect of vegetation change. Although we found a negative effect of harvesting on only 2 species, the Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis) and Hutton's vireo (Vireo huttoni), statistical power to detect anything less than total extirpation of many uncommon species was <0.8. Our results indicate that small-scale firewood harvests that reduce basal area by <25% and preserve nest cavities and granary trees have minimal negative short-term effects on most of the more common bird species present during the breeding season, but we caution that effects on uncommon species may have gone undetected. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the potential importance of site fidelity brush-pile decay and vegetation recovery in affecting species' responses over the long term.

We suspect that more information about the relation between the diet of the RCW and its habitat is needed and would permit development of better guidelines for the ANF and other populations. We studied diets of adult and nestling RCWs and their relation to variation in habitat. We found that ants were the dominant prey item by biomass (58%). Additional major items in stomachs of adult RCW's were other arthropods, fruits and seeds, and wood. Of the 4 species of ants present in samples, 74% of the biomass consisted of eggs, lan ae, pupae, and adults of the arboreal ant Crematogaster ashmeadi. Territories burned more frequently had pine trees (Pinus spp.) with a higher diversity of ant species and lower proportions of trees occupied, by C. ashmeadi than did territories burned less frequently. Also, stomach samples from adult male woodpeckers at frequently burned sites had lower proportions of ants, including C. ashmeadi. More information is needed about the dynamics of interspecific relations within arthropod communities of longleaf Dine trees (P. palustris), the importance of ants to the ecology of the RCW, and the relevance of variation in habitat to diets of RCWs.

Concern has arisen over impacts of large-scale conversion of closed-canopy forests to open pine-grassland woodlands. We evaluated how an ecosystem approach to habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected small mammals. During 2 winters wee compared small mammal occurrence and abundance in untreated pine-hardwood stands to stands following wildlife stand improvement (WSI; midstory removal), and With WSI-treated stands in the first, second, and third dormant seasons following prescribed fire. Total abundance of small mammals was highest in WSI stands and was a more direct response to WSI (change in stand structure) than to fire. Increased species richness and diversity in the second year of this study was strongly related to both WSI and fire. No species was adversely affected by WSI or by fire. Rather, WSI and fire-reduced midstory, increased dead debris in the understory, promoted herbaceous production, and increased woody sprouting. Total community abundance, richness, and diversity were lowest in untreated stands. White-footed mice (Peromyscus spp.; primarily white-footed mouse [P. leucopus]) were the dominant species, accounting for 68% of the 611 individuals collected. Restoration efforts may be particularly beneficial to generalist species such as P, leucopus as well as to more specialized species, such as golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli) and fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens) that historically may have depended upon pine-grassland habitats. Restoration of pine-grassland communities may enhance small mammal communities by reestablishing a landscape element that was present during presettlement times.

Populations of the Bachman's sparrow began declining in the 1930s, with both a dramatic retraction in geographic distribution and the extinction of many local populations. Current land management practices in the southeastern United States often focus on the habitat requirements of the red-cockaded woodpecker without considering other species with similar habitat requirements (i.e., Bachman's sparrow). We examined habitat requirements of the Bachman's sparrow on Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to determine if management practices directed at recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers are providing Bachman's sparrows with suitable habitat. Comparisons between active red-cockaded woodpecker clusters occupied (n = 8) and unoccupied (n = 13) by Bachman's sparrows showed that Bachman's sparrows selected areas with a dense understory of grasses and sparse midstory vegetation. Areas suitable for red-cockaded woodpeckers were not always suitable for Bachman's sparrows. Red-cockaded woodpeckers appear more tolerant of a hardwood midstory and do not require a dense cover of grasses and forbs. Prescribed burning is key for development and maintenance of the dense herbaceous understory preferred by Bachman's sparrow. In areas managed for red-cockaded woodpeckers, frequent (3-5 yr) burning early in the growing season appears the best way to increase habitat suitability for Bachman's sparrows.
