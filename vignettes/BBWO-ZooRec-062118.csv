Habitat loss and degradation, largely related to fire suppression, are believed to be the major causes of population declines, but these relationships are less studied at the northern range-extent. Hence, we investigated habitat selection of Bachman's Sparrow on Fort Bragg Military Installation, where vegetation is characterized by extensive fire-maintained Pinus palustris (Longleaf Pine) uplands. We surveyed breeding male sparrows using repeat-visit point-counts. We visited 182 points 3 times from April to July during the 2014 and 2015 breeding seasons. We measured vegetation and distance to other habitat features (e.g., wildlife openings, streams) at each point. We recorded presence or absence of Bachman's Sparrows and fit encounter histories into a single-season occupancy model in program Unmarked, including a year effect on detection. Occupancy probability was 0.52 and increased with greater grass-cover and at intermediate distances from wildlife openings, and decreased with years-since-fire and with greater shrub height. Predictors of Bachman's Sparrow occupancy were similar to those reported for other portions of the range, supporting the importance of frequent prescribed fire to maintain herbaceous groundcover used by birds for nesting and foraging. However, our study indicated that other habitat features (e.g., canopy openings) provided critical cover within extensive upland Longleaf Pine-Aristida stricta (Wiregrass) forest.","Fish, Alexander C.; North Carolina State Univ, Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol Program, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA, USA.",alex.c.fish@gmail.com,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Forestry",1528-7092,,"Ecology; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Peucaea aestivalis [Habitat preference / Habitat selection / ] [Forest and woodland / Woodland / ] [Fire /  / ] [Spatial environment / Habitat structure / ] [North Carolina / Sandhills physiographic region, Fort Bragg Military Installation / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Emberizidae","Peucaea aestivalis (Emberizidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15406036038,,,,,2018/06/21

Although recent studies have demonstrated increased diversity and abundance of wetland specialists after reed bed management, documenting demographic benefits to individual species would add additional support to the advantages of appropriate management. Here, we explore the effects of reed management on the philopatry of Great Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) over 7 yr. Reed beds were managed in the winter by occasional burning at mining ponds and large canals, infrequent burning in marshes, and frequent mowing of small canals. Based on resightings and recaptures of 1,243 adult and 1,428 nestlings individually marked at 57 sites in 6 different reed habitats, we built Cormack-Jolly-Seber models to estimate the apparent annual survival and encounter probabilities of birds banded as nestlings or as adults. Apparent survival varied in time for both age groups and both sexes, suggesting annual fluctuations in survival, whereas encounter probability remained constant across years. The encounter probability of birds banded as juveniles was higher in reed beds with shallower water. The encounter probability of birds banded as adults was higher in reed beds with deeper water for females, and strongly increased with variation in reed management and less strongly with variation in water depth for males. We also found that the few returning juveniles displayed strong philopatry to the reed habitat occupied in their first breeding season. Our study provides evidence that reed management influences the return rates of juveniles and adult males and females in different ways. Spatially variable reed management by mowing or burning should be applied and water of varying depths should be maintained to maximize return rates of Great Reed Warblers.","Mero, Thomas Oliver; Nat Protect & Study Soc NATURA, Sombor, Serbia, Serbia.",thomas.oliver.mero@gmail.com,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Anatomy & Morphology; Reproductive Biology",0010-5422,,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Biometrics; Reproduction; Reproductive behaviour; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Acrocephalus arundinaceus [Habitat management /  / ] [Age /  / ] [Sex differences /  / ] [Breeding site / Nesting site / ] [Breeding season /  / ] [Emigration / Philopatry / ] [Survival /  / ] [Habitat utilization /  / ] [Semiaquatic habitat / Reed bed habitat / ] [Depth / Water depth / ] [Serbia / Sombor / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Sylviidae","Acrocephalus arundinaceus (Sylviidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15406035067,,,,,2018/06/21

We address this issue by studying the neuromuscular origins of display behavior in a small tropical passerine bird, the golden-collared manakin (Manacus vitellinus). Males of this species court females by dancing around the forest floor and rapidly snapping their wings together above their back. Using radio-telemetry, we collected electromyographic (EMG) recordings from the three main muscles that control avian forelimb movement, and found how these different muscles are activated to generate various aspects of display behavior. The muscle that raises the wing (supracoracoideus, SC) and the primary muscle that retracts the wing (scapulohumeralis caudalis, SH) were activated during the wing-snap, whereas the pectoralis (PEC), the main wing depressor, was not. SC activation began before wing elevation commenced, with further activation occurring gradually. By contrast, SH activation was swift, starting soon after wing elevation and peaking shortly after the snap. The intensity of this SH activation was comparable to that which occurs during flapping, whereas the SC activation was much lower. Thus, light activation of the SC likely helps position the wings above the back, so that quick, robust SH activation can drive these appendages together to generate the firecracker-like snap sonation. This is one of the first looks at the neuromuscular mechanisms that underlie the actuation of a dynamic courtship display, and it demonstrates that even complex, whole-body display movements can be studied with transmitter-aided EMG techniques.","Fuxjager, Matthew J.; Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC, 27109, USA, USA.",mfoxhunter@gmail.com,,,,,"Zoology; Anatomy & Morphology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Reproductive Biology",0022-0949,,"General morphology; Appendages; Musculature; Nervous system; Reproduction; Reproductive behaviour; Land zones; Neotropical region; Central America","Manacus vitellinus [Wings / Wing display / ] [Skeletal musculature / Skeletal muscles / ] [Synapses / Neuromuscular junctions / ] [Courtship /  / ] [Panama / Gamboa / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Pipridae","Manacus vitellinus (Pipridae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15403016311,29061685,,,,2018/06/21

Birds have been repeatedly mentioned as transmitters of fire blight by agricultural representatives. As a consequence, measures targeted against birds have been propagated to limit the spread of the disease. Such measures are likely to destroy potential habitats of birds and other wildlife. Habitat might be strongly reduced in quality or might even become entirely inaccessible. In a literature review, we investigated evidence for and against the spread of fire blight by birds. Scientific laboratory studies merely showed that fire blight bacteria applied to birds' feet survived up to nine days, and that fire blight bacteria can occur in faeces of Starlings. On the whole, the hypothesis that birds are regular and major transmitters of fire blight is only weakly supported. Other disease transmission routes, however, have been scientifically confirmed, or there is strong evidence for them: plant trade, contaminated cutting tools, wind, rain, and insects. We conclude that birds only play a minor role in the spread of fire blight. In quite a number of Swiss agricultural leaflets, birds are erroneously mentioned as major transmitters of fire blight. This needs to be corrected. In some of the leaflets, measures are recommended that are directly or indirectly targeted against birds. Such measures will not effectively help to reduce the spread of fire flight.","Birrer, Simon; Schweizer Vogelwarte, Seerose 1, Sempach, CH-6204, Switzerland, Switzerland.",simon.birrer@vogelwarte.ch,,,,,"Zoology; Agriculture; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Infectious Diseases",0030-5707,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Conservation; Documentation; Publications; Parasites diseases and disorders; Transmission; Habitat; Man made habitat; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Aves [Farming and agriculture / Farming controls / epidemiology; role evaluation] [Conservation /  / ] [Literature review /  / ] [Transmission of bacteria / Erwinia amylovora / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Agricultural land / ] [Switzerland /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15405029076,,,,,2018/06/21

Changes in land use and patterns of human settlement have altered fire regimes and led to fire suppression resulting in numerous undesirable consequences spanning individual species and entire ecosystems. Many obvious and direct consequences of fire suppression have been well studied, but several, albeit less obvious, costs of alteration to fire regimes on wildlife are unknown. One such phenomenon is the response of carnivores to fire events-something we refer to as pyric-carnivory. To investigate the prevalence of pyric-carnivory in raptors, we monitored 25 prescribed fires occurring during two different seasons and across two different locations in tallgrass prairie of the central United States. We used paired point counts occurring before and during prescribed fires to quantify the use of fires by raptors. We found a strong attraction to fires with average maximum abundance nearly seven times greater during fires than prior to ignitions (before: (x) over bar = 2.90, SE = 0.42; during: (x) over bar = 20.20; SE = 3.29) and an average difference between fire events and immediately before fires of 15.2 ([plus or minus]2.69) raptors. This result was driven by Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsoni), which were the most abundant (n = 346) of the nine species we observed using fires. Our results illustrate the importance of fire as integral disturbance process that effects wildlife behavior through multiple mechanisms that are often overshadowed by the predominant view of fire as a tool used for vegetation management.","Hovick, Torre J.; North Dakota State Univ, Sch Nat Resource Sci, Fargo, ND, 58105, USA, USA.",torre.hovick@ndsu.edu,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Zoology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Reproductive Biology",2045-7758,,"Conservation; Nutrition; Feeding behaviour; Reproduction; Reproductive behaviour; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Aves; Buteo swainsoni [Conservation /  / ] [Foraging / Foraging opportunities / ] [Breeding season /  / ] [Grassland / Prairie habitat / ] [Fire /  / ] [Oklahoma /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Falconiformes, Accipitridae","Aves (Vertebrata).

Holocene land-bridge islands harbor recent isolated populations that offer an excellent natural framework to study the microevolutionary processes involved in rapid or ongoing phenotypic shifts. Two insular populations (Ons and San Martio) of Salamandra salamandra in NW Iberian Peninsula exemplify these phenotypic shifts with a rapid evolutionary transition in reproductive mode and genetic differentiation since their isolation ca. 8000 years ago. We evaluate parallel phenotypic changes in body size and behavior. In particular, we (1) collected observational fieldwork data during diurnal and nocturnal transects in both islands for over a decade (2004-2016); (2) investigated the climatic conditions associated to fire salamanders' activity; (3) compared physical condition between insular and mainland populations; and (4) used plasticine models and camera trapping to identify potential predators that might cause the observed diurnal activity in San Martio Island. Our 13-year-long study shows that salamanders from San Martio show mainly diurnal activity and are significantly smaller than salamanders from Ons and nearby continental populations. Overall, we present an exceptional case of behavior and phenotypic differentiation of an insular population of fire salamanders and suggest that this unusual behavior in the small population of San Martio might be triggered by a response to predator pressure exerted by a dense population of Rattus rattus.","Velo-Anton, Guillermo; Univ Porto, CIBIO InBIO Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos, R Padre Armando Quintas 7, Vairao, P-4485661, Portugal, Portugal.",guillermo.velo@gmail.com,,,,,"Zoology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Anatomy & Morphology; Physiology; Genetics & Heredity; Evolutionary Biology; Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","0873-9749; 1437-9546",,"Biometrics; Whole animal physiology; Nutrition; Diet; Prey; Genetics; Evolution; Evolutionary adaptation; Behaviour; Activity patterns; Ecology; Predators; Abiotic factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Aves; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Rattus rattus [Amphibian prey / Salamandra salamandra / Predation pressure] [Spain / Ons & San Martino Islands / ].

Retrofitting poles through increasing clearances (separation) between components, adding insulation to components, or adding redirection materials like perch discouragers reduces risk, but electrocutions may occur even on retrofitted poles. We evaluated 52 retrofitted poles where 56 birds, including 17 Golden Eagles, were electrocuted after retrofitting. We used burns on pole equipment and carcasses to identify precise pole-top locations where electrocutions occurred, and we identified three categories of retrofitting errors: product design, mitigation plan, and application. Product design errors (n = 9 poles, 6 Golden Eagles) occurred when products did not sufficiently cover energized equipment. Mitigation plan errors (n = 30 poles, 6 Golden Eagles) occurred when retrofitting plans did not include coverage of all energized components on a pole. Application errors (n = 13 poles, 5 Golden Eagles) occurred when the correct products were installed incorrectly. Retrofitting mistakes were identified in this study retroactively when avian electrocutions occurred on poles described as retrofitted. This is typical of how retrofitting mistakes are identified by the electric industry, which can lead to expensive duplicate efforts, and ongoing avian electrocutions. These can be avoided if retrofitting is done correctly initially. This study provides insight to electric utility personnel and wildlife managers interested in proactively evaluating the thoroughness of retrofitting, facilitating immediate identification and correction of retrofitting errors, increasing cost effectiveness, and reducing avian electrocution mortality.","Dwyer, James F.; EDM Int Inc, Ft Collins, CO, 80525, USA, USA.",jdwyer@edmlink.com,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0892-1016,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Conservation; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America","Aquila chrysaetos; Bubo viginianus; Buteo; Buteo jamaicensis; Corvus corax; Corvus cryptoleucus; Haliaeetus leucocephalus; Pandion haliaetus; Parabuteo unicinctus; Pica hudsonia [Industry / Power poles / ] [Conservation measures / Wildlife management / ] [Mortality / Electrocution mortality / ] [Man made habitat /  / ] [USA /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Falconiformes, Accipitridae, Pandionidae, Passeriformes, Corvidae, Strigiformes, Strigidae","Aquila chrysaetos (Accipitridae).

Disturbance events often alter habitat, which in turn can modify behaviors of individuals in affected areas, including changes in habitat use and associated changes in social structure. To better understand these relationships, we investigated aspects of habitat selection and social connectivity of a small passerine bird, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus), before vs. after naturally occurring fire disturbance in Northern Territory, Australia. We utilized a social network framework to evaluate changes in social dynamics pre-vs. post-fire. Our study covered the non-breeding season in two consecutive years in which fires occurred, and individuals whose habitat was affected and those that were not affected by fire. Individuals in habitat affected by fires had stronger social ties (i.e. higher weighted degree) after fires, while those that were in areas that were not affected by fire actually had lower weighted degree. We suggest that this change in social connections may be linked to habitat. Before fires, fairywrens used habitat that had similar grass cover to available habitat plots randomly generated within our study site. Fire caused a reduction in grass cover, and fairywrens responded by selecting habitat with higher grass cover relative to random plots. This study demonstrates how changes in habitat and/or resource availability caused by disturbance can lead to substantive changes in the social environment that individuals experience.","Lantz, Samantha M.; Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA, 70118, USA, USA.",samlantz@gmail.com,,,,,"Zoology; Reproductive Biology; Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry",1932-6203,,"Reproduction; Reproductive behaviour; Behaviour; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia; Australia","Malurus melanocephalus [Breeding season / Non-breeding season / ] [Social behaviour / Social interaction / ] [Population density / Abundance / ] [Habitat preference / Habitat selection / ] [Forest and woodland / Woodland / ] [Fire /  / ] [Spatial environment / Habitat structure / ] [Northern Territory / Coomalie Farm / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Maluridae","Malurus melanocephalus (Maluridae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15312082647,28854197,gold,,,2018/06/21

We report on a 20-year mark-recapture investigation (1991-2010) of the distribution and density of breeders, temporal and spatial variability in breeding, nestling sex ratios, local versus immigrant recruitment of breeders, breeding age structure, age-specific survival rates, and rate of population change () of this species on the Kaibab Plateau, a forested sky island in northern Arizona, USA. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of annual fluctuations in precipitation on the annual frequency of goshawk breeding and fledgling production. We studied 125 goshawk breeding territories, representing approximately 87% of an estimated 144 total territories based on a mean distance of 3.8km between territory centers in a 1,728-km2 study area. The salient demographic feature of the population was extensive annual variation in breeding, which manifested as large inter-annual variation in proportions of pairs laying eggs, brood sizes, nest failure rates, and fledgling production. The percent of territories known in a prior year in which eggs were laid in a current year ranged from 8% to 86% (x=37%, SE=4.51), annual mean nest failure rate (active nests that failed) ranged from 12% to 48% (overall x=23%, SE=2.48), and mean annual brood size of successful nests (fledged 1 fledgling) ranged from 1.5 young to 2.5 young (overall x=2.0 young, SE=0.03). Inter-annual variation in reproduction closely tracked inter-annual variation in precipitation, which we hypothesize influenced primary forest productivity and bird and mammal prey abundance. The best breeding years (1992-1993, 77-87% of pairs laid eggs) were coincident with a record-long El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) wet period and the worst breeding year (2003; 8% of pairs laid eggs) was the last of a 3-year record drought. Overall breeding success was 83% with most failures occurring during incubation; once eggs hatched, goshawks tended to fledge young. The pooled 20-year nestling sex ratio did not differ from unity (53% M; n=410M, 366F) but was significantly male-biased in 2 years and female-biased in 1 year. Nonetheless, the overall greater production of male fledglings followed a strong trend of greater male production in other goshawk populations, suggesting that breeders might have been adaptively adjusting their offspring sex ratio, perhaps to produce more of the rarer (male) sex. Annual recruitment of new individuals into the breeding population averaged 43% during the study. Study area recruitment rate of hawks locally born (in situ) and banded was 0.12. Both sexes had equal tendencies to return to the Kaibab Plateau to breed (no differences in philopatry) and there were no differences in natal dispersal distances (natal to first breeding site) between the sexes. During the final years of study (1999-2010), an estimated 46% of breeding recruits were locally born and 54% were immigrants from distant forests. Minimum age at first breeding was 2 years and mean age at first breeding by known-age hawks (banded as nestlings or aged on plumage at first breeding) was 3.7 years for males and 3.5 years for females. Mean lifespan (yr from first banding as nestling to last resighting) of known-age goshawks was 6.9 years for both sexes. Mean minimum apparent lifespan of breeders aged 4 years based on plumage at first capture was 6.5 years for both sexes. Average age of goshawks at their first detection was 3.9 years old, at which time apparent survival was estimated at 0.77 for both sexes, which was just slightly less than the peak survival of 0.78 as a function of age. Age-specific survival estimates showed a steady decline after 9 years old and approached 0 at 20 years of age. Estimates of for breeding adults (M, 0.94, SE=0.037; F, 0.98, SE=0.038) provided only weak evidence for a population decline during the study. Although sex was not in the top survival model, models including age+sex were competitive, evidencing lower male than female survival, a finding corroborated by the occurrence of sex effects in the top model. Lower male survival may result from higher mortality associated with hunting agile prey in vegetation-filled environments during long breeding seasons when they are the primary forager. Lower survival may be compensated by the more frequent production (53%) of male fledglings. High-severity crown fire was an existential threat to the population. In addition to 4 large high-severity fires that burned roughly 3,770ha (equal to 3 goshawk territories) in the 30 years preceding 1991, 6 high-severity fires burned another 30,945ha during our study and killed most (>64%) of the forests in 8 known territories and possibly another 2 that were burned before we completed surveys. Based on a lack of any recent demographic perturbations in age structure, a relatively high and time-constant annual adult survival rate, confidence intervals around adult estimates overlapping 1.0, and a study area saturated with territories, we surmise that the goshawk population on the Kaibab Plateau was stable during the 20-year study. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains regarding the population's future status because of a declining trend in breeding frequency, uncertain status (dead, alive, emigrated) of non-breeding adults, extensive temporal and spatial variation in breeding, and high frequency of immigrant recruits to the breeding population on the Kaibab Plateau. If the century-long decline in precipitation persists, especially at the increased rate seen since 1980, and manifests as deeper droughts, diminished wet periods, and weaker pulses in forest productivity, then the Kaibab Plateau goshawk population would be expected to show unambiguous evidence of decline. Evidence would include reduced local and regional goshawk reproduction and survival, reduced frequency of immigration, and further habitat loss to catastrophic fire.

Using data from an eight-year study in southeastern Australia, we quantified the effects on native bird, mammal, and reptile species of (1) the abundance of the invasive Bitou Bush, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata, and (2) a Bitou Bush control program, which involved repeated herbicide spraying interspersed with prescribed burning. We found that overall species richness of birds, mammals, and reptiles and the majority of individual vertebrate species were unresponsive to Bitou Bush cover and the number of plants. Two species including the nationally endangered Eastern Bristlebird (Dasyurus brachypterus) responded positively to measures of native vegetation cover following the control of Bitou Bush. Analyses of the effects of different components of the treatment protocol employed to control Bitou Bush revealed (1) no negative effects of spraying on vertebrate species richness; (2) negative effects of spraying on only one individual species (Scarlet Honeyeater); and (3) lower bird species richness but higher reptile species richness after fire.

This reclamation can provide a novel opportunity to conserve northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We evaluated the influence of habitat management activities on nest survival, nest-site selection, and brood resource selection on managed and unmanaged units of a reclaimed surface mine, Peabody Wildlife Management Area (Peabody), in west-central Kentucky, USA, from 2010 to 2013. We compared resource selection, using discrete-choice analysis, and nest survival, using the nest survival model in Program MARK, between managed and unmanaged units of Peabody at 2 spatial scales: the composition and configuration of vegetation types (i.e., macrohabitat) and vegetation characteristics at nest sites and brood locations (i.e., microhabitat). On managed sites, we also investigated resource selection relative to a number of different treatments (e.g., herbicide, disking, prescribed fire). We found no evidence that nest-site selection was influenced by macrohabitat variables, but bobwhite selected nest sites in areas with greater litter depth than was available at random sites. On managed units, bobwhite were more likely to nest where herbicide was applied to reduce sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) compared with areas untreated with herbicide. Daily nest survival was not influenced by habitat characteristics or by habitat management but was influenced by nest age and the interaction of nest initiation date and nest age. Daily nest survival was greater for older nests occurring early in the breeding season (0.99, SE<0.01) but was lower for older nests occurring later in the season (0.08, SE=0.13). Brood resource selection was not influenced by macrohabitat or microhabitat variables we measured, but broods on managed units selected areas treated with herbicide to control sericea lespedeza and were located closer to firebreaks and disked native-warm season grass stands than would be expected at random. Our results suggest the vegetation at Peabody was sufficient without manipulation to support nesting and brood-rearing northern bobwhite at a low level, but habitat management practices improved vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing resource selection. Reproductive rates (e.g., nest survival and re-nesting rates) at Peabody were lower than reported in other studies, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies caused by the abundance of sericea lespedeza. On reclaimed mine lands dominated by sericea lespedeza, we suggest continuing practices such as disking and herbicide application that are targeted at reducing sericea lespedeza to improve the vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing bobwhite.

Here, we use the functional trait structure of Amazonian forest bird assemblages to explore the impacts of land-cover change on two ecosystem processes: seed dispersal and insect predation. We show that trait structure in assemblages of frugivorous and insectivorous birds remained stable after primary forests were subjected to logging and fire events, but that further intensification of human land use substantially reduced the functional diversity and dispersion of traits, and resulted in communities that occupied a different region of trait space. These effects were only partially reversed in regenerating secondary forests. Our findings suggest that local extinctions caused by the loss and degradation of tropical forest are non-random with respect to functional traits, thus disrupting the network of trophic interactions regulating seed dispersal by forest birds and herbivory by insects, with important implications for the structure and resilience of human-modified tropical forests. Furthermore, our results illustrate how quantitative functional traits for specific guilds can provide a range of metrics for estimating the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem processes, and the response of such processes to land-cover change.","Bregman, Tom P.; Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford, OX1 3PS, United Kingdom, United Kingdom.",tpbregman@gmail.com,"Barlow, Jos/E-7861-2014; Aleixo, Alexandre/L-3135-2013","Aleixo, Alexandre/0000-0002-7816-9725; Lees, Alexander/0000-0001-7603-9081",,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Entomology; Forestry",0962-8452,,"Animals and man; Nutrition; Diet; Prey; Feeding behaviour; Associations; Mutualism; Ecology; Predators; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Neotropical region; South America","Aves [Disturbance by man / Land-use change / frugivory] [Food plants /  / ] [Insect prey /  / ] [Foraging / Feeding guilds / ] [Seed dispersal /  / ] [Ecological niche /  / ] [Community structure /  / ] [Forest and woodland / Forested vs non-forested areas / ] [Fire /  / ] [Spatial environment / Landcover pattern / ] [Brazil / Para, Paragominas & Santarem Muncipalities / ].

We quantified the effects of military training on vertebrates in a 5-year study at Beecroft Weapons Range in south-eastern Australia by contrasting the occurrence of birds, mammals and reptiles between 24 sites within an area subject to repeated weapons use and a matched set of non-impacted sites. Species richness of mammals and reptiles was similar within versus outside the impact area, although many-individual species responded to fire, which occurred more frequently in impacted sites. Bird species richness, the occurrence of larger-bodied and migratory bird species, and the occurrence of most individual bird species, was reduced within the impact area. Many bird species that displayed low prevalence in impacted sites also declined over time across the whole study area. Differences in biota between the impact and non-impact areas were detectable after controlling for the effects of recent fire, suggesting that weapons use impacted vertebrates through mechanisms additional to altered fire regimes. Overall, our data indicated that Beecroft Weapons Range maintained considerable biodiversity value despite prolonged military use. Hence, MTAs have the potential to make a substantial contribution to conservation outside the formal protected area network. However, managers of MTAs need to explicitly state their environmental objectives. This is because management practices may be different if the aim is to maximize species richness rather than to secure populations of particular species.

Endogenous factors are directly related to density-dependent forces, whereas exogenous factors are environmental drivers (e.g. climate). Several studies have reported the effects of endogenous and exogenous factors using exponential population models in mammals, birds or insects, but few works have explored the effects on reptiles, specifically in tortoises. In this study, we developed logistic population growth models to decipher the role of these factors on the population dynamics of the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca. The role of environmental drivers in the distribution, movement, survival, reproduction or individual growth has been described for this species in previous works, but no studies have examined the effects of both endogenous and exogenous factors in population growth rates. Using long-term data of T. graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula (1999-2013), we fitted non-linear logistic models with endogenous and exogenous effects. The results showed that endogenous processes are important drivers of the population dynamics of this species, and that exogenous factors, such as freezing hours in winter, also directly affect the population growth rate. Intolerance of extreme winter temperatures may especially affect hatchlings and juvenile tortoises. Our models also showed that perturbations (i.e. a fire occurred during the monitoring period) have a lasting impact by reducing the carrying capacity of the population. This study shows that simple quantitative approaches based on population dynamic theory are useful for deciphering the ecological mechanisms underlying dynamics of tortoise populations.","Rodriguez-Caro, R.C.; Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Biol Aplicada, Alicante, 03202, Spain, Spain.",r.rodriguez@umh.es,"Lima, Mauricio/F-2722-2013","Lima, Mauricio/0000-0002-3700-2945; Gracia Martinez, Eva/0000-0003-0790-163X",,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Reproductive Biology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",0952-8369,,"Techniques; Reproduction; Ecology; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Testudo graeca [Ecological techniques / Population growth models / ] [Reproduction /  / ] [Population dynamics /  / ] [Climate and weather / Climate / ] [Fire /  / ] [Spain / Murcia, Cumbres de la Galera / ].","Chordates; Reptiles; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Reptilia, Anapsida, Testudines, Cryptodira, Testudinidae","Testudo graeca (Testudinidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15306033301,,,,,2018/06/21

However, during the last glacial cycle, between 120 and 15 ka, unprecedented irreversible changes in flora and fauna occurred, and in that same interval modern humans established their first firm presence in the landscape. Disentangling the impacts of the first-order trend toward a colder, drier planet through the Late Quaternary from the impacts of human colonization has been challenging, from both the chronological and paleoenvironmental perspectives. We utilize the stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen preserved in near continuous time series of Dromaius (emu) eggshell from five regions across Australia to provide independent reconstructions of ecosystem status and climate over the past 100 ka. Carbon isotopes are determined by the diet consumed by the female bird, whereas oxygen isotopes record the status of local moisture balance in the months prior to breeding. Together, [delta]13C and [delta]18O provide ecosystem status and climate from the same dated sample, reducing correlation uncertainties between proxies. Combined with recent improvements in the chronologies of Late Quaternary shorelines fringing inland lake basins and deflation during arid times, these data collectively reaffirm that Australia generally became increasingly, albeit irregularly, drier from the last interglaciation through to the last glacial maximum. Dromaius eggshell [delta]18O documents peak aridity between 30 and 15 ka, but shows no evidence of exceptional climate change between 60 and 40 ka. In contrast, Dromaius [delta]13Cdiet documents an irreversible loss of the majority of palatable summer-rainfall-related C4 grasses across the Australian arid zone between 50 and 45 ka, about the same time that the giant megafaunal bird, Genyornis, became extinct, and coincident with human dispersal across the continent. Our data indicate that changes unique to Australia occurred between 50 and 45 ka that led to a new climate-vegetation relationship and an overall reduction in effective moisture across much of the continent. The large summer-rainfall-dominated lakes of interior Australia failed to re-fill subsequently, despite a wide range of global climate states. A full explanation for the mechanisms behind these changes remains elusive, but they are almost certainly related to human agency. Plausible explanations include a change in fire regime resulting from human-lit fires, a change in fire regime following extinction of megafaunal browsers, and/or a threshold response to increasing aridity. Of these, the climate change explanation is least likely, given the lack of evidence for unprecedented aridity between 60 and 40 ka, and the successful adaptation of Australian ecosystems to 2.5 Ma of similar changes.

Its impacts on fauna can be both direct (e.g., mortality) and indirect (e.g., altered habitat), resulting in population recovery being driven by several possible mechanisms. Separating direct from indirect impacts of fire on faunal population recovery can be valuable in guiding management of biodiversity in fire-prone environments. However, resolving the influence of direct and indirect processes remains a key challenge because many processes affecting fauna can change concomitantly with time since fire. We explore the mechanisms influencing bird response to fire by posing the question, can temporal changes in vegetation structure predict changes in bird occurrence on sites, and can these be separated from other temporal changes using the surrogate of time since fire? We conducted a 12-yr study of bird and vegetation responses to fire at 124 sites across six vegetation classes in Booderee National Park, Australia. Approximately half of these sites, established in 2002, were burned by a large (>3000 ha) wildfire in 2003. To disentangle collinear effects of temporal changes in vegetation and direct demographic effects on population recovery that are subsumed by time since fire, we incorporated both longitudinal and cross-sectional vegetation effects in addition to time since fire within logistic structural equation models. We identified temporal changes in vegetation structure and richness of plant and bird species that characterized burned and unburned sites in all vegetation classes. For nine bird species, a significant component of the year trend was driven by temporal trends in one of three vegetation variables (number of understory or midstory plant species, or midstory cover). By contrast, we could not separate temporal effects between time since fire and vegetation attributes for bird species richness, reporting rate, and the occurrence of 11 other bird species. Our findings help identify species for which indirect effects of vegetation dominate recovery and thus may benefit from vegetation management where conservation actions are required and, conversely, those species for which direct effects of time since fire drive recovery, where simply leaving a system to recover following the last disturbance will be sufficient.","Lindenmayer, David B.; Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT, 2601, Australia, Australia.",david.lindenmayer@anu.edu.au,"Lindenmayer, David/P-7183-2017; Ikin, Karen/G-2845-2012; Tulloch, Ayesha/E-4408-2012","Lindenmayer, David/0000-0002-4766-4088; Tulloch, Ayesha/0000-0002-5866-1923; /0000-0003-2415-0057; Westgate, Martin/0000-0003-0854-2034",,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Forestry",1051-0761,,"Techniques; Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia; Australia","Aves [Ecological techniques /  / ] [Community structure /  / ] [Forest and woodland /  / ] [Fire /  / ] [Spatial environment / Vegetation structure / ] [New South Wales / Sydney, Booderee National Park / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15303014431,27755726,,,,2018/06/21

In particular, these grasslands serve as biodiversity repositories for a myriad of imperilled animal species. One such group is grassland birds, which have experienced significant declines, predominantly caused by extensive loss and degradation of native grasslands. Rangeland management that promotes increasing and sustaining livestock production through reducing the inherent, disturbance-driven variability that historically occurred in grasslands is considered a major contributing factor to these declines. An alternative approach to this homogeneous management paradigm attempts to restore a shifting mosaic of disturbance patches across the landscape through the spatial and temporal interactions of fire and grazing (i.e. pyric herbivory). Application of pyric herbivory through patch-burn grazing increases overall habitat heterogeneity, likely a critically important factor in maintaining and enhancing grassland bird populations. We compared reproductive rates and estimates of fecundity of three grassland birds nesting in grasslands maintained by traditional and patch-burn grazing management paradigms in the Southern Great Plains of North America. Additionally, we used a sensitivity analysis approach to assess population stability (i.e. =1) and source-sink population dynamics under the two management practices. Nest survival for dickcissels Spiza americana and grasshopper sparrows Ammodramus savannarum was higher in patch-burned grasslands than in traditionally managed grasslands, while nest survival for eastern meadowlarks Sturnella magna was higher in traditionally managed grasslands than in patch-burned grasslands. Dickcissels and grasshopper sparrows responded positively to patch burning with source habitats occurring over a wider range of survival rates under patch burning than traditional management, while no clear pattern emerged in source-sink dynamics of eastern meadowlarks.Synthesis and applications. Management strategies such as patch-burn grazing offer opportunities to restore landscape heterogeneity to benefit bird communities while maintaining livestock production goals. Applying patch-burn grazing to rangelands can increase productivity of grassland birds and could be effective for reversing the decline of grassland birds by providing source habitats more consistently than traditional rangeland management. Our results emphasize the utility of using sensitivity analyses to determine source-sink population dynamics when evaluating management practices. However, land managers should consider that source-sink models have shortcomings and designation of a habitat as a sink does not necessarily mean the habitat has low conservation value.","Davis, Craig A.; Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK, 74078, USA, USA.",craig.a.davis@okstate.edu,,,,,"Agriculture; Zoology; Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0021-8901,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Reproduction; Reproductive productivity; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Ammodramus savannarum; Spiza americana; Sturnella magna [Farming and agriculture / Grazing / ] [Fecundity / Fecundity rate / ] [Population dynamics /  / ] [Survival / Survival rate / ] [Grassland /  / ] [Fire / Patch burning / ] [Spatial environment / Landscape heterogeneity / ] [Oklahoma / Osage County, Tallgrass Prairie Preserve / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Emberizidae, Icteridae","Ammodramus savannarum (Emberizidae).

In this observational pilot study at the world's largest solar tower facility, we assessed the efficacy of using radar, surveillance video, and insect trapping to detect and observe animals flying near the towers. During site visits in May and September 2014, we monitored the airspace surrounding towers and observed insects, birds, and bats under a variety of environmental and operational conditions. We detected and broadly differentiated animals or objects moving through the airspace generally using radar and near solar towers using several video imaging methods. Video revealed what appeared to be mostly small insects burning in the solar flux. Also, we occasionally detected birds flying in the solar flux but could not accurately identify birds to species or the types of insects and small objects composing the vast majority of smoking targets. Insect trapping on the ground was somewhat effective at sampling smaller insects around the tower, and presence and abundance of insects in the traps generally trended with radar and video observations.

Fire fragments the shrub steppe and reduces its capacity to provide forage for livestock and wildlife and habitat critical to sagebrush obligates. Of particular interest is the greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), an obligate whose populations have declined so severely due, in part, to increases in cheatgrass and fires that it was considered for inclusion as an endangered species. Remote sensing technologies and satellite archives help scientists monitor terrestrial vegetation globally, including cheatgrass in the Northern Great Basin. Along with geospatial analysis and advanced spatial modeling, these data and technologies can identify areas susceptible to increased cheatgrass cover and compare these with greater sage grouse priority areas for conservation (PAC). Future climate models forecast a warmer and wetter climate for the Northern Great Basin, which likely will force changing cheatgrass dynamics. Therefore, we examine potential climate-caused changes to cheatgrass. Our results indicate that future cheatgrass percent cover will remain stable over more than 80% of the study area when compared with recent estimates, and higher overall cheatgrass cover will occur with slightly more spatial variability. The land area projected to increase or decrease in cheatgrass cover equals 18% and 1%, respectively, making an increase in fire disturbances in greater sage grouse habitat likely. Relative susceptibility measures, created by integrating cheatgrass percent cover and temporal standard deviation datasets, show that potential increases in future cheatgrass cover match future projections. This discovery indicates that some greater sage grouse PACs for conservation could be at heightened risk of fire disturbance. Multiple factors will affect future cheatgrass cover including changes in precipitation timing and totals and increases in freeze-thaw cycles. Understanding these effects can help direct land management, guide scientific research, and influence policy. (C) 2016 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Using maximum entropy (Maxent) models, we modeled nesting habitat suitability over all lands in the murrelet's range in Washington, Oregon, and California. The models used vegetation and physiographic attributes, and a sample of 368 murrelet nest sites (184 confirmed murrelet nest sites and 184 occupied sites) for model training. We estimated there were 1.03 million ha (2.53 million ac) of potential nesting habitat over all lands in the murrelet's range in Washington, Oregon, and California at the start of the plan (1993). Of this, 0.19 million ha (0.46 million ac) were identified as highest suitability, matching or exceeding the average conditions for the training sites. Most (90 percent) of potential nesting habitat in 1993 on federally administered lands occurred within reserved-land allocations. A substantial amount (41 percent) of baseline habitat occurred on nonfederal lands, including 44 percent of the highest suitability habitat. We found a net loss of about 2 percent of potential nesting habitat from 1993 to 2012 on federal lands, compared to a net loss of about 27 percent on nonfederal lands. For federal and nonfederal lands combined, the net loss was about 12 percent. Fire was the major cause of nesting habitat loss on federal lands since the NWFP was implemented; timber harvest was the primary cause of loss on nonfederal lands. The large amount of younger forest of lower suitability located in reserves has the potential to offset habitat losses over time, but this merits further investigation using spatially explicit forest development models. As evidenced by the high proportion of currently suitable nesting habitat that occurs within reserved land use designations, the NWFP has been successful in conserving murrelet habitat on federal lands. Losses of habitat on federal lands will continue owing to fires and other disturbance events, but we expect those losses to be exceeded by recovery of currently unsuitable habitat within reserves as forests mature. Incentives are needed, however, to curb losses of suitable habitat on nonfederal lands.","Raphael, Martin G.; USDA, Forest Serv, 3625 93rd Ave SW, Olympia, WA, 98512, USA, USA.",,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Reproductive Biology; Forestry",0197-6109,,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Reproduction; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Marine zones; Pacific Ocean","Brachyramphus marmoratus [Habitat management /  / ] [Reproductive behaviour /  / ] [Forest and woodland /  / ] [Abiotic factors /  / ] [North Pacific / USA, Washington, Oregon & California / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Charadriiformes, Alcidae","Brachyramphus marmoratus (Alcidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15209056279,,,,,2018/06/21

To better understand how forest management practices, weather, and indices of nest predator abundance influence nest predation, we set artificial ground nests at 100 sites for 2 weeks each summer from 2002 to 2013 in a longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem. We modeled effects of prescribed fire, hardwood removal, rainfall, temperature, indices of mammalian and avian nest predator abundance, and proximity to wildlife food plots and agriculture, edges, and roads on nest predation. Annual nest predation rates ranged from 30% to 74% and averaged 53%. Occurrence of prescribed fire at a nest site <2 months prior to nest placement had a strong, positive association with nest predation but prescribed fires carried out >2 months prior to nest placement had little effect. Hardwood removal was also associated with increased rates of nest predation, but this effect appeared most prevalent 4-9 years following removals. Nest predation rates also increased when food plots or agricultural fields were within 50 m of nest sites. Higher temperatures were associated with greater rates of predation, but rainfall did not have a significant influence. There was a general lack of support for effects of predator indices on nest predation rates, except for a weak, negative association with raccoon relative abundance. This study shows the wide range of factors which may influence nest predation and importance of viewing effects of forest management practices on nest predation over the long term.

These are important not only intrinsically, but also for ecological functioning and as flagships for South Africa's economically valuable avitourism sector. Little is known about population sizes or realised distribution ranges of these six species, but projected range modelling based on occurrence from the South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP) has suggested these species are vulnerable to climate change. We estimate global population sizes for these six endemics based on densities calculated from two intensive biome-wide point count surveys in 2012. We modelled regions of suitable climatic space, from which we established that mean annual temperature and the temperature of the warmest quarter of the year appear to limit Cape Rock-jumper Chaetops frenatus and Protea Canary Serinus leucopterus ranges. Both species have seen an apparent > 30% decrease in range and reporting rates (a proxy for abundance) in the twenty years between SABAP atlas periods (1987-1991 and 2007-ongoing). The Cape Rock-jumper result is unexpected: encounter rates are higher in shorter vegetation, dry slopes and habitats with more recent occurrence of fire - all proxies for proximate causes of climate change on the Fynbos. Although coastal plains are highly transformed, mountain Fynbos is the best protected of all the world's Mediterranean-climate habitats, with relatively little anthropogenic land transformation. Long term weather datasets from the Fynbos demonstrate significant warming since 1960. We conclude from these lines of evidence that these decreases are consistent with the loss of suitable climate space and inability of these species to adjust physiologically to increasing temperatures.","Lee, Alan T.K.; South African Natl Biodivers Inst, Climate Change Adaptat Div, Private Bag X7, Claremont, ZA-7735, South Africa, South Africa.",alan.tk.lee@googlemail.com,,"Lee, Alan Tristram Kenneth/0000-0002-5858-9351",,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",0959-2709,,"Animals and man; Conservation; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Afrotropical region; Africa","Bradypterus victorini; Chaetops frenatus; Crithagra totta; Nectarinia violacea; Promerops cafer; Serinus leucopterus [Disturbance by man / Habitat modification / ] [Endangered status / Conservation status / ] [Population density /  / ] [Population size /  / ] [Grassland / Fynbos / distribution] [Climate and weather / Climate change / ] [Temperature /  / ] [South Africa /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Fringillidae, Meliphagidae, Nectariniidae, Sylviidae, Turdidae","Crithagra totta (Fringillidae).

We characterized the community structure and niche characteristics (niche position, marginality, breadth) of upland and lowland boreal birds at scales relevant to both natural and human disturbance patterns in western boreal forests undergoing rapid and extensive multi-sector resource development. Our goal was to identify the degree of ecological specialization in order to inform activities directed at conserving a diversity of species (e.g. specialists and generalists) within the western boreal bird community. We used avian data (>5,220 point counts) and environmental variable data comprised of forest composition, stand, and landscape pattern metrics at local (7.1 ha), landscape (1,963 ha), and regional (11,310 ha) scales to determine boreal bird distribution and community-level associations using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Outlying Mean Index (OMl) analysis. OMI analysis explained a high proportion of variance in the ""dataset (71.8%) and separated boreal birds along two axes associated with moisture-productivity and age-structural complexity gradients. Niche position was influenced by local scale variables (height, age, area of mature-old forest, area of wet soil types), but also landscape and regional scale variables (total area of hardwood and conifer, mean nearest neighbour distance of conifer, and total core area of productive upland conifer). Only 15 of 67 species (22%) had marginal (atypical) niches and narrow niche breadths exhibiting specialization in old hardwood and white spruce forests and burned, open, and lowland habitats. Most species occupied typical or common habitats within the study area and exhibited generalist strategies typical of species in heterogeneous and disturbed habitats that undergo frequent change. Our results suggest the need to design and implement multi-species plans to conserve a diversity of western boreal bird species (e.g. specialists and generalists) at the regional scale.

Not only does this strategy depart from dormant season to growing season prescriptions, but the strategy also moves from stand-scale to landscape-scale implementation (>1,000 ha). This being so, agencies are making considerable commitments in terms of time and resources to this management strategy, but the effects on wildlife in upland forests, especially those dominated by hardwood canopy species, are relatively unknown. We initiated our study to assess whether this management strategy affects eastern wild turkey reproductive ecology on the Ozark-St. Francis National Forest. We marked 67 wild turkey hens with Global Positioning System (GPS) Platform Transmitting Terminals in 2012 and 2013 to document exposure to prescribed fire, and estimate daily nest survival, nest success, and nest-site selection. We estimated these reproductive parameters in forest units managed with prescribed fire (treated) and units absent of prescribed fire (untreated). Of 60 initial nest attempts monitored, none were destroyed or exposed to prescribed fire because a majority of fires occurred early than a majority of the nesting activity. We found nest success was greater in untreated units than treated units (36.4% versus 14.6%). We did not find any habitat characteristic differences between successful and unsuccessful nest-sites. We found that nest-site selection criteria differed between treated and untreated units. Visual concealment and woody ground cover were common selection criteria in both treated and untreated units. However, in treated units wild turkey selected nest-sites with fewer small shrubs (<5 cm ground diameter) and large trees (>20 cm DBH) but not in untreated units. In untreated units wild turkey selected nest-sites with more large shrubs (>=5cm ground diameter) but did not select for small shrubs or large trees.

The Firecrest, a local rarity in the 19th century, has become one of the common birds of southern Germany in the course of the 20th century, so that in many areas its numbers are now greater than those of Goldcrest. Although it has been assumed that the explanation for this is probably connected to the increase in conifers and climate change in Central Europe, the most important point has been overlooked, since German Goldcrests spend five to six months in the Mediterranean Region: The situation in the geographical region of the Alps can be taken as a reference point to examine these developments in Central Europe, since there spruce and fir trees accounted for a high proportion of the woodlands even in the 18th and19th century. In southern Germany and the Austrian Alps between 1820 and 1920 the Firecrest was described as rare and localized, and was even unknown until the end of the 19th century in most places since it didn't occur at all. Since then it has undergone a steady increase, so that today it is among the common bird species in Germany and the whole region of the Alps. In the South German study area dealt with here, the Goldcrest was still the more common of the two until around 1970, but currently the Firecrest is at least 1.5 times more abundant than the Goldcrest. Its present abundance in western Central Europe, from near the alpine tree line to sea level, can be explained neither by climatic causes nor by the planting of coniferous trees. The earlier minimal forest cover in the winter quarters of the Firecrest between the Iberian Peninsula and Italy prevented the species from spreading and increasing its numbers in Central Europe. It was the retreat of pastureland and arable farming, favoring succession and reforestation, that led to a change in the historic avifauna to the benefit of woodland species, among them many migrant species from northern and Central Europe such as the Blackcap. Therefore, the cause of the increasing commonness of Firecrest as opposed to Goldcrest, and of the expansion of its distributional range in Central Europe, is the enormous increase in the area covered by forest in its winter quarters in the European part of the Mediterranean Region. There, the increase in woody cover and forest in the past 100 years, as shown in new maps and other evidence, could be as high as a factor of 50. Without that, the expansion of the Firecrest and its current high abundance in Central Europe would be unthinkable, even if the effects of climate change would also be positive. It also illustrates how careless treatments of historical data can impair research and antedate the development of the status of the Firecrest by a hundred years. The responsibility of Germany, which today harbors 40 % of the world population of Firecrest, becomes a shared responsibility with the Mediterranean countries where the species overwinters.","Gatter, Wulf; Hans Thoma Weg 31, Kirchheim Unter Teck, D-73230, Germany, Germany.",Wulfgatter@aol.com,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Forestry",0042-7993,,"Ecology; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Zoogeography; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Regulus ignicapillus [Population dynamics / Population history & increase / ] [Habitat preference /  / ] [Forest and woodland / Mediterranean woodland availability & conifer forests / distribution] [Zoogeography / Geographical expansion / ] [Europe / Central Europe / ] [Germany /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Sylviidae","Regulus ignicapillus (Sylviidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15401000285,,,,,2018/06/21

In central Baden-Wurttemberg, Spotted Flycatchers are sparse, inconspicuous inhabitants of older forests. Severe storms in 1967, and especially in 1990 and 1999, provided the opportunity for a long-term study of the adaptation of this species to such events. The dynamics of unhindered succession caused by infestations of bark beetles (Scolytidae) allowed unexpected insights into the settlement strategy, diet phenology, and nesting and breeding behaviour of the flycatcher. The rise in numbers and/or settlement activity of Spotted Flycatcher triggered by the increase in the beetle population enabled us to study trophic processes in stocks of woodland, insects, and birds. In the absence of human influence, the scenario of these processes, where bark beetles from wind-thrown timber spread to and killed neighboring stands, could be followed for up to 16 years. High flycatcher population densities, as well as a band-like distribution that moved with the advancing infestation front, were found. The bark beetles supplied not only a surplus of food, but also of nest sites (thousands of 'bark-pockets, i.e. fragments caught in branch whorls by the Scolytidae beetles loosening the bark in spruce forests), a situation unknown in conventionally managed forests but probably normal in pristine forests. There were over a hundred dying trees standing in every flycatcher territory with a large number of such nesting possibilities, too many for predators to deal with. So we were able to observe the development by Spotted Flycatchers of flexible settlement and reproduction strategies. Territory occupation mostly in June could be interpreted as late arrival of the flycatchers from Africa or as an adaptation to bark beetle phenology. A third strategy could be that breeding outside the early part of the season, when predators are occupying their territories, allows the flycatchers to exploit the situation by breeding when the spatial and temporal pressures of competition and predation are already declining. The strong differences in biology between the Spotted Flycatcher and two Ficedula species (Pied and Collared Flycatcher) could indicate that the evolution of the species as a niche-nester has been shaped by the frequency of (large-scale) catastrophes occurring in unmanaged forest, especially since its wing morphology gives the species a high degree of mobility. The possibility of a 'pheno- or ecotype' Forest Spotted Flycatcher, adapted via mobility to the spatially and temporally unpredictable catastrophes of pristine forest is discussed and contrasted with urban Spotted Flycatchers.","Gatter, Wulf; Hans Thoma Weg 31, Kirchheim Unter Teck;, D-73230, Germany, Germany.",wulfgatter@aol.com,,,,,"Zoology; Entomology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",0042-7993,,"Nutrition; Diet; Prey; Reproduction; Ecology; Predators; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Muscicapa striata [Insect prey / Scolytidae (Coleoptera) / Predator prey relationships] [Food availability / Prey availability / ] [Feeding behaviour /  / ] [Reproduction / Breeding strategies / ] [Ecological niche /  / ] [Distribution within habitat / Distribution shifts / ] [Habitat utilization /  / ] [Forest and woodland / Forest damage / ] [Climate and weather / Storms / ] [Fire /  / ] [Germany /  / ].

Past studies have focused on nest site selection and survival but information is needed on factors influencing their space use when away from the nest. We examined space use by white-headed woodpeckers during the nesting (May-Jul) and post-nesting (Jul-Oct) periods and compared the role of environmental factors (e.g., landcover) and socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, breeding success) in home range size and selection of location. Average size of 99% kernel home ranges was 125ha (SD[plus or minus]59ha; n=19) in the nesting period and 137ha (SD[plus or minus]70ha; n=30) in the post-nesting period. Minimum convex polygons were generally comparable to or smaller than ranges reported from previous radio-telemetry studies with this species. Although bird weight and age best explained variation in home range size compared to other factors, neither parameter estimate was significant in our models. Thus, even though weight and age were the most-supported factors in our analysis, home range size was largely influenced by factors that we did not measure. We found that most woodpeckers selected home ranges within forest patches that had undergone a recent disturbance; these areas included forests that had recently been burned with prescribed fire by the United States Forest Service (82%) or subject to disease (16%). Most burned patches in our study were small (approx. 4.8ha) and occurred within otherwise live forest but had nearly complete mortality of adult trees. We suggest that recent forest disturbances, especially mixed-severity prescribed burns, may have been selected by white-headed woodpeckers because they created snags for nesting and future studies should explore this hypothesis. Because home range size was variable and not linked with productivity, it should not be used as an indication of habitat quality without more detailed studies on causal factors that affect space use in this species.

The vast areas of logged tropical forest are often vulnerable to relogging, clear-felling, burning or conversion to plantations, despite evidence that logged forests retain a large proportion of tropical forest species at high abundances compared with alternate land uses. However, the demographic processes (e.g. survival, fecundity) that drive community or species properties (e.g. occurrence, density) in response to logging have never been examined. We used a novel capture-recapture-based sampling design to separate insitu reproduction from immigration-fuelled recruitment to investigate the demographic vital rates of six forest-dependent understorey insectivorous bird species along a logging continuum in the Eastern Himalaya Global Biodiversity Hotspot. We expected a positive relationship between forest intactness and reproductive rates, and that intact patches would contribute excess' individuals to logged patches from natal dispersal. Contrary to our expectations, we found: (i) a positive relationship between logging intensity and reproduction, and (ii) evidence of natal dispersal from more logged to less logged and intact forest patches. Our results indicate that for certain forest-dependent species in particular contexts, selectively logged habitats can have surprising and hitherto unrecognized demographic value that might be superior even to primary forest.Synthesis and applications. In most tropical settings, logged forests can not only support a greater subset of forest biodiversity than other forms of land use (for instance, agriculture), but can also play an important role in supporting populations of certain forest-dependent species. The ongoing conversion of large swathes of logged forest to non-forest habitat (such as oil palm plantation) because of their perceived lack of importance for biodiversity is a cause for serious concern for the conservation of tropical biodiversity.

Because ravens perch on overhead shield wires, for which no perch discourager exists, management focuses on nests. When nests occur above energized wires (phase wires), risk of line faults, pole fires, and power outages develop. In southeastern Colorado, USA, Chihuahuan ravens nesting on H-frame transmission structures historically nested exclusively above the center phase. Nest deterrents prevent ravens from nesting over the center phase on short line segments (1.5 km), but effectiveness over longer line segments is unknown. We installed nest deterrents over the center phase on all structures within a 25.7-km line segment (n = 93 structures), and compared nesting there with nesting on two 0.75-km untreated segments adjacent to each end of the treated segment (n = 10 adjacent structures) and on a 25.6-km untreated segment (n = 93 distant structures). Data were collected over 7 surveys in Bent, Kiowa, and Crowley counties in southeastern Colorado, spring 2012. Ravens placed nest material on 25.8% of treated structures, 90.0% of adjacent untreated structures, and 78.5% of distant untreated structures. Used nests (containing eggs or nestlings) occurred on 2.1% of treated structures, 40.0% of adjacent untreated structures, and 17.2% of distant untreated structures. No used nest occurred above the center phase on any treated tangent structure, whereas all used nests occurred above the center phase on untreated structures. Future research should evaluate whether placing deterrents above all phases further reduces nesting. If so, this application could also be used in areas where ravens are potential predators of species of special concern.

We collected data for 93 nests over two breeding seasons (2012-2014). We assessed how some covariates influence the daily survival rates and affect nest survival, building models in Program MARK. Breeding begins in early October, peaks in late November, and continues until early March, lasting approximately 150 days. The mean size of breeding territories was 1.1 ha, and territories located in burned areas were smaller than those in unburned areas. Only the females build the small open-cup nests, in clumps of grass (mainly composed of Andropogon lateralis, Schizachyrium tenerum and Sorghastrum setosum) at 36.2 cm above the ground. The clutch size is three (67%) or two eggs (n = 52), and laying occurs on consecutive days. Incubation is performed by the female and lasts 13.7 days. The mean period of on-bouts was 73.5 min and the mean period of off-bouts was 39 mins. The hatching is synchronized and the hatching rate was 94%. In most nests, both the female and male fed the nestlings (biparental care). The frequency of visits/hr to feed the young did not differ with nestling age, but the length of visits was longer when the nestlings were younger. Nestlings fledged after 9-12 days. The apparent success was 42%, with 39% and 35% breeding success when calculated with the Mayfield estimate and the MARK software program, respectively. Predation was the main cause of failure, affecting 76% of the unsuccessful nests. The best models included time-specific factors (nest age and year) and nest-site features (nest height and habitat) influencing nest survival. Daily survival rates decreased through the nest cycle, and were much lower in the nestling stage. The re-nesting interval after nest failure was 2.7 days, and the mean distance between consecutive nesting attempts was 104.2 m. Up to four attempts (n 5 5) by the same female were observed in the same breeding season. Although little published information is available for this species, the basic reproductive features are very similar to those found in a population in Argentina. In Brazil, the breeding season is slightly shorter, and clutches of two eggs are more common.","Fontana, Carla S.; Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul PUCRS, MCT, Ave Ipiranga 6681, Porto Alegre, RS, BR-90619900 BC, Brazil, Brazil.",carla@pucrs.br,,,,,"Zoology; Anatomy & Morphology; Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",1559-4491,,"Biometrics; Reproduction; Ecology; Animal constructions; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Neotropical region; South America","Emberizoides ypiranganus [Biometrics / Morphometrics / ] [Reproduction / Breeding biology / ] [Predators /  / ] [Nests / Nest survival / ] [Grassland /  / ] [Brazil / Rio Grande do Sul / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Emberizidae","Emberizoides ypiranganus (Emberizidae): [Prey].",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15201003468,,,,,2018/06/21

Our goal was to investigate the effects of rangeland management on resource selection and nest survival of upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda). We conducted our project at Konza Prairie, a Long-Term Ecological Research site. The station has 60 experimental units with replicated grazing and fire treatments that create a heterogeneous landscape of different habitat patches. We radio-tracked sandpipers for two breeding seasons (2003-2004, n = 37 birds) and monitored sandpiper nests for eight seasons (2001-2008, n = 246 nests). We used resource utilization functions to examine resource selection with respect to five landscape features. Home ranges of sandpipers were large in contiguous prairie () and explain area-sensitive occurrence in fragmented prairie. Upland sandpipers selected grazed and burned sites with short vegetation within their home range. In contrast, nest site selection was influenced by fire frequency and birds selected infrequently burned sites with greater vegetative structure. Settlement decisions affected fitness because nest survival was low in burned and grazed sites (0.068), but higher in unburned and ungrazed sites (0.201-0.247). Our results raise concerns for conservation because private rangelands managed for livestock production are often homogeneous landscapes with heavy grazing and frequent fires. Rotational grazing and fire could be used to restore heterogeneity to grasslands but the duration of rotation, patch size, and optimal configuration require further investigation.","Sandercock, Brett K.; Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, 116 Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS, 66506, USA, USA.",bsanderc@ksu.edu,"Sandercock, Brett/L-1644-2016","Sandercock, Brett/0000-0002-9240-0268",,,"Zoology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Reproductive Biology; Behavioral Sciences",0921-2973,,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Reproduction; Reproductive behaviour; Behaviour; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat utilization; Animal constructions; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Bartramia longicauda [Habitat management / Rangeland management / Prescribed fire & grazing] [Breeding site / Nest site selection / ] [Home range / Home range size / ] [Survival / Nest survival / ] [Habitat preference /  / ] [Nests /  / ] [Grassland / Prairie habitat / ] [Kansas / Konza Prairie Biological Station / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Charadriiformes, Scolopacidae","Bartramia longicauda (Scolopacidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15105029377,,,,,2018/06/21

Habitat for shrubland birds is typically dynamic, in which available habitat changes temporally and spatially in response to disturbance and succession. Despite widespread concerns among conservationists about shrubland birds, much is still poorly understood regarding fundamental demographic processes associated with the persistence of species in dynamic landscapes, such as the age of colonists, their success upon establishment, the fate of birds displaced by disturbance, and the effect of displaced birds on neighboring territories. To address these knowledge gaps, we studied prairie warblers (Setophaga discolor) between 2008 and 2012 in a pitch pine-scrub oak (Pinus rigida Quercus ilicifolia) barren consisting of newly created, maturing, and disturbed habitat patches. We found that newly created habitat patches were colonized primarily by younger, second-year males, whereas slightly older shrubland habitat was occupied by site-faithful older birds. Second-year males arrived later on the breeding grounds and had slightly lower pairing success compared to older males; however, they had similar reproductive output as older males. Based on mark-resight analyses, we calculated that 72% of adult males and 14% of banded nestlings returned to the study site in a following year. When territories were subject to high-intensity mowing, fire, or selective herbicide during the non-breeding season, only 14% of the males that returned to the study site stayed on their territories the following year. These returning males that acquired a territory within the study area had similar reproductive success to other birds in the study area and did not negatively affect the pairing or reproductive success of birds occupying adjacent areas. Disturbed territories made up a relatively small portion of the suitable habitat in the study area and disturbance affected a low number of territorial males in any given year. Overall, we found that the short-term effects of shrubland management and habitat disturbance on birds are minimal and subsequently allow young birds to colonize and breed. Moreover, the long-term effects of management are beneficial by maintaining ephemeral shrubland habitat for immigrating and site-faithful birds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The onset of laying and clutch size were correlated with ambient temperature and precipitation (p < 0.001). Hatching success was also determined by these environmental factors as well as by the degree of predation (p < 0,001). There was a statistically significant correlation between clutch size and hatching success (p < 0.001) as well as fledging success (p < 0.001). Nestlings hatching first or second grew faster, reached a higher body weight, and had a lower mortality rate than those hatching last or second to last. There was also a statistically significant correlation between nestling survival and clutch size as well as ambient temperature (p < 0.001 each). Nestling mortality caused by predators, i. e. mainly by martens Martes foina and domestic cats Felis domestica, was high in periods of intensive burning of the meadows surrounding the Jackdaw colony. However, mortality rate of the youngest nestlings was almost 100% lower in periods of high predation compared to times of low predatory activity. Several groups of insects constituted a high amount of nestling food, e. g. 60% of all Orthoptera occurring in the meadows next to the breeding colony. In that area the total dry body mass of phytophagous invertebrates amounted to 1.4-2.0 g per m2, of which 0.3 g were fed to the nestlings. The percentage of zoophagous invertebrates delivered to the offspring was high with about 30-35%. From an economical point of view, Jackdaws during the breeding season are advantageous in an agricultural landscape because they reduce pest insects significantly while consuming only an insignificant amount of all seeds applied.","Kaminski, Piotr; Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Coll Med Bydgoszcz, M Sklodowska Curie St 9, Bydgoszcz, PL-85094, Poland, Poland.",piotr.kaminski@cm.umk.pl,,,,,"Reproductive Biology; Zoology; Developmental Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",1734-624X,,"Reproduction; Life cycle and development; Development; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat; Man made habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Corvus monedula [Reproduction / Reproductive biology / ] [Young development / Nestling development / ] [Survival /  / ] [Predators /  / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Agricultural landscape / ] [Climate and weather / Precipitation / ] [Temperature /  / ] [Poland / Bialystok, southwest / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Corvidae","Corvus monedula (Corvidae): [Prey].",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15207045563,,,,,2018/06/21

The data were compiled using internet and database research as well as surveys among birdwatchers, and subjected to critical evaluation. Lighting fireworks in a wildlife environment represents an anthropogenic disturbance stimulus, which depending on the type of firework, exposure, distance, and time of year as well as the species-specific and individual sensitivities of the exposed species can have varying disturbance effects. The birds show physiological reactions (e.g. increased heart rate, stress hormone release, and other metabolic reactions, even if there is no visible reaction), increased vigilance, signs of anxiety and fear (changes in body posture, alarm calls, running around, ducking, intentional movements, etc). The most documented reaction was flight by flying, running or swimming. In extreme cases, young birds jumped or fell out of the nest (e.g. storks, heron). Flight also includes the danger of aftereffects: birds hurt or exhaust themselves; in particular, eggs and young birds become easy prey for predators, have accidents or get lost completely. The mortality risk for young birds also increases when contact with the parental flock is lost during flight (waterbirds, cranes). Flocking bird tends to flee in panic, which comprises a third of all documented flights. In panic, the birds can become disoriented, fly into obstacles and injure themselves; 9 of the 10 documented fatalities were attributable to panics (up to 5,000 individuals). After panic fewer birds returned to their resting place, the length of the absence and anxiety was longer; displaced birds were found at distances of up to 15 km away. Independent of these short-term effects, flight reduces the fitness of individual birds, thus weakening them and making them more susceptible to illness or parasites. Direct hits on birds by firework materials have only been documented at rare occasions. In individual cases they caused the bird's death or injury (mostly burnings). The incidence of hearing damage as a result seems unlikely due to the special anatomy of birds' ears. Birds react to the visual stimuli (flash and light ""storm"") as well as to the acoustic stimuli (muffled to loud bangs, shrill whistling sounds) of fireworks. The latter often produced strong reactions and even panic. Waterbirds apparently react more sensitively than birds of prey and mammals. Strengthened reactions were also observed during the hunting season. The manner in which birds are disturbed by pulsating bass, sonic booms and deterrents using pulse detonation technology makes it very likely that birds perceive even the pressure waves from firework explosions as a disturbance stimulus. This perception may occur via the paratympanic organ in the inner ear or via the air sacs. Habituation to the pulse detonation technology apparently does not occur. The simultaneous appearance of various types of stimulus from one and the same source of disturbance (summation) or of identical types of stimulus from different sources (cumulation) has an increased negative effect according to other authors. A series of similar disturbance stimuli and an increase in the rate of disturbances results in sensitizing and, thus, stronger disturbing effects. New Year's Eve fireworks are an exception since they occur over a large area. In the Netherlands during such fireworks, weather radar calculates thousands of birds fleeing up to great heights (up to 500 meters). Conclusions and possible consequences for the handing of fireworks in Germany are briefly outlined.","Stickroth, Hermann; Sperberweg 4A, Augsburg, D-86156, Germany, Germany.",hermann.stickroth@birdnet.de,,,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physiology; Behavioral Sciences; Pathology",0944-5730,,"Animals and man; Whole animal physiology; Sensory reception; Behaviour; Parasites diseases and disorders; Ecology; Population dynamics; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Aves [Disturbance by man / Disturbance caused by fireworks / review] [Physiological condition /  / ] [Sensory reception /  / ] [Behaviour /  / ] [Injuries /  / ] [Mortality /  / ] [Germany /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15302008304,,,,,2018/06/21

The Siju Cave of Meghalaya, also known as cave of the bat, is among the longest caves on the Indian subcontinent. The palynological study of fifty bat-guano samples from Siju Cave and of thirty surface soil and moss cushion from the area immediate surrounding the cave reflects the close similarity between the modern pollen and vegetation in the region in the two areas sampled. The resulting palynodata comprise mainly the native flora, dominated by riparian taxa like Duabanga, Syzygium, Careya, and Ficus, along with evergreen and deciduous elements in the region. The evergreen taxa Mesua, Elaeocarpus, and Garcinia, along with Impatiens, reflect the high precipitation in the region. The climate of the region and the vegetation are strongly influenced by the Simsang River, and the heavy rainfall results in the dominance of riparian taxa and other high-rainfall indicator taxa. The occurrence of pollen from Nepenthes khasiana, an endemic and endangered plant of Meghalaya, in bat guano is significant and may be due to its insectivorous and entomophilous nature. However, medicinal plants like Swertia chirata, Cinchona, and Rauvolfia are not encountered in the bat-guano sediments, despite their luxuriant growth around the cave, and these species could be avoided by the insects due to their alkaloid contain and bitter taste. The presence of highland taxa such as Pinus, Abies, Picea, and Larix in the bat guano deposit is significant and suggestive of high winds from higher altitudes, or the pollen may be introduced by the return of migratory Siberian birds during winter to the nearby Siju wildlife and bird sanctuary. The recovery of cerealia along with Areca catechu and Citrus pollen indicate the human activity in the region.

We conducted occupancy surveys for an umbrella species, the Coastal California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica), from 2004 to 2009 in San Diego County, California, focusing on preserve lands associated with HCPs. We investigated the effects of habitat quality classification, elevation, distance to coast, and heat load on gnatcatcher occupancy, extinction, and colonization probabilities. Our work focused on these factors throughout the range of this species in San Diego County where, through conservation agreements, a preserve system has been assembled addressing management considerations at a landscape scale. In addition, a large wildfire in 2003 burned 17,044 ha, roughly 1/3 of preserve lands, thus we were able to investigate the recolonization process associated with this event. We found that occupancy increased with habitat quality and over time, but decreased with elevation. Extinction probability was generally constant ([approximately]0.13), but colonization varied greatly, with probabilities being greater in higher quality habitat and at lower elevations. Gnatcatchers were more likely to colonize burned areas adjacent to high and very high quality habitat, sites that should receive priority conservation actions, particularly at lower elevations. Our work suggests that umbrella species, like the California Gnatcatcher, may reflect not just habitat quality, but may also be useful indicators of recovery after an unexpected event such as fire. Although not perfect, the use of multiple umbrella species in HCPs may lead to effective conservation and management of biodiversity hotspots.","Winchell, Clark S.; US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Carlsbad Fish & Wildlife Off, Carlsbad, CA, 92008, USA, USA.",clark_winchell@fws.gov,,,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0010-5422,,"Conservation; Ecology; Habitat utilization; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Polioptila californica californica [Conservation measures /  / habitat quality effects] [Habitat utilization / Habitat occupancy dynamics / ] [Habitat colonization / Habitat recolonization / ] [Fire / Wild fire / ] [California / San Diego County / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Polioptilidae","Polioptila californica californica (Polioptilidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15102011513,,,,,2018/06/21

In species in which both the males and females are ornamented, assortative pairings could arise from mutual mate choice on the same trait. We test this mechanism of mate choice and assortative pairing in the Diamond Firetail (Stagonopleura guttata), an Australian estrildid finch in which both sexes are ornamented with red bills, red rumps and white flank spots. We have previously shown sex differences in the degree of ornamentation as females have more flank spots than males. These white flank spots are used during sexual display, being fully displayed by courting males and by females when approaching a displaying male. Here, we experimentally test whether mutual mate preference is based on the number of flank spots. There was no evidence for a direct mutual preference for spot number. Given a choice of potential mates with a natural or experimentally manipulated number of flank spots, males preferred females with more spots, while female preference was not solely based on flank spots. Intriguingly, in both wild and captive Diamond Firetails, we found the number of flank spots in pairs was correlated suggesting a basis for positive assortative pairing. Nevertheless, we conclude that assortative pairing in Diamond Firetails is not due to mutual choice of mates based on the number of flank spots.

This has caused many scientists to identify the conservation of early-successional species as a high priority. In this synthesis, we discuss the conservation implications of this loss of early-successional habitats using examples from the literature on songbirds. Early-successional ""shrubland"" bird species require conditions and resources present in recently disturbed sites. These conditions are ephemeral and change rapidly over time as sites become dominated by later-seral species. Historical disturbance regimes such as wind-throw, fire and flooding have been altered or suppressed in eastern forests through human activity such as conversion of forests to younger aged stands more resistant to wind, fire suppression and mesophication of fire-adapted communities, and suppression of beaver activity and flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic disturbance has shifted over much of the region to types of land use that provide less shrubland habitat of lower quality than historically. Despite scientific evidence in support of this concern, there is still misunderstanding about the role of disturbance in maintaining biodiversity, and public opposition to management remains a challenge to conserving these communities. Contemporary approaches use natural disturbance regimes to inform management practices that employ historical agents where possible or surrogates when necessary to achieve desired future conditions defined on the basis of regional population or community status. Conservation of early-successional communities occurs within the context of other potentially conflicting ecological values, such as the conservation and enhancement of biologically mature forest. Recent findings, however, show shrubland habitat can augment diversity in forested landscapes by providing seasonal resources for mature-forest species, such as food or predator-free space for juvenile forest songbirds that seek out early-successional habitats during the transition to independence. Balancing the conservation of early-successional shrubland species with other, sometimes conflicting values is an active area of current conservation research. In some cases the conservation of shrubland birds can be coordinated with commercial activities like silviculture or maintenance of infrastructure (e.g. powerline corridors), although our work indicates that deliberate efforts expressly directed at conservation of early-successional shrubland species are more effective.

A.; Baker, William L.; Bond, Monica L.",,,,"Open Ecology Journal",7,,,37-51,2014/07/11,2014,,,,English,0,7,"The Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is an emblematic, threatened raptor associated with dense, late-successional forests in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Concerns over high-severity fire and reduced timber harvesting have led to programs to commercially thin forests, and this may occur within habitat designated as ""critical"" for spotted owls. However, thinning is only allowed under the U. S. Government spotted owl guidelines if the long-term benefits clearly outweigh adverse impacts. This possibility remains uncertain. Adverse impacts from commercial thinning may be caused by removal of key habitat elements and creation of forests that are more open than those likely to be occupied by spotted owls. Benefits of thinning may accrue through reduction in high-severity fire, yet whether the fire-reduction benefits accrue faster than the adverse impacts of reduced late-successional habitat from thinning remains an untested hypothesis. We found that rotations of severe fire (the time required for high-severity fire to burn an area equal to the area of interest once) in spotted owl habitat since 1996, the earliest date we could use, were 362 and 913 years for the two regions of interest: the Klamath and dry Cascades. Using empirical data, we calculated the future amount of spotted owl habitat that may be maintained with these rates of high-severity fire and ongoing forest regrowth rates with and without commercial thinning. Over 40 years, habitat loss would be far greater than with no thinning because, under a ""best case"" scenario, thinning reduced 3.4 and 6.0 times more dense, late-successional forest than it prevented from burning in high-severity fire in the Klamath and dry Cascades, respectively. Even if rates of fire increase substantially, the requirement that the long-term benefits of commercial thinning clearly outweigh adverse impacts is not attainable with commercial thinning in spotted owl habitat. It is also becoming increasingly recognized that exclusion of high-severity fire may not benefit spotted owls in areas where owls evolved with reoccurring fires in the landscape.","Odion, Dennis C.; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106, USA, USA.",dennis@odion.name,,"Bond, Monica/0000-0001-8500-6564",,,"Zoology; Forestry; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Conservation; Conservation measures; Ecology; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Strix occidentalis caurina [Forestry /  / ] [Habitat management /  / ] [Succession in habitats /  / ] [Forest and woodland / Dry forest / ] [Fire /  / ] [California /  / ] [Oregon /  / ] [Washington /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Strigiformes, Strigidae","Strix occidentalis caurina (Strigidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15106034953,,,,,2018/06/21

I provide here the first study of Great Crested Flycatcher nesting ecology and nest-site selection in tree cavities in the eastern United States. I monitored 44 Great Crested Flycatcher nests in a mosaic of slash pine plantations and longleaf pine sandhills in Clay County, Florida. Nest sites were located in slash pine (52%), turkey oak (39%), longleaf pine (7%), and unknown pine species (2%). Most (73%) Great Crested Flycatcher nests were located in abandoned tree cavities excavated by various species, especially the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus). Cavity entrance diameters averaged 6.2 ([plus or minus] 2.5) cm, with most (55%) measured entrances smaller than the minimum previously reported for the species. These findings are contrary to earlier characterizations of the species as showing a strong affinity for large naturally occurring hollows in live trees. Only 19 of 44 Great Crested Flycatcher nests (43%) were successful in fledging >=1 young. Mean cavity height was greater for successful nests than for unsuccessful nests, and the primary cause of nest failure was predation. Most flycatcher nests in oaks were located in the understory <3 m above ground where they were particularly vulnerable to predation.

Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are emblematic of the role these disturbances play in creating wildlife habitat, since they are strongly associated with recently-killed forests. However, management practices aimed at reducing the economic impact of natural disturbances can result in habitat loss for this species. Although black-backed woodpeckers occupy habitats created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and mountain pine beetle infestations. Our finding that population growth rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the landscape. The lower growth rates in fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations may be attributed to differences in predator communities and food resources relative to summer wildfire.","Rota, Christopher T.; Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA, USA.",rotact@missouri.edu,,"Rota, Christopher/0000-0001-9272-4687",,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Reproductive Biology",1932-6203,,"Reproduction; Ecology; Population dynamics; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Coleoptera [Impact on habitat /  / ] [South Dakota / Black Hills / ].

Besides the known cases of biological extinctions, this time period was also characterized by the regional extirpations of specialized taxa and by the expansion and population growth of some opportunistic species. Several lines of evidence suggest that the current configuration of small mammal communities - i.e. richness (number of species) and diversity (distribution of species abundance)-in southern South America would have been generated in the period after the arrival of Europeans ca. 1500 AD. In this study, we reviewed the fossil record for small rodents and marsupials during the last 500 years, with emphasis on the Pampean and Patagonian regions. Based on these findings, we offer some considerations concerning the biogeography and conservation of these species. Methods: Micromammals from archaeological and paleontological sites have provided considerable information on environmental conditions during the Quaternary in South America. In this work, we reviewed several micromammal fossil samples, mostly generated by the trophic activity of owls. The use of this kind of data involves some extrinsic and intrinsic biases that must be considered at the time to study the diversity of past communities, such as the bird involved on the accumulations, its hunting techniques, the time of the year, the size and behavior of the prey species, etc. For this work, we compared the fossil samples with more than 700 owl pellet assemblages of the same geographical areas. Results: Richness and diversity of small mammal communities was higher prior to the deepest human impact (> 0.5 ka), showing a pronounced drop in both parameters to the present. The regional extinction of some cricetid rodents and small marsupials was recorded, both in the Pampean (e.g. Bibimys torresi, Pseudoryzomys simplex) and in the Patagonian regions (e.g. Euneomys mordax, Lestodelphys halli, Tympanoctomys kirchnerorum), as well as the biological extinctions of the bat Desmodus cf. D. draculae and the cavy Galea tixiensis in the Pampas. At this same time, opportunistic species (e.g. Calomys spp., Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) showed a dramatic increase of their populations, especially in the most extensively disturbed areas. Discussion and conclusions: In the last 500 years, significant variations occurred in the micromammal assemblages of southern South America. These changes included the dispersion and increase (in some cases extensive) of some specialized species and the regional extinctions of others, involving hundreds to thousands of kilometers of distributional extent. We suggest that the changes produced by livestock and agriculture have caused extensive habitat uniformity which was beneficial for some opportunistic taxa (e.g. Calomys spp., Oligoryzomys longicaudatus), facilitating their dispersion and allowing the increase of their populations. Anthropic disturbances also include the extensive use of fire, urbanization, and introduction of exotic forbs and grasses. Of about 46 species rodents considered as Least Concern by the IUCN and with fossil record for the last 500 years, 23 (50 %) have experienced drastic reductions in their range or abundance during the Late Holocene. At least nine taxa are completely extinct, including one marsupial, one bat and seven rodents. Similar phenomena are recorded in other areas of the Southern Hemisphere, both in continental and island contexts. This evaluation of the fossil record highlights the need to evaluate more carefully the status of some species with supposedly stable populations, but which are likely to be affected by future extensive changes in their environments (e.g. mining, expansion of the agricultural frontier).","Teta, Pablo; Ctr Nacl Patagon, Unidad Invest Diversidad Sistemat & Evoluc, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina, Argentina.",antheca@yahoo.com.ar,,"Tammone, Mauro/0000-0003-2966-820X",,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Paleontology",2007-3364,,"Animals and man; Ecology; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Neotropical region; Geological time periods; Caenozoic; Quaternary","Mammalia [Disturbance by man /  / small taxa] [Community structure / Historical changes / ] [Climate and weather / Climate change / ] [South America /  / ] [Holocene /  / ].","Chordates; Mammals; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Mammalia (Vertebrata): [Fossil].",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15208050219,,gold,,,2018/06/21

The superb lyrebird Menura novaehollandiae is thought to be an important ecosystem engineer that, through its foraging, accelerates the decomposition of litter in Eucalyptus forests. Lyrebird foraging is therefore likely to affect forest fuel loads and hence fire behaviour in these fire-prone forests. In turn, fire is likely to reduce the abundance and influence the distribution of lyrebirds. Aims. Our goal was to determine the impacts of a major bushfire on the habitat and food sources for the superb lyrebird and the effects of foraging activities of lyrebirds on litter fuel and potential fire behaviour in gullies of herb-rich foothill forests. Methods. The effect of fire on lyrebirds and their habitat in the post-fire environment was examined at the landscape-scale, 2 years after fire; and at the patch-scale, 3 years after fire. Paired exclusion and control plots were also used over a 9-month period to assess the effects of foraging by the lyrebird on litter accumulation and fuel connectivity. Fire-behaviour models were used to determine the potential influence of lyrebird scratchings on fire behaviour. Key results. At the landscape scale, lyrebirds were present in both unburnt and ground-burnt sites, but not in canopy-burnt sites. Within patchily burnt sites, lyrebirds favoured foraging in unburnt patches. On average, lyrebird foraging reduced litter fuel loads by25%(1.66 t ha-1) in plots in which they were free to forage, compared with plots from which they were excluded, over a 9-month period. Fire-behaviour modelling showed that lyrebird foraging led to a lower likelihood of fire occurring and less intense fire. Conclusions. Distinctly different vegetation structure and composition between burnt and unburnt patches appears to influence both the foraging patterns and distribution of lyrebirds. Additionally, foraging by lyrebirds reduces surface fuel loads and fuel connectivity such that fire spread is likely to be inhibited. Implications. We propose that alternative stable states may emerge in Eucalyptus forests as a result of feedback mechanisms among lyrebirds, vegetation and fuel accumulation. Therefore, the ecological role of lyrebirds is an important consideration in forest fuel management and conservation in these extensive, fire-prone forests in south-eastern Australia.","Nugent, Daniel T.; 6 Gibbs Rd, Healesville, Vic, 3056, Australia, Australia.",dtnugent@hotmail.com,,,,,"Zoology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Forestry",1035-3712,,"Conservation; Nutrition; Feeding behaviour; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia","Menura novaehollandiae [Conservation measures /  / model] [Food availability /  / ] [Foraging /  / ] [Forest and woodland / Forest / distribution] [Fire /  / ] [Australia / South-east / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Menuridae","Menura novaehollandiae (Menuridae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15103017620,,,,,2018/06/21

Nest-sites are generally selected to reduce the risk of nest predation. In this study we provide information on the reproductive biology of Siamese fireback (Lophura diardi) at Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve, Thailand and identify habitat characteristics that influence nest site selection. At this site the species is found both in pristine and disturbed habitats. During a three year period (2010-2012), we found 21 nest-sites. Egg laying occurred from April to early August and the average clutch size was 6.4 [plus or minus] 0.3 SE eggs (range four-eight). Incubation lasted 23-24 days and daily nest survival was estimated at 0.90 [plus or minus] 0.02 SE (95% CI = 0.85-0.94), giving an estimated overall nest success of 0.08 [plus or minus] 0.04 SE. Predation was the main cause of nest failure. Siamese fireback appeared to prefer to site nests between the buttresses of large trees (62.5%), which presumably have the potential to serve as shelter from potential predators. Analyses indicated that Siamese fireback significantly preferred to place nests in an area associated with dense vegetation coverage below 0.5 m, on steeper slopes, large basal areas of trees DBH > 10 cm and with low potential predation pressure. This can be interpreted as a strategy to make the nest less conspicuous to predators and facilitate flying out of the nest when predators attack.

To evaluate the short-term effects of a summer wildfire on this species, we performed several transect counts in the burnt and unburnt parts of a shrub-steppe in central Spain. The same transects were counted within a three-year interval prior to the fire and were repeated during the first two springs after the fire. We also measured the vegetation during the first two springs after the fire. In the burnt area, we observed a decrease of about 85-100% in Dupont's Lark abundance, and about 7-15% in the control area. The disappearance of the scrub cover after fire and its slow regeneration, as well as the large increase in grass cover during the second year, may explain the decrease in this habitat-specialist bird species. Fire should be avoided in areas occupied by the Dupont's Lark, as its negative effects in the short-term may cause local extinctions. However, prescribed burning may be used in neighboring areas to create new open habitats that may be subsequently colonized by this species.","Perez-Granados, Cristian; Univ Alicante, Fac Sci, 03690 POB 99, Alicante, E-03080, Spain, Spain.",cristian.perez@ua.es,"Noguerales, Victor/C-4376-2013","Noguerales, Victor/0000-0003-3185-778X; Perez-Granados, Cristian/0000-0003-3247-4182",,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology","0001-6454; 1734-8471",,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Chersophilus duponti [Habitat management /  / short-term effects] [Grassland / Arid shrub-steppe / ] [Fire / Summer wildfire / ] [Spain / Soria, Castilla y Leon Autonomous Community / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Alaudidae","Chersophilus duponti (Alaudidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15006031653,,,,,2018/06/21

We present the information on the state of the birds in the Cienega and a checklist of the species that have been detected at the site. We also summarize the ornithological work that has been conducted and compiled recommendations for bird conservation. A total of 261 species of birds have been detected in the Cienega de Santa Clara, representing 71% of the species known to the Colorado River delta. The birds of the Cienega include 189 migratory species (70.4%), 49 year-round residents (18.7%), and 28 breeding visitors (10.7%). Twenty-seven species are federally protected in Mexico, four of them as Endangered, eight as Threatened, and 15 under Special Protection. The Cienega provides critical habitat for migratory waterbirds, with maximum counts of 280,000 shorebirds in the southern mudflats, as well as for breeding marsh birds, including Yuma Clapper Rails, Virginia Rails and California Black Rails, with maximum estimates of 8600, 7150 and 400 individuals respectively. Other species of concern that occur regularly in the Cienega include Least Bittern, Snowy Plover, Least Tern, and Large-billed Savannah Sparrow. This wetland also provides important stopover habitat for 81 species of Neotropical migratory landbirds during their northbound spring migration, particularly for Wilson's Warbler, Swainson's Thrush, Yellow Warbler, Pacific-slope Flycatcher, and Willow Flycatcher. Binational cooperation is essential to protect the Cienega in the long-term, especially in terms of dedicating the necessary water for its maintenance.

Fire management for wildlife conservation requires understanding how species respond to burning at different frequencies, severities, and over time. In an earlier study, we experimentally assessed how breeding bird communities and species responded to fuel reduction treatments by mechanical understory reduction, low-severity prescribed fires, or mechanical understory reduction followed a year later by high-severity prescribed fires in upland hardwood forest. Here, we assess longer-term response to the initial mechanical treatment (M), and a second low-intensity burn in twice burned (B2) and mechanical + twice burned (MB2) treatments and controls (C). Initial (2003) higher dead fuel loadings and consequently high-severity fires in MB2 created open-canopy structure with abundant snags, resulting in much higher species richness and density of breeding birds compared to other treatments. Relative bird density and richness remained much higher in MB2 after a second burn, but few changes were evident that were not already apparent after one burn. The initial (2003) burn in B2 had cooler, low-severity fires that killed few trees. Delayed tree mortality occurred in both burn treatments after one burn, and continued in both after a second low-intensity burn. In B2, this resulted in gradual development of a ""perforated,"" patchy canopy structure with more snags. Abundance of total birds and most species in B2 was similar to C, but several additional species associated with open-forest conditions occurred at low levels, increasing richness in B2. In both burn treatments, burning temporarily reduced habitat suitability for ground-nesting birds. Bird communities in M were similar to C, as shrubs recovered rapidly. Results indicate that one or two relatively low-intensity burns with patches of hotter fire may result in gradual, subtle changes to canopy cover and structure that may slightly increase bird species richness over time. In contrast, a single high-intensity, high severity fire can create young forest conditions and a heterogeneous canopy structure that can be maintained by repeated burning and increase breeding bird relative abundance and richness by attracting disturbance-adapted species while retaining most other forest species.

In the absence of fire, fuels have accumulated in these forests causing concerns over the potential for catastrophic wildfires. Fuel reduction treatments are being used on federal and state lands to reduce the threat of wildfire by mechanically removing biomass. Although these treatments result in a reduction in fire hazard, their impact on wildlife is less clear. We use a multi-species occupancy modeling approach to build habitat-suitability models for 46 upland forest birds found in the Lake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra Nevada based on forest structure and abiotic variables. Using a Bayesian hierarchical framework, we predict species-specific and community-level responses to changes in forest structure and make inferences about responses of important avian foraging guilds. Disparities within and among foraging group responses to canopy cover, tree size and shrub cover emphasized the complexities in managing forests to meet biodiversity goals. Based on our species-specific model results, we predicted changes in species richness and community similarity under forest prescriptions representing three management practices: no active management, a typical fuel reduction treatment that emphasizes spacing between trees, and a thinning prescription that creates structural heterogeneity. Simulated changes to structural components of the forest analogous to management practices to reduce fuel loads clearly affected foraging groups differentially despite variability in responses within guilds. Although species richness was predicted to decrease slightly under both simulated fuels reduction treatments, the prescription that incorporated structural heterogeneity retained marginally higher species richness. The composition of communities supported by different management alternatives was influenced by urbanization and management practice, emphasizing the importance of creating heterogeneity at the landscape scale.

Using occupancy survey data from 2003 to 2011 for all-detections and pairs-only data, we estimated annual extinction and colonization probabilities at 71 burned and 97 unburned breeding-season sites before and after fire, while controlling for confounding effects of non-fire-related temporal variation and among-site differences in habitat characteristics. We found no statistically significant effects of fire or salvage logging on occupancy dynamics of spotted owls of southern California. However, we found some evidence that fire and logging effects could be biologically meaningful. For pairs data, the model-averaged mean of fire-related effects on colonization and extinction probabilities resulted in a 0.062 lesser site-occupancy probability in burned sites 1-year post-fire relative to unburned sites. Post-fire salvage logging reduced occupancy an additional 0.046 relative to sites that only burned. We documented a threshold-type relationship between extinction and colonization probabilities and the amount of forested habitat (conifer or hardwood tree cover types) that burned at high severity within a 203-ha core area around spotted owl nests and roost centroids. Sites where approximately 0-50ha of forested habitat within the core area burned at high severity had extinction probabilities similar to unburned sites, but where more than approximately 50ha of forested habitat burned severely, extinction probability increased approximately 0.003 for every additional hectare severely burned. The majority (75%) of sites burned below this threshold. Sites where high-severity fire affected >50ha of forested habitat could still support spotted owls, so all burned sites should be monitored for occupancy before management actions such as salvage logging are undertaken that could be detrimental to the subspecies. We also recommend that managers strive to reduce human-caused ignitions along the wildland-urban interface, particularly at lower elevations where owl sites are at higher risk of extinction from fire.

We sampled all adult trees found within a 10.24ha permanent plot, young trees within a subplot of 1.44ha and open-pollinated seeds. We detected a very high level of genetic diversity among the three generations in the studied plot. Parentage analysis revealed high pollen immigration rate (0.64) and a mean contemporary pollen dispersal distance of 74m. In addition, half-sib production was 1.8 times higher than full-sibs in significant higher distances, indicating foraging activity preference for different trees at long distances. There was a significant and negative correlation between diameter at breast height (DBH) of the pollen donor with the number of seeds (r=0.640, P-value=0.032), suggesting that pollen donor trees with a higher DBH produce less seeds. The mean distance of realized seed dispersal (recruitment kernel) was 135m due to the large home range dispersers (birds and mammals) in the area. The small magnitude of spatial genetic structure found in young trees may be a consequence of overlapping seed shadows and increased tree density.

These declines may be in part related to contemporary reductions in small-scale forest interior disturbances such as fire, windthrow, and treefalls. To mitigate the negative impacts of disturbance alteration and suppression on some late-successional species, strategies that emulate natural disturbance regimes are often advocated, but large-scale evaluations of these practices are rare. Here, we assessed the consequences of experimental disturbance (using partial timber harvest) on a severely declining late-successional species, the cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea), across the core of its breeding range in the Appalachian Mountains. We measured numerical (density), physiological (body condition), and demographic (age structure and reproduction) responses to three levels of disturbance and explored the potential impacts of disturbance on source-sink dynamics. Breeding densities of warblers increased one to four years after all canopy disturbances (vs. controls) and males occupying territories on treatment plots were in better condition than those on control plots. However, these beneficial effects of disturbance did not correspond to improvements in reproduction; nest success was lower on all treatment plots than on control plots in the southern region and marginally lower on light disturbance plots in the northern region. Our data suggest that only habitats in the southern region acted as sources, and interior disturbances in this region have the potential to create ecological traps at a local scale, but sources when viewed at broader scales. Thus, cerulean warblers would likely benefit from management that strikes a landscape-level balance between emulating natural disturbances in order to attract individuals into areas where current structure is inappropriate, and limiting anthropogenic disturbance in forests that already possess appropriate structural attributes in order to maintain maximum productivity.","Boves, Than J.; Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA, USA.",tboves@illinois.edu,"Rodewald, Amanda/I-6308-2016","Rodewald, Amanda/0000-0002-6719-6306",,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Physiology; Reproductive Biology",1932-6203,,"Conservation; Whole animal physiology; Reproduction; Ecology; Land zones; Nearctic region","Setophaga cerulea [Conservation measures /  / Impacts of natural disturbances] [Physiological condition / Body condition / ] [Reproduction /  / ] [Population dynamics / Population decline / ] [North America / Appalachian Mountains / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Parulidae","Setophaga cerulea (Parulidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR15010052858,23308104,gold,,,2018/06/21

Monthly samples from commercial heliconia productions in six municipalities of Southern Bahia (13[degree] 21' a 14[degree] 58' latitude South and 39[degree] 04' a 39[degree] 27' longitude West) were collected during August 2006 to June 2007. Samples of five vegetative stocks, two reproductive stocks and roots as well as insects were collected by entomological net, per plant. Insect triage of the collected material was done under a stereoscope (40x) at the Entomology Laboratory at the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz - UESC. A total of 45 insect families distributed in eight orders were identified. The occurrence of the mealy bug Dysmicoccus sp. was detected in Heliconia rostrata and H. latispath cv 'She' and var. 'Golden Torch'. The weevil, Metamasius hemipterus L., was found in rhizomes and stems of H. Rostrata and H. wagneriana, var. 'Alan Carle' and cv. 'Fire Bird'. The grasshopper, Tropidacris collaris (Stoll), was most often found on H. psittacorum (L.) (cv. 'Red Opol') as well as on 'Alan Carle' and 'Golden Torch', causing defoliation. Species of grasshoppers of the genus Cornops were observed on heliconia leaves. Additionally, Opsiphanes sp., Antichloris sp., Anartia jatrophae L. and Argyreuptychia sp. (Lepidoptera) were detected in collected samples and caterpillars were found on inflorescences, causing defoliation and irreversible damage to flowers. Because of the importance of the tropical flowers growing in the region, the results found in the studies will contribute to the crop management.","Leao Bittencourt, Maria Aparecida; Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Dept Ciencias Agr & Ambientais, Rod Ilheus Itabuna,Km 16, Ilheus, BA, Brazil, Brazil.",malbitte@uesc.br,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology",0102-5333,,"Ecology; Habitat; Man made habitat; Land zones; Neotropical region; South America","Insecta [Population dynamics /  / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Heliconias farm / ] [Brazil / Bahia / ].","Arthropods; Insects; Invertebrates","Animalia, Arthropoda","Insecta (Arthropoda).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14908032058,,,,,2018/06/21

In the Orkney Isles, where pole nesting is relatively common, most nests are actively removed before they can cause a fault. However, rebuilding often occurs. Although the electrical company routinely fits Firefly FF-type diverters (P&R Tech Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA) after nest removals to deter the crows from rebuilding, there has been no field test of the effectiveness of the Fireflies as a deterrent. In our study, carried out in Orkney in the Spring/Summer of 2009 and 2010, Fireflies were fitted at half of the sites from which nests were removed and not fitted at the other half of the sites. We found that crows were equally likely to rebuild at sites fitted with Fireflies as they were to rebuild at sites without Fireflies. However, rebuilding was less likely to occur the later in the season that nests were removed, and nests in the middle phase of construction were the most likely to be rebuilt. Therefore, making an appropriate decision as to when to remove a crow nest seems to be a more effective method for deterring nest rebuilding than is the fitting of Firefly diverters.

We study here the usefulness of a general-purpose monitoring programme for the calibration of hybrid SDMs. As a benchmark case, we take the calibration with data from a monitoring programme that specifically surveys those areas where environmental changes expected to be relevant occur. Location Catalonia, north-east of Spain. Methods We modelled the distribution changes of twelve open-habitat bird species in landscapes whose dynamics are driven by fire and forest regeneration. We developed hybrid SDMs combining correlative habitat suitability with mechanistic occupancy models. We used observations from two monitoring programmes to provide maximum-likelihood estimates for spread parameters: a common breeding bird survey (CBS) and a programme specifically designed to monitor bird communities within areas affected by wildfires (DINDIS). Results Both calibration with CBS and DINDIS data yielded sound spread parameter estimates and range dynamics that suggested dispersal limitations. However, compared to calibration with DINDIS data, calibration with CBS data leads to biased estimates of spread distance for seven species and to a higher degree of uncertainty in predicted range dynamics for six species. Main conclusions We have shown that available monitoring data can be used in the calibration of the mechanistic component of hybrid SDMs. However, if the dynamics of the target species occur within areas not well covered, general-purpose monitoring data can lead to biased and inaccurate parameter estimates. To determine the potential usefulness of a given monitoring data set for the calibration of the mechanistic component of a hybrid SDM, we recommend quantifying the number of surveyed sites that are predicted to undergo habitat suitability changes.","De Caceres, Miquel; CTFC, Ctra St Llorenc,de Morunys Km 2, Solsona, Catalonia, E-25280, Spain, Spain.",miquelcaceres@gmail.com,"Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009; De Caceres, Miquel/I-1279-2016","Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457; De Caceres, Miquel/0000-0001-7132-2080",,,"Zoology; Forestry; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",1366-9516,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Techniques; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Aves [Forestry / Forest regeneration / distribution dynamics] [Ecological techniques / Species distribution model monitoring technique evaluation / ] [Fire /  / ] [Spain / Catalonia / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14901002858,,,,,2018/06/21

We evaluated the impacts of grassland alteration by mowing and fire on the abundance, diversity, and frequency of birds using 1 control and 2 experimental grass plots from 2009 to 2010 on a U.S. Army airfield in Colorado located in short-grass prairie. Density of breeding birds was highest in the mowed plot. Numbers of birds observed in 34 surveys conducted during the non-breeding season in the burned ((x) over bar = 41) and mowed ((x) over bar = 24) plots were greater than in an unmanaged control ((x) over bar = 7) plot. Bird species diversity in the nonbreeding season was greatest in the control plot. Horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) was the most frequently observed bird species and occurred in high numbers on the burned and mowed plots, possibly because of its preference for short vegetation and bare ground. This species is recognized as hazardous to aircraft in part because of its habit of forming large flocks in the nonbreeding season. All 3 study plots were dominated by grasses and forbs, with minimal shrub and cactus cover. Litter cover was greatest on the control plot, while the burned plot had the greatest coverage of bare ground. Results from this study are limited because the small size of the airfield precluded placement of multiple treatment plots. Additional study in larger airfields with multiple treatment plots would be required before management recommendations regarding the use of fire and mowing can be made for airfields in areas with short-grass prairie.","Carragher, Kara A.; Univ Colorado, Dept Biol, 1420 Austin Bluffs Pkwy, Colorado Springs, CO, 80918, USA, USA.",rclawges@gmail.com,,,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",,,"Animals and man; Ecology; Community structure; Population dynamics; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat","Aves [Damage caused by animals /  / comparative study] [Species diversity /  / ] [Population density /  / ] [Grassland / Grassland alterations / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14907025515,,,,,2018/06/21

This study re-evaluates its conservation status by assessing its population size and habitat preferences on Mount Mulanje, where forest patches are threatened by illegal logging and an increasing frequency of uncontrolled fires. These fires also cause a proliferation of invasive plant species, especially the Himalayan yellow raspberry Rubus ellipticus. We surveyed the Yellow-throated Apalis in 41 forest patches during the breeding season. The apalises favoured forest edge habitat, occurring in forest patches as small as 0.01 ha. Their occurrence was positively correlated with the presence of R. ellipticus, although this relationship may be driven primarily by canopy architecture and the existence of an understorey shrub layer. At a conservative estimate, 7,900 Yellow-throated Apalises were calculated to be present in cedar forest habitat alone on Mount Mulanje. Given that the birds occurred in other native forests at the same altitude at densities of 8.6-10.9 birds ha-1, the true population size on Mount Mulanje alone is likely to approach or even exceed IUCN's most optimistic estimate of the global population (10,000).","Hockey, Philip A.R.; Univ Cape Town, Percy Fitzpatrick Inst African Ornithol, Private Bag X3, Rondebosch, ZA-7701, South Africa, South Africa.",phil.hockey@uct.ac.za,"Ridley, Amanda/D-2636-2011; Ridley, Amanda/B-5759-2009","Mzumara, Tiwonge/0000-0002-5364-9853; Ridley, Amanda/0000-0001-5886-0992",,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Forestry",0959-2709,,"Conservation; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Afrotropical region; Africa","Apalis flavigularis [Endangered status / Conservation status / Re-assessment] [Population size /  / ] [Habitat preference /  / ] [Forest and woodland / Forest / ] [Mountain habitat /  / ] [Malawi / Mount Mulanje / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Sylviidae","Apalis flavigularis (Sylviidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14810069470,,gold_or_bronze,,,2018/06/21

To explore a proactive risk mitigation strategy we deployed novel nest diverters on 51 structures supporting a 230 kV H-frame transmission line in Kiowa and Bent Counties, Colorado, USA, and compared nesting on these structures with nesting on 66 structures without nest diverters on the same line. Chihuahuan ravens placed nest material on 7% of treated structures and 43% of untreated structures and nested on 0% of treated structures and 34% of untreated structures. Chihuahuan ravens were less likely to attempt to nest on, or actually nest on, structures treated with nest diverters.

Among all factors causing habitat disturbance, wildfire is recognized as one of the most important ecological forces that influences not only the physical environment, but also the structure and composition of floral and faunal communities.

In this study, we analyzed the genetic consequences of a demographic bottleneck produced by a forest fire that reduced the population of the endangered blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea polatzeki), which inhabits the island of Gran Canaria, to approximately 122 individuals. Analysis of nine micro-satellite loci revealed that, while a decline in census was observed during the bottleneck, there was no observed excess of heterozygosity or evidence of a decline in allelic richness, two characteristic bottleneck signatures. On the contrary, we observed that the Gran Canaria blue chaffinch has retained significant levels of genetic diversity and shows no evidence of an increased level of inbreeding (FIS) either before or after the bottleneck.

Partial nest depredation occurs when predators attack but leave some eggs intact. Using continuous video monitoring, we documented a total of 372 initial predation events at nests of Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). From these, we observed a sample of partial nest predation events (n = 47). Partial predation events resulted in three outcomes: (1) The nest failed due to parental abandonment; (2) adult stayed with the nest, but clutch failed to hatch, usually due to further predation events; or (3) adult stayed with nest and the remaining eggs hatched, adding to the reproductive fitness of the adult. Most common predators causing partial depredations were ratsnakes (Pantherophis alleghaniensis and P. guttatus), kingsnakes (Lampropeltis getula), and fire ants (Solenopsis spp.). We used logistic regression and model selection methods to assess six cues that parents may use to determine the value of remaining offspring and resulting abandonment decision. Overall, nests with fewer eggs remaining after the predation event or those predated early in the incubation period were more likely to be abandoned; juveniles appeared more likely to abandon than adults. Future studies will be needed to confirm our findings of the relationships between cues and abandonment decisions, and video surveillance systems will be a necessary component of these studies.","Ellis-Felege, Susan N.; Univ N Dakota, Dept Biol, 10 Cornell St,Stop 9019, Grand Forks, ND, 58202, USA, USA.",susan.felege@email.und.edu,,,,,"Zoology; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Anatomy & Morphology; Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0197-9922,,"Techniques; Biometrics; Reproduction; Reproductive behaviour; Ecology; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Colinus virginianus [Photographic techniques / Video surveillance / ] [Age /  / ] [Parental care / Parental investment / ] [Predators / Partial nest depredation / ] [Florida / North / ] [Georgia-USA / South / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Galliformes, Phasianidae","Colinus virginianus (Phasianidae): [Prey].",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14912066370,,,,,2018/06/21

Using vegetation data derived from satellite imagery, we modeled habitat suitability by using a maximum entropy model. We used Maxent software to compute habitat suitability scores from vegetation and physiographic attributes based on comparisons of conditions at 342 sites that were occupied by marbled murrelets (equal numbers of confirmed nest sites and likely nest sites) and average conditions over all forested lands in which the murrelets occurred. We estimated 3.8 million acres of higher suitability nesting habitat over all lands in the murrelet's range in Washington, Oregon, and California at the start of the Plan (1994/96). Most (89 percent) baseline habitat on federally administered lands occurred within reserved-land allocations. A substantial amount (36 percent) of baseline habitat occurred on nonfederal lands. Over all lands, we observed a net loss of about 7 percent of higher suitability potential nesting habitat from the baseline period to 2006/07. If we focus on losses and ignore gains, we estimate a loss of about 13 percent of the higher suitability habitat present at baseline, over this same period. Fire has been the major cause of loss of nesting habitat on federal lands since the Plan was implemented; timber harvest is the primary cause of loss on nonfederal lands. We also found that murrelet population size is strongly and positively correlated with amount or nesting habitat, suggesting that conservation of remaining nesting habitat and restoration of currently unsuitable habitat is key to murrelet recovery.","Raphael, Martin G.; US Forest Serv, USDA, 3625 93rd Ave SW, Olympia, WA 98512, USA, USA.",,,,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Reproductive Biology; Forestry",0363-6224,,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Reproduction; Reproductive behaviour; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Brachyramphus marmoratus [Habitat management /  / monitoring plan report] [Breeding site / Nesting habitat status / ] [Population size /  / ] [Forest and woodland / Forest / ] [California /  / ] [Oregon /  / ] [Washington /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Charadriiformes, Alcidae","Brachyramphus marmoratus (Alcidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14802009097,,,,,2018/06/21

We use two natural disturbances, fire and grazing, to examine the response of bird and arthropod communities in grasslands of Serengeti, Tanzania. Both burning and grazing by migrant ungulates take place at the end of the rains in June-July. We documented the communities before disturbance, then 1, 4 and 20 weeks after disturbance on three replicate plots and compared them with three undisturbed plots. Birds were recorded by observation, arthropods from pitfall, tray trap and sweepnet samples. We expected that as the grass biomass was reduced by either disturbance, bird communities would change with concomitant change in arthropod food abundance. Alternatively, bird communities would change not with the absolute amount of food but with the greater accessibility of food as the grass structure changed from long to short grass. Results showed first that both bird species richness and abundance increased after both types of disturbance, but burnt sites showed a greater increase than that for grazed sites. Second, there was a change in bird species composition with disturbance. The functionally equivalent athi short-toed lark (Calandrella athensis) was replaced by the red-capped lark (Calandrella cinerea). Third, the abundance of most groups of arthropods was lower on disturbed sites than those on undisturbed sites, and the reduction of arthropod numbers was greatest on burnt sites. These results imply that bird abundance did not occur through an increase in arthropod abundance but rather through a change in the grass structure making food more accessible; and the higher predation could have caused the lower arthropod abundance. In addition, some bird species replaced others thus functionally compensating for their loss.","Sinclair, A.R.E.; Tanzania Wildlife Res Inst, Serengeti Biodivers Program, Arusha, Tanzania, Tanzania.",sinclair@zoology.ubc.ca,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Nutrition & Dietetics",1442-9985,,"Nutrition; Diet; Ecology; Trophic structure; Community structure; Predators; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Afrotropical region; Africa","Arthropoda [Food webs / Mammalian grazing / ] [Relative abundance /  / ] [Avian predators /  / ] [Grassland /  / ] [Fire / Wildfire / ] [Tanzania / Serengeti / ].

To improve our knowledge on these mechanisms, we examine cavity abundance, cavity occupation and reproductive performance of SCN in Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests subjected to two management systems: (i) dense ""young forests"", maintained at such stage by clear-cuttings and burns, and (ii) ""old forest"", subjected to extensive traditional grazing and scarce firewood extraction by selective cutting. Young forests had considerably lower density of cavities (1.29 [plus or minus] 0.71 vs 15.09 [plus or minus] 2.00 cavities ha-1). SCN species (0.18 [plus or minus] 0.11 vs 0.61 [plus or minus] 0.07 species ha-1) and nests (0.40 [plus or minus] 0.27 vs 2.67 [plus or minus] 0.25 nests of all SCN ha-1) than old forests, indicating that a low availability of cavities may limit SCN assemblages in young oak forests. However, reproductive parameters of great (Parus major) and blue (Cyanistes caeruleus) tits associated with the availability of food (laying date, clutch size, nestling number and weight, adult weight) did not differ between both forest types, suggesting that food supply was not reduced in young forests, at least for tits during the breeding season. Large diameter (up to 170 cm dbh) decayed trees were the most likely to hold cavities, but birds preferred smaller living cavity-trees for nesting (90% of nests in 21-65 cm dbh trees). The preservation of cavity-trees within traditionally managed old oak forests is crucial in providing nesting opportunities to SCN. Besides, the protection of these traditionally managed forests would also benefit to other forest organisms that depend on old and open oak forests. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Nests were built mainly from mid June until early July on massive growing Western Waterweed Elodea nuttallii in the middle of the 210 ha lake, nearly 300-350 m off the waterline. The colony covered an area of 2-3 ha. By observation from distance, in total 91 breeding attempts were documented, of which 89 failed. Only two of the very early broods resulted in four fledged juveniles, i. e. breeding success was 0,08 juv./pair referring to the minimum breeding stock of 52 pairs. Losses were caused mainly by predation by a female Marsh Harrier. That bird flew into the colony on three of four evenings with special controls (3rd, 7th, 10th and July, but not 8th July). The Marsh Harrier visited up to three nests for feeding within 20 minutes each day. The Black-necked Grebes could not defend their broods against the raptor and escaped by diving immediately before the Marsh Harrier landed on the nest. The latest replacement clutch was registered at 20'h July. The colony was potentially endangered due to surfing and sailing, but those activities mostly ceased early June because of the growing waterweed. To protect the grebe nests against pedal boating, the southern part of the lake (70 ha) was closed with a line of buoys. A replacement clutch 50-70 m nearby man made structures was destroyed by a swimmer (man or dog). After a professional firework in the night of 30th July (10:54-11:12 h p.m., sunset 9:23 h p.m.) directly beneath the northern part of lake Alfsee about 23 % of all Black-necked Grebes were missing the day after (including 11 of the former 15 first-year birds, which had arrived from elsewhere).","Flore, Bernd-Olaf; Gartlager Weg 54, D-49086 Osnabrueck, Germany, Germany.",FloreBeOl@aol.com,,,,,"Zoology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Reproductive Biology",0042-7993,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Conservation; Nutrition; Diet; Prey; Reproduction; Ecology; Predators; Habitat; Freshwater habitat; Lentic water; Abiotic factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Circus aerguginosus [Avian prey / Podiceps nigricollis / Predation impact] [Lake / Shallow artificial lake / ] [Germany / Lake Alfsee / ].

Currently, most fuel reduction projects do not include riparian, due to the perception that these riparian areas are negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbance. However, there is very little information on the ecological consequences of including riparian areas in fuel reduction projects. We compared the effects of non-commercial thin and handpile treatments followed by prescribed burns in riparian areas of intermittent and perennial streams that were treated to the streamside (unbuffered), to the typical prescription in which sites were treated only in the adjacent upland (buffered). Unbuffered fuel reduction treatments have the potential to affect bird density and reproductive success differently than buffered treatments by altering (1) available nest habitat, (2) predator and nest parasite abundance, and (3) food availability in riparian areas. This study assessed whether unbuffered fuel reduction treatments yielded similar bird response as buffered treatments by quantifying differences in density and reproductive success of five bird species, vegetation structure, the frequency of occurrence of predators and a nest parasite, and arthropod biomass. Density was greater for the shrub and tree-nesting Pacific-slope Flycatcher in buffered streams post treatment. Reproductive success showed a minimal, near-term effect for the shrub-nesting Black-headed Grosbeak. For potential causal factors, we found differences between buffered and unbuffered streams only for available nest habitat in the upper-ground strata and frequency of occurrence of raptors. Overall, results suggest that fuel reduction in riparian areas as compared with typical upland treatments with buffers had a small effect on bird density and a near-term effect on reproductive success. Additional study of fuel reduction in riparian areas is warranted because of its effectiveness in reducing the risk of unnaturally severe wildfire and, correspondingly, the potential benefit to bird communities over the long-term.

Baseline data collected prior to the application of treatments allows accurate estimation of changes taking place on the experimental units, and random allocation of treatments ensures that relations between causes and effects can be established. This is critical to effective active adaptive management. In this paper, we outline the establishment phase of a new long-term ecological restoration experiment in south-eastern Australia, that will test ways of improving critically endangered box gum grassy woodlands for biodiversity. In the experimental design, treatments include the addition of 2000 tonnes of coarse woody debris, exclusion of kangaroos and fire. Random variation in biophysical variables occurs at several levels. To facilitate accurate estimation of key main effects, selected high order interactions are partially confounded with 'random' block terms. Response variables include: plants, birds, small mammals, reptiles and invertebrates. Analysis of baseline data across selected response variables confirmed no pre-treatment effects. The experiment provides a strong inferential framework for tracking the effects of restoration treatments on woodland biodiversity over coming years. It also provides a model for other similar experiments that integrate restoration and research. A newly constructed feral animal-proof fence, that will allow reintroduction of locally extinct species, including ecosystem engineers, will provide additional opportunities to research the woodland restoration process. This experiment will become a long-term ecological research site, and an 'outdoor laboratory' for ecological restoration research, and community and student learning.","Manning, A.D.; The Fenner School for Environment and Society, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia, Australia.",adrian.manning@anu.edu.au,"Gordon, Iain/K-8636-2012; McIntyre, Sue/F-1885-2010; Lindenmayer, David/P-7183-2017","Gordon, Iain/0000-0001-9704-0946; Lindenmayer, David/0000-0002-4766-4088; Manning, Adrian/0000-0003-0989-9203",,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry",0067-2238,,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Ecology; Community structure; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia; Australia","Animalia [Habitat management / Ecological restoration / ] [Species diversity / Species richness / ] [Forest and woodland / Woodland / ] [Australian Capital Territory / Mulligans Flat & Goorooyarroo Nature Reserve / ].",,Animalia,Animalia.,,ZOOREC:ZOOR14708057566,,,,,2018/06/21

The negative effects of agricultural intensification and policies, use of pesticides, fertilisers and mechanised harvesting on several populations of pseudo-steppe birds have increasingly required more detailed and effective habitat suitability models. Distribution models of farmland species are prone to incur recordings of false absence data. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) allows identification of environmental predictors of species distribution by using presence data only. Aims. We quantified the diurnal habitat preferences and niche width of one steppe species, the stone curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus), with unfavourable conservations status in a Mediterranean area and reclassified a map with respect to habitat suitability classes according to the resulting distribution model. Methods. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis was used with GIS cartography customised with habitat and anthropogenic variables recorded during field surveys carried out in four study plots ([approximately]500 ha) and at different spatial scales. Key results. The stone curlew selected areas with low vegetation cover, such as fields following artichoke harvesting and tillage, close to rural buildings and unpaved roads. In contrast, the stone curlew avoided areas with high vegetation cover and areas highly disturbed by human-induced fires. The occurrence of natural vegetation was neither preferred nor avoided. The most robust model was based on a large-scale analysis (200 m from the bird location points), according to which the optimal area for stone curlew distribution during its breeding season was restricted to 1% of the entire study area. Conclusions. Two uncorrelated factors, 'marginality' and 'tolerance', described the stone curlew's niche in the area. The first index indicated selection for habitats that were marginal with respect to those available in the area, whereas the second indicated a species with a medium-wide environmental niche. In particular, the stone curlew occupied a much more restricted niche (low tolerance) in relation to individual variables. The use of customised databases at a large scale of analysis was found to more effectively reveal ecological requirements of this marginal and specialised species. Implications. Our results allowed us to indicate practical land management actions for the stone curlew, such as prevention of human-induced fires and increase of pastoral activities. Our results indicated a potentially positive role of little-disturbed service roads along rural buildings in stone curlew distribution, which warrants further research. In addition, studies are needed to verify the presence of an ecological trap in artichoke fields, their preferred habitat. As we showed for the stone curlew, niche analyses conducted at a large scale using customised databases could greatly improve habitat suitability models of farmland species.","Campobello, Daniela; Univ Palermo, Dept Environm Biol & Biodivers, Via Archirafi, Palermo, Italy, Italy.",danielacampobello@hotmail.com,"Sara, Maurizio/H-2662-2012","Sara, Maurizio/0000-0003-4274-422X; Campobello, Daniela/0000-0003-4094-9395",,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Behavioral Sciences",1035-3712,,"Techniques; Behaviour; Activity patterns; Circadian activity; Ecology; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe; Italy","Burhinus oedicnemus [Ecological techniques / Ecological niche factor analysis / ] [Diurnal activity / Diurnal habitat suitability / ] [Ecological niche /  / ] [Habitat preference /  / ] [Grassland / Steppelands habitat / ] [Sicily / South, Gela Plain / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Charadriiformes, Burhinidae","Burhinus oedicnemus (Burhinidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14707050933,,,,,2018/06/21

We presented a bird-monitoring database in Mediterranean landscapes (Catalonia, NE Spain) affected by wildfires and we evaluated: 1) the spatial and temporal variability in the bird community composition and 2) the influence of pre-fire habitat configuration in the composition of bird communities. The DINDIS database results from the monitoring of bird communities occupying all areas affected by large wildfires in Catalonia since 2000. We used bird surveys conducted from 2006 to 2009 and performed a principal components analysis to describe two main gradients of variation in the composition of bird communities, which were used as descriptors of bird communities in subsequent analyses. We then analysed the relationships of these community descriptors with bioclimatic regions within Catalonia, time since fire and pre-fire vegetation (forest or shrubland). We have conducted I,918 bird surveys in 567 transects distributed in 56 burnt areas. Eight out of the twenty most common detected species have an unfavourable conservation status, most of them being associated to open-habitats. Both bird communities' descriptors had a strong regional component and were related to pre-fire vegetation, and to a lesser extent to the time since fire. We came to the conclusion that the responses of bird communities to wildfires are heterogeneous, complex and context dependent. Large-scale monitoring datasets, such as DINDIS, might allow identifying factors acting at different spatial and temporal scales that affect the dynamics of species and communities, giving additional information on the causes under general trends observed using other monitoring systems.","Zozaya, Elena L.; Forest Technol Ctr Catalonia, Biodivers Dept, Ctra St Llorenc de Morunys Port Comte Km 2, Solsona, E-25280, Spain, Spain.",elzozaya@mail.com,"Pons, Pere/B-9472-2008; Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009","Pons, Pere/0000-0002-2196-5544; Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457; Clavero, Miguel/0000-0002-5186-0153; Rost, Josep/0000-0003-4053-5141",,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Computer Science",0570-7358,,"Techniques; Information handling; Ecology; Habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Aves [Ecological techniques / Community dynamics monitoring / ] [Use of computers / Database design / ] [Community structure /  / ] [Population dynamics /  / ] [Terrestrial habitat / Mediterranean landscapes / ] [Fire / Wildfire / ] [Spain / Catalonia / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14803018757,,,,,2018/06/21

Logging implies an additional disturbance occurring shortly after fire, although its ecological effects can be somewhat mitigated by leaving wood debris on site. The composition of the bird community and its capacity to provide ecosystem services such as seed dispersal of fleshy-fruited plants have been shown to be affected by postfire logging. We assessed the effects of the habitat structure resulting from different postfire management practices on the bird community, in three burned pine forests in Catalonia (western Mediterranean). For this purpose, we focused on the group of species that is responsible for seed dispersal, a process which takes place primarily during the winter in the Mediterranean basin. In addition, we assessed microhabitat selection by seed disperser birds in such environments in relation to management practices. Our results showed a significant, positive relationship between the density of wood debris piles and the abundance of seed disperser birds. Furthermore, such piles were the preferred microhabitat of these species. This reveals an important effect of forest management on seed disperser birds, which is likely to affect the dynamics of bird-dependent seed dispersal. Thus, building wood debris piles can be a useful practice for the conservation of both the species and their ecosystem services, while also being compatible with timber harvesting.

Intensive fire and grazing denude and homogenize vegetation whereas their suppression increases woody cover. Although habitat loss is implicated in grassland bird declines, degradation through intensive management or neglect also decreases breeding habitat and may reduce nesting success through increased rates of nest predation. Snakes are important nest predators, but little is known about how habitat use in snakes relates to predation risk for grassland birds nesting within tallgrass prairie subjected to different grazing and fire frequencies. We evaluated nest survival in the context of habitat used by nesting songbirds and two bird-eating snakes, the eastern yellowbelly racer Coluber constrictor flaviventris and Great Plains ratsnake Pantherophis emoryi. Daily nest survival rates decreased with increasing shrub cover and decreasing vegetation height, which characterize grasslands that have been neglected or intensively managed, respectively. Discriminant function analysis revealed that snake habitats were characterized by higher shrub cover, whereas successful nests were more likely to occur in areas with tall grass and forbs but reduced shrub cover. Because snakes often use shrub habitat, birds nesting in areas with increased shrub cover may be at higher risk of nest predation by snakes in addition to other predators known to use shrub habitat (e.g., mid-sized carnivores and avian predators). Depredated nests also occurred outside the discriminant space of the snakes, indicating that other predators (e.g., ground squirrels Spermophilus spp. and bullsnakes Pituophis catenifer) may be important in areas with denuded cover. Targeted removal of shrubs may increase nest success by minimizing the activity of nest predators attracted to shrub cover.","Klug, Page E.; Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, 116 Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS, USA, USA.",pklug@ksu.edu,"With, Kimberly/J-5124-2014","With, Kimberly/0000-0001-5570-1515; Klug, Page/0000-0002-0836-3901",,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Nutrition & Dietetics",0029-8549,,"Nutrition; Diet; Prey; Ecology; Population dynamics; Predators; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Ammodramus savannarum; Chondestes grammacus; Spiza americana; Spizella pusilla; Sturnella magna [Mortality / Nest predation risk / predator habitat use] [Reptilian predators / Coluber constrictor flaviventris / ] [ / Pantherophis emoryi / ] [Habitat utilization /  / ] [Grassland /  / ] [Kansas / Konza Prairie / ].

We recognized three functional bird types: seabirds, waterbirds, and landbirds (the latter separately treated as granivorous, insectivorous, carnivorous). The evidence shows that El Nino affects seabirds by reducing their food base. Seabirds feeding on fish, or fish plus squid, generally decrease their population abundance, as a combined result of adult mortality and reproductive failure. Omnivorous seabirds negotiate El Nino periods with modest declines, while those including fishery wastes in their diets show minimal changes during such periods. Waterbirds in the southeastern Pacific benefit from precipitation that accompanies El Nino, which enlarges their wetland habitats. Finally. landbirds are favored by El Nino-driven precipitation, which fires up primary productivity fuelling arthropod and mammal increases. Granivorous birds react promptly to peaks in seed output, while insectivores respond similarly to arthropod abundance. Carnivorous birds take somewhat longer to react to increases in mammal populations. We conclude that (a) Food shortage may be an important key factor for bird populations in the southeastern Pacific, but its effects depend on diet breadth, prey switching, and life history parameters. (b) Seasonal patterns of productivity determine distribution and abundance of resident birds, but variations imposed by occurrences of El Nino and La Nina phases determine the presence and abundance of migratory birds. (c) The dichotomy El Nino versus La Nina or versus 'normal' years is artificial and non conducive.

We quantified nest survival and identified nest predators of shrub-nesting songbirds within 4 large (approx. 40-ha) exclosures and 4 control sites within a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. During 2003-2006, we located and monitored 535 shrub nests (222 with videography) for 4,804 nest-days to quantify daily nest survival and document predation events. We found no support for a treatment effect, suggesting mesopredators had little impact on daily nest survival (0.9303 in controls and 0.9260 in exclosures) of shrub-nesting songbirds. For the 5 most commonly monitored species, daily nest survival within species was constant. Our analysis suggested that shrub nests were most vulnerable during the nestling stage and presence of cameras on nests increased survival with the increase in survival being more pronounced during the incubation stage. We filmed 107 nest predation events, identifying predators at 88 nests. Of these 88 nests, snakes caused 33%, red imported fire ants (hereafter fire ants, Solenopsis invicta) 28%, raptors 17%, corvids 8%, mesopredators 6%, and small mammals 8% of nest predations. Cause-specific nest predation in controls and exclosures did not differ from expectation, providing evidence that compensatory predation did not occur. Nest predators differed from expectation with regard to nest stage; fire ants and raptors only depredated nests during the nestling stage. Presence of cameras had no effect on nest abandonment. Fire ants were the most prevalent nest predator, and nest predation by fire ants was only observed on nestlings, potentially reducing likelihood of renesting. Magnitude and timing of fire ant predation suggests that fire ants may be the most influential nest predator of shrub-nesting birds within the longleaf pine ecosystem. Our data suggest that controlling mesopredators will have no effect on nest success of shrub-nesting birds within longleaf pine forests.","Conner, L.

We describe a single observation of an individual Bobwhite killed by a prescribed fire event. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of its kind in the scientific literature. We believe this occurrence is uncommon under most conditions while conducting prescribed fires. However, managers should consider the fuel conditions, weather variables, and scale of fire before conducting prescribed fires for Bobwhite habitat enhancement.

These outbreaks are managed through removal of trees infested with mountain pine beetles to control mountain pine beetle populations and salvage timber resources. To minimize impacts to black-backed woodpeckers while meeting management objectives, there is a need to identify characteristics of these areas that support black-backed woodpeckers. We examined the habitat associations of this species nesting in areas of beetle outbreaks in the Black Hills, South Dakota in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic approach and discrete choice models to evaluate nest-site selection of 42 woodpecker nests at 3 spatial scales-territory, nest area, and nest tree. At the territory scale (250 m around nest), availability and distribution of food best explained black-backed woodpecker selection of beetle outbreaks versus the surrounding forest. Selection at the territory scale was positively associated with densities of trees currently infested by mountain pine beetles and indices of wood borer (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) abundance, and was greatest at distances of 50-100 m from the nearest patch of infestation. At the nest-area scale (12.5 m radius around the nest), densities of snags positively influenced nest-area selection. Finally, at the nest-tree scale, aspen (Populus tremuloides) and 3-5-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags were important resources. The association between abundant wood-boring insects and black-backed woodpeckers creates a difficult challenge for forest managers. In the absence of fire, areas of beetle outbreak might serve as the only substantial source of habitat in the Black Hills. Regulating insect populations via salvage logging will reduce key food resources to black-backed woodpeckers during nesting. Therefore, given the relatively infrequent occurrence of large-scale fire in the Black Hills, management should recognize the importance of beetle-killed forests to the long-term viability of the black-backed woodpecker population in the Black Hills.

Extinction debt is the term used to describe the ongoing loss of species from fragmented landscapes long after the original loss and fragmentation of habitat. However, losses may also result from habitat changes that are unrelated to fragmentation, which reduce breeding success and recruitment. Many woodland birds have declined in fragmented landscapes in Australia, probably due to loss of small, isolated populations, though the ecological processes are poorly understood. We record the progressive regional loss of two ground-foraging, woodland birds, the Brown Treecreeper Climacteris picumnus and Hooded Robin Melanodryas cucullata, in northern New South Wales, over 30 years. This has happened despite most habitat loss occurring over 100 years ago, suggesting the payment of an extinction debt. Our observations suggest that several ecological processes, caused by habitat loss, fragmentation or degradation, and operating over different time scales, have led to both species' declines. Female Brown Treecreepers disperse poorly among vegetation remnants, leaving only males in isolated populations, which then go extinct. In contrast, Hooded Robins suffer high nest predation in fragmented landscapes, producing too few recruits to replace adult mortality. Foraging by both species may also be affected by regrowth of ground vegetation and shrubs. We found little support for a major role played by drought, climate change or aggressive Noisy Miners Manorina melanocephala. We propose that both extinction debt in the classical sense and ongoing habitat change frequently contribute to species' decline in modified landscapes. Management to arrest and reverse such declines needs to consider these multiple causes of decline. For instance, reconnecting isolated populations may be inadequate alone, and activities such as appropriate grazing, fires and the addition of woody debris may also be required.

Given its high abundance in recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time. Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success declined from 84% the first year after fire to 73% and 25%, respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests. Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests. Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature and over-mature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated species.","Nappi, Antoine; Centre for Forest Research, Departement des sciences biologiques, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, C.P. 8888, Succ.

Its habitat, Corsican pine Pinus nigra laricio forest, is currently restricted to less than 16,000 ha and is threatened by forest fires. In this article, we aim (1) to evaluate the effects of a large wildfire on a Nuthatch population, and (2) to identify the habitat features that influence the presence/absence of the Nuthatch after fire, so as to promote appropriate forestry practices after fire. The study has been conducted on a study plot of 300 ha which is part of a larger area severely burnt in August 2003. Habitat characteristics have been investigated on 39 plots of 1,225 m2 occupied by the bird, and 22 randomly chosen plots without the Nuthatch. We observed a decrease of 37.5% in Nuthatch abundance the first spring after the fire, but the impact showed great local variation as a function of fire severity. Logistic modelling showed that the presence of Nuthatch mainly depended on the degree of crown alteration: the Nuthatch tended to be present when at least one pine had less than 2.5 m of crown burned. We have no evidence of any direct fire-induced mortality, but several effects of fire can explain this population decrease, namely, the reduction of canopy volume, the decrease of the amount of pine seeds, and the reduction of nest-site availability. These results permit us to propose a simple criterion that can help in choosing the plots to be cut where salvage logging is necessary.","Moneglia, Pasquale; CNRS CEFE, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France, France.",roger.prodon@cefe.cnrs.fr,,,,,"Forestry; Zoology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0021-8375,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Conservation; Conservation measures; Ecology; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe; France","Sitta whiteheadi [Forestry / Post-fire forest management / ] [Habitat management /  / ] [Distribution within habitat / Spatial distribution patterns / ] [Habitat preference / Habitat selection / ] [Forest and woodland / Corsican pine forest habitat / ] [Fire / Wildfire / ] [Corsica / North west, Tartagine-Melaja / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Sittidae","Sitta whiteheadi (Sittidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14510063085,,,,,2018/06/21

Field observations in the Pelican Cays in March 2007 revealed extensive clear-cutting of mangroves and covering of exposed peat surfaces with sediment dredged from the adjacent seafloor to create false sand cays. On Manatee Cay, introduction of dredge spoils taken from the nearby seabed resulted in fine sediment plumes spilling into the adjacent ponds, smothering the attached benthic communities on mangrove roots and burying Thalassia bottom communities. In addition, comparative studies of microalgal (phytoplankton) assemblages in a Manatee Cay pond before and after mangrove clearing indicate a dramatic loss in this group. This change, related to high turbidity observed in the water column, signals a serious impact to this aquatic ecosystem. In March 2007, clear-cutting, burning, and dredge and fill operations were taking place on Fisherman's Cay, with additional survey lines visible on Fisherman's, Manatee, and Cat Cays. We used a series of aerial photographic surveys from 2003 to 2007 to document the extensive loss of mangroves on both Manatee and Fisherman's Cays. To date, additional clearing of mangroves has occurred on Northeast Gay, Bird Cays, and Ridge Cay, resulting in a total of 15.3 ha or more than 29% of the mangrove community that have been destroyed in the Pelican Cays. Furthermore, several survey lines through still-forested areas on these islands indicated that additional clearing of mangroves was planned. The Pelican Cays ponds contain unique, biologically diverse ecosystems dominated by delicate sessile photosynthetic and filter-feeding populations; these rare communities will be lost as a result of sediment suffocation caused by the clearing and filling of these islands. However, the conversion of mangrove ecosystems for residential, tourism, and commercial uses is both widespread and accelerating in Belize and throughout the global tropics.

The 49.3 ha large study area under agricultural and forestry management (forested area 52.3 %) is situated at an altitude of 400 to 450 m above sea level. There are no nesting boxes within the study area. All the species of Tits Parus native to Germany occur on the study site. Although in the course of 15 years neither significantly positive nor significantly negative trends could be proved for any of the six species inhabiting woodland, fluctuations of the breeding numbers were more or less clearly noticeable. Comparisons, which included the populations of Long-tailed Tit Aegithalos caudatus, Firecrest Regulus ignicapilla, Nuthatch Sitta europea and Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, revealed various similar or even identical fluctuations. The trend curves of Blue Tit P. caeruleus and Great Tit P major are identical. The population trends of Nuthatch, Chaffinch, and probably of Long-tailed Tit (a rare species in the study area) are very similar to those of Blue Tit and Great Tit. The trend curve of the population of Marsh Tit P. palustris deviates more distinctly, and there is only partial congruence between the trends of Great Tit and Coal Tit P. ater (maxi-mums in 1993 and 2005, the latter followed by sharp declines of both species). In recent years, there have been striking similarities between the population trends of Coal Tit and Firecrest, both inhabitants of coniferous forests. Possible causes are discussed. As in different cases the similarities in trend fluctuations concern resident species (Tits and Nuthatch) as well as migratory species (Firecrest and Chaffinch), winter losses should not be considered as the only regulating factors. As to the long-lived and particularly hardy Crested Tit and Willow Tit, whose respective trend curves are similar, this cannot be considered essential anyway. Apart from two sharp declines during the survey, their population fluctuations were all in all much less pronounced. One of these declines, caused by forest management measures, is exemplified in the study.","George, Klaus; Pappelweg 183e, D-06493 Ballenstedt, Germany, Germany.",klaus.george@t-online.de,,,,,"Zoology; Forestry; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0340-403X,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Aegithalos caudatus; Fringilla coelebs; Parus ater; Parus caeruleus; Parus cristatus; Parus major; Parus montanus; Parus palustris; Regulus ignicapilla; Sitta europaea [Forestry / Forestry management measures / ] [Population dynamics / Breeding population dynamics / ] [Forest and woodland / Montane forest / ] [Mountain habitat /  / ] [Germany / Sachsen-Anhalt, Harz, north-east / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Aegithalidae, Fringillidae, Paridae, Sittidae, Sylviidae","Aegithalos caudatus (Aegithalidae).

Every year many parts of the biome change from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and vice-versa. The degree of inundation creates a range of major habitats. Flooding occupies about 80% of the whole Pantanal. In contrast, during the dry season, most of the flooded areas stay dry, when the water returns to the river beds or evaporates. The Pantanal is a large continental savanna wetland (147,574km2 in Brazil), touching Bolivia to the north and Paraguay to the south. The maze of fluctuating water levels, nutrients, and biota forms a dynamic ecosystem. The vegetation comprises 1,863 phanerogam plant species listed for the floodplain and 3,400 for the whole basin and 250 species of aquatic plants. The complex vegetation cover and seasonal productivity support a diverse and abundant fauna within the floodplain: 263 species of fish, 41 of amphibians, 113 of reptiles (177 for the basin), 463 of birds and 132 mammal species. Many endangered species occur, including jaguar (Panthera onca Linnaeus, 1758). Waterfowl are exceptionally abundant during the dry season. Analysis of the root causes of the threats to biodiversity indicated that deforestation (17% of the Pantanal and 63% of the Surrounding uplands) with modification and loss of natural habitats due to cattle ranching, unsustainable agriculture, mining environmental contamination (including mercury, pesticides, urban sewage), non organized tourism, fire, disturbances at the upstream region modifying hydrological flow, erosion, weak implementation and enforcement of legislation are the major issues to face conservation action and Sustainable use. Under an evolutionary focus, local biodiversity seems to be well adapted to seasonal shrinking and expansion Of natural habitats due to flooding. However, the conversion of natural vegetation due to human occupation is a real threat to biodiversity.","Alho, C.J.R.; Univ Para Desenvolvimento Estado and Regiao Pantana, Posgrad Meiol Ambiente and Desenvolvimento Reg, Rua Ceara 333, BR-79003010 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil, Brazil.",alho@unb.br,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology",1519-6984,,"Animals and man; Ecology; Habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Neotropical region","Animalia [Disturbance by man / Environmental degradation / ] [Ecology / Biodiversity / ] [Semiaquatic habitat / Wetlands habitat / ] [Flooding / Seasonal flooding / ] [South America / Pantanal / ].",,Animalia,Animalia.,10.1590/S1519-69842008000500005,ZOOREC:ZOOR14506037628,19197468,gold,,,2018/06/21

Because most species of grassland birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines, especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an alternative grassland management practice known as patch-burning has been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296 dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures. Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides further evidence that this practice can he a useful tool for grassland bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation, patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g., trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects of grazing, which are not available under traditional management. Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains.","Churchwell, Roy T.; Univ Alaska, Dept Biol and Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775, USA, USA.",,"Fuhlendorf, Samuel/A-2931-2011","Fuhlendorf, Samuel/0000-0002-8726-9402",,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Reproductive Biology",0022-541X,,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Reproduction; Parasites diseases and disorders; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Molothrus ater [Habitat management / Patch-burn management / prevalence] [Nest parasitism / Spiza americana (Aves) / ] [Grassland / Tallgrass prairie / ] [Fire /  / ] [Oklahoma / Osage County / ].

The main limiting factor influencing the survival of Lear's Macaws is their dependence on an increasingly scarce food resource, the fruit of the licuri palm (Syagrus coronata). The research outlined in this paper was realized in December 2006 - February 2007 with the objective of identifying feeding areas and to describe area size, altitude, density and natural regeneration of licuri palm, tall tree availability, other food resources, distance from roosting areas, land use and any other threats to this species. We identified 37 distinct feeding areas totalling 4,711.92 hectares, of which 46.6% is in Canudos, 35.18% in Euclides da Cunha, 15.74% in Jeremoabo, 1.77% in Paulo Afonso and 0.7% in Santa Brigida. The largest area is 807.11ha and the smallest 3.26ha. The average altitude recorded was 474 meters and ranged from 315m up to 603m. The distance between roosting and feeding areas ranged from 0.5km up to 60km. The feeding areas had an average density of 94 licuri palms. Only 28% of the areas had natural regeneration of licuri palms, 32% had insufficient regeneration and 40% was experiencing no regeneration. Trees tall enough for the macaws to use as sentinels occurred in sufficient densities in 37.8% of feeding areas, 51.4% had insufficient numbers of tall trees and 10.8% had no tall trees. There was only one area which did not have an alternative food resource to the licuri palm. Umbu was the most common alternative food in the feeding areas. Of the areas surveyed, 94% are used to ranch cattle and goats and 70% are used for agriculture. Many areas are used for both practices with hoof stock given access to agricultural land following crop harvest. Mining operations were also located on 10% of the areas surveyed. The main threats to the long-term survival of Lear's Macaws as identified in this study are habitat decay caused by hoof stock, forest fires, and deforestation caused by unsustainable levels of wood harvesting for fire and mining activities.","dos Santos Neto, Joaquim R.; CEMAVE/ICMBio, Av.

However, their spatial effects have not been evaluated. Our goal was to model the human footprint across the western United States. We first delineated the actual area occupied by anthropogenic features, the physical effect area. Next, we developed the human footprint model based on the ecological effect area, the zone influenced by features beyond their physical presence, by combining seven input models: three models quantified top- down anthropogenic influences of synanthropic predators (avian predators, domestic dog and cat presence risk), and four models quantified bottom-up anthropogenic influences on habitat (invasion of exotic plants, human-caused fires, energy extraction, and anthropogenic wildland fragmentation). Using independent bird population data, we found bird abundance of four synanthropic species to correlate positively with human footprint intensity and negatively for three of the six species influenced by habitat fragmentation. We then evaluated the extent of the human footprint in relation to terrestrial (ecoregions) and aquatic systems (major rivers and lakes), regional management and conservation status, physical environment, and temporal changes in human actions. The physical effect area of anthropogenic features covered 13% of the western United States with agricultural land ( 9.8%) being most dominant. High-intensity human footprint areas (class 8-10) overlapped highly productive low-elevation private landholdings and covered 7% of the western United States compared to 48% for low intensity areas (class 1-3), which were confined to low-productivity high-elevation federal landholdings. Areas within 1 km of rivers were more affected by the human footprint compared to lakes. Percentage human population growth was higher in low-intensity human footprint areas. The disproportional regional effects of the human footprint on landscapes in the western United States create a challenge to management of ecosystems and wildlife populations. Using footprint models, managers can plan land use actions, develop restoration scenarios, and identify areas of high conservation value at local landscapes within a regional context. Moreover, human footprint models serve as a tool to stratify landscapes for studies investigating. oral and faunal response to human disturbance intensity gradients.","Leu, Matthias; US Geol Survey, Forest and Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, 970 Lusk St, Boise, ID 83706, USA, USA.",mleu@usgs.gov,,"Hanser, Steven/0000-0002-4430-2073",,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",1051-0761,,"Animals and man; Ecology; Habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America","Animalia [Disturbance by man / Anthropogenic impacts, large scale analysis / ] [Ecology /  / Anthropogenic impacts; large scale analysis] [Habitat /  / ] [USA / West / ].",,Animalia,Animalia.,10.1890/07-0480.1,ZOOREC:ZOOR14411066614,18686576,,,,2018/06/21

One such chemical is arsenic, which is concentrated to phytotoxic levels in the soils surrounding estivation sites. Vegetation may recover as arsenic is made unavailable by time or by fire. This may be a cyclical process that has occurred many times in the past. Bogong moths are an important food for birds and small mammals, and arsenic has been found in the food chain, although bird deaths and population declines in small mammals cannot be positively ascribed to arsenic. Genetic studies and studies looking at the chemical form of the arsenic have so far been unable to confirm the source of the arsenic; however, interception of moths on their spring migration confirms that the source is away from the mountains.","Green, Ken; Natl Pk and Wildlife Serv, Snowy Mt Reg, PO Box 2228, Jindabyne, NSW 2627, Australia, Australia.",kenneth.green@environment.nsw.gov.au,,,,,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Zoology; Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",1523-0430,,"Biochemistry; Behaviour; Social behaviour; Ecology; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia","Agrotis infusa [Pollutants / Arsenic / Transport by migrants & concentration into soil & food chain in alpine region] [Aggregating behaviour / Aestivation aggregation / Arsenic transport by migrants & concentration into soil & food chain in alpine region] [Migration / Aestivation migration / ] [Impact on habitat /  / ] [Australia / Snowy Mountains / ].

To inform future conservation measures for this poorly known species, we used ecological niche factor analysis, habitat suitability modelling and distance sampling to determir e landscape-scale habitat requirements and estimate the population size. Using GIS software, we integrated digital layers of ecogeographic variables with; (1) presence-only observations to derive and validate a habitat suitability model using ecological niche factor analysis, and (2) distance sampling to determine population distribution and densities across vegetation types. We detected populations in only five of seven reserves which they had occupied in 2000. We estimate the global population size to be 16,821 individuals (range 8431-39, 104), 68% greater than the previously estimated 10,000 individuals, with a single large reserve containing the majority ([approximately]92%) of the global population. The Mallee Ernu-wren is a habitat specialist, primarily occurring in mallee-Triodia vegetation that has not been burnt for at least 15 years. The highest densities were in vegetation associations containing at least a 15% cover of Triodia, however, time since the habitat was last burnt was the overriding factor in determining densities. Large-scale wildfires are a pervasive threat: to the global status of the Mallee Emu-wren, and the risk to remaining populations is exacerbated by the adverse impact of prolonged drought and the potential for altered fire regimes caused by global warming. Evaluation of the global population status, and the continued wildfire threat warranted recent reclassification of the Mallee Emu-wren from Vulnerable to Endangered according to IUCN Red List categories and criteria.

It was demonstrated that spatial distribution, numbers and nesting success of the Eurasian Curlew, (Numenius arquata) on farn-dands are primarily determined by intensity of landuse. Hatching success was increasing in a series of years 1997, 1999, 2005 from 32-97% due to improvement of protective characteristics of habitats on abandoned lands, as well as growth of the density of territorial pairs on considerably reduced area of mown meadows, a preferred nesting habitat. Abandonment of farmlands probably leads to decreased feeding activity of corvids, while density growth of Curlews facilitates effective nest protection by their communal agressive behaviour. Alterations of nesting habitats due to ploughing and growth of shrubs did not result in decrease of the species numbers, but caused changes in spatial distribution of territorial birds within the study plot. Catastrophic events in some years, like widespread grass fires (up to 43,5% of the area of nesting habitats burnt) did not result in changes of Curlew numbers or distribution, but markedly reduced total nesting success like in 2006 (49%, compared to 97% in 2005). This occures due to both decreased hatching success in nests affected by fire and low hatching success in replacement Clutches on burnt meadows (31,25%, n = 5) compared to clutches on unimpaired meadows (80516, n = 5).

From 1989-2002, I studied the nest-site selection and reproductive success of Warbling Vireos across an elevational gradient in the southern Sierra Nevada. Warbling Vireos regularly nested in upland coniferous forests with few or no deciduous trees, and tree species used by nesting vireos included five species of conifers and four species of deciduous trees. Overall, hardwoods were used more than expected based on their availability, but 69% of all nests were in conifers. Hardwood trees were found only in low and mid-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed-conifer sites. In low-elevation ponderosa pine habitat, 87% of nests were in hardwoods, with 67% in California black oaks (Quercus kelloggii), a species that typically occupies upland sites. In mixed-conifer sites where reproductive success was high, 65% of nests were in incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) and California black oak was the next most commonly used species. Because fire suppression has likely increased numbers of shade-tolerant tree species like incense cedar, shade-intolerant species like black oaks may have been more important as a nest substrate for vireos in the past. Only conifers were used as nesting substrates at higher elevations. Nest success was greater for Warbling Vireos that nested in tall trees in areas with high basal area. My results suggest that Warbling Vireos in the Sierra Nevada would benefit from management activities that encourage retention and recruitment of California black oaks at lower elevations, and development of stands with large trees, dense foliage, and semi-open canopy throughout their elevation range.","Purcell, Kathryn L.; USDA, Forest Serv, 2081 E Sierra Ave, Fresno, CA 93710, USA, USA.",kpurcell@fs.fed.us,"Purcell, Kathryn/S-2592-2016",,,,"Zoology; Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry",0273-8570,,"Reproduction; Reproductive behaviour; Ecology; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Vireo gilvus [Breeding site / Nest site selection / Forest habitat] [Reproductive productivity / Breeding success / ] [Habitat preference /  / forest] [Forest and woodland /  / Nest site selection & breeding success] [California / Sierra Nevada, Sierra National Forest / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Vireonidae","Vireo gilvus (Vireonidae).",10.1111/j.1557-9263.2007.00107.x,ZOOREC:ZOOR14403012790,,,,,2018/06/21

Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus) declined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions, and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open habitat while retaining many forest and generalist species, but may have short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.","Greenberg, Cathryn H.; USDA, Forest Serv, Asheville, NC 28806, USA, USA.",kgreenberg@fs.fed.us,,,,,"Zoology; Forestry; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0022-541X,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Aves [Forestry / Fire & fuel reduction treatment / Effect on community structure] [Community structure /  / Fire & fuel reduction treatment effects; forest] [Forest and woodland / Hardwood forest / ] [North Carolina / Polk County, Green River Gameland / Fire & fuel reduction treatment effects on community structure].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",10.2193/2006-070,ZOOREC:ZOOR14311072009,,,,,2018/06/21

While PBDEs play a key role in reducing loss of human life and property from fires, these flame retardants have become pervasive organic contaminants in the environment and in the tissues of fish, birds, marine mammals, and humans. Levels of PBDEs in wildlife and humans continue to rise, raising concerns about potential ecological and health risks associated with exposure to these chemicals. Nevertheless, there is little currently known about the toxicological effects of PBDE exposure. Here, we examined the developmental toxicity of the PBDE congener 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE 47) using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an ontogenetic model. Zebrafish embryos were exposed continuously to dissolved phase PBDE 47 (100-5000 [mu]g/l) beginning 3-5 h post-fertilization (hpf). Fish treated with the highest concentrations of PBDE 47 delayed hatching, had reduced growth post-hatching, and displayed an abnormal dorsal curvature of the body with flexion at the hindbrain. By 96 h post-fertilization larvae exposed to PBDE 47 had significant tachycardia, which progressed into atrioventricular block arrhythmias. Microinjection of fluorescent dye into the hindbrain ventricle revealed that cerebrospinal fluid in the neural tube and brain ventricles flowed more slowly in fish larvae exposed to PBDE 47, a likely etiology for the dorsal curvature. Similar, though much less pronounced, developmental toxicity also occurred in larvae exposed to PBDE 47 only for a 20 h period during early embryogenesis (3-23 hpf), suggesting that PBDEs incorporated in lipid of the egg are bioavailable and cause toxicity later in life. Taken together, this work indicates that exposure to PBDE 47 can cause morphological abnormalities, impair cardiovascular function and cerebrospinal fluid flow, and provides a tractable starting point for using the zebrafish model to explore molecular mechanisms of PBDE toxicity.

We use an unplanned fire, which burned half of a long-term study plot, as a natural experiment to test the effects of fire on the federally endangered Cape Sable seaside sparrow in Everglades National Park. By implementing a before-after-controlimpact study design we determine the mechanistic link between fire and demography of this endangered sparrow. Our results show that while the sparrow tolerates fire, neither sparrow density nor nesting success are enhanced by fire, which runs contrary to the current paradigm in which sparrows are expected to benefit and therefore require fire for persistence. Our results caution against the assumption that occupancy of disturbance-prone habitat automatically suggests dependence on disturbance. Land managers must prevent large and frequent fires from burning occupied sparrow habitat to best manage for the species. Moreover, it is imperative that more studies focus on the effects of disturbance processes on rare and endangered species in order to prevent further loss of biodiversity. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, human activities that closely mimic the appearance but not the fundamental quality of natural habitats could attract animals to settle whether or not these habitats are suitable for their survival or reproduction. We examined habitat selection behavior and nest success of Olive-sided Flycatchers (Contopus cooperi) in a naturally occurring burned forest and an anthropogenically created habitat type-selectively harvested forest. Olive-sided Flycatcher density and nestling provisioning rates were greater in the selectively harvested landscape, whereas estimated nest success in selectively harvested forest was roughly half that found in naturally burned forest. Reduced nest success was probably a result of the relatively high abundance of nest predators found in the artificially disturbed forest. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that selectively harvested forest call act as an ""ecological trap"" by attracting Olive-sided Flycatchers to a relatively poor-quality habitat type. This highlights the importance of considering animal behavior in biodiversity conservation.","Robertson, Bruce A.; Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812, USA, USA.",bruce.robertson@mso.umt.edu,,,,,"Zoology; Forestry; Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0010-5422,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Reproduction; Ecology; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Contopus cooperi [Forestry / Selective harvesting / Habitat preference & nesting success effects; forests] [Reproductive productivity / Nesting success / Fire & selective harvesting effects] [Habitat preference /  / ] [Forest and woodland / Burned & selectively harvested forests / ] [Fire /  / ] [Montana / Flathead National Forest area / Habitat preference & nesting success].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Tyrannidae","Contopus cooperi (Tyrannidae).",10.1650/0010-5422(2007)109[109:ISHFAE]2.0.CO;2,ZOOREC:ZOOR14308049241,,,,,2018/06/21

In recent years the limestone region called Kras was forested with Austrian Pine Pinus nigra and became more and more overgrown by bushes and trees due to depopulation and land abandonment, which has made it more vulnerable to fire. The latter patterns in particular are occurring throughout the whole sub-Mediterranean area and are affecting bird diversity drastically. Bird mortality during fires is low. For the first few years after a fire the richness and abundance of bird species decrease, and the species composition turnover rate is very high, from open habitat species to scrubland species. However, birds will colonise the burned area only when there is a neighbouring source population. In addition, larger burned areas are colonised more quickly than smaller ones. It is assumed that many birds will emigrate, while a number of species will adapt their territory size, nesting and foraging behaviour to the changed habitat. The severity of the habitat alteration and the change in food availability affect bird population dynamics. Bird species composition changes in parallel with vegetation succession. The effects of different aspects of fire, such as the size of the burned area, fire intensity, fire frequency and burning season, are reviewed. There are still many gaps in our knowledge of bird responses to fire, such as bird emigration after fires. However the impact of fire on birds is apparently not always detrimental and can even have a positive effect on populations. We therefore emphasize the importance of the continuation of research into the possibilities of fire as a management tool.","de Groot, Maarten; Redelongijeva 26a, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia, Slovenia.",m.degroot@rocketmail.com,,,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Reproductive Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Behavioral Sciences",0351-2851,,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Nutrition; Feeding behaviour; Reproduction; Evolution; Behaviour; Ecology; Habitat utilization; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Aves [Habitat management / Burnt areas / Community structural changes & successions significance] [Foraging /  / Adaptation in relation to woodland fires; conservational significance] [Reproduction / Breeding strategy / ] [Evolutionary adaptation /  / Territorial; nesting & foraging behaviour; effect of woodland fires] [Territoriality / Territory size / ] [Community structure /  / Changes; habitat succession & colonization relationships; conservational aspects] [Population dynamics /  / potential use in conservation] [Habitat colonization /  / Community structure relationships; potential conservation use] [Succession in habitats /  / ] [Fire /  / Community structural changes & successions relationships; potential conservational significance] [Slovenia / Kras / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14403017346,,,,,2018/06/21

Surveying comprised of pitfall traps, small mammal traps, MacKinnon's list avifaunal surveying, mist net and hand net capture of bats, herpetological searches, nocturnal searches, casual observations and socio-economic surveys. The mammals observed include eight species of bat (two megachiroptera), one carnivore (Galidea elegans dambrensis), seven small mammals, bush pig, Potamochoerus larvatus, and four species of lemur. Of the seven small mammals identified, three are introduced species, and two are unidentified (Microgale sp. and Eliurus sp.). Only two individuals of Eliurus sp. were captured and it is possible that this species is an undescribed species. Further capture of this species is necessary for identification. All four lemur species observed during the study (Daubentonia madagascariensis, Eulemur coronatus, Lepilemur septentrionalis, and Microcebus tavatra) are endemic to Madagascar and three are listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Socio-economic interviews revealed the possibility of another species of lemur existing in the massif (Hapalemur griseus occidentalis). Interviews also revealed the possibility of the fanaloka (Fossa fossana), fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox), and small Indian civet (Viverricula indica) existing in the massif. These are all cryptic nocturnal species which could explain the lack of observation. Further surveying focusing on these species is required to confirm their exis tence in Montagne des Francais. A total of 63 species of bird were observed in Montagne des Francais, with an additional 10 species occurring in the mangrove forest at the mouth of the River Betahitra. Of the species observed within the massif 38% are endemic to Madagascar, the Madagascar Crested ibis (Lophotibis cristata) is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, and three species are listed on CITES Appendix I. Species of low abundance and found mainly in semi-disturbed forest are under great pressure from habitat loss. This includes Madagascar lesser cuckoo (Cuculus rochii), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Madagascar starling (Hartlaubius auratus), Madagascar pygmy kingfisher (Ispidina madagascariensis), Madagascar crested ibis (Lophotibis cristata), western scops owl (Otus madagascariensis), and hook-billed vanga (Vanga curvirostris). Of the nine amphibians and 52 reptiles observed in Montagne des Francais, 96.7% are endemic to Madagascar, with only Ptychadena mascareniensis and Leioheterodon madagascariensis occurring on other Indian Ocean Islands. In addition, eight species are likely to be endemic to Montagne des Francais; Amphiglossus sp. nov., Brookesia sp. nov., Heteroliodon fohy, Liophidium sp., Liopholidophis martae, Madagascarophis sp. nov., Paroedura cf. homalorhina, and Paroeduralohatsara. Species listed on the IUCN Red List include: Acrantophis madagascariensis and Sanzinia madagascariensis volontany which are listed as Vulnerable, and Mantella Viridis which is listed as Critically Endangered. Socio-economic interviews confirm that the main anthropogenic pressures on the massif are charcoal burning and agriculture practices. These activities are causing vast loss of the native forests which inevitably has a drastic effect on the diverse flora and fauna. Given the high levels of endemic fauna and the current rate of habitat loss through anthropogenic activities, there is a great need for rapid protection of the flora and fauna of Montagne des FranYais. This will require effective management and monitoring of habitat loss, anthropogenic activities, number of residents within the massif, and the status and extent of the flora and fauna.",,,,,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology",1479-120X,,"Conservation; Land zones; Afrotropical region; Africa","Vertebrata [Conservation measures /  / Conservation evaluation based on biodiversity survey results] [Endangered status /  / ] [Madagascar / Montagne des Francais / Biodiversity surveys & conservation evaluation].","Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata","Vertebrata (Chordata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14406037038,,,,,2018/06/21

Vegetation (floristic data and 22 habitat variables) and vertebrate fauna (birds. mammals, reptiles) were sampled in 29 standardized 50 x 50-m quadrats in the 2001 wet season. representing Four treatments: sites burnt recently (within 2 y) and grazed by cattle (4-8 ha per livestock unit): sites unburnt (last burnt >2 y ago) and grazed: sites burnt recently and ungrazed: and unburn and ungrazed sites. Fire and grazing had a significant influence on vegetation: both grazing and fire reduced ground cover (fire in grazed sites 51-23%, tire in ungrazed sites 68-39%)) and increased the cover of forbs (8%, in burnt and grazed sites, 3%, if ungrazed) and tussock grasses (20%) in grazed and unburnt sites and 5%) when ungrazed). Grazing caused a shift in floristic composition from the perennial hummock grass Trioda pungens to tussock grasses (e.g. Aristida spp.. Enneapogon spp.), forbs (e.g. Phyllanthus spp.) and shrubs (e.g. Acacia spp.). Of the vertebrate groups, birds responded more to fire effects (9 species), reptiles to grazing effects (6 species) and mammals to the interaction (2 species). Species reacted to increases in bare ground (e.g. crested pigeon Ocyphaps lophotes, hooded robin Melanodryas cucullatus. Ctenophorus nuchalis) and to the dominant ground cover (e.g. Ctenotus pantherinus) or change in vegetation architecture (e.g. singing honeyeater Lichenostomus virescens, variegated fairy-wren Malurus lamberti). The clearest example of an interacting effect was the cycle of complementary dominance between the rodents Pseudomys delicatulus and P. desertor, the latter's post-fire recovery becoming more muted in sites where cattle grazed (modelled time for population recovery twice as long as in ungrazed sites).","Kutt, Alex.

Historically stoat research and management has focused on beech forests and little is known about the ecology of stoats in the alpine grasslands occurring above the natural altitudinal limit of beech forest. Several stoat control operations in beech forest valley floors in southern New Zealand assume that adjacent montane areas act as a barrier to stoat immigration. Stoats were live-trapped and radio-tracked in alpine grasslands above the Borland Burn, Fiordland National Park, during the summer and autumn of 2003 and 2004. Seventeen stoats were radio-collared and home ranges were estimated for 11 of them. These home ranges were used in a compositional analysis which showed that these stoats spent significantly more time in alpine grassland than in adjacent beech forest. Range cores calculated for six of these stoats were located high up in alpine grassland and contained very little beech forest. This means that montane areas that contain alpine grasslands are unlikely to be barriers to stoat immigration; rather they may be a source of dispersing stoats that reinvade control areas. Also, endemic animal species that inhabit alpine grasslands could be at risk from stoat predation.","Wilson, Deborah J.; Landcare Research, Private Bag 1930, Dunedin, New Zealand, New Zealand.",wilsond@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Wilson, Deborah/B-8651-2008",,,,"Zoology; Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry",0110-6465,,"Behaviour; Ecology; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia","Mustela erminea [Home range /  / ] [Distribution within habitat /  / ] [Habitat preference / Habitat selection / ] [Forest and woodland / Beech forest / ] [Grassland / Alpine grasslands / ] [Mountain habitat /  / ] [New Zealand / Fiordland National Park, Borland Burn / ].","Carnivores; Chordates; Mammals; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Mammalia, Carnivora, Mustelidae","Mustela erminea (Mustelidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14409054004,,,,,2018/06/21
J,ZOOR14402010912,Article,"A rapid biodiversity assessment of the Kaijende Highlands, Enga Province, Papua New Guinea.",,,,,"Richards, Stephen J.","RAP Bulletin of Biological Assessment",45,,,1-96,2007,2007,,,"Chapters indexed separately.",English,0,21,"Papua New Guinea (PNG) is an independent state occupying the eastern half of New Guinea, the world's largest and highest tropical island. In recognition of its extensive remaining forest cover, spectacular biological diversity and low human population density, New Guinea has been recognised as one of the world's five High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas (Mittermeier et al. 2003). In addition to extensive low- and mid-elevation tropical forests, New Guinea has extensive high-montane environments, particularly along the central mountainous spine of the island. This central cordillera, formed by uplift resulting from the collision of the Australian Plate with the Pacific Plate, presents dramatic gradients of topography, elevation, temperature and rainfall that have promoted rapid evolution of an exceptionally diverse biota. Although the montane birds and flora of New Guinea have been moderately well documented (e.g. Royen 1982, Beehler et al. 1986), documentation of most biota at high elevations has been sporadic at best and major gaps in survey effort continue to hinder meaningful discussions about conservation priorities for, and biogeographic relationships among, the New Guinean biota. With an area of 12,800 km2 Enga Province in Papua New Guinea's central highlands region includes a higher proportion of upper montane (>3,000 m) environments than any other province in Papua New Guinea (Loeffler 1977). It is also the site of the Porgera Mine, a major openpit gold mining operation that accounts for 14% of the country's export earnings, making it the world's eighth largest gold producer in terms of 2005 output. Remarkably, despite the substantial infrastructure established by this mining operation, Enga Province appears to have the lowest biological survey effort of any province in the country. Prior to this RAP survey only a handful of collections had been made in the province. The proximity of Porgera Mine to the vast Kaijende Highlands provided the opportunity to redress this paucity of biological information through a RAP biodiversity survey designed and conducted by Conservation International and the PNG Department of Environment and Conservation, and sponsored by the Porgera Joint Venture mining operation. Scope of Project The RAP biodiversity survey reported here was undertaken as part of a long-term commitment by Conservation International (CI) to assist with the establishment of a Conservation Area covering the Kaijende Highlands of Enga Province. Discussions between CI, the PNG Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) and the Porgera Joint Venture partners (PJV) resulted in a consensus that CI would play a lead role in developing the project. To this end CI has established an office at Porgera with funding support from PJV. Locally-based CI staff are working with local landowners and local NGOs to establish the area (see Map) as a Conservation Area under the Conservation Area Act with assistance from the DEC. The Mt. Kaijende Conservation Area will have a management plan and a development plan, rules, a management committee, and the steps towards establishment will allow for participation by the general public and by landowners. Follow-up awareness activities during 2007 have generated substantial support from local landowners, the PNG Mining Department and other stakeholders. The RAP results reported here are the result of a successful partnership between CI, DEC, PJV and a number of local communities. We hope that the information gathered during this survey will play a useful role in informing the development of sustainable management strategies for this spectacular region. RAP SURVEY OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES Conservation International's Rapid Assessment Program(RAP) is an innovative biological inventory program designed to use scientific information to catalyze conservation action. RAP methods are designed to rapidly assess the biodiversity of highly diverse areas and to train local scientists in biodiversity survey techniques. Since 1990, RAP's teams of expert and host-country scientists have conducted 60 terrestrial, freshwater aquatic (AquaRAP), and marine biodiversity surveys and have contributed to building local scientific capacity for scientists in 26 countries. Biological information from previous RAP surveys has resulted in the protection of millions of hectares of tropical forest, including the declaration of protected areas in Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil and the identification of biodiversity priorities in numerous countries. The primary objective of this RAP survey was to document the plant, herpetofauna, bird and mammal diversity of the Kaijende Highlands, a vast region of near-uninhabited montane forest and grasslands in Enga Province. The information we gathered will be used to make recommendations about the conservation significance of, and management options for, the remarkable biodiversity of this area. Survey sites were selected to include the major habitat types contained within the proposed Mt. Kaijende Conservation Area. The specific aims of this RAP survey were to: * Produce an overview of the diversity and conservation significance of selected plant and animal taxa at elevations between 2,000 and 3,300 m. * Evaluate threats to biodiversity of the region, and recommend management strategies for their mitigation that are relevant to local communities, government agencies, and the nearby Porgera Mine. * Provide on-site training in biodiversity inventory techniques for staff from DEC.* Make RAP data available for decision-makers at all levels of Government, and to local communities, NGOs and the general public, with a view to promoting the establishment of a Conservation Area in the Mt. Kaijende Highlands. Study Area The Kaijende Highlands incorporate an extensive area of montane habitats (>2,000 m elevation) adjacent to the Porgera Mine in Enga Province, Papua New Guinea (see Map). Population density in the proposed Conservation Area is extremely low, but trails linking small villages and others used by hunters criss-cross the area. A well-travelled trailthrough the high-montane grasslands of the Kaijende Highlands links Porgera Town with the Mt. Kare goldfields. As in most areas of Melanesia, land ownership in this region is complex and numerous clans lay claim to parts of the Kaijende Highlands. The area behind Mt. Kumbepara, from Omyaka to the Porgera Reservoir, is owned by the Pulumaini, Angalaini, Tieni and Aipakani clans. The Omyaka camp site was on Pulumaini land. The LakeTawa area belongs to people from Kole and Kanzawi villages (Paiela) who also own the Mt. Kare area. The Paiela Road area is owned by the Pulumaini, Angalaini, Tieni and Tuanda clans. Land around Suyan is owned by the Aipakani-Kealo/ Pepe (Suyan Camp), and the Timain and Paiam clans (areas behind Suyan). Site descriptions The climate of the Kaijende Highlands area, extrapolated from rainfall and temperature data collected at the PJV Environment Department offices on the Porgera Mine site at around 2,200 m, is relatively aseasonal. Mean monthly minimum air temperature recorded daily between 2001 and 2004 varied between just 11.3 and 13.0[degree]C and mean monthly maximum temperature varied between 18.8 and21.0[degree]C (Figure 1). Precipitation is high, with a long-term (1974 - 2006) mean annual rainfall of 3,679.6 mm (range 2,505.8 - 4,413.0 mm) but rainfall shows a more pronounced seasonal effect than temperature (Figure 2). The mean monthly rainfall calculated for each month over 33years was 306.6 mm when calculated across all months, but there are distinctly wetter and drier 'seasons' with a maximum mean monthly rainfall of 370 mm in March and a minimum of 246.6 mm in July. Figure 2 shows long-term (1974 - 2006) mean monthly rainfall and the 2005 total rainfall for Porgera Mine to illustrate the period leading up to and including this RAP survey. The RAP survey was conducted during a year when rainfall in September was much higher than the long-term mean. However maximum and minimum monthly rainfall totals at Porgera over the same period do not follow the trend shown by the monthly means illustrated in Figure 2; they show that most months can be extremely wet (> 450 mm) or extremely dry (<150 mm) in any given year. Although the Porgera climate data probably broadly reflect conditions at the lower elevations throughout the KaijendeHighlands, including Lake Tawa, it should be noted that climate in the area varies dramatically with topography and altitude. The highest elevations of the Kaijende Highlands experience climatic conditions that are much more extreme than those reported for Porgera, and air temperatures recorded in the upper-montane grasslands around Omyaka and Waile Creek during this survey regularly dropped to 5[degree]C. Unfortunately, comprehensive rainfall and temperature data for these high-montane sites are unavailable. The survey was conducted around four major 'sites' at elevations between 2,000 m and 3,400 m. These localities provided access to a range of habitats including montane grasslands, upper montane forests, mid-montane forest, and disturbed mid-montane forest regrowth and gardens. Geologically, this highland area is on the New Guinea Fold Belt (Hill and Hall 2003), and lies to the south of the complex system of geological terranes that have accreted to northern New Guinea (Pigram and Davies 1987). The survey schedule and location of major sites are presented in Table 1. The major vegetation formations of the study area are described in detail in Chapter 1 and a gazetteer for, and brief descriptions of vegetation at, each major site and each 'sub-site' are presented in Appendix 1. The general topography of Lake Tawa, and the location of significant collection sites and habitats around this valley are illustrated in Figure 3. SUMMARY Of RAP RESUlTS By TAXONOMIC GROUP vegetation The flora of the Kaijende Highlands occurs in three principal vegetation formations: 1) lower montane forest, 2) upper montane forest, and 3) subalpine grassland. A total of 492 tracheophytic plant species were documented during this survey including 112 ferns and lycophytes, 6 gymnosperms, 69 monocots, and 305 dicots from a total of 262 genera. At least 16 plants are determined as species new to science,including five arborescent taxa, five understory shrubs, two vines, two orchids, and two ferns. Herpetofauna Seventeen frog and two reptile species were documented from montane forests and montane grassland habitats in the Kaijende Highlands. At least eight of the frog species are undescribed and one of these probably warrants recognition as a new genus. This survey documented the second known population of Callulops glandulosus, and a very large species of Albericus found at Lake Tawa may represent only the second known population of A. fafniri. Both of these species were considered Data Deficient by the Global Amphibian Assessment. One other frog, Litoria becki, found only in high-montane grassland habitats, was considered Vulnerable in the recent Global Amphibian Assessment. Although the reptile fauna was depauperate, this reflects the high-elevationfocus of our survey and the low diversity is probably typical of sites at similar elevations elsewhere in New Guinea. One of the two species documented, a skink of the genus Sphenomorphus, may represent an undescribed taxon. Birds Nineteen days of surveys, including a series of 'walkingcensuses' undertaken at key sites, detected 102 species of birds. The Long-bearded Melidectes (Melidectes princeps) was recorded for the first time west of the Mount Hagen massif. The Ribbon-tailed Astrapia (Astrapia mayeri), a spectacular long-tailed species with a severely circumscribed distribution centered on our study area, was common from 2,117 m at Lake Tawa to 3,200 m at Omyaka Camp. Although the Crested Bird of Paradise (Cnemophilus macgregorii) was not encountered on this survey, one local informant at Omyaka Camp stated that it was present and the species was apparently collected in a DEC field survey (Kula 1989). It appears that there is a substantial geographic break in this species' range between the Hagen/Giluwe area and the Star Mountains of Papua (Indonesia). This provides an intermediate-stage example of Diamond's ""drop-out"" phenomenon(Diamond 1972). The Kaijende Highlands support a rich upland bird fauna that might best be conserved through the creation of a large contiguous community-managed reserve that encompasses uninhabited traditional hunting lands. Mammals This survey confirmed the occurrence of one monotreme, 18 marsupials, nine rodents, two bats, and two non-native placental mammals (wild-living dogs and pigs) in the Kaijende Highlands. Previous surveys in this area had recorded just one marsupial species, three rodent species, and one bat species that were not detected in the current survey. Our survey brings the total number of native marsupials, rodents, and bats recorded in the Kaijende Highlands to 35 and in Enga Province to 39. Significant new records for the Kaijende Highlands include the third vouchered locality for Calaby's Pademelon (Thylogale calabyi) and the first record of the Giluwe Rat (Rattus giluwensis) outside of the immediate vicinity of Mt. Giluwe in Southern Highlands Province. CONSERvATiON RECOMMENDATIONS Protection of important habitats The Cyathea savanna that dominates the Kaijende upper montane zone at elevations between 3,000 m and at least 3,400 m is unique to the island of New Guinea. These upper montane habitats and vegetation formations are not protected by existing conservation initiatives in Papua New Guinea. Because island endemism is higher in Upper Montane Forest and subalpine environments than in the low elevation habitats typically covered by many conservation areas in Papua New Guinea, protection of the Kaijende Highlands will provide security for a number of endemic taxa presently excluded from conservation consideration. This survey has identified a suite of plants, frogs and mammals that appear to be dependent on these subalpine environments. The highaltitude tree fern savanna, tussock grassland, and adjacent upper montane (elfin) forests also support a poorly known assemblage of mammal species that have become rare or disappeared from many other montane sites in New Guinea. Another habitat that may require specific targeting for conservation action is limestone outcrops. Three new plantspecies were associated with karst formations during the 2005 RAP survey and additional surveys are required to determine whether these localized habitats harbor a substantial endemic plant or animal biota. The Kaijende Highlands not only harbor a large number of poorly known and significant species and habitats, but the landscapes of the region are scenic and visually stunning. The aesthetic beauty of the Kaijende Highlands provides afurther compelling argument for protection of these montane habitats. The Cyathea grassland panoramas at Omyaka and Waile Creek and the lakeside vistas at Lake Tawa are among the most spectacular ever encountered by the RAP team, and the dramatic limestone pinnacles emerging fromdense mid-montane forest near Porgera are breathtaking. Our results strongly vindicate the current efforts to establisha Wildlife Conservation Area in the Kaijende Highlands. Conservation International, the PNG Department of Environment and Conservation and PJV are working with local communities to develop a sustainable, long-term conservation plan for the proposed Conservation Area. We hope that the results of our survey will be used to promote interest in the Kaijende Highlands among local communities, and among decision makers in Local, Provincial and National Governments. Particular attention should be placed on educating local landowners about the significance of their unique biota on a global scale, about the importance of adopting sustainable hunting practices to ensure the longterm survival of many bird and larger mammal species that are becoming scarce in the mountains of New Guinea, and about the benefits of protecting their montane forests and about the benefits of protecting their montane forests and grasslands from increasingly frequent fires and other destructive human activities. With the interest and support of the local communities, the Kaijende Highlands could become a model protected area in Papua New Guinea. Species-specific recommendations Studies are needed to assess in greater detail the distribution, abundance, and threats faced by wallabies, tree-kangaroos, and echidnas in the Kaijende Highlands. These large mammals have disappeared from most areas with high human population density throughout New Guinea. Although Zaglossus and at least three different kangaroo species (Dendrolagus dorianus, Dorcopsulus vanheurni, and Thylogale calabyi) still persist in the vicinity of Porgera, the 2005 RAPteam did not encounter living animals of these species. They were documented solely based on information from informants or from trophy jaws. Clearly there is at least some hunting pressure on these animals. Obtaining information about abundance, hunting pressure, and microdistributionof large mammals in the region is a high priority if these species are to be conserved in the long term. These studies will require the assistance and knowledge of local communities, and might prove to be a straightforward and manageable project, perhaps one that can be undertaken by a sponsoredstudent or a PJV Environmental Officer. Future Research The cost and logistical challenges of working in New Guinea's remote high-montane environments are a major impediment to research. As a result, most upper montane habitats on the island remain very poorly documented. The success of our Kaijende survey was due in large part to the logistical support provided by the Porgera mine, and also to the infrastructure, including roads, that has been established in the surrounding district. Few areas in Papua New Guinea offer such advantages for an ongoing program of conservationassessments and biological studies. Long-term monitoring programs The upper montane habitats of the Kaijende Highlands provide an opportunity to monitor long-term floristic change caused by global warming. Upper Montane Forest is acutely responsive to temperature shifts induced by climatic change, as demonstrated by palynological evidence from Holocene sediments. Baseline studies should be established that not only document subsequent shifts in upper montane forest composition and distribution, but also examine concurrent changes in abundance and assemblage structure of animal taxa associated exclusively or primarily with these habitats. Fauna identified as high priorities for monitoring programs include a new genus and species of frog known only from grasslands at Omyaka, and a number of large mammal species that may already be under threat from over-hunting.Biodiversity surveys The results of the short Kaijende Highlands RAP survey were spectacular and it is clear that additional biodiversity surveys targeting habitats and elevations not covered during the 2005 RAP survey will document numerous additional species in the proposed Mt. Kaijende Conservation Area. Additional surveys will also be critical for assessing the distribution and conservation status of a number of threatened or significant species encountered or otherwise documented during the 2005 RAP survey (e.g. Thylogale calabyi, Zaglossus bartoni and Dendrolagus dorianus, three new species of microhylid frogs, several new plant species). Inasmuch as the flora and vertebrate fauna of the Upper Montane Forests are highly significant from a conservation perspective but relatively depauperate in terms of species richness, a series of targeted surveys could provide themost comprehensive biodiversity assessment of Upper Montane Forest and grasslands for any area in New Guinea to date. All participants in the Kaijende RAP survey noted that extending biodiversity survey activities to areas below 2,000 m elevation would dramatically increase the variety of biota documented. With support from PJV a trans-watershed biodiversity survey transect extending from the Kaijende Highlands to the lowlands along the Strickland River would be an ambitious project that would put the Kaijende Highlands fauna and flora in a broad biological and biogeographiccontext. In addition, with community support any future extension of the boundaries of the Conservation Area to accommodate contiguous habitats below 2,000 m elevation would substantially increase the biodiversity values of the Conservation Area. Ecotourism potential Tourism is a small but potentially lucrative business for Papua New Guinea. Few areas in the country can boast the combination of spectacular scenery and established infrastructure of the Kaijende Highlands region. Properly marketed, the Kaijende Highlands could attract visitors from elsewhere in PNG andfrom overseas. Formal designation of the Kaijende Highlands as a Conservation Area will increase the area's attractiveness as a travel destination. However it should be recognized that the tourism market is small. Studies to assess the potential of specialised eco-tours, or the promotion of research-based 'tourism' should be conducted as a matter of priority.","Richards, Stephen J.; South Australian Museum, North Terrace, Adelaide, South Australia 5000, Australia.",Richards.Steve@saugov.sa.gov.au,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Forestry",,,"Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia","Animalia [Ecology / Rapid biodiversity assessment / Grassland & forest] [Forest and woodland /  / Rapid biodiversity assessment & conservation recommndations] [Grassland /  / ] [Papua New Guinea / Enga Province, Kaijende Highlands / ].",,Animalia,Animalia.,,ZOOREC:ZOOR14402010912,,,,,2018/06/21

J,ZOOR14509058614,Article,"The indirect effects of increased nutrient inputs on birds in the UK: a review.",,"MacDonald, M.A.",,,,"RSPB Research Report",21,,,"i-xv, 1-204",2006/10/01,2006,,,,English,0,30,"1. The past fifty years have seen declines in a range of bird species, notably those of farmland habitats, in the United Kingdom. 2. These declines have occurred alongside changes in human activities that have increased anthropogenic inputs of nutrients to the environment. 3. The most important anthropogenic sources of nitrogen and phosphorus are agriculture, sewage and domestic waste, while combustion of fossil fuels by industry and transport is a major source of reactive atmospheric nitrogen. 4. Around 60% of human nitrogen production, and about 80% of phosphate use are associated with fertiliser production for agriculture. 5. Both nitrogen and phosphorus are essential nutrients for plant growth and strongly influence the productivity of habitats. The use of inorganic fertilisers has allowed massive increases in agricultural production. 6. While all three major sources of nutrient pollution (fertiliser, fossil fuel combustion and sewage effluent) have declined over the past two decades, they still vastly increase the pool of available nutrients. 7. There is strong evidence that increased anthropogenic inputs of nutrients has altered the vegetation of the United Kingdom over the past century, with species typical of high-nutrient situations favoured. Farmland Vegetation 1. Increased fertiliser use generally reduces plant species richness in farm fields. Management practices associated with or driven by increased fertiliser use, notably silage production and intensive grazing, also reduce plant species richness. 2. Fertiliser application affects sward structure by promoting faster and earlier spring growth, leading to taller, denser swards. In grassland, both cutting for silage and intensive grazing lead to short (although still dense) and heterogeneous swards. 3. Silage production probably has the most radical effects on vegetation of any form of farmland management, and silage production has replaced hay production over much of the UK. Early and frequent cutting affects sward structure, and reduce the amount of seed set by grass swards. 4. The use of inorganic fertilisers has led to changes in landscape configuration by releasing farmers from the need to graze stock for manure production and/or to rotate leguminous crops. There has been a loss of mixed farming landscapes and a polarisation of agriculture in the United Kingdom towards arable farming in the south and east, and pastoral farming in the north and west. Invertebrates 5. Invertebrates, notably earthworms, may be killed by heavy applications of organic and inorganic fertiliser, due to toxic ammonia concentrations, salinity and desiccation. The effects are not usually long-term. 6. Invertebrate species richness is frequently positively related to plant species richness, due to increased opportunities for specialist species. However, the relationship does not always hold, nor is invertebrate abundance necessarily positively related to plant species richness. 7. Plant-eating invertebrates may be favoured by the increased nutritive content of fertilised crops, although there may be shifts in community composition. They are also favoured by the increased shoot growth resulting from fertiliser application. 8. The reduced root:shoot ratio resulting from increased foliar growth can be detrimental to soil invertebrates, although invertebrates feeding on roots may benefit from increased nutritive content. 9. Invertebrates that require specific sward structure, even those that eat plants, will be affected by the changes to sward structure arising from fertiliser application and associated management practices. Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets) are an example of this, as their habitat requirements are poorly met in intensively managed improved grassland. 10. Invertebrates may be affected by disturbance arising from grazing and cutting. Large insects are disproportionately affected, as their longer life cycles and relatively low recolonisation ability mean that they are more likely to disappear from intensively managed farmland. 11. Intensive grazing, and earlier and more frequent cutting associated with silage production directly remove invertebrates, and also remove much of the primary productivity. 12. Changes to sward structure probably have the greatest effects on invertebrate abundance, and these effects are most clearly observed in grassland under intensive grazing and/or cutting regimes. Birds 13. Birds may be affected by fertiliser use via several mechanisms. The strongest effects are seen in pastoral landscapes, because fertiliser use has been the main driver of habitat changes in grassland, while the shift to autumn-sown cereals is a more important cause of habitat changes in arable landscapes. 14. Wintering geese graze preferentially on fertilised grass, and management for these important species includes fertiliser application and grazing. 15. Several species have suffered from reduced abundance and/or availability of surface-dwelling invertebrates. Species reliant on large invertebrates, such as cirl bunting and red-backed shrike, are especially sensitive. Loss of large invertebrates is also suggested as a major cause of reduced productivity of breeding waders in grassland. 16. Species that feed on soil invertebrates may be affected by reduced availability in dense swards. Snipe, starling and chough are examples of these. Although desiccation also reduces the ability of birds to feed on soil invertebrates, increased crop growth can contribute to this. 17. Seed resources are also reduced in intensive agriculture, and this can affect several species of seed-eating passerines. The loss of winter stubbles due to more efficient harvesting and autumn-sown cereals is probably the strongest driver of this. 18. More intensive grazing can lead to increased nest trampling in ground nesting species such as skylark and lapwing. These species may also suffer higher predation rates in intensively managed fields because sward homogeneity may make their nests easier to locate. 19. Nest destruction during silage cutting is a major cause of reduced productivity in ground nesting birds such as whinchat and corncrake. 20. The shift to silage production has probably had the greatest effect on bird populations in farmland, as it operates via three pathways: reduced invertebrate food due to frequent cutting; reduced seed resource as it is cut before setting seed; destruction of nests. 21. Birds may also have been affected by the polarisation of farming landscapes. Species such as starling and lapwing that prefer the juxtaposition of arable fields and pasture will have been disadvantaged by this process. 22. Organic farms are generally better for birds than conventional farms, but the causes of this are complex and cannot be simply ascribed to use of organic rather than inorganic fertiliser. Aquatic habitats Vegetation 1. Shallow freshwater lakes are especially susceptible to eutrophication. They tend to exist in either a clear-water state dominated by large plants (macrophytes), or a turbid-water state dominated by floating microscopic plants (phytoplankton). 2. Lakes shift between the states relatively suddenly. Switching can be triggered by a variety of processes, including changes in fish community and physical disturbance of vegetation, but the likelihood of switching is strongly influenced by nutrient levels. Both states are buffered against switching, so that a clear-water state can persist at high nutrient levels, and a turbid-water state may persist after nutrient levels are reduced. 3. Reedswamp vegetation has declined across areas of western and central Europe. Although there is some coincidence between reed decline and eutrophication, no cause and effect has been proven. In the Norfolk Broads, there was a spatial relationship between water nitrate concentration and the decline of a particular floating form of reed, known as hover. 4. Upland lakes in the UK are mostly oligotrophic in the absence of anthropogenic inputs of nutrients. These lakes can be susceptible to minor increases in nutrient loadings. 5. Estuaries and coastal waters are generally better flushed than freshwater lakes, and so the effects of eutrophication are generally less persistent. However, where eutrophication occurs it typically leads to a decline in rooted plant communities such as seagrass and eelgrass beds, and their replacement by macroalgal mats and phytoplankton blooms. vertebrates and fish 6. In freshwater, large zooplankton such as cladocerans (water fleas) are favoured by a clear-water state, as the presence of submerged macrophytes provides shelter from fish that prey on such zooplankton. 7. Freshwater invertebrate communities are sensitive to nutrient inputs, with shifts in community composition frequently driven by changes to substrate rather than food abundance or availability. Anoxic conditions also affect both invertebrates and fish. Molluscs are especially sensitive to eutrophic conditions, while annelid worms are favoured. 8. Fish communities both respond to the stable state of fresh water bodies and buffer stable states form changes, through processes such as disturbance of sediments and predation of zooplankton. 9. Eutrophication of shallow lakes leads to a reduction of fish diversity, with roach and bream becoming dominant at the expense of perch, rudd and tench. The size structure of fish communities in upland lakes can be altered by nutrient pollution, leading to fewer but larger individuals. 10. Immediately adjacent to point sources of nutrient pollution, invertebrate biomass is reduced by extreme conditions. However, in surrounding areas it can be much higher, although the community is very different from low- nutrient waters. 11. In estuarine and coastal areas, where sewage outfalls are removed, or where treatment is implemented, invertebrate biomass usually falls, although species richness increases and species composition more closely approximates natural conditions. 12. In intertidal mudflats, the presence of macroalgal mats forces invertebrates closer to the surface to evade anoxic conditions. If the mats persist invertebrate biomass may drop severely. 13. The mud-shrimp Corophium volutator and the sandworm Nereis diversicolor are more tolerant of eutrophic conditions and can provide abundant food resources to shorebirds. Birds 14. The indirect effects of eutrophication can be complex and highly localised in aquatic systems, and local changes in bird populations may be affected by changes at larger scales. Increased nutrient loading may be beneficial to birds up to a point at which radical changes to habitat occur. 15. The negative effects of nutrients on birds are most consistent in freshwater lakes, where a shift in stable states results in a decline in food plants for herbivorous and omnivorous waterfowl. 16. Eutrophic conditions also radically change the bottom-dwelling invertebrate fauna, leading to a loss of sensitive elements such as molluscs. Diving birds that feed on these invertebrates suffer from reduced food supply. 17. Roach, a fish species tolerant of eutrophic conditions are thought to compete with tufted duck for food resources in Lough Neagh. 18. Fish-eating birds that chase their prey may be negatively affected by eutrophication, as water transparency tends to be reduced. Nutrient enrichmen may also alter the size class of fish prey, reducing the abundance of suitable (small) individuals. 19. Eutrophication may affect birds reliant on reedbed by accelerating seral succession and by reducing the amount of open water present. Reedbed decline in Europe has been coincident with eutrophication, but no causality has been proven. 20. The red-listed bittern may be affected by reduced food supply. One of its major food items in Britain, rudd, performs poorly in eutrophic conditions. 21. In north-western Europe, marsh tern decline has been linked to eutrophication because its preferred nesting substrate, water soldier, is sensitive to increased nutrient loading. 22. Shorebirds in tidal areas generally benefit from anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Although the invertebrate community composition may shift radically, abundance is increased. Historically, bird populations have risen in estuaries where sewage inputs have increased, although population declines have not been observed in all situations where inputs have been reduced. 23. Species with specific prey requirements or foraging habits, such as shelduck, may not benefit from nutrient inputs. 24. In conditions of extreme eutrophication, where extensive macroalgal mats form, the anoxic conditions may force the mud-dwelling fauna to the surface, providing a short-term flush of food. If the mats persist, the food supply will be reduced in the long term. 25. Diving ducks in coastal waters also benefited from the increased food supplies around sewage outfalls, and their numbers have decline where outfalls have been removed. Upland moor and lowland heath Vegetation 1. There has been a decline in the extent of heather (Calluna vulgaris) cover in both heath and moorland in the United Kingdom in recent years. Causes of the decline include afforestation, conversion to farmland, invasion of grasses, and seral succession. 2. Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen increases the foliar nitrogen content of Calluna and decreases the root:shoot ratio. This increases sensitivity to desiccation, and dieback has been observed especially during winter droughts in upland moor and lowland heath. 3. Heath beetle outbreaks also cause Calluna dieback, and larval growth increases with foliar nitrogen content. It is suggested that nitrogen deposition increases the probability of beetle outbreaks. 4. Calluna is not competitively disadvantaged by increased nitrogen inputs in the absence of disturbance. Dieback resulting from heather beetle attacks or desiccation may cause disturbance sufficient for grasses to invade. Both of these mechanisms may be increased by nitrogen deposition. 5. Grazing disturbance has effects on the cover of heather and grass in moorland independent of the effects of nutrient inputs. Grazing intensity has increased over time in upland areas, although the drivers of this have mostly been agricultural subsidy policies. Nitrogen deposition may have facilitated this by increasing the forage quality of moorland, but this is difficult to determine and is likely to be a minor contributor. 6. These mechanisms are also suggested as causes for the loss of lowland heath in western Europe. However, lack of management is also implicated, so that succession to scrub and lack of burning have also resulted in loss of heath. vertebrates 7. Maintenance of invertebrate communities in moorland requires a mosaic of grass and heather of varying ages. Invertebrate biomass is generally lower in heather moorland than in grass moorland, although wet areas in moorland may support an abundant invertebrate fauna. 8. Plant-eating invertebrates may be favoured by nitrogen deposition and increased nutritive value of Calluna. However, intensive grazing will remove foliage to the detriment of these invertebrates. irds 9. The importance of nitrogen deposition in driving changes to bird populations in the uplands, relative to other causes (such as afforestation, climate change, land management), is difficult to determine. The evidence for links between increased nitrogen deposition (and associated processes) and bird populations is examined. 10. In upland moorland, the shift from heather to grass moorland over a large scale is likely to be the most important indirect effect of nitrogen deposition on birds. For fifteen species there was sufficient evidence of such effects to estimate sensitivity to heather loss. 11. Two species (red grouse and merlin) are classed as sensitive to heather loss, because they are strongly associated with mature heather cover for breeding and foraging. 12. Seven species (black grouse, golden eagle, hen harrier, meadow pipit, stonechat, ring ouzel and twite) are classed as moderately sensitive to heather loss. These species require a mosaic of heather and grass cover, and the effects of heather loss on birds will depend on the extent of initial heather cover and its spatial distribution. 13. Six species (golden plover, curlew, snipe, skylark, whinchat, wheatear) are classed as having low sensitivity to heather loss. Some of these species are likely to benefit from the conversion of heather moorland to either grass or bracken, while for others the structure of moorland vegetation is more important than its floristic composition. 14. For almost all species, an appropriate mosaic of upland habitats is required to supply suitable resources (eg nesting and foraging sites). In many cases, vegetation structure is more important than species composition, and very few bird species benefit from continuous heather cover.",,,,,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology",,,"Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Man made habitat; Pollution; Abiotic factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Aves [Population dynamics /  / ] [Freshwater habitat /  / ] [Heathland / Lowland heath / ] [Moorland /  / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Farmland / ] [Chemical pollution / Nutrient pollution / ] [Chemical factors /  / ] [United Kingdom /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14509058614,,,,,2018/06/21

At the time of the fire, studies of two subalpine faunal assemblages were being undertaken. The opportunity to resurvey the assemblages was taken in order to examine the immediate impact of fire in an environment where it is uncommon but predicted to occur increasingly with global warming. A study area in the Whites River Valley, where the number of bird species was counted monthly from 1996 to 2003, and weekly in late winter-spring from 2000 to 2003, was burnt in one fire. As well as the expected decrease in the number of individual birds, the fire resulted in an immediate decrease in the number of bird species, unlike in previously studied montane forest, with only the regularly wintering species plus the olive whistler and the ground-feeding flame robin remaining. During the post-winter avian immigration, few regular spring migrants appeared on burnt sites despite their nearby presence on the unburnt side of the valley. Five of six small mammal trapping grid's were burnt. As with fires at lower altitudes, there was an immediate reduction in mammal numbers. on burnt grids following the fire, but in addition, one species, Mastacomys fuscus, declined further in the ensuing 2 months both on burnt and unburnt sites. Numbers of Antechinus swainsonii and Rattus fuscipes stabilized until autumn/winter when there was a further decline due to the unavailability of subnivean space to allow winter foraging, allied with a concentration of fox predation on areas still carrying populations of small mammals.","Green, Ken; Natl Pks and Wildlife Serv, Snowy Mt Reg, POB 2228, Findabyne, NSW 2627, Australia, Australia.",kenneth.green@environment.nsw.gov.au,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",1442-9985,,"Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia; Australia","Aves; Mammalia [Community structure /  / Immediate & short-term responses of montane assemblages to subalpine wildfire] [Population density /  / ] [Distribution within habitat /  / ] [Mountain habitat /  / ] [Climate and weather /  / ] [Fire /  / ] [Temperature /  / ] [New South Wales / Snowy Mountains / ].","Birds; Chordates; Mammals; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).

The purpose of our analyses was to provide an assessment of the status and trends of northern spotted owl populations throughout most of their geographic range. The 14 study areas made up approximately 12% of the range of the subspecies and included federal, tribal, private, and mixed federal and private lands. The study areas also included all the major forest types that the subspecies inhabits. The analyses followed rigorous protocols that were developed a priori and were the result of extensive discussions and consensus among the authors. Our primary objectives were to estimate fecundity, apparent survival ([phi]), and annual rate of population change ([lambda]) and to determine if there were any temporal trends in these population parameters. In addition to analyses of data from individual study areas, we conducted 2 meta-analyses on each demographic parameter. One meta-analysis was conducted on all 14 areas, and the other was restricted to the 8 areas that constituted the Effectiveness Monitoring Plan for northern spotted owls under the Northwest Forest Plan. The average number of years of reproductive data per study area was 14 (range=5-19), and the average number of recapture occasions per study area was 13 (range =4-18). Only 1 study area had <12 years of data. Our results were based on 32,054 captures and resightings of 11,432 banded individuals for estimation of survival and 10,902 instances in which we documented the number of young produced by territorial females. The number of young fledged (NYF) per territorial female was analyzed by testing a suite of a priori models that included (1) effects of age, (2) linear or quadratic time trends, (3) presence of barred owls (Strix varia) in spotted owl territories, and (4) an even-odd year effect. The NYF varied among years on most study areas with a biennial cycle of high reproduction in even-numbered years and low reproduction in odd-numbered years. These cyclic fluctuations did not occur on all study areas, and the even-odd year effect waned during the last 5 years of the study. Fecundity was highest for adults ([overhead single bar]x=0.372, SE=0.029), lower for 2-year-olds ([overhead single bar]x=0.208, SE=0.032), and very low for 1-year-olds ([overhead single bar]x=0.074, SE=0.029). Fecundity was stable over time for 6 areas (Rainier, Olympic, Warm Springs, H. J. Andrews, Klamath, and Marin), declining for 6 areas (Wenatchee, Cle Elum, Oregon Coast Range, Southern Oregon Cascades, Northwest California, and Simpson), and slightly increasing for 2 areas (Tyee, Hoopa). We found little association between NYF and the proportion of northern spotted owl territories where barred owls were detected, although results were suggestive of a negative effect of barred owls on the Wenatchee and Olympic study areas. The meta-analysis on fecundity indicated substantial annual variability with no increasing or decreasing trends. Fecundity was highest in the mixed-conifer region of eastern Washington ([overhead single bar]x=0.560, SE=0.041) and lowest in the Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii ) region of the Oregon coast ([overhead single bar]x=0.306, SE=0.039). We used Cormack-Jolly-Seber open population models and Program MARK to estimate apparent survival rates of owls >1 year old. We found no differences in apparent survival rates between sexes except for 1 area (Marin), which had only 6 years of data. Estimates of apparent survival from individual study areas indicated that there were differences among age classes with adults generally having higher survival than 1-and 2-year-olds. Apparent survival rates ranged from 0.750 (SE=0.026) to 0.886 (SE=0.010) for adults, 0.626 (SE=0.073) to 0.886 (SE=0.010) for 2-year-olds, and 0.415 (SE=0.111) to 0.860 (SE=0.017) for 1-year-olds. These estimates were comparable to survival rates from previous studies on the subspecies. We found evidence for negative time trends in survival rates on 5 study areas (Wenatchee, Cle Elum, Rainier, Olympic, and Northwest California) and no trends in survival on the remaining areas. There was evidence for negative effects of barred owls on apparent survival on 3 study areas (Wenatchee, Cle Elum, and Olympic). Survival rates of adult owls on the 8 Monitoring Areas generally were high, ranging from 0.85 (SE=0.009) to 0.89 (SE=0.010), but were declining on the Cle Elum, Olympic, and Northwestern California study areas. The meta-analysis of apparent survival indicated differences among regions and changes over time with a downward trend in the mixed-conifer and Douglas-fir regions of Washington. The meta-analysis of apparent survival also indicated that there was a negative association between fecundity and survival the following year, suggesting a cost of reproduction on survival. This effect was limited to the Douglas-fir and mixed conifer regions of Washington and the Douglas-fir region of the Oregon Cascade Mountains. We used the reparameterized Jolly-Seber method ([lambda]RJS) to estimate annual rate of population change of territorial owls in the study areas. This estimate answers the question, Are these territorial owls being replaced in this geographically open population? Point estimates of [lambda]RJS were <1.0 for 12 of 13 study areas. The analyses provided strong evidence that populations on the Wenatchee, Cle Elum, Rainier, Olympic, Warm Springs, H. J. Andrews, Oregon Coast Ranges, and Simpson study areas were declining during the study. The mean [lambda]RJS for the 13 study areas was 0.963 (SE=0.009), suggesting that populations over all the areas were declining about 3.7% per year during the study. The mean [lambda]RJS for the 8 monitoring areas for the Northwest Forest Plan was 0.976 (SE=0.007) compared to a mean of 0.942 (SE=0.016) for the other study areas, a 2.4-versus-5.8% decline per year. This suggested that owl populations on federal lands had higher demographic rates than elsewhere; thus, the Northwest Forest Plan appeared to have a positive effect on demography of northern spotted owls. Populations were doing poorest in Washington, where apparent survival rates and populations were declining on all 4 study areas. Our estimates of [lambda]RJS were generally lower than those reported in a previous analysis ([lambda]RJS=0.997, SE=0.003) for many of the same areas at an earlier date. The possible causes of populationdeclines include but are not limited to habitat loss from timber harvest and fires, competition with barred owls, and weather patterns.","Anthony, Robert G.; U.S. Geological Survey, Oregon Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit, Fisheries and Wildlife Research Unit, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA, USA.",robert.anthony@oregonstate.edu,,,,,"Zoology; Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0084-0173,,"Reproduction; Reproductive productivity; Ecology; Population dynamics; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Strix occidentalis caurina [Fledgeing success /  / Long term trends; Oregon & Washington] [Population dynamics /  / Demographic status; long term trends & recommendations for future research] [Survival / Apparent survival / ] [California /  / ] [Oregon /  / ] [Washington /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Strigiformes, Strigidae","Strix occidentalis caurina (Strigidae).",10.2193/0084-0173(2006)163[1:SATIDO]2.0.CO;2,ZOOREC:ZOOR14309061924,,,,,2018/06/21

It is proposed that this target will be achieved in part by switching energy generation from the burning of fossil fuels to forms of generation with lower carbon dioxide emissions, such as renewables. The UK has a target for 10% of its energy to be generated from renewable sources by 2010, and the equivalent target for Scotland is 20%. In 2002, the UK Government introduced the Renewables Obligation, and associated Renewables Obligation (Scotland), a market support mechanism, which requires that power suppliers must source increasing amounts of their energy from renewables. Wind is currently the cheapest and most technologically advanced form of renewable energy, and thus the Renewables Obligation has led to a huge increase in the number of wind farm proposals. The wind resource, coupled with reluctance to have wind farms close to habitation, has led to many of these sites being in the uplands. Scotland contains a large area of upland habitat and has the highest number of schemes being considered for planning proposals of any of the UK countries. Scotland's upland habitat supports many important populations of birds of conservation concern, and this, combined with the negative effects wind farms can have on birds, leads to potential conflict. In order to help minimise this conflict, a bird sensitivity map to aid location of onshore wind farms in Scotland has been created, based on distributional data for a suite of sensitive bird species. Species included on the map are either listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, and/or are species of conservation concern with known or suspected susceptibility to the effects of wind turbines on birds, notably collision mortality and disturbance displacement. The sensitivity map has been produced at a 1km square resolution, with each 1km square in Scotland being assigned one of three sensitivity ratings. These sensitivity ratings were assigned following reviews of literature and best available information for each species on foraging ranges, collision risk, disturbance distances and other relevant features of behavioural and population ecology, to develop 'sensitivity criteria' to determine appropriate buffering distances to apply to the distributional data for birds. The map indicates that there is a greater incidence of bird sensitivities in north-west Scotland. Particularly sensitive areas occur in the Highlands, Western Isles and Northern Isles. Thirty seven percent of the area on the map is classified as 'high sensitivity' (31 418 1km squares), thirty one percent as 'medium' (26 358 1km squares) and thirty two percent as 'low/unknown sensitivity' (26 813 1km squares). The following caveats need to be taken into account when using the map: * The map has been developed from the best information available. However, data deficiency means that the map cannot be comprehensive. Gaps in survey coverage for species on the map mean that there is no guarantee these species will not occur in 'low/unknown' sensitivity squares. Lack of available data also means that some sensitive species could not be included on the map. No liability is accepted for the presence or absence of species at particular sites contrary to that indicated on the map. * The map is based primarily on the locations of breeding birds.* The sensitivity map was created by collating data that were collected for other purposes, and thus not tailored specifically to the map's requirements (which would be an enormous task). * The map is not a substitute for Environmental Impact Assessment, but is intended as an indicative map of likely bird sensitivities, to help guide decision-makers in the early stages of the planning process. * The map will require updates to add new survey data for the species included, to add data for further species as they become available, and to reflect revisions to the sensitivity criteria in the light of new information, notably from research and experience at working wind farms.","Langston, R.H.W.; RSPB, The Lodge, Sandy, Bedfordshire, SG19 2DL, United Kingdom, United Kingdom.",rowena.langston@rspb.org.uk,,,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Conservation; Ecology; Population dynamics; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom","Aves [Industry / Wind farm / Locational guidance map] [Conservation measures /  / Locational guidance map for wind farms] [Mortality /  / Wind farms; mitigation] [Scotland /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14403015814,,,,,2018/06/21

Habitat loss is magnified by fragmentation, which produces edge effects, alters dispersal and natural processes (i.e., fire). We quantified how Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) habitat varied using traditional landcover maps and methods that considered small focal habitat features (e.g., scrub ridges 2 ha) within an otherwise unsuitable matrix. We collected 7 years of data on color banded Florida scrub-jays to quantify dispersal and investigate how reproductive success and survival varied with habitat potential (scrub ridges), edge effects, and fire history. Landcover maps that identified only large scrub ridges resulted in a potential population of 354 pairs. Including small scrub ridges within an otherwise unsuitable matrix resulted in a potential population >774 pairs. Florida scrub-jays occupied less than half the potential habitat, and their population declined most from disrupted fire regimes. Almost 90% of all breeding dispersers remained within the same cluster of territories that they hatched in emphasizing the need to maximize local habitat quantity and quality. Reduced habitat quality, caused by disrupted fire regimes, was a major fragmentation effect that greatly magnified impacts of habitat loss. The disruption of natural processes is seldom identified as a major fragmentation effect, but studies worldwide have accumulated to demonstrate its significance. We advocated specific mapping approaches for species influenced by small habitat features and species dependent on matrix habitats that advance natural processes, such as fire.

A vascular plant inventory was conducted here between 1993 and 2005, resulting in the documentation of 466 species (398 native) in the preserve. Included in the annotated checklist of plants presented in this paper is a federally endangered species, northern monkshood Aconitum noveboracense Gray), nineteen plant species listed by the State of Iowa as threatened, endangered or of special concern, and the first report of a grass species, drooping woodreed (Cinna latifolia (Trevir.) Griseb.), in the Iowa flora. During the above inventory, a vegetation map was prepared on which six forest types were identified. Seven microhabitats were also recognized as occurring in the preserve; although these are not noted on the map, they are described. The results of other inventories conducted at Bixby of fungi (115 species), amphibians (7), reptiles (4), summer birds (40) and mammals (10) are also presented in this paper. As a vegetation remnant, Bixby fulfills several roles in conservation as described by Saunders et al. (1991). The numerous habitats at Bixby support populations of many uncommon to rare organisms and their gene pools and thus serve a species oriented role. By preserving a diversity of forest types and microhabitats, including rare Betula alleghaniensis forest and algific talus slope habitats, Bixby fulfills an example oriented role. The climatic conditions (temperature, precipitation) and topographic diversity that occur here allow the persistence of numerous ""special plants"" at the edge of their distribution or disjunct from floras elsewhere in North America, thus preserving evolutionary opportunities and successional states (i.e., a process oriented role). Bixby is commonly visited by the general public and is frequently utilized by educators and conservationists as a site for field trips and natural history hikes; hence, it fulfills a social values oriented role in conservation. Numerous human effects have been observed or inferred to have Occurred at Bixby that have altered population dynamics and community composition of the residing biota. These impacts include fire Suppression, introduction of non-native species of vascular plants Such as garlic Mustard (Alliaria petiolata (Bieb.) Cavara & Grande) and disease-causing fungi including Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma ulmi (Buisman) Nannf. and O. nova-ulmi Brasier) and butternut canker (Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum N.B. Nair, Kostichka & Kuntz), increased abundance of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) and brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater Boddaert), forest fragmentation, and increased edge habitat. Bixby is an ideal site for future research that might include inventory of the bryoflora, Study of population dynamics of herbs in disturbed versus mature forests, and resurvey of forest vegetation plots to monitor Successional dynamics in northeast Iowa forests. Future management at Bixby should include removal of woody vegetation from the prairie opening, annual removal of garlic mustard, and acquisition of adjacent forest lands to act as a buffer surrounding the preserve.","Norris, William R.; Western New Mexico Univ, Dept Nat Sci, 1000 W Coll Ave, Silver City, NM 88061, USA, USA.",,,,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0896-8381,,"Ecology; Community structure; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Amphibia; Aves; Mammalia; Reptilia [Relative abundance /  / ] [Iowa / Bixby State Preserve / Species list; relative abundance & habitat].","Amphibians; Birds; Chordates; Mammals; Reptiles; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Amphibia (Vertebrata).

B,ZOOR14303016994,Book,"Progress towards halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010.",,,,"European Environment Agency",,"Progress towards halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010.",,,,1-99,2006,2006,,,,English,0,57,"The continuing loss of biological diversity and its components, genes, species and ecosystems, is an issue of global concern. Research has shown that both the diversity and the identity of the various species have a fundamental influence on the magnitude and stability of the ecological processes that occur at the ecosystem level. There are significant interrelationships between the degradation of ecosystems, the loss of animal and plant species, market globalisation, and poverty. Europe's high per capita consumption and waste production means that its impact on ecosystems is felt well beyond its own borders. Biodiversity loss is inextricably linked to the degradation of the ecosystem services described by the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. The objective of 'managing natural resources more responsibly: to protect and restore habitats and natural systems and halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010' was first adopted by the EU in the EU Strategy for Sustainable Development (2001). As a consequence, the conservation of biodiversity is one of the four main issues to be tackled, together with climate change, environment and health and quality of life, and natural resources and waste, within the 6th environmental action programme 'Our Future, Our Choice', adopted in 2002. In Europe, more than on any other continent, the influence of human activity has shaped biodiversity over time, with settled agriculture and animal husbandry spreading from the south-east to the north-west between 10 000 and 5 000 years ago. Landscapes in Europe were relatively stable until the agricultural and industrial revolutions of the past two centuries. Since then, and even more since the 1950s, dramatic changes in land use, intensification of agriculture, urbanisation, land abandonment and movement to towns and cities have led to the widespread collapse of the socio-economic systems that supported these diverse systems of land use. While some species populations in Europe are increasing, many others are declining. The most vulnerable are the species at the top of food chains, such as large carnivores, endemic local species (species found only in one geographical area), species with chronically small populations, migratory species, and specialist species. However, several species that were considered threatened by extinction, such as the beaver, the otter, vultures and many raptors, are now showing stable or even positive trends in certain parts of their distribution, as a result of protection and restoration measures. Land use in Europe continues to change, but not on the scale of recent decades. Land is becoming a scarcer resource: 800 000 ha of Europe's land cover was converted to artificial surfaces between 1990 and 2000, taking over agricultural and natural areas, in particular wetlands. Responses in nature conservation policies are positive as the total area covered by nationally designated areas by European countries has increased during recent years. The Natura2000 site designations have contributed to a direct increase in the total area designated for in situ conservation in EU-15 countries. The level of sufficiency in designating Natura2000 sites under the habitats directive is high for almost all EU-15 countries, but there have been significant delays in putting the network in place. The generally low rate of implementation of both the EU Biodiversity Strategy and the action plans in Member States was recognised in 2004. The 'final message from Malahide' presented 18 priority objectives for halting the loss of biodiversity, many of which express the need for sectoral considerations and the integration of biodiversity issues in other policies. This report assesses farmland, forests, freshwater ecosystems, marine and coastal systems, wetlands of international importance and mountain ecosystems in order to provide evidence of progress - or lack of progress - towards the 2010 target of halting the loss of biodiversity. Farmland: Progress towards the 2010 target is not apparent and the target is unlikely to be reached without additional integrated policy efforts. In need of specific attention are the targeting and prioritising actions aimed both at the conservation of high nature value farmland and at improving the biodiversity value of intensively-managed farmland. The most alarming signs of lack of progress are the continuing expansion of intensively-farmed areas at the expense of natural and semi-natural habitats, the reported declining trend in farmland-related species of birds and butterflies, the increasing rates of water utilisation, farm specialisation and intensification of farming practices, the increased presence of invasive alien species in farmland, and the high risk of abandonment of farmland in several parts of Europe. Forests: There are clear signs of progress in reducing threats to and enhancing the biological diversity of Europe's forests. In most countries, forests are growing older and thus more valuable for biodiversity conservation, and a slightly decreased effect of air pollution has been observed. Conserving biodiversity has been gaining ground within the objectives of forest management, as has certification of the products of sustainably-managed forests. Several persisting issues of concern include conservation of threatened species that occur in forests, control of increasing invasive alien species, addressing forest fragmentation due to changes in land use, and more efficient control of forest fires. Freshwater ecosystems: The main sign of progress is the marked improvement in the water quality of many rivers and lakes in recent decades, whichhas made water again suitable for the potential return of some of the lost species. The 2010 target is unlikely to be reached without restoring riverine habitats and biological communities and reversing the trend of many freshwater species that are threatened or at risk of extinction. To this end, three issues are of outstanding importance: counteracting the loss, fragmentation and modification of habitats due to dams and canalization, minimizing the increased presence of invasive alien species, and ensuring the appropriate conservation and management of the few remaining natural freshwater systems. Seas and coasts: The loss of biodiversity in all European seas and coasts is considerable and shows little sign of being reduced. The only area of progress, although not spectacular, is the improvement in the abiotic conditions ofthe Black sea, which was badly damaged in the past; conditions in the Mediterranean sea remain critical. Persisting evidence of the need for urgent action is the increasing depletion of fish stocks, the continuing pollution from land-based sources and oil spills, and the non-recovery of threatened and endangered marine species. Numbers of invasive alien species in the marine environment have been increasing and risks of pollution and genetic erosion induced by aquaculture have been identified. Continuing loss and fragmentation of natural habitat areas on the coastline as wellas increased soil erosion, caused by urbanisation, tourism and infrastructure development, have been observed. Wetlands of international importance: While the loss of wetland habitats in Europe is continuing, there is some progress in conserving the wetlands designated as of international importance (Ramsar sites). This is indicated by the steady increase in the area designated in the past decade, the stabilising populations of water birds, and the increased number of restoration and local community awareness projects in many countries. However, Ramsar sites are still facing importantthreats, and negative changes in ecological state have been reported in most of them. Pressures from water abstraction, drainage or damming, excessive hunting and fishing, and unspecified pollution sources have been identified in many countries. Urbanisation and transport development, as well as tourism and recreation have been signalled as drivers of deterioration of the sites. Mountains: There is little evidence of progress in enhancing or reducing threats to the biologicaldiversity of Europe's mountains, which are subject to rapid changes. The 2010 target may be partly met in areas where traditional uses and activities continue to shape the ecosystem structures. Evidence for progress is that the populations ofsome endangered large carnivores and herbivores are increasing due to successful management and that long-range pollution has stabilised while pollution from industry is a relatively local threat. The main challenges for reaching the target are minimising the high risk of local extinctions of several species and counteracting the already visible effects of habitat fragmentation and/or change due to changes in land use. The increasing effects of climate change should be also taken in account when addressing policy measures. A number of issues continue to be of general concern in ecosystems across Europe. The effects of eutrophication and acidification often occur far from the sources of pollution, as a result of transfersthrough the atmosphere and water bodies. Marine, coastal and other aquatic ecosystems, grasslands and forests are all sensitive to eutrophication, which has become a widespread problem - globally and within Europe. Climate change will impact biodiversity and ecosystems differently across Europe and it may well be the most powerful factor in shaping Europe's future biodiversity, acting on top of habitat destruction, fragmentation and over-exploitation. Changes have been observed in the Arctic, with new incoming species of plants establishing in lakes, and in mountain regions like the Alps, with loss of endemic plants. Potential risks to human health and the environment, including biodiversity, posed byliving modified organisms, resulting from modern biotechnology, are recognised by global conventions and EU legislation. Continuous monitoring and assessment of impacts is necessary both at the European and global scales. A range of general issues is in need of further consideration to help steer future action: the impacts of long-range transboundary pollution and climate change on biodiversity, the failure to break the common perception that conservation and economicdevelopment are incompatible, the continued abandonment of traditional wildlife-friendly extensive farming methods, and gaps between theory and practice in Europe's management of forests and fisheries. With regard to improving the integration of biodiversity into economic sectors, there is a need to address next steps with respect to most actionslaid down in policy documents, and a need for a clear sense of priority, broadly agreed by the key stakeholders. Assessing the dependence of human health on responsible biodiversity management, the potential of spatial planning, the internalisation of external costs to biodiversity, and the distribution or sharing-out of competence between different levelsof governance would assist in reaching further agreement on actions to be taken. The development of integrated data sets throughout the continent as well as of a conceptual framework for indicators and their interpretation are essential for assessing progress towards the 2010 target and beyond it.",,,,,"Office for Official Publications of the European Communities",Luxembourg,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",,92-9167-846-5,"Animals and man; Conservation; Ecology; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Marine zones; Atlantic Ocean","Animalia [Disturbance by man /  / Progress towards halting loss of biodiversity by 2010] [Conservation /  / ] [Ecology /  / ] [Europe /  / ] [North Atlantic /  / ].",,Animalia,Animalia.,,ZOOREC:ZOOR14303016994,,,,,2018/06/21

Widespread declines of farmland birds are also occurring in Great Britain and western Europe, largely due to the intensification of agricultural operations. Habitat loss has been the major driving force for declines of grassland birds up until the last 50 years when the intensification of mechanized agricultural operations, along with increased habitat fragmentation that is associated with larger ""industrial"" farm sizes, became strong factors Other threats to grassland birds come from invasive species and planting of exotic grasses, urbanization, residential development, oil and gas extraction, wind power development, excessive predation/parasitism, fire suppression that results in succession to shrubland, ground water depletion, development of transportation corridors, use of pesticides, and rodent eradication programs. No single management approach or conservation solution will benefit the entire suite of grassland bird species across large geographic regions. Just stabilizing populations of grassland birds at their present levels presents a huge conservation challenge.","McCracken, Jon D.; Bird Studies Canada, Port Rowan, Ontario, N0E 1M0, Canada, Canada.",jmccracken@bsc-eog.org,,,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",1488-8386,,"Animals and man; Conservation; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region","Aves [Disturbance by man /  / Grassland species population decline causes] [Conservation measures /  / Grassland species] [Population size /  / Grassland species population declines overview & causes] [Grassland /  / Species population declines overview & causes] [North America /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14204024218,,,,,2018/06/21

We developed a graphical model based on isodar theory to distinguish between an ideal distribution and an ecological trap. We tested the model's predictions using data on breeding bird populations in managed tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. Between 1992 and 1996 we monitored success for 2600 nests of 26 breeding species in undisturbed, grazed, and burned and grazed plots. We also sampled arthropod biomass and nest predator abundance. Using the isodar model we determined that managed plots are ecological traps: compared with success on plots left undisturbed, nest success on plots that were only grazed was lower, and success on plots that were burned and grazed was substantially lower. Yet birds preferred to nest on managed plots, where arthropod abundance was measurably higher. Reptiles were the most abundant taxon of nest predators, and their abundance was highest in managed plots. Consequently, tree-nesting species had higher nest success than shrub- and ground-nesting birds. Nest success also increased with tree height. We concluded that isodar theory is a useful tool for detecting ecological traps if any component of fitness is measured in addition to animal densities. Our study also suggests that (1) human modification of the environment may alter simultaneously food and predator abundance, (2) the former affects nest site selection and the latter nest success, and (3) such ecosystems are likely to become traps for breeding birds.","Shochat, Eyal; Sutton Avian Research Center, University of Oklahoma, P.O.

An as complete as possible inventory of the territory of the current breeding population, an analysis of the habitat use, abundances in different types of habitat and the development of the population were the major aims of this study. The results allow conclusions concerning the threats to and chances for the conservation the species listed in Annex I of the EU Birds Directive. 144 breeding records, 1,778 territories and 1,106 simple observations during breeding time were recorded in 2004. Including another breeding records, 752 territories and 288 simple observations from the seasons 1999-2003 and the estimates for those areas which could not be investigated or only on sample sub-areas, the current population size in Low Saxony is estimated at approximately 6,00-6,500 territories. The main distribution areas are the ""Lueneburger Heide"" and the region Wendland with large populations in the nature conservation are ""Lueneburger Heide"" and in military training areas as well as in the ""normal landscape"". Regarding habitat preference, fields, mostly on the outskirts of forests, are the most important type of habitat (52 % of all territories), followed by heathlands (27 %) and oligotrophic sandy- or other grassland (10 %); forests, the outskirts of sphagnum bogs and soil quarrying area account for 3 % each. Few territories were found in special cultivation and other habitats. Considering the fact that gaps in inventory are biggest in fields, the real proportion of fields probably around 60 %, whereas heathlands only hold around 20 % of all territories. On average, the highest abundances were found in sandy heathlands; inside of military training areas they are often slightly smaller. A statistical correlation between habitat sizes and abundances could not be determined. In general, a manifold, fragmented landscape structure, especially with a distinct relief and extended habitat boundary lines between forests and open landscape, has a positive effect on woodlark abundances.The development of the population size is difficult to analyse since longtime statistical series were collected almost exclusively in heathlands and not in agricultural landscapes. Furthermore, storm and fire occurrences occasionally had a strong effect on the woodlark population.All in all, the population size seems to be stable or slightly decreasing. Approximately 25-30 % of the territories can be found in Special Protection Areas (SPA""s) under the Birds Directive. Thus, the present state of preservation can still be assessed as ""good"". For the further development changes in agricultural land are crucial, whereas the heathland populations could be protected by appropriate management measures. However, the main threats arise from the increasing abandonment and conversion of military areas. Changes in forest management have already caused a decrease or even disappearance of this species from the inside of the forests.","Blueml, Volker; Hasestrasse 60, D-49074 Osnabrueck, Germany, Germany.",v.blueml@bms-umweltplanung.de,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Zoology",0340-403X,,"Conservation; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat utilization; Habitat; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Lullula arborea [Conservation / Population endangerment & protection / Population census analysis] [Population censuses / State-wide census / Analysis of distribution; population size & habitat preference] [Distribution within habitat /  / ] [Habitat preference /  / ] [Terrestrial habitat /  / ] [Germany / Niedersachsen / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Alaudidae","Lullula arborea (Alaudidae).",10.1080/10236240400029366,ZOOREC:ZOOR14202010101,,,,,2018/06/21

In lower elevation, xeric sagebrush communities, the role of fire has changed in recent decades from an infrequent disturbance maintaining a landscape mosaic and facilitating community processes to frequent events that after sagebrush communities to exotic vegetation, from which restoration is unlikely. Because of cheatgrass invasion, fire-return intervals in these sagebrush ecosystems have decreased from an historical pattern (pre-European settlement) of 30 to >100 yr to 5-15 yr. In other sagebrush communities, primarily higher elevation ecosystems, the lack of fire has allowed transitions to greater dominance by sagebrush, loss of herbaceous understory, and expansion of juniper-pinyon woodlands. Response by birds living in sagebrush habitats to fire was related to the frequency, size, complexity (or patchiness), and severity of the burns. Small-scale fires that left patchy distributions of sagebrush did not influence bird populations. However, large-scale fires that resulted in large grassland expanses and isolated existing sagebrush patches reduced the probability of occupancy by sagebrush-obligate species. Populations of birds also declined in sagebrush ecosystems with increasing dominance by juniper (Juniperus spp.) and pinyon (Pinus spp.) woodlands. Our understanding of the effects of fire on sagebrush habitats and birds in these systems is limited. Almost all studies of fire effects on birds have been opportunistic, correlative, and lacking controls. We recommend using the large number of prescribed burns to develop strong inferences about cause-and-effect relationships. Prescribed burning is complicated and highly contentious, particularly in low-elevation, xeric sagebrush communities. Therefore, we need to use the unique opportunities provided by planned burns to understand the spatial and temporal influence of fire on sagebrush landscapes and birds. In particular, we need to develop larger-scale and longer-term research to identify the underlying mechanisms that produce the patterns of bird responses to fire in sagebrush ecosystems.","Knick, Steven T.; USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center, Snake River Field Station, 970 Lusk Street, Boise, ID 83706, USA, USA.",,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Biodiversity & Conservation",0197-9922,,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Documentation; Publications; Ecology; Habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region","Aves [Habitat management / Prescribed burning / ecological effects of fire implications] [Literature review /  / Ecological effects of fire] [Ecology /  / Fire effects; review; research & management issues] [Terrestrial habitat / Sagebrush habitats / ] [Fire /  / Ecological effects] [North America / West / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14202011288,,,,,2018/06/21

The occurrence of fire in the region has been associated with the presence of humans for over 10,000 yr. While pre-European fire regimes are poorly understood, fire is widely thought to have promoted and maintained large expanses of oak forest, woodland, and savanna documented in original land surveys. Forest composition is gradually shifting from fire-tolerant oaks (Quercus spp.) to other species (e.g., maples (Acer spp.)) and suppression of fire has been implicated as a primary cause. Prescribed fire has been used successfully to restore and maintain oak savannas and has been advocated to improve the sustainability of oak forests. Fire ecology research has addressed short-term effects of prescribed fire on habitat structure, breeding bird populations, and nesting productivity. In the short term, prescribed fire reduces habitat suitability for forest-interior birds that nest on the ground and in low shrubs but provides more favorable conditions for disturbance-dependent birds associated with savannas, woodlands, and early-successional forest. The use of prescribed burning requires tradeoffs in terms of management and conservation because some bird species benefit while others are negatively affected, depending on the degree to which fire changes habitat features. There is a critical need for long-term studies to better understand the effects of different fire regimes on bird populations in the eastern deciduous forest region.","Artman, Vanessa L.; Department of Biology, DePauw University, Greencastle, IN, 46135, USA, USA.",,,,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry",0197-9922,,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Documentation; Publications; Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region","Aves [Habitat management / Prescribed burning / ecological effects of fire implications] [Literature review /  / Ecological effects of fire] [Ecology /  / Fire effects; review; management implications & research needs] [Forest and woodland / Deciduous forests / ] [Fire /  / Ecological effects] [North America / East / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14202011292,,,,,2018/06/21

Species richness of birds, fishes, reptiles, amphibians, and insects is equally high, whereas mammal diversity is relatively low. Deforestation rates have been higher in the Cerrado than in the Amazon rainforest, and conservation efforts have been modest. only 2.2% of its area is under legal protection. Numerous animal and plant species are threatened with extinction, and an estimated 20% of threatened and endemic species do not occur in protected areas. Soil erosion, the degradation of the diverse Cerrado vegetation formations, and the spread of exotic grasses are widespread and major threats. The use of fire for clearing land and to encourage new growth for pasture has also caused damage, even though the Cerrado is afire-adapted ecosystem. Ecosystem experiments and modeling show that change in land cover is altering the hydrology and affecting carbon stocks and fluxes. Cerrado agriculture is lucrative, and agricultural expansion is expected to continue, requiring improvements in and extension of the transportation infrastructure, which will affect not only the Cerrado but also the Amazon forest.

First, post-disturbance colonization is not limited by the dispersal ability of the species to reach the newly created open areas and, secondly, colonization is limited by dispersal. Under the first hypothesis, we expect, at a regional scale, to find similar post-disturbance communities to develop on recently burned sites. However, colonization limited by dispersal will lead to strong between-site variations in species composition.Location To test these hypotheses, we studied the post-fire colonization patterns of nine open-habitat bird species in eight distantly located wildfires in the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula.Methods We censused post-fire bird composition by means of field transects and identified potential colonization sources from species-habitat suitability maps derived from atlas data.Results Our results showed strong significant differences in post-fire species composition between burnt areas. Burnt areas located in areas with low probability of species presence before the fire event showed lower species occurrence and richness after the fire.Main conclusions These results do not support the idea that early successional stages and open habitats have a homogeneous community structure at regional scales and suggest that dispersal is a key constraint determining bird colonization of post-fire habitats. Further attention should be paid to landscape heterogeneity as a key factor in determining population dynamics of open-habitat species in the light of current and future land-use changes in Mediterranean regions.","Brotons, Lluis; Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya, Area de Biodiversitat, Pujada del Seminari s/n, 25280 Solsona, Catalonia, Spain, Spain.",lluis.brotons@ctfc.es,"Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009","Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457; Pons, Pere/0000-0002-2196-5544",,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0305-0270,,"Ecology; Habitat utilization; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Aves [Habitat colonization /  / Burned habitats] [Fire /  / Colonization of burned habitats] [Spain / Catalonia / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01195.x,ZOOREC:ZOOR14108046967,,,,,2018/06/21

In this paper, we use generalised linear models to investigate interrelationships among an index of decline in 1[degree] by 1[degree] cells and measures of grazing intensity and contemporary patterns of burning, together with the environmental variables of rainfall, vegetation and topographic patterning in the landscape. Grazing intensity was the single strongest human effect but strong correlations between grazing intensity and other human influences suggest that these may have been subsumed within the grazing intensity measure. Impacts of grazing may be worse where pastoral settlement occurred earlier. Topographic variation appeared to be a mitigating effect, suggesting a role for 'topographic refuges' from human activities. Relationships among granivore declines, grazing and rainfall are difficult to disentangle using inferential statistics, but a consistent effect is that declines are more severe in areas with greater year-to-year variation in rainfall. We do not suggest that our analyses are conclusive. However, they do support the proposition that better understanding of the causes of decline at finer spatial scales will emerge most strongly in studies that link habitat quality with granivore demography at inland sites of highly variable year-to-year rainfall and with strongly contrasting grazing histories.","Franklin, Donald C.; School for Environmental Research, Charles Darwin University, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia, Australia.",don.franklin@cdu.edu.au,"Franklin, Donald/F-1171-2014","Franklin, Donald/0000-0002-9813-0959",,,"Zoology; Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation",1035-3712,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Conservation; Ecology; Abiotic factors; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia","Aves [Farming and agriculture /  / Decline of granivorous taxa; geographic patterns & correlates] [Conservation /  / ] [Population dynamics /  / ] [Abiotic factors /  / ] [Australia / North / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",10.1071/WR05052,ZOOREC:ZOOR14111065572,,gold_or_bronze,,,2018/06/21

Ecosystem engineers are important facilitators of other species because they cause physical changes in the environment that alter resource availability. Although a species can be associated with more than one partner, facilitators may not be interchangeable if they differ in abundance, behavioral characteristics, or interactions with other factors in ways that condition the outcome of the association. We examined interactions between burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) and two burrowing mammals, hairy armadillos (Chaetophractus villosus) and plains vizcachas (Lagostomus maximus), and determined whether these ecosystem engineers are interchangeable for owls. We examined reproductive success for owls nesting in these mammal burrows, constructed a logistic regression model to identify habitat characteristics associated with owl nests, and examined the engineering activities of the mammals. Data on reproduction and habitat indicate that armadillos and vizcachas are not interchangeable for owls. Thirty-five percent of the nests in vizcacha burrows produced fledglings; no fledglings were produced from nests outside vizcachas colonies, even though owls nest successfully in armadillo burrows in other parts of Argentina. Vizcachas facilitate burrowing owls by construction of burrows and by producing open understory vegetation through herbivory. In contrast, armadillos do not alter vegetation, and their burrows are suitable for nest sites only when they occur in recently burned areas or areas maintained by anthropogenic disturbance. Our habitat model also suggests that fire plays a key role in maintaining owl populations because fire is the only natural process that reduces shrubs to the level required by owls. Current management practices of eradication of vizcachas and fire suppression in shrublands could have strong negative consequences for burrowing owls.","Machicote, Marcela; Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol and Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA, USA.",mmachicote@yahoo.com,,,,,"Reproductive Biology; Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0030-1299,,"Reproduction; Reproductive behaviour; Locomotion; Ecology; Habitat; Land zones; Neotropical region; South America","Athene cunicularia [Breeding site /  / Ecosystem engineer interactions] [Reproductive productivity / Breeding success / ] [Burrowing /  / ] [Impact on habitat /  / ] [Terrestrial habitat /  / ] [Argentina / La Pampa, Los Valles Ranch / ].

We investigated whether the source-sink concept Could help to clarify the influence of habitat potential (scrub ridge characteristics), population density, and fires (shrub heights) on Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) demography and dispersal. We mapped territories and measured survival, recruitment, emigration, immigration, and shrub heights annually for 12 years. We classified territories as oak if they overlapped well-drained ridges, oak-palmetto if they overlapped poorly drained ridges >0.4 ha, and palmetto-oak if they only overlapped poorly drained ridges 0.4 ha. Territory size differed little among these categories but was negatively correlated with the annual number of breeding pairs, which ranged from 12 to 27. Scrub ridge characteristics influenced the locations of sinks and potential sources, whereas population density and fires caused temporal variation in demographic success. Oak territories were usually sources because they were net exporters of individuals and because recruitment exceeded mortality. Oak-palmetto territories sometimes functioned as sources but were often pseudo-sinks because density dependence caused mortality to exceed recruitment. Palmetto-oak territories were true sinks because they were net importers of individuals and mortality exceeded recruitment regardless of population density. All scrub was short (1.2 m) or medium height (1.2-1.7 m), but the spatial arrangement of these height classes changed regularly because fires occurred every 2-7 years. We observed a quadratic relationship between demographic success and the area of medium-height scrub within territories. Territories that had 0.9-1.2 ha of medium-height scrub had the highest demographic success. Applying source-sink concepts at the territory scale was useful to quantify habitat variation at a spatial scale relevant to population processes, reserve design, and habitat management. Our approach can be applied by using territory maps or geographic information systems to partition heterogeneous landscapes into territories and then by classifying territories into potential sources and sinks using scrub ridge characteristics and shrub heights.","Breininger, David R.; Dyn-2, Dynamac Corporation, Kennedy Space Center, Florida 32899, USA, USA.",breindr@kscems.ksc.nasa.gov,,,,,"Zoology; Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry",1051-0761,,"Behaviour; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Aphelocoma coerulescens [Territoriality / Territory occupation / Habitat potential; population density & fires influence] [Population dynamics / Source-sink dynamics / ] [Population density /  / Influence on source-sink dynamics] [Forest and woodland / Scrub ridges / population density & fires influence on source-sink dynamics] [Fire /  / ] [Florida / Kennedy Space Center / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Passeriformes, Corvidae","Aphelocoma coerulescens (Corvidae).",10.1890/03-5002,ZOOREC:ZOOR14101001638,,,,,2018/06/21

Ants (family Formicidae) are an important, although often overlooked, component of many terrestrial ecosystems. Six species of ants are especially striking in their global ability to invade, and their impacts. This paper focuses on the impacts of the most destructive of those species, the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), and focuses on impacts on native vertebrates. Red imported fire ants often become the dominant ant species in infested areas outside of their native range due to their aggressive foraging behavior, high reproductive capability and lack of predators and/or other strong competitors. The evidence suggests that mammals, birds and herpetofauna are vulnerable to negative impacts from fire ants, and some species are more likely to experience negative population-level impacts than other species. Assessing the ecological impacts of fire ants on wild animal populations is logistically difficult, and very few studies have combined replicated experimental manipulation with adequate spatial (> 10 ha) and temporal (>1 y) scale. Thus, most studies have been observational, opportunistic, small-scale or 'natural' experiments. However, significant research, including an increase in experimental and mechanistic investigations, has occurred during the past decade, and this has led to information that can lead to better management. of potentially affected species.","Allen, C.R.; USGS-South Carolina Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, Clemson University, Clemson 29634, USA, USA.",allencr@clemson.edu,,,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0003-0031,,"Documentation; Publications; Ecology; Competition; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America","Solenopsis invicta [Literature review /  / Impact on native vertebrates] [Interspecific competition /  / review] [USA /  / ].

A Norwegian population of the endangered ortolan bunting (Emberiza hortulana) occurs on a forest burn that has an area allocated to golf. Some forest-burn habitat (heather (Calluna vulgaris) heath with scattered, small Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris)) remains between fairways and on the periphery of the golf course. I compared pairing success, residence times, and emigration rates of male ortolan buntings in the interior and periphery of the golf course and in a neighboring part of undisturbed forest burn (control area). Males in the interior of the golf course (n = 4) never attracted females and less than half (43%, n = 7) in the golf periphery did so, whereas most males in the control area attracted females (77%, n = 13; all males on golf course vs. control: P= 0.038). Males in the golf interior had shorter residence times than males on the golf periphery and both were present for a shorter time than males in the control area (golf vs. control: P = 0.030). All males that had territories in the golf interior emigrated to other areas (median = 13.3 km away). The emigration rate was lower for males on the golf periphery (43%) and even lower in the control area (15%; golf vs. control: P = 0.033). Males emigrating from the golf course attracted females at the same rate as control males in their new areas of residence. Compared to males in the rest of the forest burn (n = 76), males on the golf course had shorter residence times (P = 0.049) and higher emigration rate (P = 0.009), but pairing success was not different (P = 0.196). Overall, the golf course did not seem to be attractive to ortolan buntings, although the lack of other populations on golf courses precludes replicate studies. Whether the apparent avoidance was due to fragmentation of breeding habitat on the golf course, human disturbance, or some other reason remains to be tested. In the case of the ortolan bunting, the negative effects of the golf course probably would have been reduced if remaining natural habitat had been concentrated to the periphery of the golf course and adjacent to other bunting habitat.","Dale, Svein; Department of Biology and Nature Conservation, Agricultural University of Norway, P.O.

We studied the nesting biology of Southeastern American Kestrels in 1999 and 2000 at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, in old-growth longleaf pine savanna, a habitat type historically widely occupied by the kestrels. Most of the nest cavities we observed were in old-growth trees, both living and dead, and were originally excavated by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and then enlarged by other woodpecker species. Nesting success was 70% in 1999 and 56% in 2000. In 1999, 67% of eggs survived to become fledglings in successful nests, as did 58% in 2000. Nests in live pines and snags were equally successful, and nest success was positively related to cavity height in 1999. Reduced nesting success in 2000 may have been related to severe drought conditions. High nesting concentrations of up to 4 pairs per km2 were observed. We suggest that stands of old-growth longleaf pine, with little or no hardwood midstory and a relatively high number of snags, inhabited by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, may constitute high quality habitat for Southeastern American Kestrels. Therefore, loss of longleaf pine habitat, degradation of remaining longleaf habitat due to fire suppression and removal of old-growth and snags, and the decline of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker, a species on which kestrels may have depended as a source of nest cavities historically, may have contributed to the decline of the Southeastern American Kestrel.","Gault, Kathleen E.; Virginia Tech RCW Research Team, PO Box 875, Niceville, FL 32588-0875, USA, USA.",rcwproj@earthlink.net,,,,,"Zoology; Reproductive Biology; Forestry; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",1528-7092,,"Reproduction; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Falco sparverius paulus [Reproductive productivity / Nesting success / In nest cavities; influences] [Forest and woodland / Savanna / Nesting success in nest cavities] [Aridity / Drought / Nesting success in nest cavities effect] [Climate and weather /  / ] [Florida / Northwest / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Falconiformes, Falconidae","Falco sparverius paulus (Falconidae).",10.1656/1528-7092(2004)003[0191:NSOSAK]2.0.CO;2,ZOOREC:ZOOR14011065638,,,,,2018/06/21

The species density changed between years from 135 to even 0 males per km2. The density and numbers of these birds are governed mainly by changes in the groundwater table caused by floods, droughts or fires. Aquatic Warblers breed successfully when the groundwater table coincides with the topsoil level; the optimal water table lies in the range from 12 cm above the soil to 5 cm below it. Between 1981 and 2002 successful first-clutch breeding occurred 11 times (47.8%); in only 4 years was second-clutch breeding successful (17.3%). First and second clutches both failed in 9 years (39%). The pattern of changes in the population size and data on the recovery of the population size following such unfavourable years indicates that the key factors governing the overall population size are not migration or wintering conditions, but rather the state of the breeding biotopes.

However, logistic regression models for nest fate are inappropriate when applied to data from nests found at various ages, for the same reason that the apparent estimator of nest success is biased (i.e. older clutches are more likely to be successful than younger clutches). A generalized linear model is presented and illustrated that gives ornithologists access to a flexible, suitable alternative to logistic regression that is appropriate when exposure periods vary, as they usually do. Unlike the Mayfield method (1961, 1975) and the logistic regression method of Aebischer (1999), the logistic-exposure model requires no assumptions about when nest losses occur. Nest survival models involving continuous and categorical explanatory variables, multiway classifications, and time-specific (e.g. nest age) and random effects are easily implemented with the logistic-exposure model. Application of the model to a sample of Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) nests shows that logistic-exposure estimates for individual levels of categorical explanatory variables agree closely with estimates obtained with Johnson's (1979) constant-survival estimator. Use of the logistic-exposure method to model time-specific effects of nest age and date on survival of Blue-winged Teal (Anas discors) and Mallard (A. platyrhynchos) nests gives results comparable to those reported by Klett and Johnson (1982). However, the logistic-exposure approach is less subjective and much easier to implement than Klett and Johnson's method. In addition, logistic-exposure survival rate estimates are constrained to the (0,1) interval, whereas Klett and Johnson estimates are not. When applied to a sample of Mountain Plover (Charadrius montanus) nests, the logistic-exposure method gives results either identical to, or similar to, those obtained with the nest survival model in program MARK (White and Burnham 1999). I illustrate how the combination of generalized linear models and information-theoretic techniques for model selection, along with commonly available statistical software, provides ornithologists with a powerful, easily used approach to analyzing nest success.","Shaffer, Terry L.; US Geol Survey, Prairie and No Wildlife Res Ctr, 8711 37th St SE, Jamestown, ND 58401, USA, USA.",terry_shaffer@usgs.gov,,,,,"Reproductive Biology; Zoology; Mathematics",0004-8038,,"Techniques; Reproduction","Anas discors; Anas platyrhynchos; Charadrius montanus; Icteria virens [Reproductive techniques /  / Unified approach for nest success analysis; evaluation].

Populations of greater sage-grouse have undergone long-term population declines. The sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) habitats on which sage-grouse depend have experienced extensive alteration and loss. Consequently, concerns raised for the conservation and management of greater sage-grouse and their habitats have resulted in petitions to list greater sage-grouse under the Endangered Species Act. In this report, we assessed the ecological status and potential factors that influenced greater sage-grouse and sagebrush habitats across their entire distribution. We used a large-scale approach to identify regional patterns of habitat, disturbance, land use practices, and population trends. We included literature spanning the last 200 years, landscape information dating back 100 years, and population data collected over the last 60 years. We described the primary issues that influenced greater sage-grouse and sagebrush habitats for an area that exceeded >2,000,000 km2 (>770,000 mi2) in size. To do this, we compiled, integrated, and analyzed data obtained from agencies and organizations within 14 states, >13 federal agencies, and 2 nations. We did not make recommendations or suggest management strategies. Rather, our goal was to present an unbiased and scientific documentation of dominant issues and their effects on greater sage-grouse populations and sagebrush habitats. We organized the Conservation Assessment into 4 main sections. In the first section, (Chapters 1 and 2), we present background information on greater sage-grouse and sagebrush habitats. We first introduce the factors that have contributed to widespread concern about conservation and management of greater sage-grouse and sagebrush habitats. We also describe the historical and legal administration as well as the current stewardship of sagebrush habitats. We then provide information on the conservation status of the species across its range-wide distribution. The second section (Chapters 3-5) provides information on the basic ecology of greater sage-grouse and sagebrush habitats. Our objectives were to develop the underlying foundation on which to assess information presented in the remainder of the document. In the third section (Chapters 6-12), we describe the current situation and trends in greater sage-grouse populations and the dominant factors that individually and cumulatively influence sagebrush habitats. In the fourth section (Chapter 13), we integrate the habitat and population trendinformation into a synthesis of the conservation status for greater sage-grouse and sagebrush ecosystems in western North America. Sagebrush Habitats Sagebrush ecosystems dominate approximately 480,000 km2 throughout western North America. Almost all (70%) of the existing sagebrush habitats are publicly owned and managed by a state or federal agency. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is the primary agency responsible for management of public lands containing sagebrush and has stewardship for 50% of the sagebrush habitats in the United States. Multiple use is the dominant management objective on almost all sagebrush habitats. Using a landscape perspective, we described the current status of sagebrush ecosystems (Chapter 5), trends within these systems (Chapter 7), and assessed impacts of anthropogenic change with respect to sage-grouse (Chapter 12). In most cases, we quantified the changes, the regional distribution of a factor, or the area influenced by the disturbance. The sagebrush biome has changed since settlement by Europeans. The current distribution, composition and dynamics, and disturbance regimes of sagebrush ecosystems have been altered by interactions among disturbance, land use, and invasion of exotic plants. The primary areas in which sagebrush habitats currently cover a large regional portion of the landscape were in central Washington; southeastern Oregon, northern Nevada, and southwestern Idaho; and central Wyoming. Landscapes were highly fragmented surrounding these regions. The number of fires and total area burned have increased across much of the sagebrush biome over the past 20 years (for which records are more reliable). Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and other exotic plant species have invaded lower elevation sagebrush habitats across much of the western part of the biome, further exacerbating the role of fire in these systems. At higher elevations, juniper (Juniperus spp.) and pinyon (Pinus spp.) woodland invasions into sagebrush habitats also have altered disturbance regimes. Land conversions were significant factors in separating habitat patches and fragmenting landscapes. Sage-grouse populations and sagebrush habitats that once were continuous now are separated by agriculture, urbanization, and development in the Snake River corridor in southern Idaho. Highly productive regions throughout the sagebrush biome that had deeper soils and higher precipitation have been converted to agriculture in contrast to the low elevation, more climates that characterized the larger landscapes still dominated by sagebrush. Agriculture currently influences 56% of the Conservation Assessment Area and 49% of the sagebrush habitats by fragmenting the landscape or facilitating movements of potential predators, such as common ravens (Corvus corax) on greater sage-grouse. Urbanization and increasing human populations throughout much of the sagebrush biome have resulted in an extensive network of roads, powerlines, railroads, and communications towers and an expanding influence on sagebrush habitats. Roads and other corridors promote the invasion of exotic plants, provide travel routes for predators, and facilitate human access into sagebrush habitats. Human-caused fires were closely related to existing roads. Less than 5% ofthe existing sagebrush habitats were >2.5 km from a mapped road. We evaluated the influence of livestock grazing primarily by the effect on habitatsresulting from management practices and habitat treatments. Numbers used by agencies (e.g., permitted Animal Unit Months) do not provide the information on management regime, habitat condition, or kind of livestock that can be used to assess the direct effects of livestock grazing at regional scales. Indices of seral stage used to relate current conditions to potential climax vegetation may not correlate with current understanding of the state-and-transition dynamics of sagebrush habitats. Over half of the public lands have not been surveyed relative to standards and guidelines established for those lands. Although large treatments designed to remove sagebrush and increase forage palatable to livestock no longer are conducted, habitat manipulations, water developments, and fencing still are done to manage livestock grazing. Widespread water developments throughout sagebrush habitats increased the amount of area that can be grazed. More than 1,000 km of fences have been constructed each year on public lands from 1996 to 2002; linear density of fences exceeded 2 km/km2 in some regions of the sagebrush biome. Fences provide perches for raptors, and modify access and movements by humans and livestock, thus exerting a new mosaic of disturbance and use on the landscape. Energy development for oil and gas influences sagebrush habitats by physical removal of habitat to construct well pads, roads, and pipelines. Indirect effects include habitat fragmentation and soil disturbance along roads, spread of exotic plants, and increased predation from raptors that have access to new perches for nesting and hunting. Noise disturbance from construction activities and vehicles also can disrupt sage-grouse breeding and nesting. Development of oil and gas resources will continue to be a significant influence on sagebrush habitats and sagegrouse because of advanced technological capability to access and develop reserves, high demand for oil and gas resources, and the large number of applications submitted (4,279 in fiscal year 2002) and approved each year. Some land use factors that we considered, such as military training, may have very intense effects on habitats but are restricted to relatively small regions across the entire sagebrush biome. In contrast, livestock grazing influences sagebrush ecosystems across the entire biome. The cumulative impacts of the disturbances and the interactions among disturbance regime, invasive species, and land use have the most significant influence on the trajectory of sagebrush ecosystems rather than influences attributed to any single source. Sage-grouse populations depend on relatively large expanses of sagebrush-dominated shrub steppe. However, the appropriate patch size needed for winter and breeding habitats used by greater sage-grouse is uncertain. It is likely that this patch size is not a fixed amount but depends on various factors including migration patterns and productivity of the habitat. Greater Sage-grouse Populations We describe the population biology (Chapter 3) and habitat needs (Chapter 4) of sagegrouse. Chapter 6 addresses sage-grouse databases, distribution, and population trends. We also review information on genetics (Chapter 8), hunting (Chapter 9), predation and disease (chapter 10) and current monitoring techniques (Chapter 11). Sage-grouse are a relatively long-lived species of upland game bird with low reproductive rates. Sage-grouse are entirely dependent on sagebrush habitats for successful reproduction and winter survival. Disease and hunting have generally not been major factors in sage-grouse population change but new information suggests West Nile Virus may pose a significant threat. All state and provincial fish and wildlife agencies monitor sage-grouse breeding populations annually, but monitoring techniques vary among areas and years both within and among agencies. This variation complicates attempts to understand grouse population trends and make comparisons among areas. However, virtually all states and provinces have increased monitoring efforts, especially over the last 10 years. Range-wide, population monitoring efforts increased by 737% between 1965 and 2003. The largest increases in effort occurred in Montana and Wyoming, two of the key sage-grouse states. Our analysis indicated that 2,637 leks are now censused annually. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of sage-grouse population changes throughout their range by accumulating and analyzing all available male counts at 5,585 leks identified sinceagencies began routine monitoring of this species. We applied several different techniques to evaluate greater sage-grouse populations in North America. These techniques included: 1) changes in the average and median number of males per active lek; 2) changes in the average andmedian number of males per lek (including leks that are inactive); 3) annual changes in the number of males attending leks monitored in consecutive years (rate of change data); 4) evaluation of spatial patterns of lek extirpation; 5) evaluation of patterns of range extirpation; and 6) delineation and evaluation of distinct breeding populations. The overall distribution of potential pre-settlement habitat was estimated to have been 1,200,483 km2 and the current distribution to be 668,412 km2. Approximately 56% of the potential pre-settlement distribution of habitat is currently occupied. The area currently occupied by sage-grouse is clearly smaller than was occupied in pre-settlement times. With most of the analysis of sage-grouse numbers, we focused on the 1965-2003 period. Although many states and provinces were collecting data prior to 1965, this 39-year range provided an opportunity to analyze data after a sample of leks had been identified and protocols for data collection had been established and implemented. Eleven of 13 (85%) states and provinces showed significant long-term declines in size of active leks. Similarly, eight of 10 states (80%) showed population declines over the same time frame. Two of 10 (20%) appeared to be stable or slightly increasing. Only California had an increase in both the population index and lek size. When sage-grouse breeding populations were delineated based on separation by distance and unsuitable habitat, trends for populations were similar to those of the states. Our analysis of the entire sage-grouse population indicated that sage-grouse declined dramatically from the 1960s to the mid-1980s and then tended to stabilize. This analysis indicated that these changes were often not density-independent. If trends characteristic of the 1960s through the mid-1980s continued, sage-grouse had a relatively high likelihood of being extirpated. However, thosetrends have not continued. As a result, data suggest sage-grouse populations in most areas have been relatively stable or slightly declining during the last 15-20 years. In many areas numbers increased between 1995 and 2003. Although there are areas that presently could be consideredpopulation strongholds, some populations are still declining rather precipitously in various portions of the species range. Annual rates of change suggest a long-term decline for greater sage-grouse in western North America and support the trend information obtained from lek attendance (males/lek) data. Sage-grouse populations declined at an overall rate of 2.0% per year from 1965 to 2003. From 1965-85, the population declined at an average rate of 3.5%. From 1986 to 2003, the population declined at a lower rate of 0.4% and fluctuated around a level that was 5% lower than the 2003population. A total of 50,566 male sage-grouse were counted on leks in 2003 throughout western North America. However, we are not optimistic about the future of sage-grouse because of long-term population declines coupled with continued loss and degradation of habitat and other factors (including West Nile Virus). Conclusion This report is the first detailed assessment of range-wide population and habitat data for greater sage-grouse. The information and analysis included in this report can be used to monitor future population changes and responses to management activities. As such, we hope that the information that we have presented now can be the foundation for increasing our understanding of the ecology of sagebrush- dominated landscapes and species that depend upon them","Connelly, J.W.; Idaho Department of Fish and Game, 83 W 215 N, Blackfoot, ID 83221, USA, USA.",JCsagegrouse@aol.com,,,"Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies",Cheyenne,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture",,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Documentation; Publications; Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; Canada","Centrocercus urophasianus [Disturbance by man / Urbanization / Sagebrush habitat & ecological status impact; Saskatchewan & USA] [Farming and agriculture / Livestock grazing / ] [Literature review /  / Ecological status; historical data] [Ecology /  / Sagebrush habitat ecological status & disturbance impact] [Scrub / Sagebrush ecological status / Conservation assessment] [Alberta /  / Population & habitat issues; ecosystem conservation status] [Saskatchewan /  / ] [USA / West / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Galliformes, Phasianidae","Centrocercus urophasianus (Phasianidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14108047718,,,,,2018/06/21

Ancient Harp Seal Hunters of Disko Bay. Subsistence and Settlement at the Saqqaq Culture Site Qeqertasussuk (2400-1400 BC), West Greenland. Meddelelser om Gronland, Man & Society Vol. 30. Copenhagen, Danish Polar Center, 2003. 189 pp. The Saqqaq Culture site Qeqertasussuk (2400-1400 BC) is situated in the south eastern corner of Disko Bay, West Greenland. The site was excavated between 1983 and 1987 by Qasigiannguit Museum. The stratified cultural deposits are exceptionally well preserved by permafrost and yielded hundreds of thousands of animal bones, feathers, plant remains, insect remains, wooden implements, and a wealth of other organic refuse as well as stone tools, house ruins, stone set fireplaces and other traces of habitation. In order to understand the life conditions of the inhabitants at Qeqertasussuk, a comparative survey of the historic distribution, density and availability of the living resources in the area is undertaken. This resource model is then evaluated against the paleo-environmental data. Also, comparative ethnohistorical and ethnographic data on the exploitation of the living resources in the area is presented. Subsistence and subsistence change at Qeqertasussuk is studied through a comprehensive analysis of the faunal material that consists of more than 200,000 animal bones. Quantitative methods are supplemented by detailed studies of seasonality and age composition of the hunting bag. Forty three species of animals are represented. Harp seal and ringed seal represent the most important game, but sea birds such as fulmar, Bruennich's guillemot, and little auk also play a significant role in the subsistence economy. Fish, especially Atlantic Cod, have been caught and remains of large whales indicate that these animals were utilized, but it can not be decided whether they were actively hunted. Most of the game was taken close by the site, however finds of caribou indicate that inland caribou hunting was undertaken and that Qeqertasussuk was part of a larger subsistence-settlement-system. Several species of plants were also utilized. Temporal changes in the composition of the faunal material indicate that significant changes occur in the subsistence at Qeqertasusuk. Four phases are identified: (1) Basecamp period I (2400-2100 BC). A pioneer phase where the site is used as a year-round base camp with more than 90% of the biomass being harvested within an area of approximately 80 km2, (2) Base-camp period II (2100-1900 BC), which seems to be the period of most intensive use and where new methods (probably netting) of harp seal hunting are introduced, (3) Hunting camp period (1900-1700 BC), where the site becomes more specialized and more seasonal with a focus on spring-summer hunting for harp seals, (4) high activity period (1700-1400 BC) indications of continued heavy sea mammal hunting. The site is abandoned around 1400 BC. The cau causes of the abandonment of Qeqertasussuk is discussed and the impact of the general cooling around 1500 BC on key resources such as harp seal and capelin is highlighted.","Meldgaard, Morten; North Atlantic House, Strandgade 91, 1401 Copenhagen K, Denmark, Denmark.",,,,,,"Zoology; Nutrition & Dietetics",0106-1062,,"Animals and man; Marine zones","Phoca groenlandica [Food for man /  / Ancient human hunting activities; zooarchaeological evidence & ethnohistorical interpretations] [Arctic Ocean / Greenland, Disko Bay / ].","Carnivores; Chordates; Mammals; Pinnipeds; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Mammalia, Carnivora, Phocidae","Phoca groenlandica (Phocidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14009052250,,,,,2018/06/21

The evidence shows that El Nino affects seabirds essentially by reducing their food base. Fish- and fish + squid-eating seabirds generally decrease their population abundance, likely as a combined result of adult mortality (famine) and reproductive failure. Omnivorous seabirds negotiate El Nino periods without important declines, while those including fishery wastes in their diets show minimal changes or even increase their populations during such periods. Waterbirds seem to benefit from precipitation that accompanies El Nino, which enlarges their habitats (waterbodies). Increased habitat affords more opportunities for installing adequate nests and obtaining enough food. Finally, landbirds are affected by El Nino-driven precipitation, which fires up primary productivity (aboveground plant biomass and seed crop), which in turn fuels arthropod and mammal increases. Granivorous birds react promptly to peaks in seed output, while insectivores respond similarly to arthropod abundance. Carnivorous birds take somewhat longer to react to increases in mammal populations. I conclude that (a) Food shortage may be an important key factor for bird populations, but its effects depend on diet breadth, prey switching, and life history parameters; (b) Predictable (seasonal) patterns of productivity may determine distribution and abundance of resident birds, but variations imposed by unpredictable occurrences of El Nino and La Nina may determine the presence and abundance of migratory birds; (c) The dichotomy El Nino versus La Nina or other ""normal"" years may be artificial; (d) Long-term monitoring is needed to understand the connection between climate and birds.","Jaksic, Fabian M.; Center for Advanced Studies in Ecology & Biodiversity, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile, Chile.",fjaksic@bio.puc.cl,"jaksic, Fabian/G-1705-2014",,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",1075-4377,,"Documentation; Publications; Ecology; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Marine zones","Aves [Literature review /  / El Nino effects on ecology; Pacific Basin] [Ecology /  / El Nino effects; review] [Climate and weather / El Nino / Effect on ecology] [Water movements /  / ] [Land zones / Southeast Pacific Basin / ] [Pacific Ocean / South east / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14110060324,,,,,2018/06/21

Although much is known about deer diet, and about takahe diet in the alpine areas they currently occupy, little is known about takahe diet in the forests and even less on what the forest understorey was like before deer invasion. Deer and takahe share the Murchison Mountains forest habitat, particularly in winter when snowfall forces the birds into the forest for food and shelter. This study uses high-resolution pollen analyses of short peaty cores from under the beech forest canopy in the Chester Burn catchment in the Murchison Mountains, to show how the forest understorey has changed significantly over at least the last 1000 years, but particularly over the last 50 years since deer invasion. In terms of preferred taxa in the takahe diet, over the last 50 years sedges, grasses, and Celmisia spp. have all become less common than they were in the past, and some species of ferns such as Polystichum vestitum and Hypolepis millefolium are strikingly more abundant. Present-day takahe diet in the Murchison Mountains may not be typical of their diet in the past; they may have fed in the forest habitat more often when there were more bush grasses available. Deer browsing is the most likely cause of these relatively recent changes in forest understorey composition. A depleted understorey and ground flora may limit takahe winter diet, and affect the condition of the birds at the end of winter, and their survival or reproductive capability.","Wilmshurst, Janet M.; Landcare Research PO Box 69, LIncoln 8152, New Zealand, New Zealand.",wilmshurst@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Wilmshurst, Janet/C-2209-2009","Wilmshurst, Janet/0000-0002-4474-8569",,,"Nutrition & Dietetics; Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry",1173-2946,,"Nutrition; Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia","Porphyrio hochstetteri [Feeding behaviour / Winter feeding grounds / Long term changes; pollen analysis; forest] [Habitat utilization /  / ] [Forest and woodland / Beech forest / Peat cores; implications for winter feeding ground changes] [New Zealand / South Island, Fiordland / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Gruiformes, Rallidae","Porphyrio hochstetteri (Rallidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14001004064,,,,,2018/06/21

Consistent with global trends, Australia has warmed [approximately]0.8[degree]C over the last century with minimum temperatures warming faster than maxima. There have been significant regional trends in rainfall with the northern, eastern and southern parts of the continent receiving greater rainfall and the western region receiving less. Higher rainfall has been associated with an increase in the number of rain days and heavy rainfall events. Sea surface temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef have increased and are associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of coral bleaching and mortality. Sea level rises in Australia have been regionally variable, and considerably less than the global average. Snow cover and duration have declined significantly at some sites in the Snowy Mountains. CSIRO projections for future climatic changes indicate increases in annual average temperatures of 0.4-2.0[degree]C by 2030 (relative to 1990) and 1.0-6.0[degree]C by 2070. Considerable uncertainty remains as to future changes in rainfall, El Nino Southern Oscillation events and tropical cyclone activity. Overall increases in potential evaporation over much of the continent are predicted as well as continued reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover. Future changes in temperature and rainfall are predicted to have significant impacts on most vegetation types that have been modelled to date, although the interactive effect of continuing increases in atmospheric CO2 has not been incorporated into most modelling studies. Elevated CO2 will most likely mitigate some of the impacts of climate change by reducing water stress. Future impacts on particular ecosystems include increased forest growth, alterations in competitive regimes between C3 and C4 grasses, increasing encroachment of woody shrubs into arid and semiarid rangelands, continued incursion of mangrove communities into freshwater wetlands, increasing frequency of coral bleaching, and establishment of woody species at increasingly higher elevations in the alpine zone. Modelling of potential impacts on specific Australian taxa using bioclimatic analysis programs such as BIOCLIM consistently predicts contraction and/or fragmentation of species' current ranges. The bioclimates of some species of plants and vertebrates are predicted to disappear entirely with as little as 0.5-1.0[degree]C of warming. Australia lacks the long-term datasets and tradition of phenological monitoring that have allowed the detection of climate-change-related trends in the Northern Hemisphere. Long-term changes in Australian vegetation can be mostly attributed to alterations in fire regimes, clearing and grazing, but some trends, such as encroachment of rainforest into eucalypt woodlands, and establishment of trees in subalpine meadows probably have a climatic component. Shifts in species distributions toward the south (bats, birds), upward in elevation (alpine mammals) or along changing rainfall contours (birds, semiarid reptiles), have recently been documented and offer circumstantial evidence that temperature and rainfall trends are already affecting geographic ranges. Future research directions suggested include giving more emphasis to the study of climatic impacts and understanding the factors that control species distributions, incorporating the effects of elevated CO2 into climatic modelling for vegetation and selecting suitable species as indicators of climate-induced change.","Hughes, Lesley; Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University, North Ryde, NSW, 2109, Australia, Australia.",,"Ross, Donald/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald/0000-0002-8659-3833; Hughes, Lesley/0000-0003-0313-9780",,,"Zoology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",1442-9985,,"Documentation; Publications; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia","Animalia [Literature review /  / Climate change predicted impacts on ecosystems & native species] [Climate and weather /  / review] [Temperature /  / ] [Australia /  / ].",,Animalia,Animalia.,10.1046/j.1442-9993.2003.01300.x,ZOOREC:ZOOR13900062980,,,,,2018/06/21

The model is represented mathematically as a discrete-time, stochastic compartment model based on difference equations with a time interval of 1 week. In the model, sheep graze through sage grouse breeding habitat during spring and fall, and different portions of the area can burn at different frequencies, creating a habitat mosaic of burned and unburned areas. The model was evaluated by examining predictions of (1) growth of sagebrush canopy cover after fire, (2) seasonal dynamics of grass and forb biomass under historical environmental conditions, and (3) sage grouse population dynamics associated with selected sagebrush canopy covers. Simulated changes in sagebrush canopy cover following fire correspond well with qualitative reports of long-term trends, simulated seasonal dynamics of herbaceous biomass correspond well with field data, and simulated responses of sage grouse population size and age structure to changing sagebrush canopy cover correspond well to qualitative field observations. Simulation results suggest that large fires occurring at high frequencies may lead to the extinction of sage grouse populations, whereas fires occurring at low frequencies may benefit sage grouse if burned areas are small and sheep grazing is absent. Sheep grazing may contribute to sage grouse population decline, but is unlikely to cause extinction under fire regimes that are favorable to sage grouse.","Grant, W.E.; Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, 77843-2258, USA, USA.",,,,,,"Agriculture; Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0304-3800,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA","Centrocercus urophasianus [Farming and agriculture / Sheep grazing / Seasonal population dynamics effects; model] [Population dynamics /  / Seasonal; fire & sheep grazing effects] [Scrub / Sagebrush rangelands / Seasonal population dynamics] [Fire /  / ] [Idaho / South east / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Galliformes, Phasianidae","Centrocercus urophasianus (Phasianidae).",10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00382-4,ZOOREC:ZOOR13900048497,,,,,2018/06/21

In order to design management plans to prevent large wildfires while preserving biodiversity, understanding of the ways in which birds respond to these fires is required. We investigated the spatial variability of both avifauna and habitat structure in three zones: unburnt, burnt in 1982, and burnt in 1994. The habitat structure of the unburnt zone was the most variable spatially. However, bird species composition between sampling points was very homogeneous in space. In contrast, the bird communities inhabiting burnt zones were more spatially heterogeneous. This pattern was caused by distinct specific responses to variations in habitat structure. Open-space species responded to small changes in habitat structure with large changes in local abundance, whereas the response of forest species to these structural variations was much less. We suggest that land managers should select specific zones with limited vegetation recovery within large burnt areas and maintain them as open space to keep combustibility low and provide an appropriate habitat for several open space species that are of conservation concern.","Herrando, Sergi; Catalan Institute of Ornithology, C./Girona 168, E-5, 08037, Barcelona, Spain, Spain.",,"Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009","Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457",,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Zoology",0019-1019,,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Ecology; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Aves [Habitat management /  / Burnt habitat] [Community structure /  / Spatial heterogeneity; influence of fire; management implications] [Distribution within habitat /  / Spatial heterogeneity of communities] [Fire /  / Influence on spatial heterogeneity of communities] [Spain / Garraf Natural Park / Fire influence on spatial heterogeneity of communities].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",10.1046/j.1474-919X.2003.00155.x,ZOOREC:ZOOR13900036749,,,,,2018/06/21

The region has had a Mediterranean climate possibly since the Oligocene onset of aridity and charcoal deposits indicate recurrent fire since at least the late Pliocene (2.6 Ma BP). The Cainozoic fossil record shows a correlated decline of fire sensitive rainforest to almost complete extirpation and replacement by sclerophyll vegetation. South-west WA is characterized by a large number of rare species, especially of plants, presenting a significant opportunity to explore the relationship between fire and rarity. Current theory and empirical studies demonstrate that there are many causes of rarity. Thus, sophisticated experimentation is required to distinguish the effects of fire from other causes. This is exemplified by nonsprouter plants with a short-lived seedbank; these are more vulnerable to fire regimes than sprouters but the same could be said for their responses to other disturbances such as drought, floods, grazing, frosts and severe windstorms. Few critical experiments discriminating between such multiple causes of rarity have been published. Some interesting correlations between fire and rarity have emerged from descriptive studies of selected taxa and a limited number of habitats in south-west WA. For example, several palaeo-endemic plants and animals and some rare birds persist only in vegetation where fire is very infrequent, whereas the greatest concentration of rare and neo-endemic plant species is in south-west kwongan and mallee, which experiences relatively infrequent fire. The proportion and/or dominance of fire sensitive nonsprouter plants is highest in habitats that provide fire refuges such as granite outcrops or offshore islands. These patterns may be a consequence of varying fire regimes but other explanations cannot beexcluded based on available evidence. Experimental data are limited to testing the hypothesis that some rare plant species are fire opportunists that persist as seeds in the soil between fires. The relationship between fire and rarity is likely to be complex and we recommend further research to improve understanding of the significance of fire to management of rare species.","Yates, Colin J.; Science Division, Department of Conservation and Land Management, Locked Bag 104, Bentley Delivery Centre, WA 6983, Australia, Australia.",coliny@calm.wa.gov.au,"Yates, Colin/B-5972-2011; Hopper, Stephen/G-4222-2012",,"Backhuys Publishers",Leiden,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",,90-5782-131-1,"Ecology; Population dynamics; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia; Australia","Vertebrata [Population size /  / Rare species; frequency of fires relationship] [Fire /  / Frequency; occurrence of rare species relationship] [Western Australia / South west / Fire frequency].","Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata","Vertebrata (Chordata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR13900041219,,,,,2018/06/21

Volume 1.",,,,1-169,2003,2003,,,,English,2,29,"0.1 Background to the project Two subspecies of Great Cormorant (hereafter 'Cormorant') occur in Europe: the 'Atlantic' subspecies Phalacrocorax carbo carbo and the 'Continental subspecies P. c. sinensis. Latest (1995) breeding estimates for carbo are of 40,000 pairs, mostly on the coasts of Norway, UK, Ireland and northern France. The sinensis population (1995) is estimated to be over 150,000 pairs throughout the region, a dramatic increase since the 1960s. It is likely that the species is now more numerous across Europe than ever before. The geographical range of these populations has also expanded with Cormorants returning to some areas after a long absence and also moving into previously unoccupied area. The reasons for such expansion are unclear but possible causal factors include a ""non-limiting food supply"" and protective legislation, particularly EEC Directive 79/409 on the Conservation of Wild Birds. Cormorants are generalist fish-eating predators taking a wide variety of species in shallow coastal seas, running and standing freshwaters, and both traditional/extensive and intensive aquaculture systems. In almost all countries where Cormorants occur, their increasing numbers and geographical spread has led to a growing number of conflicts with commercial fisheries and recreational angling interests. 0.2 Aims and set up of the project Although there are several national and/or international Cormorant management plans aimed at reducing such conflicts with Cormorants, there is no co-ordinated implementation at the international level and, in practice, and certainly for many affected by the 'Cormorant problem', these plans appear ineffectual. The REDCAFE project (December 2000 - November 2001) was designed to complement and develop previous work through synthesising available information on Cormorant conflicts and aspects of Cormorant ecology leading to them, through identifying methods of reducing the current Europe-wide conflict between Cormorants and fisheries interests and collating expert evaluations of their practical use. The project also addressed a specific Cormorant-fisheries conflict case study involving recreational angling in S. E. England. REDCAFE took a novel approach to delivering solutions to these problems by, for the first time, bringing together avian, fisheries and social scientists and many other relevant 'stakeholders' to discuss and report on these issues in a rigorous, coordinated and equitable manner. With these aims in mind, a pan-European network of project participants was established comprising 49 people representing 43 organisations from 25 countries and including seven main stakeholder groups: commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, aquaculturists, avian/wetland conservationists, fisheries scientists, avian ecologists and social scientists. 0.3 Cormorant conflicts with fisheries Various stakeholder groups often hold different values and, consequently, have different preferences for the use of limited natural resources: conflict is thus often inevitable. In addition to addressing environmental conflicts from a biological perspective, the social and cultural dimensions of human society that influence such conflicts also demand equal attention. Successful conflict management depends on conflicting parties opening communication channels and developing networks of trust for effective participation, dialogue and collaboration. Thus, wherever possible, information for the synthesis of Cormorant conflicts was provided by stakeholders affected directly by Cormorants. The provision and collation of information for the present conflict synthesis formed the basis for REDCAFE's pan-European dialogue with stakeholders. This process also highlighted the difficulties involved in creating and managing dialogue between stakeholders from many countries and diverse backgrounds and these issues are discussed.0.4 Cases of Cormorant conflicts REDCAFE sampled Cormorant conflicts in 24 countries and collated information on 235 conflict cases. Cormorant conflicts were reported from a wide variety of habitats and fishery types: rivers, lakes, freshwater aquaculture ponds, coasts, and coastal aquaculture sites. This demonstrated the widespread geographical distribution of conflicts. Conflicts were reported by four different stakeholder groups representing recreational, commercial and nature conservation interests and covered a wide variety of fishery types, suggesting that the nature of conflicts also differed on a geographic scale. 0.5 Habitat features of conflict cases Two species of cormorant were recorded in conflicts: both races of the Great Cormorant and the Pygmy Cormorant (P. Pygmeus). The geographical distributions of both species, as recorded in conflicts, followed closely their known breeding and/or wintering distributions. Cormorant conflicts were reported mostly from lower altitudes (< 500m). Within river systems, Cormorant conflicts on a pan-European scale showed similar distribution patterns. They were very much restricted to the lower and middle reaches, and hence relatively wide (i.e. 10-50m) stretches, of rivers. Similar, restricted distribution patterns were clear for conflict cases on the coast which were restricted to those localities with access to shallow (< 50m deep) inshore coastal water. Overall, most conflict cases were reported on nutrient-rich (i.e. eutrophic) waters, particularly freshwater aquaculture ponds, lakes and coasts, supporting the idea that Cormorant distribution is, in part at least, determined by the nutrient status of these waters.0.6 Conflicts in time and space Information on the seasonality of Cormorant conflicts showed patterns that fitted closely with the known seasonal movements of birds across Europe. As a consequence, the broad pan-European picture of Cormorant conflicts has three elements. First, winter (October-March) conflicts in those countries where birds overwinter, either towards the north west or south east. Second, summer (April-September) conflicts, presumably involving breeding birds, in the Netherlands and almost all countries bounding the Baltic. Third, conflicts throughout the year in the 'centre' of Europe (Denmark, Germany and the Czech Republic), presumably involving both breeding birds and others overwintering there from the north. Cormorant abundance increased with water surface area on a pan-European scale for stillwater lakes, freshwater aquaculture ponds and coasts and water surface area explained 56% of the variation in maximum Cormorant numbers across these habitats. There was no such relationship on rivers based on the information available for this synthesis. Such apparent differences require further investigation, particularly as information suggests that average Cormorant density on rivers is significantly higher than that in other habitats. 0.7 Conflicts: fish Throughout Europe, there were strong associations between particular fish groups reported in conflict cases and particular habitat and fishery types. A wide variety of fish species were reported in relation to coastal conflicts. Cyprinids and salmonids were the main groups of fish recorded by stakeholders in relation to Cormorant conflicts on rivers. Similarly cyprinids, especially Carp, plus some salmonids, Perch and Pike were involved in conflicts at freshwater aquaculture ponds. Many conflicts were reported at Carp ponds throughout Europe and these sites are considered highly attractive to Cormorants in places such as the Czech Republic, Bavaria, southern Germany, and France. A small group of fishes including mullets, sea basses and sea breams were involved in conflicts at coastal, often extensive lagoon, aquaculture sites of southern Europe. 0.8 Conflicts: finance Financial information was provided by fishery-related stakeholders for 105 conflict cases, approximately 45% of those recorded in the present synthesis. Nature conservation stakeholders did not provide any financial information in relation to any of the conflict cases they recorded. Fishery stakeholders provided information on the annual financial turnover in their fishery system and the turnover loss due to Cormorants as 'actual' figures or as 'estimates'(derived by unknown means), thus care must be taken when interpreting the financial information collected in this synthesis. Nevertheless, the 105 conflict cases gave a cumulative total for annual turnover of about 154 million euro and associated losses to Cormorants were given at about 17 million euro, an overall loss of 11%. There were significant differences in the scale of financial losses reported by the relevant stakeholders for different habitatsand fishery types. All three fishery stakeholder groups independently were consistent in their views on relatively low financial losses due to Cormorants, recording average values of 9-12% of annual turnover. Around 2% of aquaculturist, 13% of commercial freshwater fishermen and 31% of commercial coastal fishermen recorded losses greater then 50% of the annual financial turnover in their fishery. In contrast, recreational anglers recorded considerably higher financial losses due to Cormorants, averaging 57% of annual turnover. Furthermore, in 43% of cases, anglers recorded financial losses greater then 50% of the annual turnover in their fishery. Although the disparity between commercial and recreational stakeholders' perceptions of financial losses due to Cormorants was clear from the information provided, the explanation forit was not and requires further investigation. 0.9 Conflict issues Nine specific conflict issues were most commonly cited as being major ones forstakeholders. For both aquaculturists and commercial fishermen, the issue of reduced catches was most important whilst for both recreational anglers and nature conservationists the most important issue was reduced fish stock through lowered production. Recreational stakeholders also most frequently reported conflicts over reduced catches and effects on fish population dynamics and community structure, an issue that was also important to nature conservationists. Both aquaculturists and commercial fishermen were concerned over loss of earnings fromthe fishery, the former stakeholders cited conflicts over loss of stocked fish and the latter ones cited conflicts over reduced stock through lowered production. Finally, nature conservationists also frequently recorded concerns over loss of juvenile fish and lowered recruitment, scaring/shooting disturbance, drowning of Cormorants in fishing gear and damage to vegetation and landscape. Thus, although stakeholder groups frequently shared concerns over specific major conflict issues, some concerns were specific to particular groups. Most importantly, nature conservationists cited broader 'environmental' issues more frequently than did the three fishery-related stakeholder groups. The conflict synthesis showed considerable, and consistent, similarities between the opinions of both income-producing stakeholder groups involved in fisheries. Although recreational anglers shared many of the concerns of these other fishery-related stakeholder groups, they also recordedsome different major conflict issues. However, the biggest differences were between fishery-related stakeholders and nature conservationists. Nature conservationists, in general, were most concerned with wider (i.e. 'environmental') conflict issues. 0.10 Information sources Stakeholders provided over 3, 500 records of the type of information they used to inform themselves about Cormorant conflict issues. Although most records were categorised as 'popular', this category included a range of diverse sources. Overall, only 15% of information sources used by stakeholders were assigned to the scientific literature. For all stakeholder groups, scientific literature was the least frequentlyrecorded information source. The importance of 'popular' sources of information to all four stakeholder groups contributing to this synthesis was thus clear. For several specific conflict issues, different stakeholder groups claimed to be informed by scientific literature yet considered the magnitude of such conflicts to be very different. It is clear that there is a need for better dissemination of scientific information and forbetter understanding of the limitations and implications of scientific research. 0.11 Cormorant ecology: factors leading to conflicts Any successful resolution, or management, of the conflicts between Cormorants and fisheries interests on a pan-European scale must include careful consideration of the best available biological information on Cormorant populations throughout the region. REDCAFE thus synthesised aspects of Cormorant ecology that lead conflicts. Relevant factors were categorised into four main themes: (1) general ecology and habitat features, (2) migration and the annual cycle, (3) fish communities and Cormorant diet, and (4) Cormorant ecology and impact at fisheries. 0.12 Ecology synthesis in relation to Cormorants Cormorant ecology has been well studied. With respect to numbers, distribution, migratory movements, foraging behaviour and diet it is one of the best known wild bird in Europe. It is clear that Cormorants are opportunistic generalist fish predators. As a result of their broad ecological requirements, they do have the potential for considerable conflicts at specific fisheries. This is because, as well as flexibility in feeding site choice, generalist predators like the Cormorant could have considerable impact on their preferred prey species because their numbers are buffered to some extent against declines in these prey by their ability to switch to other types. Theopportunistic nature of its foraging behaviour and its great adaptability to a variety of habitats, both freshwater and marine, makes the Cormorant an exceptionally successful species which is currently probably more abundant in western Europe than ever before and still expanding numerically in eastern Europe. This expansion in numbers and area is the result of European wide protective measures, eutrophication, the reduction of pesticides in the environment and alterations of water systems such as dams, sluices which facilitate foraging. 0.13 Ecology synthesis in relation to fish Fish species eaten by Cormorants are, for the most part, common, widespread species. The heavy fishery pressure exerted by people in many water systems in Europe has resulted in a shift in size distribution towards the smaller classes, which enhances Cormorant foraging conditions. Fewer large predatory fish are now present in many European waters because of over-fishing. This enables populations of smaller fish species to increase, which in turn favours the Cormorant. Eutrophication of water bodies has altered fish community - (and size -) structure again increasing the possibilities for Cormorants to exploit larger densities of small prey fishes. 0.14 Ecology synthesis in relation to damage at fisheries Fish species eaten by Cormorants are, for the most part, common, widespread species. The heavy fishery pressure exerted in many water systems in Europe has resulted in a shift in size distribution towards the smaller classes, which enhances Cormorant foraging conditions. Reduction of eutrophication will decrease Cormorant numbers through reduction in the carrying capacity of fishing waters. Restoration of waterways, aiming at a greater connectivity, will favour fish populations and reduce predation risk. In fish farming areas, specific knowledge on prey detection underwater may help to reduce predation of small fish. Enlarging stocked fish above the rangecommonly eaten by Cormorants (i.e.>500 g) may act to reduce the damage caused by birds. Periods of large-scale Cormorant movements through Europe (e.g. March and October) require extra management attention to avoid the establishment of any tradition to visit stocked water bodies or fish farm areas. A combination of ecological, demographic, climatological and geographical data into a GIS based Decision SupportSystem may help to predict future Cormorant 'problems' and reduce current ones through integrated management. 0.15 Potential Cormorant management tools Potential Cormorant management tools were assessed on two spatial/temporal scales: long-term control of European Cormorants at the population level and shorter-term site-specific control measures. The synthesis aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of potential Cormorant management tools. It provides a review of population modelling and a synthesis of site-specific techniques and actions used against Cormorants. The synthesis also includes semi-quantitative information on the 'usefulness' of techniques in relation to their effectiveness (i.e. how long a technique works for), practicability (i.e how easy the technique is to use), acceptability (i.e. how the technique is viewed by both stakeholders and the general public) and costs. REDCAFE participants provided information for this synthesis, often afterdiscussions with local stakeholders over their experiences. 0.16 Cormorant population modelling The most well-supported Cormorant population model scenarios using current information indicated three important things. First, that the effect of culls at the 1998-9 level (i.e. 17, 000 birds shot) was limited. Second, that increasing the annual cull to 30, 000 birds would have limited effect at the population level. Third, that shooting 50, 000 birds per year was predicted to lead to population extinction in 20-40 years. The modelling approach also demonstrated that increasing the number of culled Cormorants was risky because once the compensatory power of the population is overcome, it will inevitably decline towards extinction if the cull is unchecked. One general inference was that culls should be planned so that they become the most powerful density-dependent mechanism affecting the target population. This strategy would require a well parameterised population model and should also be accompanied by monitoring programmes. Even though Cormorant population control through culling is feasible it may not be the most efficient, economical or ethical way of limiting Cormorant damage to fisheries, and other interests, across Europe. Research suggests several limitations to culling and these are discussed. 0.17 Relatively large-scale Cormorant control The synthesis of general information on actions against Cormorants included information from all 25 countries covered by the REDCAFE project. Some form of national or regional Cormorant management plan was in effect in 11 of these countries. A further four countries had a legal regulation in effect that allowed Cormorant culling. Overall, such a regulation was in effect in 14 counties. In a further 6 countries licences could be obtained for the limited killing of Cormorants at particular sites as a aid to scaring. In most countries (84%), there was either no killing of Cormorants or it was uncoordinated. Few countries (16%) had a co-ordinated culling programme. Few countries (or regions therein) provided either financialcompensation for fish losses caused by Cormorants or financial aid for Cormorant exclosures or scaring programmes (16% and 24%, respectively). Of the 25 countries, ten recorded the destruction or disturbance of Cormorant colonies in recent (i.e. 1990-2002) years, with 102 colonies reported to be affected annually. As a result a minimum of 5,194 Cormorant nests were reported to be destroyed annually in fivecountries. Between 600-650 Cormorant nestlings were also reported to be killed in three countries. Numbers of both nests and nestlings destroyed were known to be under-recorded. Around 10, 000 adult Cormorants (of the 'Atlantic' carbo race) are hunted legally as game in Norway outside the breeding season. During this time of year, a further 18 countries reported killing Cormorants (mostly the 'Continental'sinensis race) as a control measure. Here, between 41-43, 000 adult birds (including young birds in their first winter) were reported to be killed annually. However, given the unprecedented number of Cormorants killed in France in 2001/02, and the fact that many of the birds killed were juveniles in their first winter, it is more appropriate to say that between 41-43, 000 fully grown birds were killed in 2001/02. A further4,598 Cormorants were reported to be killed annually during the breeding season in six countries. However, this was known to be an underestimate. Over 248 night roosts were reported to be destroyed or damaged annually in nine countries. This figure was a considerable underestimate because roosts were also known to have been destdestroyed or disturbed in three other countries. 0.18 Site-specific actions: non aquaculture habitats A total of 33 site-specific techniques used regularly to reduce the effects of Cormorants at feeding sites were recorded for 16 countries. However, only three techniques were used regularly at all five feeding habitats (small rivers, large rivers, small stillwaters, very large waterbodies, aquaculture): the use of live ammunition to scare birds, shooting birds to reinforce other forms of scaring, and shooting birds to reduce their numbers at specific sites. Eleven techniques were recorded in regular use on small and large rivers. Only two of these appeared to be effective in the long-term (i.e. years), although both of them (improving fish habitat quality and submerged fishrefuges) were primarily related to the management of fishes rather than to that of Cormorants. Several other techniques appeared to be effective on rivers for months. Eight techniques were recorded in regular use on small lakes. All appeared to be effective only for days, the exceptions being the use of two audio techniques (pyrotechnics/fireworks and live ammunition) and two lethal techniques (shooting to scare or to kill limited numbers of birds). Ten techniques were recorded in regular use on very large water bodies (lakes and coasts). Three audio techniques and three lethal Cormorant control techniques appeared effective over the time-scale of weeks to months. Other techniques appeared effective for only days. 0.19 Site-specific actions: aquaculture habitats Twenty eight techniques were recorded in regular use at aquaculture facilities. Eight bird-proof barrier techniques appeared to be effective for up to years, although in some cases the same techniques were reported only to be effective for days. Alterations to fish stocking at aquaculture facilities appeared to be effective for up to months, as did the use of two audio techniques (pyrotechnics/fireworks and live ammunition) and three forms of lethal Cormorant control. 0.20 Cormorant management tools: conclusions Very few techniques were, according to the experience in 16 countries covered by the synthesis, considered to be effective in the long-term (i.e. years). These long-term techniques appear to fall into two broad categories. First, those involving the alteration of fish habitat at some 'natural' rivers and lakes. Second, those involving the erection of various bird proof barriers (e.g. narrow mesh enclosures, wires, submerged anti-predator nets) at aquaculture facilities (both ponds and net pens/cages). Many other techniques used regularly can be effective for up to months at some sites. However, the same techniques were reported to be effective for only days, or not at all, at other sites. Overall, the practicability, acceptability and costs of all techniques used regularly were highly variable. The most likely explanation for such variation is that it is related to site-specific features. These are likely to be twofold. First, the physical location of the site, its size, the type of fishery, the number of Cormorants involved etc. Second, the scale of the Cormorant 'problem' in financial terms. 0.21 Cormorant-fishery conflict resolution: a case study REDCAFE analysed a specific Cormorant-fishery conflict case study, in the form of a three-day Workshop designed to give project participants and local stakeholders the opportunity to share their knowledge and experience. This case study also formed the basis for evaluating REDCAFE progress and the applicability of the 'REDCAFE experience' to the real world. Furthermore, it allowed participants to explore whether the project's concept of equitable stakeholder involvement was a useful framework for future Cormorant-fisheries conflict resolution elsewhere in Europe. An opportunity arose to link the project to a 'live' conflict case study - that of Cormorants and recreational fisheries in the Lea Valley, Hertfordshire, south-east England. Importantly, selecting the Lea Valley Cormorant-fishery issue also allowed REDCAFE to link with Fisheries Action Plans, and the government agency-led process being developed to address and prioritise issues affecting inland fisheries at a catchment scale. The REDCAFE case study was placed in perspective through reviews and discussions of values and dialogue in conflict resolution and management, Fisheries Action Plans in the UK, and the Lea Valley case study area. 0.22 Lea Valley Workshop Workshop delegates comprised 36 REDCAFE participants, representing 20 countries, and 16 stakeholders, representing 11 institutions or organisations. Successful conflict management depends on conflicting parties opening communication channels anddeveloping networks of trust for effective collaboration and dialogue. REDCAFE thus worked closely during the Workshop with a facilitator skilled in environmental conflict management. The Workshop began the process of approaching the numerous environmental conflicts apparently affecting the Lea Valley. Although time was short, many important issues were addressed and developed, including conflict management experiences from both continental Europe and the Lea Valley itself. Several key issues arose from discussions with local stakeholders. First, many believe that the main problem facing the Lea Valley is an economic one. Economic measures of angling 'effort' (i.e. day and season ticket sales and angling club membership) have all fallen considerably in the last decade. This has had a knock-on effect on the local economy. Second, several lines of evidence suggest that many fish stocks and/or catches there have declined dramatically. The perception is that most small fish - both small individuals and small species - have declined, whilst there are still some fisheries containing large individuals (i.e. 'specimen' fish). There is also some evidence that the distribution of fish has changed within the Lea Valley. Third, thelack of fish, and the related economic decline, has local conservation implications, social implications, and planning and policy implications. These are all discussed. 0.23 Workshop progress Key local issues were summarised in an initial 'problem statement' for the Lea Valley. Substantial progress was made in identifying critical scientific and social issues in cormorant/fisheries conflicts. Cormorant-fishery conflicts play a part in the mix of issues facing the Lea Valley but one important outcome of the Workshop was to situate these conflicts in a broader social, economic and ecological context. Local stakeholders made considerable progress where escalating conflicts had become significant obstacles in the Lea Valley. REDCAFE participants had the opportunity to explore part of a conflict management process that related directly to manyCormorant-fishery conflicts across Europe. The Workshop process enabled significant progress to be made in several areas: (a) linking scientific processes and data to realworld social issues, (b) agreeing initial problem statements, stakeholders and needs, (c) identifying relevant agencies, people and pathways for action planning, and (d) identifying research priorities and dissemination actions that link the need for strong,evidence-based scientific knowledge with social and strategic planning needs. 0.24 Workshop evaluations A specific element of the REDCAFE project was to evaluate the conflict resolution Workshop in terms of determining whether the project's concept of equitable stakeholder involvement was a useful framework for future Cormorant-fisheries conflict resolution elsewhere in Europe. To this end, the Facilitator organised an anonymous questionnaire survey of delegates immediately after the Workshop. Twenty-six responses (50% of Workshop delegates) were received and almost all agreed that the case study was useful and enjoyable and that REDCAFE had helpedthem relate conflict management methods to Cormorant-fisheries conflicts elsewhere. A series of questions were also asked of delegates and those responding to the questionnaire provided over 200 responses which are synthesised in the report. 0.25 The REDCAFE process: main strengths The most commonly cited strength of the case study Workshop, and of the REDCAFE process in general, was the development of trust between project participants and other stakeholders, and effective dialogue between scientists and others. Next followed the pan- European involvement and collaboration produced by the project and the opportunity it has provided to bring international perspectives to bear on local case studies. Another important strength identified was the project's attempts to reach consensus on Cormorant-fisheries conflicts through collaboration with social scientists. 0.26 The REDCAFE process: main weaknesses In relation to the case study Workshop, the commonest weaknesses identified were lack of time and the involvement of too few local stakeholders. It was recognised that these constraints probably limited, to some degree, discussions on potential site specific management tools. More generally, policy makers should have been included as REDCAFE participants and the continued need for effective dialogue between all interested parties was highlighted. 0.27 The REDCAFE process: main lessons learned Several lessons for the REDCAFE project were recorded. The most frequent involved the vital importance of participation and dialogue. Almost all stakeholders stated that conflicts can only be resolved through relationships and trust: people must work together, ideally in face-to-face discussions, to develop solutions. All those involved in dialogue must consider the language they use and be aware that different participants (individuals or groups) will have different levels of confidence and enthusiasm. Respondents also noted that it takes time to understand conflict and decide how best to manage it. There may be no ultimate solutions but effective dialogue will invariably help to resolve conflicts. Another important lesson was that large-scale culling of Cormorants will almost certainly be ineffective. Cormorants are now an established element of many aquatic ecosystems and people need to learn to live with them. Scientific information is necessary to inform debate and potential mitigation policies, and REDCAFE has demonstrated that clear communication of scientific information can influence other stakeholders' perceptions and understanding and vice versa. Other important REDCAFE lessons were cited and these are discussed in detail in the report. 0.28 Looking forward: overview REDCAFE has attempted to synthesise, for the first time, key stakeholder groups' views and perceptions on Cormorant conflicts with fisheries (and, to a lesser extent, with the wider environment) in a standardised way across Europe. Despite methodological limitations, many clear pictures emerged and these are discussed. Just as importantly, collecting and collating information for this synthesis has allowed REDCAFE participants (primarily natural scientists or those working closely with them) to forge links with local stakeholders experiencing conflict issues at first hand. REDCAFE offered the first opportunity to apply recognised conflict management techniques to Cormorant-fisheries interactions at the pan-European level. Through discussions with stakeholders it was clear that conflicts with Cormorants are not the only ones facing many fisheries and environmental stakeholders. To better understand the nature of Cormorant-fishery conflicts it is useful to consider other internal and external issues leading to conflicts over fisheries resources. These issues, both environmental and social, are often complex and closely linked. Environmental conflicts over resources, including those involving fisheries, usually involve numerous issues. This appeared true across Europe: many of the stakeholders who provided specific information on Cormorant conflict issues for the present synthesis also described other issues, fears and concerns affecting their businesses or recreation. Many stakeholders also recorded concerns over the creation of sustainable fisheries and the development and implementation of effective, 'holistic' fisheries management programmes. Some of the other wider concerns affecting fishermen contributing to the present synthesis related to ownership and property rights and to changes in market economies. These issues are discussed in the report. The evaluation process confirmed that the REDCAFE philosophy of developing interdisciplinary links within and between the fields of natural and social science was very useful. Moreover, the project clearly demonstrates the necessity, and value, of dialogue and participation between all stakeholders (or their legitimate representatives) involved in Cormorant fishery conflicts. Evaluations also showed that REDCAFE's approach to a specific Cormorant-fishery conflict case study provides a useful framework for similar activities elsewhere. There is acknowledgement that the process of conflict management will take time and require appropriate resources, including funds. 0.29 Looking forward: case studies, individuals and stakeholder groups At the local level, by far the most commonly anticipated next step was to consider potential site-specific management techniques based on lessons learned from the REDCAFE synthesis. There is a strong desire to put theories into practice and to try mitigation measures that have been shown to work elsewhere. For many, next steps should include exploring the possibilities of developing and implementing local fishery management, or action, plans for specific case studies and/or the building of partnerships at the national level between fishery and conservation organisations such as the Moran Committee in the UK. REDCAFE emphasised the importance of making concerted efforts to create participation, dialogue and consensus building between local stakeholders involved in Cormorant-fisheries conflicts across Europe.This will require effective dissemination of relevant information at local, regional, national and international levels. Politicians and policy makers should also be included in such dissemination activities. 0.30 Looking forward: the scientific community While social issues now feature strongly in the minds of the natural scientists involved in the REDCAFE project, many in that community expressed clear needs to further improve understanding of ecological issues. Scientists also realise the need to forge better links with others. Although scientific independence and rigour remain crucial, there is a need for scientists to apply their research results to real life cases. Scientists also need to collaborate with other stakeholders and local people, for example in the development of local management plans. Such collaboration will require scientists to communicate practical information to others in a clear manner and to maintain dialogue with all interested parties. Natural and social scientists also need to forge closer links because Cormorant-fisheries conflicts are situated in social and political contexts. 0.31 Looking forward: Fisheries co-management While REDCAFE focused on Cormorant-fishery conflicts, other tensions were recognised by the project as influencing them. Addressing such broad fisheries 17 conflict issues is not trivial and will take time and require trust between stakeholders.Furthermore, in order to avoid inadequate fisheries policies and management systems, that tend to treat the symptoms rather than address underlying problems, broader environmental and institutional factors should be taken into account and fundamental socio-cultural conditions must also be given high consideration. Participatory comanagement in fisheries, where managers and local fishermen co-operate in draftingpolicy, may facilitate successful management while also offering the possibility of reducing public costs. If natural resource management is to be sustainable in the long term, an understanding of human behaviour is vital and this multidisciplinary approach was recognised by REDCAFE. The fundamental challenge for fisheries management in this context is to find ways of expanding technical expertise whilst increasing collaboration in decision-making processes. In the past there has been much co-operation between fishermen and scientists at the individual level but a more organised management structure is required to bring these, and other, groups together. REDCAFE's work established an area of co-operation between natural scientists, local environmental stakeholders (fishermen and conservationists) and policy makers which should form the basis of future dialogue and collaboration. 0.32 Looking forward: future research A major challenge for natural scientists will be to make their work more relevant and useful to stakeholders. It is clear that different stakeholders involved in Cormorant fisheries conflicts have different values and perceptions over these issues. It is also clear that other stakeholders view scientists as having different values and perceptions. Thus, scientists should be considered as another stakeholder group involved in the issue of Cormorants and fisheries. Given the recognition that there is no single value or perception (i.e. 'reality') for all the different stakeholders groups within this conflict, it is unrealistic to expect a single method of collecting, analysing and interpreting useful scientific information. The development of a rigorous scientific research programme to address Cormorant conflict issues will have to maintain high scientific standards but will also have to be both relevant to and influential in the decision-making process. There is a need for a practical pan-European Cormorant-fishery research programme that includes ecological study, collaboration between natural and social scientists and a strong conflict management element. Similarly, there is a need for long-term studies to quantify the effectiveness of various measures to mitigate against Cormorant problems at fisheries. Stakeholders have a long list of possible management actions against Cormorants but relatively little guidance on their likely effectiveness, practicability, acceptability or costs at a specific site. Clearly, considerably more work is required to trial the use of techniques to reduce Cormorant impact at feeding sites. Whatever framework future scientific research into Cormorant conflicts takes, it is clear that all stakeholders are concerned over the common issues of quality, health and status of biological resources in wetland systems. Dialogue with stakeholders highlighted several areas where major conflicts were currently poorly served by scientific literature and these are discussed. However, it must be stressed that such research should be undertaken with participation from stakeholders at all stages where possible. Ultimately, this should increase the useful knowledge of both scientists and other stakeholder groups whilst also increasing collaboration between all parties, but particularly local people, in the decision-making process with regard to Cormorant conflict issues across Europe. 0.33 Looking forward: concluding remarks Full information from REDCAFE should be disseminated as widely as possible so that the lessons learned from the project can be applied elsewhere. The establishment of a pan-European information exchange network would greatly facilitate the conflict resolution process and allow stakeholders to view their own particular situations in the broader continental context. Information must be exchanged at several levels: within and between disciplines of natural and social science, between scientists and other stakeholders, and between all interested parties and politicians, policy makers and the general public. The most important next step after dissemination is to build on the findings of REDCAFE so that local stakeholders can begin to develop effective site specific strategies for resolving local conflicts. The formation of an information exchange network would be a very useful tool to facilitate the rapid transfer of ideas, experiences, management techniques, their implementation and subsequent outcomes. It could also offer stakeholders opportunities for discussion and could provide them with clear information on the actual costs (both invested and saved) of specific techniques. Although the REDCAFE project is the most comprehensive attempt to address Cormorant-fishery conflicts at the pan-European scale, it is clear that the project is merely the first step. Opportunities must now be explored to further develop the foundation framework that REDCAFE has developed in linking science with society and advancing processes of conflict management across a range of European contexts. The REDCAFE Cormorant-conflict synthesis demonstrated clearly that such conflicts are complex, in terms of both biology and equally important social and economic issues. This synthesis is an important first stage towards developing trust and collaborations between all those affected by Cormorant conflicts. These issues are as much a matter of human interests as they are of biology. It is hoped that this element of REDCAFE's work will indeed be the start of a management process for Cormorant-fisheries conflict issues and, by implication, for wider environmental issues affecting fisheries and aquatic conservation across Europe. A formal approach to applying REDCAFE philosophy to the thousands of other case studies across Europe is needed. Moreover, the onus is currently on biologists to solve what are essentially people-people conflicts, professionals in other disciplines should be increasingly involved in these conflict management issues","Carss, D.N.; Centre for Ecology & Hydrology Banchory, Hill of Brathens, Banchory, Aberdeenshire, AB31 4BW, Scotland, United Kingdom, United Kingdom.",,,,"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology Banchory",Banchory,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Biodiversity & Conservation",,,"Animals and man; Conservation; Ecology; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia","Phalacrocorax carbo carbo; Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis [Animals and man / Conflict with fisheries / Management strategies; options & potential tools] [Conservation measures / Conflict with fisheries management / Strategies] [Ecology /  / Fisheries management strategies relationships] [Europe /  / Biology; distribution & conflict with fisheries management strategies].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Pelecaniformes, Phalacrocoracidae","Phalacrocorax carbo carbo (Phalacrocoracidae).

J,ZOOR13900034867,Article,"Niche partitioning between immigrant Palearctic willow warblers Phylloscopus trochilus and resident Afrotropical warblers in three woodland habitats in Zimbabwe.",,"Salewski, Volker; Jones, Peter; Vickery, Juliet",,,,"Avian Science",2,4,,207-216,2002/12/01,2002,,,,English,1,4,"Palearctic migrants are thought to coexist with resident species in sub-Saharan Africa by foraging in more open habitats and by being more flexible and opportunistic in their foraging behaviours and utilisation of resources than their Afrotropical counterparts. We assessed how migrant willow warblers Phylloscopus trochilus partitioned resources with two ecologically similar resident warblers, the burnt-necked and green-capped eremomelas Eremomela usticollis and E. scotops, in acacia, miombo and mopane woodlands in Zimbabwe during the northern winter of 1999-2000. We examined whether foraging willow warblers differed from residents in microhabitat selection and food intake rates, and whether they used a wider range of foraging tactics. Unlike either eremomela species, willow warblers occurred in all three habitat types. In acacia they showed a significantly greater diversity of feeding techniques, perhaps reflecting a greater diversity of prey taken, compared to the burnt-necked eremomela. In miombo, however, willow warblers did not differ significantly in feeding repertoire from the green-capped eremomela, but did show a significant difference in feeding microhabitat within the vegetation. In mopane woodland, where eremomelas hardly occurred, willow warblers showed the highest diversity of feeding techniques and may be able to exploit resources there that eremomelas cannot. Although there may be some microhabitat displacement and niche partitioning between willow warblers and eremomelas, we do not know which mechanism facilitates this separation, when it exists at all, because direct interspecific interactions were virtually nonexistent. We cannot yet assess the extent to which such interactions, together with the willow warbler's apparently greater behavioural flexibility, might favour its coexistence with the local community of ecologically similar arboreal insectivores.","Salewski, Volker; Tropical Ecology Research Programme, Dept. of Biological Sciences, University of Zimbabwe, PO Box MP 167, Harare, Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe.",volker.salewski@biologie.uni-regensburg.de,,,,,"Zoology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry",1424-8743,,"Nutrition; Feeding behaviour; Behaviour; Ecology; Ecological niche; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Afrotropical region; Africa","Eremomela scotops; Eremomela usticollis [Feeding behaviour /  / Comparison with immigrant species; evidence for niche partioning; woodland habitats] [Foraging /  / Microhabitat selection & behaviour; evidence for niche partioning with immigrant species; woodland] [Migration /  / Residents; niche partitioning with ecological similar immigrant species; evidence] [Ecological niche /  / Evidence for resource partitioning with immigrant species in woodland habitats] [Resource partitioning /  / Microhabitat use; food & feeding behaviour comparisons with immigrant species] [Habitat utilization /  / Foraging microhabitats; evidence for niche partitioning with immigrant species] [Forest and woodland / Acacia, miombo & mopane woodlands / Niche partitoning with ecologically similar immigrant species] [Zimbabwe / Sengwa Wildlife Research Area / ].

Therefore, we evaluated effects of food abundance (i.e., supplemental prey) and time since prescribed fire on nest success of artificial ground nests. We monitored the fate of 759 artificial ground nests from June to July 2000. No interaction (P = 0.74) occurred between fire and supplemental prey treatments. Nest success in prey-supplemented plots (37.6%) did not differ (P = 0.70) from control plots (44.9%), and nest success in burned plots (41.8%) did not differ (P = 0.86) from nonburned plots (40.7%). Motion-sensitive cameras placed on feeders revealed that mesomammals accounted for >80% of visits to feeders, indicating that supplemental prey was detected and consumed by mesomammals. Nest predators differed as a function of food abundance, with combined avian and small-mammal predation being greater in prey-supplemented (46.5%) than in control (25.9%) plots. Nest predators also differed as a function of prescribed fire. Avian predation of nests was greater in burned (13.7%) than nonburned (9.9%) plots, whereas small-mammal predation was greater in non-burned (30.9%) than in burned (15.1%) plots. Altering food and cover to manage nest success may result in compensatory predation. Further work to quantify the extent of compensatory predation is needed to fully understand trade-offs of various practices for managing nest predation.","Jones, David D.; Joseph W.

We used long-term capture-recapture-recovery data and a modelling approach developed by Burnham (1993) to test a priori predictions about sources of variation in annual survival rates and fidelity within a population of individually marked females in three species of European ducks from a breeding ground study site in Latvia. 2. True annual survival was higher for diving ducks (tufted duck 0.72, common pochard 0.65) and lower for northern shoveler (0.52). Survival of female diving ducks was positively correlated with mean winter temperatures at Western European wintering areas, the relationship being much stronger for pochard. 3. We present the first unbiased estimates of breeding fidelity and permanent emigration in European ducks. Estimated fidelity rates were high (0.88-1.0) and emigration rates low (0-0.12) for all three species, and we found strong evidence for age-specific differences in fidelity of pochards. Unusual long-distance (up to 2500 km) breeding dispersal movements that we found in female tufted ducks have not been documented in any other European waterfowl and are most probably a result of saturated nesting habitats. 4. Fidelity was a function of patch reproductive success in the previous year for all three species providing support for the idea that patch success is an important cue influencing fidelity. 5. Fidelity probability increased to 1.0 for shovelers during the last 12 years of study following provision of critical improvements in nesting habitats and suggested that habitat conditions and reproductive success determined site fidelity and settling patterns for shoveler and probably also influenced fidelity of the two other species. In predictable habitats, fidelity is a parameter that reflects the integration of fitness components and is thus a good quantity for assessing the effectiveness of habitat management actions.","Blums, Peter; Gaylord Memorial Laboratory, School of Natural Resources, University of Missouri-Columbia, Puxico, MO, 63960-9686, USA, USA.",,"Piper, Walter/B-7908-2009",,,,"Anatomy & Morphology; Zoology; Reproductive Biology; Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",0021-8790,,"Biometrics; Reproduction; Reproductive behaviour; Behaviour; Ecology; Population dynamics; Abiotic factors; Physical factors; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe","Anas clypeata; Aythya ferina; Aythya fuligula [Age /  / Breeding site fidelity relationships] [Breeding site /  / Site fidelity variation & influencing factors; long term data & modelling study] [Reproductive productivity /  / Patch reproductive success; breeding site fidelity & emigration correlations] [Homing /  / Breeding site fidelity; variation & influencing factors] [Emigration / Breeding dispersal / Variation in occurrence & influencing factors] [Survival /  / Annual rate variation & influencing factors] [Climate and weather /  / Mean winter temperature; annual survival rate relationship; breeding population] [Latvia /  / Annual survival & breeding site fidelity].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Anseriformes, Anatidae","Anas clypeata (Anatidae).

There is now increasing evidence that this very localized occurrence is caused by human activity, that chronic overgrazing and pasture management by burning has restricted the woody vegetation to particular habitats, and that these forests were once widespread and contiguous with lower-elevation cloudforests. The human-induced vegetation changes were modest in the arid parts of the puna zone, and some Polylepis patches persist remarkably well, probably because of active management by local communities. Comparison of current and modeled potential distribution of birds suggest an average reduction in species richness of 26% in the humid parts of the puna zone and 17% in montane basins of central Peru. The biologically most valuable areas are found close to ancient cultural centers in the Andes, possibly reflecting the fact that the local climate is favorable for agriculture as well as for rare (relict) species of animals and plants. Because of this link, initiatives to minimize global extinction of animals and plants must include support for sustainable land use in these places, in addition to traditional conservation by formal reserving of wilderness areas with few people.

The Rocky Mountain region has one of the most heterogeneous landscapes in North America, combining high complexity in abiotic gradients with fire as a major disturbance factor. In recent decades fire suppression has limited this disturbance, resulting in altered stand structures and relatively homogeneous expanses of mid-successional forest where there were once mosaics of different-aged post-fire stands. Elsewhere, historically homogeneous landscapes that rarely burned have become more heterogeneous due to logging. Many forest types are less common than they were historically due to current management. Land conversion to agriculture and development has primarily occurred in low elevations. We speculate that the consequences of these changes include: (1) bird species adapted to historically homogeneous forest landscapes would be negatively affected by landscape heterogeneity created by timber harvest openings; (2) bird species specialized for forest types that were once prevalent but are now uncommon may be negatively affected by decreasing patch size and increasing isolation; and (3) birds that breed in close proximity to human-added landscape features may be negatively affected by brood parasites or nest predators. Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) and Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa) had the strongest trends of species sensitive to fragmentation indices. Pine Siskin (Carduelis pines), Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina) and Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis) were positively associated with fragmentation across most studies. Nesting success varied among landscape configurations, and some trends paralleled abundance patterns. Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism rates were extremely low (0-3%) where nest success has been studied in coniferous forests of the northcentral Rockies. Across extensive and intensive studies, distance to agricultural lands was the strongest predictor of cowbird presence. Therefore, we found evidence for the ideas that birds adapted to homogeneous forest landscapes have been negatively affected by heterogeneity caused by timber harvesting, that patch size is important for some birds in one vanishing habitat (old-growth ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa), and that cowbirds are more abundant in conifer forests near human-added landscape features. The effects of changes in landscape patterns on birds in the north-central Rockies seem to be less dramatic than in eastern and midwestern North America, and different landscape measures are more relevant to western conifer forests. We need additional research on most aspects of breeding, nonbreeding, and dispersal ecology in relation to landscape patterns and within-stand changes. We offer our proposed consequences as hypotheses upon which to base future tests.","Hejl, Sallie J.; Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences, Texas A and M University, 2258 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843-2258, USA, USA.",,,,,,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology; Forestry",0197-9922,,"Animals and man; Ecology; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America","Aves [Disturbance by man /  / Changing landscape patterns; ecological impact; conifer forests] [Ecology /  / Impact of changing landscape patterns] [Forest and woodland / Conifer forest / ] [USA / Rocky Mountains, north central / Ecological impact of changing landscape patterns].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR13900042923,,,,,2018/06/21

In total, data on at least 66 territorial pairs and 60 nests are presented. The species has uneven distribution in the country. There is a considerable area in the Palessia Region (southern third of the country, about 15,000 km2) where the breeding density is rather high (2.1-2.5 pairs per 100 km2). Four study plots (120-190 km2 each) in Palessia were surveyed for Eagle Owl territorial pairs. The observed breeding densities varied from 2.1-4.3 pairs per 100 km2, three of them being within 2.1-2.6. The rest of the Belarusian territory has much lower Eagle Owl breeding density, especially central Belarus, which is dominated by agricultural land, and Vitebsk Paazerie Region. The only area in that region surveyed relatively thoroughly is the Berezinsky Biosphere Reserve (810 km2), where the density was estimated at 0.1- 0.35 pairs per 100 km2. These new distributional and density data have allowed us to make a new population size estimate, which is set now at 400 - 500 pairs. Observational data suggest that preferred breeding habitats are mosaics of wet woodlands, open lands, including some agricultural ones (e.g. pastures), but especially floodplains, and medium-sized to large waterbodies. Observed nest sites were diverse, but a preference for ground-nesting in swampy Black Alder forests is apparent. Another feature of Belarusian Eagle Owls is regular (ca. 25 % in our sample) breeding in stick nests built by storks and raptors. Few cases of switches between ground and stick nests in the same pairs in consecutive years were recorded. Some unusual nest-sites such as under a bridge, and in a basal tree hole in a clear-felling were observed in the 1990s. Breeding starts as early as the third decade of February, median date for onset of egg-laying being estimated at 15-19 March. Clutch size varied between 2 and 4 (presumably, some pairs naturally lay just a single egg), mean is ca. 2.7. Successful pairs raise 1 to 3, on average 2.0, young. Brood reduction is mainly due to a mortality of 1 - 2 nestlings. We monitored breeding outcome during the entire period from incubation to fledging (or failure) in 13 nests. Six of themsuccessfully produced large young, while in at least 5 out of 7 unsuccessful nests, failures were caused by natural factors (fire, predation, tree nest collapse) and/or did not occur immediately after a nest discovery by researchers. Based on the generally high success of random nest searches for multiple pairs, we assume that breeding frequency is relatively high. However, at one of the study plots we observed 1 confirmed and 3 suspected cases of non-breeding in a year with deep snow cover and late spring ( 1996). Some of the pairs were rather tolerant of human-caused disturbance and/or habitat alteration. There are several observations of long-term successful breeding in nests situated within 1 km of small villages. The usual response of Eagle Owls towards anthropogenic territory transformation (although not formally tested) - including some drastic cases as clear felling of a nest forest patch - is to maintain the same territory location, but to shift to an alternative, often suboptimal, nest site. However, breeding success in such cases seems to be lower than average. The future state of the Belarusian Eagle Owl population depends mainly on the stability andbreeding success of several local key 'subpopulations'. Their monitoring and protection are major priority measures for the species' conservation in Belarus.","Gritschik, W.W.; Belorusskii gosudarstvennyi universitet, Kafedra obshchei ekologii, pl.

J,ZOOR14112070765,Article,"A preliminary risk assessment of cane toads in Kakadu National Park.",,"van Dam, R.A.; Walden, D.J.; Begg, G.W.",,,,"Supervising Scientist Report",164,,,"i-xvi, 1-92",2002,2002,,,,English,0,30,"Background and approach Cane toads (Bufo marinus) entered the Northern Territory (NT) in 1980 from Queensland and are rapidly approaching Kakadu National Park (KNP), having recently been reported in the upper Mann River and Snowdrop Creek, approximately 15-30 km to the east of Kakadu National Park. Concern about the invasion of cane toads in Kakadu National Park has been highlighted on a number of occasions, and in 1998 participants at a workshop on the potential impacts and control of cane toads in Kakadu National Park conceded that a strategic approach for assessing and possibly minimising cane toad impacts should be developed. The first stage would be an ecological risk assessment to predict the likely extent of impacts of cane toads in Kakadu National Park and identify key vulnerable habitats and species. This information could be used to develop new monitoring programs and assess existing ones. This assessment is a direct result of Environment Australia's concern about the potential impacts of cane toads in Kakadu National Park. The wetland risk assessment framework developed by eriss for the Ramsar Convention was used to predict key habitats and the species most at risk. The majority of the assessment involved identifying the problem, the potential extent and effects of the problem, the risk, and subsequently making recommendations on monitoring. Major information gaps relevant to predicting impacts and developing appropriate monitoring programs were also identified. The risk assessment was based on information from published and unpublished scientific and anecdotal reports. Information on Kakadu National Park was derived from relevant research projects undertaken in the Park since the early 1980s. A number of relevant Territory and Commonwealth agencies were consulted, as were relevant cane toad, native fauna and/or wildlife management experts from around Australia. Discussions were held with community members in the Borroloola and Mataranka regions to gain an indigenous/cultural perspective of the cane toad issue. Identification of the problem Since their introduction to Australia in 1935 to control sugar cane pests in Queensland, cane toads have spread naturally and with human assistance throughout much of Queensland, northern NSW and the Top End of the NT. The cane toad's preference for certain disturbed areas means that areas of degraded natural habitat have probably helped their spread. They eat a wide variety of prey, breed opportunistically, have a far greater fecundity than native anurans, and develop rapidly particularly in warmer waters. They tolerate a broad range of environmental and climatic conditions, can occupy many different habitats and compete for resources with many native species. Most significantly, they possess highly toxic chemical predator defences, with many experimental and anecdotal reports of deaths of native predators that have attempted to consume cane toads. It is accepted that the cane toad will establish and spread rapidly in Kakadu National Park - a World Heritage area with Ramsar listed wetlands, well known for its spectacular wilderness, nature conservation values, rich diversity of habitats, flora and fauna, and cultural significance. There is serious concern that the World Heritage status of Kakadu National Park could be diminished if any of these attributes were adversely affected by cane toads. The potential extent of cane toads in Kakadu National Park Cane toads are likely to colonise almost every habitat type within Kakadu National Park. The saline regions of the coastal plains and deltaic estuarine floodplains will most likely support some cane toads at various times, although they are not likely to use these habitats on a permanent basis. Other less suitable areas include deep open water and/or flowing channel habitats and tidal regions of larger rivers (excluding riparian zones) which extend 70 to 80 km inland during the Dry season. The steady range expansion over the last ten years indicates that most wetland habitats are probably suitable as breeding habitat and also as Dry season refuges. Patterns of dispersal within Kakadu will probably rely on the transport corridors and the major rivers and creeks. Dispersal rates within a catchment could be up to 100 km y-1. The current location of cane toads would indicate an initial progression down the South Alligator River catchment via its sub-catchments (eg Jim Jim Creek, Deaf Adder Creek). Invasion of other areas of the Park will likely depend on which waterways' headwaters are colonised first (eg Mary River, East Alligator River). Maximum population densities of various cane toad life stages for limited areas of suitable habitat in Kakadu could be expected to be in the order of: 4000 to 36 000 eggs per metre of shoreline; [approximately]15 to 60 m-2 for tadpoles; 2.5 m-2 for metamorphlings; and 2000 ha-1 for adults, depending on temporal and spatial factors. The Dry season will see a gradual retreat of many cane toads from seasonally inundated wetlands. The vegetation and cracks in the black soils on the floodplains should offer sheltered, moist habitat during the mid Dry season. In the late Dry season, adult cane toadswill congregate near permanent water with adequate shelter. Few cane toads would be present in the drier areas of the tall, open eucalypt forest and woodland habitats of the lowland plains. The first rains of the Wet season will stimulate dispersal and increased breeding activity. With the progression of the Wet season, cane toads will disperse into terrestrial habitats, namely the open forests and woodlands. When large areas of the floodplains are inundated, cane toads will be concentrated on the remaining dry ground, which may make them highly visible to Park visitors. The potential effects of cane toads on Kakadu National Park The potential effects of cane toads upon Kakadu National Park are outlined in six sections of this report: effects on predator species; effects on prey species; effects of resource competition; cultural effects; economic effects; and other potential effects. Predators The majority of information on cane toad impacts relates to toxic effects on predators. A substantial amount of literature exists on effects on individuals, but little scientific information is available on population effects. The degree of susceptibility of potential cane toad predator species in Kakadu National Park was determined using three criteria: Definite: documented adverse effects upon populations of this species have been reported in the literature; Probable: documented in the literature as having eaten cane toads or their early life stages and adverse effects on individuals reported, but not on populations; Possible: documented in the literature or through expert consultation as eating, or thought likely to eat, native frogs or their early life stages, but effects of eating cane toads unknown. A total of 151 species or species groups were identified under these criteria, covering a broad taxonomic range including aquatic invertebrates, fish, frogs, lizards, snakes, birds and mammals. Eleven species were considered definitely susceptible to cane toads, comprising 5 lizard, 3 snake and 3 mammal species. Sixteen species or species groups were considered probably susceptible to cane toads, while 124 species or species groups were considered possibly susceptible to cane toads. Prey Little information was available on effects of cane toads on prey species. Cane toad tadpoles have been observed preying on the eggs of some native frogs, though they are thought not to be significant predators of native anuran early life stages. Rather, cane toad tadpoles have been observed to feed mainly on cane toad eggs, algae and detritus, as well as scavenging upon dead animals and animal material which they will consume in preference to plant material. Juvenile and adult cane toads are generalist feeders, consuming almost any type of terrestrial animals, with ground-dwelling ants, termites and beetles usually dominating the diet. Some small mammals, birds, reptiles and frogs are consumed in very small numbers. No study has specifically investigated the impact of cane toads on communities of ground dwelling arthropods. One general impact study reported a decline in beetle (Coleoptera) numbers, possibly due to cane toads. It is impossible to determine how many of the undescribed invertebrate species in Kakadu, many of which may be endemic, could be affected by cane toads. Competition Little information was available on competition between cane toads and native animals for resources such as food, shelter and breeding sites. The potential for competition between cane toad tadpoles and native frog tadpoles (eg the ornate burrowing frog) appears to exist, although, several reports suggest considerable segregation of breeding sites. Competition between adult cane toads and frogs appears to be minimal, with the pattern of habitat and food exploitation differing markedly. The major factor separating resource use is the cane toad's heavy reliance on ground-dwelling ants, termites and beetles as major food sources. There has been some indication from the Roper River region of the NT of competition effects. In particular, some species of small reptile were found to decline in areas colonised by cane toads. A competition effect was suspected, but not confirmed. Two frog species (the brown tree frog and green tree frog) have possibly been linked to competition-related declines, although the evidence is not strong. It is possible that many other species within Kakadu, including endemic aquatic invertebrates, could be subject to competition by cane toads. Cultural effects Concerns for the decline in numbers of bush tucker species such as monitor lizards, snakes and turtles have already been noted by several Aboriginal communities in the NT. This decline is likely to have very significant impacts upon Aboriginal communities within Kakadu. Some traditional ceremonies in the Borroloola region have been altered to request the spirits to return these foods, and in some cases, totem species (eg freshwater crocodile). From experience elsewhere in the NT, it appears that Aboriginal people, by necessity, eventually grow accustomed to the presence of cane toads, although this does not necessarily diminish the underlying concerns of these people. Areas of human habitation in Kakadu including the township of Jabiru, Aboriginal communities, Ranger stations, tourist accommodation and camping grounds are expected to have high densities of cane toads. This will impact on outdoor recreational activities and, in some areas, increase the likelihood of pets being poisoned from mouthing or ingesting cane toads. Economic effects Cane toads are unlikely to have an adverse impact on the general economy and tourism income of Kakadu National Park. The reactions to cane toads in the NT have ranged from disinterest to dismay. International tourists do not recognise toads as an invasive species, while visitors from Queensland are well accustomed to toads. However, tourists from other states express deep concern about cane toads, especially in World Heritage sites such as Kakadu. Tour operators in Kakadu share a similar concern. However, the major attributes of Kakadu continue to attract tourists, and are likely to overshadow any concerns about adverse economic impacts of cane toads. Cane toads do have an economic value as dissecting specimens for research and education purposes, and as a supply for medicinal and leather products. Such industries exist in Queensland and will probably become established in the NT once cane toads are present in sufficient numbers. Other potential effects Another potential effect is the contamination of water supplies with rotting toad carcasses and the subsequent release of the toxins. There have been many reports of the poisoning of pets and poultry from drinking contaminated water. Experimental water-borne exposure of the toxin to various organisms has resulted in toxicity, but generally only at high concentrations. The issue of potential impacts of cane toads on granivorous prey insects and resultant repercussions on Kakadu's native plants has been raised, although this is highly speculative. There is evidence, for example, that high densities of harvester ants can significantly reduce the density of speargrass (Sorghum intrans). In terms of plant-animal interactions, it is possible that subtle ecological changes could occur amongst other biota, and other flow-on effects. Feral cats and pigs have been known to die from mouthing or ingesting cane toads. These animals cause damage to the native fauna and landscape of Kakadu, and any decline in their numbers would be considered a benefit. The reduction in numbers of predators such as varanids (goannas) and snakes could be of benefit to the several species of grounddwelling/ nesting birds in Kakadu, in addition to crocodiles and turtles whose eggs are preyed upon by other large reptiles. Cane toads are known to feed on human faeces, and as a result they may harbour human strains of Salmonella and other bacteria. The eggs of human parasites are also spread via toad faeces. In areas where modern sanitation practices are lacking, the presence of large numbers of cane toads could represent a health hazard. Another health-related issue is the potential for substance abuse of the cane toad toxin, a habit forming practice that is established in northern Queensland and in countries such as Fiji. Identification of the risk The data on cane toad effects, distribution and densities are mostly inconclusive and/or show great variability. In addition, information on distributions and abundance of Kakadu animal species are deficient. Nevertheless, it is still possible to identify key habitats and also prioritise particular species based on the likelihood that they will be at greater risk from cane toads than other species, and their importance to the ecological and/or cultural values of Kakadu. Identification of key habitats Aquatic stages In Kakadu, cane toads will breed in both temporary and permanent waterbodies and so their aquatic stages will be found in a variety of aquatic habitats. They will concentrate their breeding activity during the wetter periods, although they are also known to breed during the Dry season. During the Wet season, when many of the major wetland habitats are inundated, cane toad breeding may be concentrated in the wetland habitats associated with the open forests and woodlands of the lowland plains. Terrestrial stages As the Dry season progresses, cane toads will move progressively from sites of temporary water to permanent water. The floodplains and sheltered habitats on the margins of floodplains and temporary or shallow billabongs will provide ideal cane toad habitat during the early to mid Dry season. The late Dry season will see high densities of cane toads near permanent water or moisture, including permanent billabongs and patches of monsoon rainforest. The Wet season will probably see the highest numbers of cane toad metamorphlings, mainly around the moist margins of the waterbodies they emerged from. Wet season inundation of the major wetland habitats will see the majority of adult cane toads dispersing into the woodlands and open forests of the lowland plains. The vegetation within the woodlands will provide suitable shelter for cane toads during the Wet season. Identification of species at risk Predators The initial susceptibility ranking of each of the 151 predator species identified as being definitely, probably or possibly susceptible to cane toads was further refined to a ranking of risk using exposure (ie available habitat overlap, feeding ecology, behaviour) and ecological/cultural importance status information. Four risk categories - likely, possible, uncertain and unlikely - were defined, being adapted from the original susceptibility criteria. Within these categories, different priorities were assigned. The original 151 predator species were allocated a risk ranking accordingly. Ten species were considered likely to be at risk of experiencing population level effects, with the northern quoll being assigned the highest priority. The 9 remaining species including 5 lizards, 3 snakes, and one mammal were assigned high priority. Twelve species or species groups were considered to be at possible risk of experiencing population level effects, although none were listed as endangered or vulnerable, or thought to be notable (rare, or have restricted range, outstanding taxonomic interest, or uncertain or declining status) or flagship (ecological/cultural importance to Kakadu) species. Thus, all species were assigned moderate priority status. Represented in this category were two groups of aquatic invertebrates, 3 frogs, one lizard, 3 snakes, freshwater crocodile and 2 birds. Due to a lack of information, the risk of population level effects was considered to be uncertain for 98 species or species groups, although 21 of these were assigned high priority. These species include 3 fish, 3 frogs, 6 lizards, one snake, 4 birds and 4 mammals. The remaining species in this risk category were assigned moderate priority. These include two groups of invertebrates, 4 fish, 17 frogs, 9 snakes, 42 birds and 3 mammals. A total of 31 species were considered unlikely to be at risk of experiencing population level effects (based on relevant ecological, feeding or behavioural information) and were assigned low priority. These included 11 fish, 18 birds and 2 mammals. Prey Quantitative data on impacts to prey species are scant, and very little can be concluded about the species or species groups at risk. Cane toads occasionally consume small vertebrates, but populations of these are not likely to be at risk. There is little doubt that termites, beetles and ants will be heavily exploited by cane toads in Kakadu. Due to the potentially high cane toad densities, and an individual cane toad's ability to consume up to hundreds of prey items in one night, ground-dwelling arthropods are at greatest risk. The potential impact of cane toads on endemic invertebrates is unknown. The only species known to suffer long-term population decline or extinction from the impact of cane toads is a tapeworm found in the intestines of a snake. Competitors The available experimental information suggests that some native frog tadpoles (eg L. ornatus) may be at risk through competition with cane toad tadpoles. However, observations suggest that native frogs rarely share breeding habitats with cane toads. Although adult native frogs do not appear to compete with cane toads, the potential risk to native tadpoles represents a risk to native frog populations. Some of the smaller insectivorous reptile species of Kakadu may be at risk from competition for food resources by cane toads, but nothing more can be concluded. Cultural, socio-economic and other risks The major impacts on Aboriginal communities within Kakadu National Park will be a decline in some traditional foods and, in some situations, the alteration of ceremonies following declines of food and totem species. Aboriginal people elsewhere in the NT have accepted the presence of cane toads but still express concern regarding the impacts. Aboriginal communities within Kakadu may also become accustomed to cane toads albeit most likely sharing the same concerns. Cane toads will congregate in areas of human habitation within Kakadu, and will be of nuisance value in these places, and will also represent a risk to domestic and semi-domestic dogs.1 Tourism, the major economic activity of Kakadu, is not at risk from the presence of cane toads, and visitor numbers will not decrease as a result. With predicted high numbers in Kakadu, there may be an opportunity to harvest them for commercial benefit. Other potential effects of cane toads have been hypothesised, including the contamination of water supplies, secondary effects on vegetation communities, the spread of human diseases, and the substance abuse of cane toad toxin. Details of these potential effects and hence the risks posed by them are essentially unknown. Uncertainty and information gaps This assessment has highlighted that there are major information gaps contributing to a large degree of uncertainty about the potential extent and impacts of cane toads in Kakadu. These include: uncertainty about densities of cane toads in Kakadu, effects of fire and burning regimes, degree of land/habitat disturbance, and the extent to which the Arnhem Land escarpment and plateau will act as a barrier and/or be colonised; the lack of quantitative data on the impacts on animal populations, particularly in the long-term, quantitative data on Kakadu fauna populations and distributions as well as dietary information; incomplete knowledge of Kakadu's invertebrate fauna, many being undescribed and possibly endemic; unknown response and susceptibility of most Kakadu fish species; unknown competitive interactions with native frogs; unknown chemoreceptive response in snakes and their ability to detect cane toad toxins; conflicting and unclear information on freshwater turtles; insufficient information on conservation listed species; the lack of experimental or anecdotal evidence regarding effects on bats; and impacts to as yet unidentified endemic species. Recommendations for additional surveys and monitoring Priority habitats for monitoring Seven major habitat types were identified for future monitoring: floodplain communities; swamp communities; monsoon forest; riparian communities; woodland and open forest communities; springs, soaks and waterholes; and escarpment/plateau pools. Priority species for monitoringThe species of most concern, and therefore a priority for monitoring, include the northern quoll, sandstone antechinus, red-cheeked dunnart, brush-tailed phascogale, dingo, all of the varanid lizards, northern death adder, king brown snake, western brown snake, ghost bat, black-necked stork, comb-crested jacana, Oenpelli python and freshwater crocodile. These are based on their risk rating, notability or listing as vulnerable, and also importance to Aboriginal people. Given that many species assigned to risk category 3 were done so due to a lack of information about effects of cane toads, it is possible that further information could result in the reprioritisation of some species. Although risks to prey species are unknown, beetles, termites and ants should be considered for inclusion in monitoring programs. Monitoring the possible effects of competition between cane toads and native aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates should be given high priority, particularly in escarpment/plateau pools where endemic species are known to exist. Similarly, monitoring for competitive effects between adult cane toads and insectivorous reptiles should also have high priority. Priorities for addressing information gaps A number of information gaps require addressing before more confident estimates of risks can be derived. Monitoring programs assessing the effects of cane toads upon Kakadu species will allow greater understanding of the risks. There is a need for appropriate baseline data, not just for cane toads but to monitor and assess other management issues that will arise in the future (eg other invasive species, fire and tourism). In addition, surveys should be conducted to identify and map the distribution of the endemic species of Kakadu, particularly in the escarpment and sandstone regions. All survey and/or monitoring programs should concurrently measure cane toad abundances and habitat preferences. Other information gaps that could be addressed but are less of a priority, include the effects of fire on cane toads and the lack of information for particular species or species groups (eg freshwater turtles, red goshawk). Evaluation of past and present monitoring programs As it may be several years before all of Kakadu is occupied by cane toads (eg some escarpment/plateau habitats), it is possible that some new monitoring programs may have sufficient time to accumulate pre-cane toad (ie baseline) data. It is highly unlikely that new monitoring programs will have time to provide similar data for many floodplain and lowland habitats. Data from major past and present monitoring programs within Kakadu may provide an alternative, noting that they were developed with objectives other than cane toad impacts in mind. Broad scale surveys The two major fauna surveys of the last 20 years provided information on abundances, distribution and habitat preferences of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians in a range of habitats similar to those identified in this report. The information from these surveys is not appropriate to use as current baseline. However, the established sites provide the opportunity for re-sampling before cane toads arrive. Not all habitat types were included in these surveys. A proposed representative re-sampling of the Stage 3 Wildlife Survey, which is hoped to be undertaken next Dry season could possibly provide one season of pre-cane toad data. Ongoing monitoring programs The only major ongoing fauna monitoring programs in Kakadu National Park are those associated with assessing potential environmental impact downstream of ERA Ranger Mine and the Jabiluka lease area. Monitoring programs are being conducted by eriss and ERA/EWL Sciences (Energy Resources of Australia Ltd/Earth Water Life Sciences). Aquatic macroinvertebrates are monitored at sites in the Magela Creek system (since 1988) and a number of control sites elsewhere in the Park. Sites from other areas have also been monitored regularly in the past (ie upper South Alligator River and Baroalba, Nourlangie and Gulungul Creeks). Though these studies were not designed for detecting cane toad impacts, inferences would be enhanced if cane toad invasion/distribution was monitored. Billabongs sampled in the Magela and Nourlangie Creek systems may provide information on (potentially vulnerable) freshwater snails. Fish communities in the Magela, Nourlangie and upper East Alligator systems have been monitored annually since 1994, and data exist for fish migration patterns in Magela Creek from 1985 to 1996. 'Whole-ecosystem' monitoring by ERA/EWLS has also been conducted at sites in Swift, Magela and Nourlangie Creek systems. Zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, fish, frogs, reptiles, bushbirds, waterbirds and mammals were surveyed in 1994/95 and again in 2000/01. Other surveys or monitoring programs Other past programs may also contribute to background information, including surveys of waterbirds on the Magela and Nourlangie floodplains. It has been proposed to re-survey the original Magela floodplain sites, in order to update/add to the existing information on birds. Information from the CSIRO Kapalga fire study from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s will provide a useful basis for detecting and assessing impacts once cane toads arrive there. Mammals, reptiles and insects were sampled originally and were re-sampled for small mammals in 1999. It will be very difficult to obtain adequate baseline data for a cane toad impact monitoring program. While the ongoing programs will be of some use, they are not necessarily targeted at the priority species identified in this report. Risk management and reduction Given the outcomes of the assessment, some relevant issues can be discussed that may assist Park managers in developing a risk management strategy. Parks Australia North has already been active with regards to management of cane toad issues, having initiated a cane toad identification training program and rapid response strategy to manage human assisted incursions of cane toads. Additionally, frog recording stations have been established at four sites in Kakadu (and more are planned). Baseline data have been collected for the past two Wet seasons. Very little will be able to be done to reduce cane toad numbers in Kakadu. Particular measures may prove effective in localised areas (eg townships, caravan parks), but efforts would need to be ongoing. Management of areas damaged by feral pigs may help reduce the densities of cane toads in pig-affected areas. Chemical and biological control methods are insufficiently developed at this stage. It is recommended that Parks Australia North manage the invasion of cane toads initially by i) ensuring that monitoring efforts are underway to assess the impacts of cane toads upon the natural and cultural values of Kakadu, and ii) investigating measures by which cane toads can be managed on a localised basis. The preliminary risk assessment provides a starting point from which Parks Australia North can determine the monitoring requirements for fauna. In addition, it provides an overview of the potential cultural and socio-economic impacts, which could be studied in greater detail by appropriate expe","van Dam, R.A.; Sinclair Knight Merz, 100 Christie St., St. Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia, Australia.",,,,,,"Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology",1325-1554,,"Conservation; Conservation measures; Ecology; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia; Australia","Bufo marinus [National parks and reserves / Kakadu National Park / Invasion ecological risk assessment & monitoring recommendations] [Ecology /  / ] [Northern Territory /  / ].","Amphibians; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Amphibia, Lissamphibia, Anura, Bufonidae","Bufo marinus (Bufonidae).",,ZOOREC:ZOOR14112070765,,,,,2018/06/21

The country was visited annually for 4-7 weeks up to 3-4 months per visit. Before the invasion of the Chinese, Tibetans used to bring their dead to special areas outside the village, dismember the corpse and allow the vultures, mainly Himalayan Griffons Gyps himalayensis but also Red-headed Vultures Sarcogyps calvus and Bearded Vultures Gypaetus barbatus, to devour the human remains. Dogs, and locally wolves, also took their share. Bhuddist Tibetans believe that the spirit leaves the body voluntarily after its death, but not so the body-soul. The latter has a tendency to switch to other humans, and in doing so will become a teaser. To prevent this, the body of the deceased has to be dismembered in order to force the teaser into the open air. The vultures are a great help in disposing of the body-soul. The authors spoke to many Tibetans about this tradition. Their tales were remarkably similar. Since the occupation, the Chinese cracked down on these traditional burials, forcing the Tibetans to burn or bury their dead (an impossible task given the lack of soil and wood in the mountains), executing those who tried to continue the traditional air burials and clubbing attending Himalayan Griffons to death. Between 1950 and c. 1995 it is estimated that 1000s of Himalayan Griffons and several 100s of Bearded Vultures were killed, an easy operation because the vultures had become extremely tame following centuries of adaptation to air burials. Culling vultures, dogs and wolves continued into the 1990s, although most vultures had already been wiped out by the 1960s and 1970s. In later decades, the Chinese intermittently held new rounds of vulture killing, in order to prevent the species to increase again. Two such operations were witnessed by the authors in 1992 and 1995, respectively in NW-Tibet near Gerze (5 Bearded Vultures shot by Chinese soldiers) and between Gyantse and Lhasa (126 Himalayan Griffons ditto). Remains of dead vultures were seen at many monasteries in the 1990s, proving the fact that killing continued. As dogs and wolves were also killed, the situation became intolerable because the dead could not be disposed of, and were left behind to rot. The situation slightly improved after 1997, when monks of the big monasteries of Drepung and Sera at Lhasa pointed out that minorities in China have the right to upheld their own traditions. After many hassles, it was agreed that air burials were again allowed in the central valley of Tibet between Shigatze (west of Lhasa) and Djegum (east of Lhasa). However, Himalayan Griffons had become very scarce by then. In western Tibet, the authors failed to see any Himalayan Griffons after 1995 and the number residing in the Tibetan valley between Shigatze and Djegum may not exceed 300 birds. Red-headed Vultures had been virtually wiped out by the time the authors started travelling in Tibet in 1988; during 12 years of traversing the country this species was rarely encountered, and if so exclusively in the provinces of Yunnan and Gansu. According to Tibetans, this species used to be a common visitor of burial sites in the past.","van Orden, Chris; Doelenstraat 14, 1601 GL Enkhuizen, Netherlands, Netherlands.",paklina@planet.nl,,,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation; Nutrition & Dietetics",1380-3735,,"Animals and man; Conservation; Nutrition; Ecology; Population dynamics; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Asia","Gypaetus barbatus; Gyps himalayensis; Sarcogyps calvus [Animals and man / Burial traditions / Significance for feeding behaviour & population size] [Endangered status /  / Population decline; effect of abolition of traditional human burials] [Diet / Human remains / Traditional burial ceremony; ecological significance] [Feeding behaviour /  / ] [Population size /  / Decline to endangered status] [China /  / ].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Falconiformes, Accipitridae","Gypaetus barbatus (Accipitridae).

During a 26 year period from 1972 to 1997, when three major and eight minor fires occurred, the density of Splendid Fairy-wrens Malurus splendens ranged from a high of 105 adults/100 ha in 1985 to 20 adults/100 ha in 1994. Both of these extremes followed periods of similar fire frequency (five fires in preceding 10 years). However, in the ten years before 1985, all fires were of limited extent, whereas the ten year period up to 1994 began with an extensive 100% hot summer burn, closely followed by two smaller reburns. The aftermath of the major fire in 1985 and subsequent minor fires had a major detrimental impact on populations of Splendid Fairy-wrens, Western Thornbills Acanthiza inornata, Scarlet Robins Petroica multicolor and Yellow-rumped Thornbills A. chrysorrhoa, all of which declined during the following eight years, even though the vegetation had nearly recovered to 1985 conditions. This continued decline in bird densities was related to increased mortality of breeding birds and lowered productivity, due to temporary cessation of breeding by Western Thornbills and to increased nest predation and parasitism in Splendid Fairy-wrens. In addition, the broad extent of the 1985 fire reduced opportunities for immigration from elsewhere. Understanding this avifaunal response to fire would not have been possible without an extended period of study. Any fire management plans based on just two or three years data might have yielded recommendations quite detrimental to the fauna they were designed to protect.","Brooker, Michael G.; CSIRO Wildlife and Ecology, Private Bag PO, Wembley, WA 6014, USA, USA.",,,,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Reproductive Biology",0158-4197,,"Reproduction; Ecology; Population dynamics; Abiotic factors; Physical factors","Acanthiza chrysorrhoa; Acanthiza inornata; Malurus splendens; Petroica multicolor [Fire /  / Ecological responses; Western Australia].

The ability to predict demographic performance (potential-breeder production minus breeder mortality) using the HSI model was tested at patch (0.1 and 1.0 ha) and territory (5.5 ha) scales. Florida scrub-jays preferred to nest in patches having the highest HSI and had the highest fledgling production in patches with the highest HSI.

Minor improvements in the ability to predict demographic performance occurred as sampling scale increased from the smallest patch (0.1 ha) to the territory scale (5.5 ha).

Previous studies, however, have focused primarily on bow nest predation can change when landscapes become fragmented by agriculture rather than by logging. To determine if predation on artificial nests in forest patches was influenced by the surrounding landscape, we placed ground and shrub nests along the edge and interior of forest patches located in agricultural, logged, and contiguous forest landscapes within a single region of the southern boreal mixed wood forest of central Canada. Nest predators were identified using remotely triggered cameras and by marks left in plasticine eggs, whereas the relative abundance of nest predators such as corvids and small mammals was estimated by surveys and live-trapping. The percentage of ground nests destroyed at the edge and interior of patches in the logged and contiguous forest landscapes was significantly lower than at the edge or interior of patches in the agricultural landscape. No differences in predation rate were observed for shrub nests among landscapes. We attributed higher rates of predation in the agricultural landscape to higher densities of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in the interior and a greater diversity of predators along edges. The similarity in predation rate between logged and contiguous forest landscapes suggests that fragmentation caused by logging may result in little change in predator communities and in this respect, might be similar to fragmentation caused by natural disturbance regimes such as fire. In contrast, fragmentation by agriculture seems to have more serious consequences for nesting birds. Policy changes that limit the growth of agriculture in the southern boreal mixed wood forest are required to conserve the diverse avifauna of this region.","Bayne, Erin M.; Canadian Wildlife Service, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X4, Canada, Canada.",,,"Bayne, Erin/0000-0002-0679-4521",,,"Zoology; Agriculture; Forestry; Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0888-8892,,"Animals and man; Disturbance by man; Commercial activities; Reproduction; Ecology; Population dynamics; Habitat; Terrestrial habitat; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; Canada","Aves [Farming and agriculture /  / Forest fragmentation by agriculture; effect on egg predation rates; Canada] [Forestry /  / Logging; forest] [Egg /  / Predation rates in forests; effects of forestry & agriculture] [Mortality /  / Egg predation rates in forests; effects of logging & agriculture] [Predators /  / ] [Forest and woodland /  / Egg predation rates] [Saskatchewan /  / Prince Albert Model Forest].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata","Aves (Vertebrata): [Prey].",10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96135.x,ZOOREC:ZOOR13400058774,,,,,2018/06/21

Selenium bioaccumulated in aquatic food chains and caused severe reproductive failure and teratogenic deformities in fish. Beginning in 1986, the electric utility company changed its ash disposal practices and selenium-laden wastewater no longer entered the lake. A survey of selenium present in the water, sediments, benthic invertebrates, fish, and aquatic birds was conducted in 1996. Concentrations were compared to pre1986 levels to determine how much change occurred during the decade since selenium inputs stopped. The data were also examined using a hazard assessment protocol to determine if ecosystem-level hazards to fish and aquatic birds had changed as well. Results reveal that waterborne selenium fell from a peak of 20 mu-g/liter before 1986, to lt 1 mu-g/liter in 1996; concentrations in biota were 85-95% lower in 1996. Hazard ratings indicate that high hazard existed prior to 1986 and that moderate hazard is still present, primarily due to selenium in the sediment-detrital food pathway. Concentrations of selenium in sediments have fallen by about 65-75%, but remain sufficiently elevated (14 mu-g/g) to contaminate benthic food organisms of fish and aquatic birds. Field evidence confirmed the validity of the hazard ratings. Developmental abnormalities in young fish indicate that selenium-induced teratogenesis and reproductive impairment are occurring. Moreover, the concentrations of selenium in benthic food organisms are sufficient to cause mortality in young bluegill and other centrarchids because of Winter Stress Syndrome. At the ecosystem level, recovery has been slow. Toxic effects are still evident 10 years after selenium inputs were stopped. The sediment-associated selenium will likely continue to be a significant hazard to fish and aquatic birds for years.","Lemly, A.

Species typical to gallery forests are probably less adapted to habitat burning than species that occur in other habitats and may be suffering a decrease or a disturbance in their population structure, revealing an important problem of cerrado bird conservation.","Marini, Miguel Angelo; Departamento de Biologia Geral, Cx.

The accuracy of the methods depends on how closely habitat mapping classes are linked to population demography. Habitat use by Florida Scrub jays (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) was quantified using circular plots. Habitat variation was mapped using high-resolution aerial Photography on a site where all Florida Scrub Jays were color-banded. Nest site selection, nest success, yearling production, and breeder survival were measured within Florida Scrub Jay territories. Habitat use was lowest in areas without scrub oaks or areas within 136 m from forests. Open oak, dominated by scrub oaks and open sandy areas, bad the highest use and nest success among habitats. Open oak occurred as narrow patches ( lt 20 m wide) in landscapes dominated by matrix habitat (palmetto-lyonia and swale marshes). Most wide patches ( gt 50 m) of open oak were potential population sources, where reproduction exceeded mortality. Areas with patches of open oak of less than 1 ha were usually population sinks. Open oak occurred as less flammable patches in a landscape subject to frequent fires. Population sources varied temporally and spatially with fires and site potential to support scrub oaks (soils). Analyses of landscape patterns and dynamics indicated that habitat mapping should not only include patches of currently optimal habitat but should also include landscapes associated with open oak. The influences of landscape patterns on habitat use, reproductive success, survival, and territory size can be quantified at different scales starting with attributes associated with habitat patches, nest sites, and territories. Potential mapping errors occur, however, when habitats are used to quantify the areal extent of sources and sinks and similar population attributes important for species persistence.","Breininger, David R.; Dyn-2, Dynamac Corporation, NASA Biomedical Operations Office, John F.

The number of groups and number of individuals in a 3795-ha area that was surveyed in 1977 and 1989-1990 declined by 62% and 75%, respectively. The productivity of the population was low during 1989-1990; 0.69 young were fledged per nesting attempt. To assess the adequacy of foraging habitat, forest structure was measured in an area with a high density of groups (1.95/km-2) in 1990 and in an area where the group density had declined from 2.92 groups/km-2 in 1977 to 0.74 groups/km-2 in 1990. Forest structure in both areas was adequate but approached the limits recommended in the Red-cockaded Woodpecker Recovery Plan. To determine if isolation of groups was related to population decline, we estimated nearest neighbor distances from cluster locations (a cluster is the cavity trees used by a group of woodpeckers) in 1977 and 1990. Cluster sites had longer nearest neighbor distances in 1977 than in 1990, which may indicate that isolation by distance reduces the influx of dispersing breeders from elsewhere in the population. Periodic fires occur naturally in the MCWA but have been suppressed since 1926.

In The Netherlands, visible bird migration was recorded at twelve observation sites (four of which situated along the North Sea coast) during 1 409 hours from September to December, 1989 (tab. 1, fig. 1). Comparable information from observation and ringing sites elsewhere in Europe was gathered. Notably large numbers of Coal Tits were recorded in The Netherlands in the third decade of September (dozens of birds per site per hour, all over the country). Two waves of birds passed in the course of October. The first occurred during the first week of the month (300 birds/h along the coast, 35 birds/h at inland sites), the second peaked on October 17 (1 100 birds/h along the coast, 50 birds/h at inland sites, fig. 2, a and b). The first wave consisted mainly of Coal Tits, but during the second wave they were accompanied by Blue and Great Tits. The two waves are considered to have consisted mainly of adult (first) and juvenile (second) birds. The first flocks were observed about half an hour before sunrise, and migration usually peaked between 07h00 and 08h00 (fig. 5). Mean flock size correlated positively with mean number of birds observed per hour, except for the last two hours of the day when relatively large flocks were observed. In appears that two separate Coal Tit-irruptions affected Europe in autumn 1989: one originated from the taiga zone, the other from northern Germany plus western Poland, and the two differed with respect to timing. Examination of Coal Tits caught in The Netherlands at the time (wing-length, back colour, moult of greater coverts) showed that these birds originated from northern Germany and Poland (Wijker 1991). This irruption coincided with one of Goldcrests and Firecrests, which may have come from the same geographical area.

In the younger plants, canopy seed storage was highest in B. coccinea. However, 21-year-old B. coccinea stored an order of magnitude fewer seeds than the other species and no more than young B. coccinea. Seed storage per year increased exponentially with plant age in B. speciosa and B. baxteri, whereas a quadratic function, peaking at 16 years, best described seed storage in B. coccinea. Degree of serotiny was lowest in B. coccinea. Seed abortion did not vary between age cohorts but was highest in B. coccinea. Granivory ranged from 18 to 42% and was highest in the older plants and in B. baxteri. Cockatoos removed about 20% of cones in B. baxteri and B. coccinea and 10% in B. speciosa. Experimental cone removal accelerated follicle opening, especially in B. coccinea, irrespective of whether cones were placed in the ground (simulating cockatoo removal) or reattached to the plant (simulating plant death). Half the 21-year-old B. coccinea were dead and the remainder were considered senescent, as most branches showed dieback and cone fertility had fallen to 8%. Death of the other species was negligible, with cone fertility rising to a mean of 45% (B. speciosa) and 66% (B. baxteri). Interfire establishment was significant only in B. coccinea.

We inferred from the repeated surveys that this population increase of 10.1% over a 7-year period was significant (P < 0.05). Our inference was supported by (1) documentation of colonization (new clans using new colony sites) in both surveyed and nonsurveyed compartments; (2) an actual increase in number of clans in surveyed compartments; and (3) an actual increase in the number of clans in a group of nonsurveyed compartments. Fourteen of 19 new clans were occupying new colony sites < 400 m to 2,440 m from an adjacent colony. Two of these 14 colonizations were observed to be formed by pioneering, and were 520 m and 1,530 m from another colony. Either pioneering or budding was suspected in the formation of the 12 remaining new colonies, depending upon the distance the new colony was from another colony. Although only 1% of males were estimated to have colonized, colonization appears to be an important factor in the population biology of the species. The population increase was attributable to: (1) a large inventory of pine sawtimber, (2) availability of old trees for cavity excavation, (3) control of hardwood midstory with prescribed fire, (4) protection of cavity trees, and (5) provision of adequate foraging habitat. The lack of any of these factors probably would have prevented a population increase. Despite a net increase in number of clans, colonies were being abandoned at a rate of 1.1% annually.

In 1987 there were only 40 pairs, of which 20 were on the isles of Sylt and Fohr. The little number includes a few isolated pairs in North-Frisia, Eiderstedt and Dithmarschen. The sandy uplands in northern Schleswig-Holstein as well as the eastern hills around the Schwansener lake and the Oldenburger fault are occupied by 10 pairs each. The decline began sometime between 1960 and 1965 and increased rapidly after 1975. Pictures and tables 1 and 2 inform in detail about this happening. The formerly considerable wintering population can be considered as practically extinct. The main breeding distribution centred in farmlands with fertile soil in the west and east of the province (fig. 1). Fewer Corn Bunting settled on the sandy uplands with their less fertile soil. Unspoiled beach and lake meadows as well as variety of heaths are usually inhabitted only by isolated pairs. Different causes of decrease are discussed which all in the final analysis have to do with intensivied farming methods. The lack of food in autumn and winter is possibly the most important factor. This lack is caused by the use of herbicides, the elimination of the field borders, the mowing of the edges of paths and roads, the burning of fields and their immediate plowing under, decreased corn supply thanks to the use of modern combines.

Only at refuges has wildlife conservation been legislated to have higher priority than either recreational or commercial activities. Presently, private ranchers and farmers graze cattle on 981,954 ha and harvest hay on 12,021 ha at 123 National Wildlife Refuges. USA Fish and Wildlife Service policy is to permit these uses primarily when needed to benefit refuge wildlife. To evaluate the success of this policy, I surveyed grassland management practices at the 123 refuges. The survey results indicate that in fiscal year 1980 there were 374,849 animal unit months (AUMs) of cattle grazing, or 41% more than was reported by the Fish and Wildlife Service. According to managers' opinions, 86 species of wildlife are positively affected and 82 are negatively affected by refuge cattle grazing or haying. However, quantitative field studies of the effect of cattle grazing and haying on wildlife coupled with the survey data on how refuge programs are implemented suggest that these activities are impeding the goal of wildlife conservation. Particular management problems uncovered by the survey include overgrazing of riparian habitats, wildlife mortality due to collisions with cattle fences, and mowing of migratory bird habitat during the breeding season. Managers reported that they spend $919,740 administering cattle grazing and haying; thus refuge grazing and haying programs are also expensive. At any single refuge these uses occupy up to 50% of refuge funds and 55% of staff time. In light of these results, prescribed burning may be a better wildlife management option than is either cattle grazing or haying.",,,,,,,"Zoology; Agriculture; Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0364-152X,,"Animals and man; Habitat modification; Conservation; Ecology; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America","Vertebrata [Agricultural activity /  / Community & production effects; wildlife refuges] [Wildlife management /  / Refuges; agricultural activity effect on community & production] [Productivity /  / effect of agricultural activity] [Community structure /  / ] [USA /  / community & production].","Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata","Vertebrata (Chordata).",10.1007/BF01867177,ZOOREC:ZOOR12300050893,,,,,2018/06/21

Some are associated with darkened mammoth and bird fossils, and these fossils have been considered as having been burned by early man. Reevaluation of these so-called ""fire areas"" indicates that the above phenomena are the result of low-temperature (.ltoreq. 100.degree. C), nonheating processes occurring in groundwater. Evidence for this conclusion is derived from field observations on fossil carbonized vegetation, and the geology of the areas. Additional evidence derives from experiments on the red sediments and fossil wood, X-ray diffraction analyses, magnetic analyses, studies on the clay minerals smectite and illite, and the demonstration that fossil mammoth bone contains sufficient Fe and Mn to account for their discoloration. Much of the carbonization of vegetation probably occurred in water rather than in fire. Radiocarbon dates from the islands will probably need to be reevaluated. These data provide evidence contrary to the concept of the occurrence of significant fires, either natural or set by early man, on the Northern Channel Islands.",,,,,,,"Zoology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Paleontology",0033-5894,,"Ecology; Fossilization; Land zones; Nearctic region; North America; USA; Geological time periods; Caenozoic; Quaternary","Mammuthus [Diagenesis /  / Discoloration of bones due to groundwater] [California /  / Northern Channel Islands; diagenetic causes of bone discoloration; =] [Pleistocene /  / ].","Chordates; Elephants; Mammals; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Mammalia, Proboscidea, Elephantidae","Mammuthus (Elephantidae): [Fossil].",10.1016/0033-5894(86)90105-5,ZOOREC:ZOOR12300041964,,,,,2018/06/21

Rates of seed removal by ants usually are measured by recording removal from artifical seed baits, but the reliability of this approach has not been tested, nor have there been many attempts to integrate the results with the activity of seed-eating ants. This paper describes the rates of seed removal, estimated using a baiting technique that is tested for its reliability, by the seed-eating ants in adjacent heath and woodland sites at Wilson's Promontory, Victoria. Ants removed up to 100% of seeds, but rates varied according to seed species, size of seed clumps, season, time of exposure, and other aspects of the baiting technique. Methodological guidelines are provided to make baiting conditions approximately those likely to occur in nature. Seed-eating ants, particularly species of Rhytidoponera, Chelaner and Pheidole, were by far the most important post-dispersal seed predators, and patterns of seed removal were directly related to their composition, abundance and foraging behaviour. Lygaeid bugs were also observed eating seeds, but there was no evidence of seed predation by rodents or birds. The results suggest that seed predation by ants can substantially deplete seed reserves; however, its actual effect on seedling recruitment is likely to depend on many factors including seed size, crop size, weather, timing and location of seed fall, availability of alternative food sources, patterns of seedling mortality, and fire, none of which have been adequately investigated.",,,"Andersen, Alan/F-8763-2010","Andersen, Alan/0000-0003-1487-3323",,,"Zoology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Behavioral Sciences",0307-692X,,"Techniques; Nutrition; Diet; Feeding behaviour; Behaviour; Activity patterns; Land zones; Australasian region; Australasia; Australia","Formicidae [Feeding analysis techniques /  / Seed removal rates from bait traps; reliability] [Food plants /  / Seed removal rate; influencing factors & analysis] [Food availability /  / Seed clumping; effect on removal rate] [Foraging /  / Seed removal rates] [Seasonal activity /  / Seed removal rate relationships] [Victoria /  / Wilson's Promontory].","Arthropods; Hymenopterans; Insects; Invertebrates","Animalia, Arthropoda, Insecta, Hymenoptera, Apocrita, Aculeata, Formicoidea","Formicidae (Formicoidea).",10.1111/j.1442-9993.1985.tb00900.x,ZOOREC:ZOOR12200055839,,,,,2018/06/21

In the 30 km2 area studied, a probable 4-5 pairs in the mid-1960's rose to 8 in 1975 and 1976, but fell to only 1 by 1982. Nests were unusually close, with nearest-neighbor means of 0.98-1.92 km. Since 1974 the ratio of breeding 1st-yr males to older birds was high (1:7). Eggs were laid in most occupied territories. Breeding success was fairly high up to 1977, but in the period 1978-1982 only 22.7% of pairs produced fledged young. Clutch and brood sizes varied little between periods. Two repeat clutches were laid. Losses to presumed human predators were high, and since 1979 further failure through addling, egg breakage and chick death has increased greatly. Levels of DDE and PCB [polychlorinated biphenyls] in recent eggs were substantial, while shell thinning was marked. Fire destroyed 5 out of the moor's 14 breeding sites in 1980. Severe spring weather in 1979 and 1981 may also have helped depress breeding success.",,,,,,,"Zoology; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Reproductive Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology",0006-3657,,"Biochemistry; Chemical composition; Reproduction; Reproductive productivity; Ecology; Population dynamics; Land zones; Palaearctic region; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom","Falco columbarius [Pollutant content /  / Organochlorine pesticides] [Egg /  / Organochlorine content] [Clutches /  / Size] [Fledgeing success /  / ] [Hatching success /  / ] [Breeding success /  / Breeding failure documentation & causes] [Mortality /  / Causes; local population] [Population changes /  / Breeding population decline documentation; moor] [Wales /  / Clwyd; Breeding population decline & nest failure].","Birds; Chordates; Vertebrates","Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Aves, Falconiformes, Falconidae","Falco columbarius (Falconidae).",10.1080/00063658309476796,ZOOREC:ZOOR12000052160,,gold_or_bronze,,,2018/06/21

The considerable changes in bird community composition at Poukawa during the last 1000 yr, including the extinction of many species, probably resulted from forest modification caused by fires lit by Polynesian man.
